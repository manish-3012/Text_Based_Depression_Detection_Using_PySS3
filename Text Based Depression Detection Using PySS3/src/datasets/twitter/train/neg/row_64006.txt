Don't wanna be a statistic.41%. That is the number  that sticks with me, every time I look in the mirror. That is the number that makes me shake with fear, especially when my moods get like *this*.

Hi. My name is... unimportant. I am trans. I hate myself. I want it to end. I want to not see myself in the mirror. I want to not be around anymore. I want to stop being made fun of in this stupid town. I want it all to go away.

I was told to come here. Told people could help. 

Please help. I an feel the idea take root more and more every day. I don't want to be part of the 41% of people like me who attempt it. 

I wouldn't be lucky enough to make it.
