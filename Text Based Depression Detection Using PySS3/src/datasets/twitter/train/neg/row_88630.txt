I'm in so pain but I don't want to hurt my familyI feel so alone and in reality I know I'm probably not.  I have my mom, my brothers, my best friends, my cat, I'm also dating this guy who really likes me.  But I still feel so alone.  I know I should call one of them and tell them I'm not doing so well today and that I'm really considering suicide today. But I just can't.  I'm scared they'll try to talk me out of it or that they will talk me out of it and then they'll just become extremely worried. I also don't want to put anyone out and ruin their day.  I feel like I've been doing that allot lately.  My depression and my suicide thoughts have been really hard on my family for the past month. I just feel so alone.  I don't want to ruin anyone's life I just want to end mine.  I just wish they would be ok with it.  I don't know what to do.  I just want all my pain to stop.
