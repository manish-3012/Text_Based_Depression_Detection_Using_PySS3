Chronically disabled and feeling sad.I've had everything from congestive heart failure, wolf parkinsons white syndrome, open heart surgery, respitory distress syndrome, broncho pulmonary displachia. i wear an oxygen machine when i sleep at night and sometimes during the day. i use a wheel chair cause i can't really walk more than two hours. I have 27% lung function. I spend most of my time alone cause my husband works a lot. I sometimes get rib cage arthritis. most of my days consist of wheezing, coughing, tiredness. I spend about 6 days a week trapped in my apartment since i don't drive. I don't have any IRL local friends to hang out with. I talk to my dog a lot when i'm alone. I was bullied a lot growing up. 
People tend to tell me i'm a bother. I've struggled with depression since i was 15 years old. i'm now 33. I was bullied most of my life. I tend to waste peoples time with my clingy attempts to make friends.
