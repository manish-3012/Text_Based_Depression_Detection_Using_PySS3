I wish I could give my life awayI always think about how, if I could, I would give my life to someone who was about to die or is dead but really wanted to live or really enjoys life and has some sort of purpose. 

There's no point in me being alive, I'm not enjoying this at all and I hate it here. I'm just completing tasks that are expected of me by my parents and society but I'm SO TIRED of all of this. I just want to make it stop.
