Ways to tell my soon to be husband about my suicidal tendenciesIâ€™m currently laying in bed alone due to my own wishes; all I can think about is how I do not want to start another day. Constantly think about sleeping forever or just wishing I wasnâ€™t born. I know if I pull the trigger it wonâ€™t be soon, I want to at least make sure we can fulfill our dreams of marrying one another. When I think about the future itâ€™s normal him losing me prematurely....... I just want to prepare him for what I think will happen
