strugglingI don't necessarily want to die, probably down to fear of the unknown, so I'm probably not brave enough to act on my feelings, despite this I'm always thinking of how i could just end myself, where would be the best place and least painful method. I also don't want to be alive, I just don't want to do this anymore, I feel constantly trapped in a pit of misery and depression that just seems to get deeper and deeper. I have no motivation to help myself because I just do not see a point to life. If there was a pill for just ceasing to exist, that would be ideal.
