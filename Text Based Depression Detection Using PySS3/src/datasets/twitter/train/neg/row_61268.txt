I donâ€™t like this anymore. I just want to go. I need to talk to someonez15m. I donâ€™t like myself anymore. People use my mental illnesses as an insult. 

People at school tell me to kill myself and to go and die. They call me stupid and an idiot because iâ€™m behind people in lessons and stuff. 

I want to just take alot of my meds and wait until it happens. I donâ€™t like this anymore. They bring up my abusive father who is now out of my life but all i can think about is when he used to hit me and put things into my head. He broke me. 

I donâ€™t like myself and iâ€™m really starting to think those people at school were right. 

They say things to me for no reason what so ever, even if iâ€™m not with them. My friends are slowly drifting away and i feel kinda lonely. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I just feel like i want to leave forever.

Mostly every day i go home crying and feeling worthless and iâ€™m hiding everything from everyone and i have been for about 4 years and itâ€™s just all adding on. I just want to die. I canâ€™t do this much longer.

I need to talk to someone, please.
