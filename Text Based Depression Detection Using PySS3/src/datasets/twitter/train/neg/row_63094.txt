/Trigger warning/ I'm also gonna be Hella bluntOn October 15th im going to kill myself, there's nothing anyone can do or say that can change my mind, somedays I want to do it and other days I don't but I have to, this is what the voices tell me. My life is just a huge fucking shit show of mental illness, the voices and hallucinations are getting to a point where I can't function anymore, I'm not on any meds because I can't get my prescription because camhs keep canceling my fucking appointments, I'm at my breaking point, but the more I think about it the more I realise im probably not going to make it to that date and just kill myself sooner. If there's anything that I want to get across is that camhs is fucking horible they've fucked up so many times and their all pieces of shit and I fucking hate them
