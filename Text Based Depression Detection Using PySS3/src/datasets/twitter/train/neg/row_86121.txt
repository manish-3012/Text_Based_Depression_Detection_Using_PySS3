I just want to know how to die painlessly and get out of this fucking awful planet. I can't live anymore. I've already decided this is what I need to do.I don't want to talk about this anymore, the things that are slowly killing my from the inside out. They aren't getting any better, if anything they're just getting worse. My brain is broken for all I can tell at this point.

I had an epiphany this afternoon. I've been miserably, suicidally depressed for over 2 years now. One of the only things I've been hanging on for is to hear the new Radiohead album before I died. Well if you visit the front page or anything or just look at /r/radiohead then you'll know it's about to come out.

And then I realized after being excited for a few hours, the closer it gets to coming out, the more I realize it doesn't matter. I don't feel anything. This music isn't going to make me happy. I realized I just don't care. It won't make me feel better or my life better. 

I realized I have totally lost the capacity to feel happiness or even care about things I really enjoy or love anymore. All of my feelings are dead.

I'm ready to go. It's time. I want to let go. I don't want to feel this way anymore. This isn't life, this isn't living. It's just waking up everyday, feeling a unique kind of miserable, and hoping against logic that if I'm lucky, something will take me out quickly and without notice.

But I can't wait anymore. I have to go now because I can't withstand the pain anymore.

So what's the way out. I have tried overdosing a few times and failed. I don't think I have any medications that would cause an OD death. 

I took morphine a few years back. I don't know if I have any left from that. If I do I imagine that's lethal. But I don't know how much I would have to take.

I'm afraid of trying to hang myself or cutting myself, afraid of knives and I don't want pain either, that's the whole point.

I don't know what to do. Help.
