I've sexually assaulted people and I can't live with itI'm a female, and when I was fourteen or so, I didn't really have a sense of boundary, I would grab and touch and grab my friend's chests when they were female and crotches when they were male without their permission, it was a joke to me, and while most didn't mind, I'm terrified that some did and I just can't live with that guilt. I'm a disgusting person who doesn't deserve the air they breathe.
