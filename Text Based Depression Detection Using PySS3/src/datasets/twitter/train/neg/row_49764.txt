Iâ€™m not even sad or angry anymore, I just feel empty.I used to feel so mad, so enraged, so upset at the world. But now, I just feel numb and hollow. Thereâ€™s nothing left in me, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m just a vacant body going through the motions of being alive, while not actually living. 

And thatâ€™s the worst feeling in the world. I just wish I could go to sleep forever.
