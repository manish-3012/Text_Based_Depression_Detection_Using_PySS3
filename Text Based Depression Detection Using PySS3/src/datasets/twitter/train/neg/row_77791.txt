I was molested when I was 11 and opening up about has seemed to make everything worse.I have lost every ounce of motivation in my body.

When I was 11 my older sister molested me. I opened up about it a coupe months ago and ever since then Iâ€™ve been going through hell. 
Since it happened so long ago they arenâ€™t doing anything to my sister (who moved out) so I get to sit here and pretend that Iâ€™m not at all effected by it. 

Before the molestation I was a happy, touchy little kid. After I realized what happened I simply was not the same. Every aspect of intimacy makes me panic. I have a hard time with relationships because I canâ€™t be physical and no one wants to date the girl who was molested. All guys want at my age is fun. 0 baggage. 

Iâ€™ve decided not to tell people about what happened which has caused me massive amounts of stress. When I hide something I look at it like a lie and I CAN NOT lie. This causes me to get extremely angry every time I even think about what happened, which is all the time. I have lost all of my friends because I canâ€™t 
handle what happened. 

It all feels like my fault. Itâ€™s a continuous cycle. I make a friend, itâ€™s great, something happens and I get angry, they go away.  Iâ€™m stubborn when Iâ€™m angry though. There is no talking me down when Iâ€™m upset. I donâ€™t transition between emotions. 

Iâ€™m in counseling, I go to church. I feel helpless. A complete mess up. My friends have all left me and Iâ€™m alone. Iâ€™m back to the 11 year old me I was...completely, 100% lost and confused.
