is living worth it?i really doubt someone will read this, so i donâ€™t really know where to start this but i guess my question is, is it really worth living? i donâ€™t see a future for myself at all. iâ€™m only a young teenager but i stopped going to school about a year and a half ago. i havenâ€™t been able to go back because i just canâ€™t see myself catching up on a years worth of work. the whole time i havenâ€™t been at school iâ€™ve just laid in bed all day. i do nothing at all, iâ€™ve become extremely bored, i try to sleep as much as possible so i donâ€™t have to be awake and sit through the same bullshit everyday. i barely go out now, and since iâ€™ve been home for so long iâ€™ve really let go of myself. iâ€™m extremely insecure now, the worst thing for me is my height, iâ€™m a 5â€™3 female. iâ€™m below the average height for my country yet i still feel like a giant and itâ€™s brought me down so much. i canâ€™t go out without being embarrassed of my height anymore to be honest it just gives me extreme anxiety. i find myself extremely unattractive in general as well, i feel sick looking at myself without makeup on, i have to take my mirror down and cover my phone camera with blue tack if i donâ€™t have makeup on because itâ€™s just so hard to look at myself. even with makeup i still look like shit. there isnâ€™t a single thing about myself that i like, i hate my appearance, and my personality. thereâ€™s nothing special about me at all, no one cares about me either. iâ€™ve tried to tell the few friends that i have about how iâ€™m feeling and they really did not care. it kinda hurts. it feels like it isnâ€™t worth it anymore because i feel like iâ€™ll never have inner peace or whatever you wanna call it. iâ€™ll never be able to look at myself and be proud of who i am, or even just look at myself and not immediately think of everything wrong with me. it feels like everything would be a lot easier if i just fell asleep. forever. i think about it every day if iâ€™m honest. i just donâ€™t know how iâ€™d go about it.  i genuinely donâ€™t want to be here anymore. every problem i have is unfixable. it feels like if i continue like this iâ€™ll just end up more hurt, iâ€™ve seriously tried everything to get over this, i went back to school for a week at one point and i just couldnâ€™t bare it. iâ€™ve went and seen a psychiatrist, that didnâ€™t work out well, and iâ€™m currently seeing a therapist but it is seriously not helping at all. i seriously feel like my life is not worth it and i really donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
