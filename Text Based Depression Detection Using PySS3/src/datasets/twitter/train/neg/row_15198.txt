I am thinking about killing myselfI don't know what compelled me to come here....probably because it's where I find myself spending most of my time these days.

I'm 30 years old, and recently back in college. Up until the beginning of the school year, I have been depressed for a long time. When school began, I felt the best I have in years. Like I had a second shot at being happy with myself.

I don't even know where to start, my thoughts aren't organized at all lately. But I do know that I've never felt the urge to end my life as much as I do today. I feel I need help. But I'm not sure where to turn.
