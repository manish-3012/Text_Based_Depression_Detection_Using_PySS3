Thinking about doing it.. .Hi guys,  


I'm a 17 years old female, who suffers from a rare disorder called PGAD, depression, OCD and is in the closet. I'm at  a very low point right now and I really don't know what to do. I've tried so many things but nothing seems to work. I really don't want to hurt my family (my cats included), but my disorder is killing my SOUL! It's so hard for me to not give up! Everyday I think about it and start crying. I really don't know what to do. One time I saw people writing things such as "If I had that, I would kill myself.". READING THIS SHIT HURT LIKE HELL!

I'm so hopeless atm, please help me! It's been going on for 2 years and I'm losing my strength.. .
