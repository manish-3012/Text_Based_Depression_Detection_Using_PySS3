I can't stop thinking about itJust like the title says

I have been living with major ptsd for over 20 years stemming from some messed up stuff that happened to me as a child. I feel so hopeless and tired and scared and alone and broken beyond repair. Every day, to one degree or another, I think about killing myself. I have been in therapy for about 5 years now and things had gotten better in recent years but these feelings never go away, not completely. Even when things are going well, and I feel happy and I'm functioning well and I'm feeling like life is ok and I might have a chance to feel like a normal human being and achieve the things I sometimes think I want, the voice in my head urging me to kill myself is still there, just very quiet. Even in these times where things are going well, I have to live with the knowledge that when I go to sleep at night, I have no idea how I'm going to feel when I wake up in the morning or if I'll wake up an hour later drenched in sweat in a full on fucking panic attack. That in itself is taxing on the mind. When things get bad, it's insufferable. The major depressive episodes and major ptsd instances have become fewer and farther between in recent years but in the last few weeks, I've been in hell and I don't know if I can make it through this time. I have been through episodes like this before, this is nothing new, but I'm tired of living like this. I know this will be the rest of my life. Every moment right now there is a loud intrusive voice telling me to kill myself. I can't focus on anything. I'm fucking up at work and I just cut off relationships with my parents and the only woman I ever met who understands me and my issues and I ever felt a real connection to. Everything is falling apart this time and part of me is devastated and the other part knows its for the best. I am not looking for answers here. There are no answers. I can't talk about this to anyone else outside of my therapist. I'll stop rambling now
