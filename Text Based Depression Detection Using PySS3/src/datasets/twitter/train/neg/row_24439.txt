Why even try anymore?Honestly, dying is a tempting thing for me.

I mean, i know i wont be going anywhere in life and those that might miss me will get over my loss. Im 19 and a god damn loser with nothing to gain or lose at this point. 

I've been told "it gets better" and shit like that, so i guess im just asking for someone to tell me something comforting that i havent heard yet? Honestly im not sure what i even want anymore. I don't feel much of anything. Suicide is actually a comfort thought now-a-days and i feel like i should at least try to tell someone.
