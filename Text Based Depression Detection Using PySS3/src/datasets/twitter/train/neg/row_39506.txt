Affairs are in OrderThe date is set for next Friday. Iâ€™ve got my money/belongings situation handled with prompts set to deliver a couple hours after my death. Iâ€™ll be far away from home and be able to jump off a dam. Any tips for hitting the ground so itâ€™ll actually do the trick? Should I go headfirst or flat?
