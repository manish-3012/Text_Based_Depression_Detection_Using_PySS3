im fucking sorry for bothering you i really a fucking burden on everyone around mei was feel down and my therapist isnt seeing me till next week. i was feeling desperate but i was made the bold (and rare) move of me of opening up to someone. stupid decision

&amp;#x200B;

if i go to open up to someone, it's usually the same friend. i feel like he just understands me best. so i aksed if i could tell him something and he said sure. i was venting to him about my fear of the future after we graduate college in the spring. eventually he got tired of me and said ive talked about this issue too much and he sounds like a broken record, he doesn't know how to help, he's too busy with other issues to think about a problem like this, and he's generally been pretty mentally unwell the apst few days. i had seriously had no clue he felt this bad. i felt terrible for bothering him, i apologized and said i just wanted to vent and wasn't really looking for a solid answer or advice on things, but thanked him anyway. i ended it at that. i left immediately i felt so fucking bad

i didnt mean to bother you. i know i talk about it a lot. its because im scared of it. i know how annoying it sounds. i dont even like talking about it with my friends that often because i knew they would get annoyed. i i know there's only so many times you can bring this issue up with someone before you start to sound annoying. i know i know i know i  know and im sorry. i didnt mean to burden you.
