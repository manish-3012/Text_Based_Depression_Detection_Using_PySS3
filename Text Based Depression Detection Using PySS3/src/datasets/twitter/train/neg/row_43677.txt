How do I cope?Feels like life from my perspective is getting shorter. It's been like this before, where I thought I was near the end but somehow I came out, but not better; traumatized. It keeps getting worse. Thoughts are telling me to off myself. I find being in public excruciating. People hold me in such contempt. I don't know how to cope.
