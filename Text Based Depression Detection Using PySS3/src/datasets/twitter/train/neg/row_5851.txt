Scar is just a deep problem that I hadSo I posted in previous posts about my scar and situation with it
I have talked with many about it and also some have helped but I couldn't reach the level of clearance 
If you don't know I was hit by a bully and gave me a deep cut that is in my forehead 
However I got depressed few weeks after it and had suffered depression and suicidal thoughts months before it. Whenever I remember the days I had no scar I just get more depressed. Many tells me that it will go but I can't believe them. I hate getting humiliated by someone specially if it's someone whom I hate and who gave me a permanent reminder of him or a scar. Many times I tried cooping with it but I can't whenever I see him I get solely depressed and just want to end my life I need help. Someone whom I can talk with. Who can relate to me and can give an advice that will lead me to happiness .
