im having a problem...so one night i was really down in the dumps where i resorted to comming here and ppl seem to be able to help. but i have this girl who she feels bad that i had resotrted to this becuse she feels like she cant help me with my problem but she does... no offense to you guys but she helps alot beter then here becuse she acctually know me... what do i do? how can i make her feel special how do i make her feel like she does help?
were both 17 she never been through what i have so she doesnt really know what to say when i come to her. she listens and that really does help but she feels like  it doesnt cuz u guys can acctually tell what i should do and you guys understand the feeling unlike her... but i just want her to understand that she does i want her to know how much she means to me... she is starting to give up on helping me cuz i found you guys... i dont want her to give up what do i do?
