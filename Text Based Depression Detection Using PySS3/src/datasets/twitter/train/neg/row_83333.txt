Paracetamol and liver damageOk, so approximately 20hrs ago I was going to take 15 grams of paracetamol, I just couldn't do it but consumed only 5 grams, will it make me liver damage? I'm a 15/M my weight is 52Kg. I rather not telling my parents unless I get irreversible damage. 

Ps: I know this may not be the appropriate sub to ask this but I feel ashamed and people here might judge me a little bit less, idk
