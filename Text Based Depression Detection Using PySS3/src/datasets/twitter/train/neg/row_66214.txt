I feel so fucking stressed out and lonelyFrom my hobbies (chess and tennis), which I fucking suck at, literally, to the fact that every other person I know is in a relationship with a beautiful woman is really just adding to my chronic fucking stress. I fucking sit in my room all the time getting nowhere with myself. I don't even enjoy the shit I do, I just do it to look normal, which I don't look normal, because my coworkers treat me like shit. Im so crushed and just trying to be normal. This is awesome. Lol.
