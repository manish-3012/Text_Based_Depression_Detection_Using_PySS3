What is life without love?Yet another late 20s person here with no romantic nor sexual experience beyond a couple of drunken makeout sessions and dates. Please don't reply with canned responses such as, "you just need confidence bro" or, "actually having an SO isn't that great, I wish I were single" or, "you're not really a loser" or, "you can and should focus on other areas of life" or, "you will be fine, there is no timeline." I know I am completely screwed and limited when it comes to this area of life. I bet all of you late bloomers really settled for something much less. Seeing my younger family members, even one as young as 12, with boyfriends/girlfriends makes me very envious and I know I will never have anything like that experience. What is life worth living knowing you're completely unlovable? I can continue to trudge through life with loneliness and envy, settle for someone who's not right for me and be miserable, or finally have some peace. Those are the only options. Fuck this.
