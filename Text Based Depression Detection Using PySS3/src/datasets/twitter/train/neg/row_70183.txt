I'm seriously considering killing myself.I have a method and place of doing it. I would do it in a way where a loved one wouldn't find my body, though it would result in a somewhat random person finding my body but I consider that a much better scenario than for a loved one to find me, much less traumatic.

I've been thinking about this for the last year. I hate my life and I just don't have the strength to change it. I have basically no roadblocks when it comes to school or finding better work or getting into shape or bettering myself or w.e., it's just my own weakness and stupidity that stops me.
