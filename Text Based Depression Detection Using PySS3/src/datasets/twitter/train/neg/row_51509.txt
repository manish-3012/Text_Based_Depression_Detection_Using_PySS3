Idk where to post this, but I honestly just feel lost in everythingMy life is fine, I have nothing to complain about other than mass social anxiety, only having a couple friends. What really got me was two things: how easy I was ignored at Thanksgiving today vs my brother since he's in the military, ready to graduate into the world while I just study from home just existing. Secondly, I've had minor epilepsy since I was a kid and it was never bad till I was 16 then it got worse so I got brain surgery. Surprise my brain rewired itself after 2 years apparently to keep having them. It's just funny how after all this time I see the thing I dread most about myself coming back, with a new little spike of a few seconds increasing my medicine. I just feel like I'm going to live in someone else's shadow alone with increasingly bad epilepsy AGAIN until I'm worn food.

Oh and to top it off not to self diagnose but I think I got minor schizophrenia. I'll hear passing thoughts about suicide in firings voice or laughing from places I can't see sometimes after I hold conversation with at least 5 voices in my head. Dunno if any of this matters, but I didn't know where to post it
