Spent most of my life suicidal.  Ask me anything.I never knew this reddit even existed.  Truth be told, I haven't been hanging out on reddit long, myself.  I spent the bulk of my life with suicide being Plan B for everything.  I'm finally starting to get a handle on the why.  Here's hoping I can drag even one person up from where they are to some place more stable.
