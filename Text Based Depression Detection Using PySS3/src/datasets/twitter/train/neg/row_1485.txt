Im lost reddit. what do i do?im in a pretty strange and confusing situation, all my life i've been pretty shit at math, Algebra to be precise. and im on my final term of my first semester repeat and thankfully i've improved on all of my subjects EXCEPT Algebra. i cant recall my first score on my first term, but the second term result is 37/100 and i've tried everything to fix myself. my mother hired so many tutor's. and only one of them helped a bit me improve abit in my studies, i've tried asking friends to "show me" how they study and do math, and that didnt help either. so i decided to take things in my own hands and teach myself, but i couldn't understand how to do this and that. i thought of drinking a bottle of water filled with various pill's. but i feel like there is a way to advance myself to G11(i know i'll do better here due to the 4 subjects of your choice kinda deal which would help me in achieving my career i animation and a choice between Business math and Algebra) . and to make things worse my father's side of the family is paying for my school.  and they stated if i don't get my stupid ass to 11 they'll stop paying my school bills. and it would be over for me, No school ,No Dream job career, Full Disapointment and Anger from my mother. i really just want to end it all, and kill myself. but something stops me from doing it I dont know what it is. But, im not sure im ready to face the end of this term.

TL;Dr? I suck at algebra, im on the brink of killing myeslef out of disapointment and anger from my mother and my arab family FML
