Advice on scar prevention/reduction?Hi folks,
I recently tried to kill myself, (SPOILER ALERT) it didnâ€™t work out for me. Or it did maybe, I guess thatâ€™s up to interpretation. Anyway, my forearms are a mess and I want to move on from this hopefully and be able to wear short sleeves without having to explain myself. I want to finish my sleeve without having to explain myself AND work around scars. Iâ€™m really trying to turn things around this time but having to deal with shame and embarrassment is really gonna dampen the mood. Any advice? I generally donâ€™t scar badly, but uh, itâ€™s kind of a mess.
