I won't make it to 21People would kill to get the advantages I have had in my life, from a fairly wealthy and supportive family to being born in one of the most prosperous areas in the world.  However, I can hardly get myself to attend my college classes, and it is my first year.  I would have blown my brains out already if it wasn't for my parents supporting me, it would destroy them to have their son die.  I just know I won't amount to anything in my life, I think I am just too lazy or maybe something is wrong in my head.  I have tried to get better but it didn't work in high school and it isn't working now.  The only place I see myself in 2-3 years is either as a bum leeching off of my parents or dead, and I am not sure what to do.  I'm not sure what I expect from this post, but I guess it just helps to see my thoughts typed out and if anyone else feels the same way.
