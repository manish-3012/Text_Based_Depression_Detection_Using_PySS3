The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fear that there is an afterlife.I was not raised in a religious household and I have never held religious believes. But the thought that we donâ€™t know whatâ€™s after death terrifies me. If I had absolute confidence that there was just nothing, I would be dead by now. But thereâ€™s a tiny part of me that isnâ€™t sure and that has stopped me.
