once my dog goes iâ€™m going tooi just canâ€™t live like this anymore. i constantly tell myself â€œin six months itâ€™ll be differentâ€ â€œeverything will have changed by this time next yearâ€ â€œsoon youâ€™ll find your people and things will get betterâ€. well itâ€™s been about 7 years of trying to tell myself that and things have only gotten worse. i have literally no friends whatsoever and no matter how hard and in how many different ways i try to make them it doesnâ€™t work, clearly there is just something seriously wrong with me that makes me impossible to be around. even my own family isnâ€™t that fussed on me. iâ€™m just annoying and weird and boring and obnoxious and selfish and ugly and disgusting and iâ€™m over it, the world isnâ€™t built for ugly people and nothing is ever going to change. iâ€™m 23 and i still live at home with no financial prospects of moving out anytime soon. iâ€™ve been trying to get my licence to have a bit more freedom but iâ€™m just as terrible at driving as i am at quite literally everything else and even if i got my licence where would i go? iâ€™ve got no one to hang out with. my life is going nowhere, i have no passions or hobbies or talents or skills so i have no hope for the future. i go to my admin job and i come home and sit in my room. i will never, ever be able to come out to my family and it wouldnâ€™t be worth it anyway because there is nothing about me that would make anyone want to date me or be with me so thereâ€™s just no point. iâ€™ve tried so damn hard to keep pushing and try to better myself and my life and i just keep falling further down this hole and getting more and more lonely. my dog is the only one who will actually miss me and be worse off without me, so iâ€™m waiting till she goes. sheâ€™s 15 and doesnâ€™t have long left now. i love her so much and i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll be able to cope without her anyway, so it just seems the right time.
