I'm going to wait until I'm 25I'm 17 and I've experienced depression from a very young age, I started ghosting friends at age 10 and lost any motivation in anything I take part in since 14. I made a suicide attempt a year ago and ever since then I started feeling happiness for the first time in years. I expected that to help, but instead it constantly reminds me of how sad I actually am 99% of the time. Now seeing or hearing the word happy or feeling it for myself is a strong trigger for my depression.

I failed 10 out of 14 of my classes last year. I can't get myself to do work, I always have the strong feeling pulling me away from it, and even when I do try, I get stuck on the smallest things and end up physically and emotionally burnt out after about 100 words. Hobbies aren't any easier to do either, despite my love for art I haven't had anything to do with it outside of school. I spend lots of my time staring at walls, hating myself... Or playing videogames, which I hate because now that it's the only thing I can get myself to do, people start to think it's the reason I'm a failure, even the people who know about all this.

Everything seems to be going downhill and I don't see how I'll ever manage to keep up a job or live on my own. And even if I do somehow despite all odds manage to have a half decent life on my own it will most likely be empty and sad, I won't have anything to do and I'll just be stuck going in the cycle of going to a job I hate, coming home to a house I hate, while having nothing to distract myself from these thoughts.

But despite all this, I understand that things can change out of nowhere, and so I am giving myself 8 years to do this. If I haven't improved or if it gets worse in this time then I'm going to kill myself, because there will be no reason to go on from there, 8 years sounds reasonable and I won't wait any longer.
