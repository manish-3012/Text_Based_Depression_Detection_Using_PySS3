My life is going to be nonstop intense suffering why go through with itFor me there is no light at the end of the tunnel, there is nothing but shame and guilt and constant unmet needs. Iâ€™ll never have a girlfriend Iâ€™ll never get out of minimum wage jobs Iâ€™m truly fucked and to be honest I hate posting this shit, but I have to because I canâ€™t talk too my parents about it or Iâ€™ll be visiting a psych ward
