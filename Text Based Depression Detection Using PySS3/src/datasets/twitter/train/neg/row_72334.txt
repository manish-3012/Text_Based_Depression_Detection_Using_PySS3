Where's the restart button?I always drift off somewhere to an alternate reality where everything went my way since birth and I'm perfectly happy. Also, lately I've been taking sleeping pills as to enhance my sleeps and dreams because these are the only ways to escape life without having to take it. 

I don't wanna feel like an ungrateful ass but my life isn't actually bad. No tragedies. I'm just not happy. 

I'm already embarrassed at how much money my parents spent for my studies and I'm still in college and uninspired. 

Why can't life be a Nintendo game?
