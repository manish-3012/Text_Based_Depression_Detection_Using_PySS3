"Im just telling you what everyone else already knows: you're a terrible person. You should kill yourself and finish the job this time." - my ex to meI broke up with my boyfriend about an hour ago and this was essentially what he said to me on his way out. He told me to kill myself and actually complete the job this time. I just started therapy again and was trying to get myself pointed in the right direction to get better. And he says this. 

I tried to kill myself in high school, obviously failed, and he knows this. He knows i just went to my first therapy appointment. 

My dad told me in high school that "its down the lane. Not across the road" when I told him I wanted to kill myself. 

Why are the men I'm close to so "supportive" of my self destructive behaviors? Am I really just not worth jackshit? 

I want to kill myself, i hate this i hate this i hate him
