I thought I was over this, but I've just cut into myself again.I had horrible depression during my mid to late teen years, and would regularly self inflict wounds. To anybody who's never experienced the compulsion to do such a thing, it's very hard to describe, but the relief that washes over you at feeling physical pain is really palpable. I think maybe the rush of adrenaline is the only thing that can take the place of the emotional pain.

Point being, that was years ago. The last time I genuinely cut myself was at 19, and I'm 28 now and I've just done it again. I haven't felt this bad in nearly a decade, and now I'm terrified of what this is going to do to my life. I can't go through years of this again, I just can't. I won't survive. 

My depression is already starting to wear down my girlfriend, who is growing less sympathetic and more annoyed with each episode. I fear she'll leave me soon.

I've tried it all before. Years of therapy, a variety pharmaceutical cocktails in various varieties and dosages, intense exercise (lost over a hundred pounds), herbal remedies and aromatherapy, nothing has had lasting effect.

What is the point of feeling better if this is just going to happen again and again?
