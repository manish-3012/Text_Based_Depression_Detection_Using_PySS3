Don't know my optionsHi guys, so right now I am in process of waiting on my marks for a course which would determine whether I meet my progression requirements or don't. I don't know if I will be allowed to stay in my degree if I fail the course. Asides from that everything else around me has just started to pick up. I am doing good extra-cirrcular wise, i got the job i always wanted and my family life is starting to do good as well. 

So if I get kicked out of degree, it all comes to an end. If I do fail I know of pretty tall building where I will just get shitfaced and jump. I need this degree. Everyone will laugh at me and I will lose everything. Maybe I could even move to the states and just shoot myself. 

I don't know what my options are. There is too much at stake. Someone please try to help me cope with the anxiety.
