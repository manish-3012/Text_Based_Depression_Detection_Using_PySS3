evolutionary failureevolution made species survive by survival of the fittest. fittest kinda changed its meaning in human society. since i don't help anyway to contribute to the survival of the human race i only way it down by being lazy and bad at everything. isn't it the best if i stop dragging people down by me existing. i mean i don't want to kill myself (yet) but being dead is apealing even if i would regret doing it i can't think about regretting it when i am dead.
