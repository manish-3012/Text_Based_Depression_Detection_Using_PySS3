I've had it with all these fucking assholesThis planet of ours is filled to the brim with oblivious assholes, I fucking hate them.

They do nothing but create problems then act like those problems are someone else's fault, fucking idiots. They go around making life unbearable then act like someone needs to be mentally ill to want to kill themselves. Maybe I don't want to live in this world if I have to be your fucking kicking boy? Maybe I don't like being the butt of every joke? Maybe I'm not okay with existing just to make your life easier? Maybe you're a fucking asshole and it's your fault people kill themselves?

Worthless shits. I see these stupid fucking posters around the place about depression and being suicidal. "Talk to someone" they say. "Reach out" they say. They never mention the part where you talk about why you're suicidal and people laugh at you. They leave out the part where you get mocked and called a troll. If someone hasn't personally dealt with the reasons you want to die, they laugh at you and call you a bitch.

No facilities I can get help at. Sure facilities exist, but not for me. All the mental health support out there is for middle class women, if you're anyone other than a middle class woman you're fucked. No help is coming, you're just a piece of shit and everything is your fault.

I thought I was suicidal for years because I was an ugly unemployable loser, but I'm not. I'm actually suicidal because I live in a world of complete fucking dickheads.

I just wish I could spread my misery around some more before killing myself. God knows the people that deserve misery the most never get it.
