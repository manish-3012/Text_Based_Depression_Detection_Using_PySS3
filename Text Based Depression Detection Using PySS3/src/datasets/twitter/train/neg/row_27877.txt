Should I tell my therapist that I'm suicidal again?Before you jump the gun and say "yes", here's some background:

I'm diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder depressive type. With medication, I am very high functioning to that point that it's hard to tell I have any mental illness. Nevertheless, I still hear voices, feel paranoid all the time, and get depressed a lot. Before my diagnosis, I had three suicide attempts. I constantly thought of killing myself. And I got hospitalized for psychosis. I am still a minor, so anything I tell my therapist about suicidal ideation goes straight to my parents. I feel that if my parents find out, they will be disappointed, making me feel worse.

Why do I feel suicidal again? Of course there is the psychosis. My own mind constantly bullying me. And the depression. More specifically, I feel extremely lonely. There's a girl I like. She has a boyfriend. We still hang out. It's painful and fun to be around her. On one hand, she is my favorite person in the world, and, on the other, she would never reciprocate my affection. Then there's college. I feel like I'll never get into the college I want. I feel like my whole life is dependent on what college I get into. 

I think of killing myself about three times a day now. I have a specific plan.
