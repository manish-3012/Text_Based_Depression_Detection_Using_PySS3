i survivedi made a post yesterday about how i was going to end my life in five minutes. i went through with it, but long story short my flatmate found me in time and took me to the hospital. iâ€™m kinda disappointed but i guess it just wasnâ€™t my time to go. thank you for all the kind messages i received. iâ€™ll try to reply to them all in case they donâ€™t see this and are still worried about me. i honestly didnâ€™t think that many people would care if i died. i meant every word in my original post and i hope you all realize how strong you are. iâ€™ll try to be better for you. sending love
