I don't even know what to put here because it's pointlessI'm so done with being alive because it's just not worth it anymore. My girlfriend is the only person who makes me happy and brings any joy into my life anymore but that's not enough anymore. I'm failing two classes, and there's no way I'll be able to get those grades back up. I have a shitty job where I'm treated like crap, and I can't quit it because I can't afford to not have any income. My grandmother died on Thursday and she was the only one besides my girlfriend who understood how everything is shitty and how "hard it can get sometimes". I'm 130 pounds over weight because I have no self-control. I'll never get myself to lose weight. I over think everything, and it drives me crazy. I can't stop thinking about the negative outcomes there could be of all the stuff going on in politics around the world now. I'm terrified of global warming never getting solved life on Earth being wiped out. It makes me paranoid. I'm so just stressed out that I went berserk and yelled at my entire famiIy. I hate those people that say "that's life, deal with it". That's not true. It can't be, because then everything is pointless. And if it is, then who is anyone to make that decision for me that I should stay alive if it's that bad. if it's worth it for you, cool, go have fun. But it's not for me. So I'm just done. I want to go.
