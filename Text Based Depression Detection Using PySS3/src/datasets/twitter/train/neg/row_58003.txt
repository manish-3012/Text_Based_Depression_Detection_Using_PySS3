Two kinds of suicidal peopleI think there are two kinds of suicidal individuals. There is the kind that waits on the platform for the train and jumps in front just before it passes. And the other kind sees the train coming, gets on the track and sprints towards it as if it can't get there soon enough. 

Right now I feel like sprinting towards the train. Google says I'm having an existential crisis. I just feel dead inside and don't see the point in anything anymore. 

I imagine the point of life is to be happy. I can't even imagine the last time I was truly happy. Not that I have any reason to be unhappy now... I just am. I just graduated from a respectable university, in one of the most difficult majors available. I feel like i could find a job easily if i tried harder, but lately i can barely bring myself to climb out of bed.

I don't want to be miserable forever. So I've resolved to either find a way to be happy or kill myself. Will antidepressant medications trick me into being happy?

I'm sorry if my thoughts are disorganized I've been drinking. (This isn't just me being drunk and pondering the point of existence, I've been stewing over this shit for years)

Last time I told a friend the way I'd been feeling she laughed in my face. Please don't do that to me as well reddit
