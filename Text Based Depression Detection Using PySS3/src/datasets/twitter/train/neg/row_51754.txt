So if someone has a physical illness, everybody understands it and takes it seriously. Why? Because they can see it? But when someone has a mental illness; they're looking for attention, are weak, and just need to get over it? OkayOr someone who is struggling with depression that hasn't killed themselves yet - they're just a whining, dramatic bitch or what? But if they kill themselves right now; everybody stops what they're doing, needs time off work, the world stops spinning, "omg horrible"  
What the fuck
