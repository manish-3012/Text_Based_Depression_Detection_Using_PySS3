Failed an attempt to kill myself 30 minutes ago.I've spent hours researching the best way to commit suicide, after looking through many options and the things I had access too, I decided to Hang myself with partial suspension.

I tied a long scarf to the door knob, then around my neck. After a few tries I positioned the scarf correctly. At first it was hard breath, my head felt like it was going to explode. Then a wave of peace, everything went numb and my body went limp. 

I don't know if the scarf isn't a solid enough rope but I just couldn't manage to pass out and my bodies survival instincts kicked in. So with every last bit of strength I had my two hand I could barely feel pushed me back up.

I'm thinking next time I try it should just be regular hanging so my body doesn't have a chance to try stop me.
