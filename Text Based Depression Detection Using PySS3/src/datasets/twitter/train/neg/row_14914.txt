Restarting my ritual of spending one hour a day holding my gun while talking trying to convince myself to commit suicideFirst off, I don't really want any of you fake pieces of shit asking me questions about what is wrong or telling me to go talk to family or saying it will get better like always happens. I just want people to know I exist and I'm documenting this for myself. That's all.
