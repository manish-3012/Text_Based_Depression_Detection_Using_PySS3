SkydivingIt's my birthday on Thursday
I will have made it to 19
Alive, in one piece
Or so it may seem


But inside it's a slalom 
Of anxiety and sadness
Trying to grasp onto hope
Wherever I can find it


All I want is to feel happy
To finally feel 'fine'
Bask in the little things
That make me feel alive


So on Monday I will jump
Right out of a plane
In hopes that the thrill 
Will make my heart soar again 


Adrenaline, I crave
I will certainly get
So maybe to get to 20
I'll do it again
