Giving up but no depressed or sadThought I'd get it off my chest. I'm currently staying at a friend's house and things aren't in the best of situations for me - I haven't been able to land a job and quite frankly I don't even care anymore. My friend's family has been giving him a lot of shit for having me stay around him for so long and I don't want him to shoulder the weight of my mistakes and bullshit no more. This Friday I intend to leave at night and off myself. I've lost motivation to do anything in this life and I haven't found anything to hold onto. I don't believe I am depressed nor sad about anything. I think I've just given up on everything and anything. I'm going to sleep after I post this. I only have like two days left, might as well sleep and watch anime or something while I can.
