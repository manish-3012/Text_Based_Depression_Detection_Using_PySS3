I Don't Know What to doIm a 22 year old living with his dad in an apartment. Have been suffering from trauma over a relationship ending very badly, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I'm jobless and relying on money from my mom. Currently taking venlafaxine, but it seems that they dont do the trick anymore (only 2 months in.)

I have had a belt tied to a bar in my closet for over 4 months now and I have been tempted and have tried to end my life on numerous occasions but the only reason I dont go through with it is because I do it in a controlled manner, meaning I can stop if I feel like I need to and on top of that I'm a coward.

I don't have much to live for anymore. No skills, no dedicated friend groups that have my back when I'm low, I let my brain win. No matter how hard I fought my brain still won. I would just take all my meds and call it a life but since I've tried that before they dont give me enough to make that a possibility. I just want out. My life has been done for a while now. I don't know what to do.
