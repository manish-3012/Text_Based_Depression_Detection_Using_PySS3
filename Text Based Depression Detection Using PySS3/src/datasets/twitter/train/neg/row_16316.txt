I AM JEALOUS OF MAJORITY OF PEOPLE AND SUICIDAL. PLEASE READ.Okay so I am 21 year old unknown single virgin IT college guy who only had one girlfriend and I didn't like her at all and was only a one week with her in relationship and the only reason I was with her is because I wanted to know what is it like to be in relationship but I didn't enjoy kissing her lips only kissing her cheeks but she was always talking about things that don't interest me. So I broke up with her. It was on February 2018 when I was 19.  I had my first kiss in nightclub when I was 18 and I didn't like that girl either I just kissed her because I thought I will feel good kissing any girl in the lips. I was wrong. I am straight but I just think I didn't find the right girl which I would enjoy kissing. Now you may ask yourself why am I writing this? Because I am depressed and anxious that I HAVE NEVER FELT WHAT LOVE IS despite having a girlfriend before. I am also a virgin. Now when I was on Tinder, Badoo or Instagram ( I don't use those shits anymore) it is so rare to get a match with girl but even if you get match then they don't reply you back. It is so hard to find a gf today. I am 6ft tall from Balkans so I am about average height here and I am actually good looking guy tbh I was complimented few time by girls in HS. BUT WHEN I SEE PEOPLE OUTSIDE I SEE SO MANY COUPLES AND COUPLES WITH CHILDREN. I GET SO JEALOUS THAT I WANT TO DESTROY THEM! THEY ARE HAPPY AND LIVE A GOOD LIFE WHILE I AM ALL ALONE, GOING TO COLLEGE, WORKING OUT, ONE OF THE BEST STUDENTS, AND HAVE A FEW FRIENDS BUT STILL CANNOT ACHIEVE WHAT THEY HAVE. A GIRLFRIEND(WIFE, FIANCE) AND CHILDREN. I AM ALSO JEALOUS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CANADA BECAUSE I WANT TO LIVE IN CANADA. I AM ALSO VERY PALE AND CAN ONLY WORK IN BUILDINGS BECUASE I DON'T WANT TO GET SUNBURNED. I AM JEALOUS OF PEOPLE WHO DRIVE A CAR AND MOST OF THEM WHEN WAITING ON TRAFFIC PASSAGE ARE JUDGING ME BY MY LOOKS OR MOVES FROM THEIR LUXURIOUS CARS LIKE THEY ARE SOME KIND OF KINGS AND QUEENS. I ALSO COME FROM POOR FAMILY AND THE ONLY COUNTRY I WENT WAS ITALY AND BOSNIA AND I LIVE IN CROATIA AND THAT IS ALL. I HAVE A OLDER BROTHER WHO SOMETIMES BULLY ME VERBALLY. I AM JEALOUS OF PEOPLE WHO WEAR BETTER CLOTHES THAN ME. I AM JEALOUS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN PROGRAMMING EVEN THOUGH I AM ONE OF THE BEST PROGRAMMERS IN MY COLLEGE. I FEEL LIKE ALL PEOPLE JUST WATCH THEMSELVES AND WANT TO BE BETTER THAN OTHERS AND WHEN I TELL THEM TO STOP BRAGGING OR WHEN THEY ARE JUDGING ME WHEN I SAY THAT ALL HUMAN SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO LOVE, TO HAVE A CHILDREN OR TO LIVE WHENVER THEY WANT AND THEY ARE ALSO MAKING FUN OF ME FOR FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY IN ECONOMICS, LOVE, CHILDREN AND FREEDOM TO LIVE WHENEVER WE WANT WITHOUT FUCKING VISAS OR OTHER DOCUMENTS. I WANT TO LIVE THE LIFE LIKE I WANT! PERIOD! I WANT A CHUBBY WIFE AND HAVE CHILDREN WITH HER, I WANT TO LIVE IN CANADA, I WANT TO DRIVE A WHITE RANGE ROVER CAR, HAVE AVERAGE CANADIAN INCOME OR HIGHER CANADIAN INCOME, BE ABLE TO VISIT OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE A TOURIST, HAVE A CAT, AND WORK AS AN IT PROGRAMMER! FUCKING ASSHOLES WILL SAY THAT I AM ENTITLED NO I AM NOT! I HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE THE LIFE LIKE I WANT AND EVERYONE SHOULD LIVE LIFE LIKE THEY WANT. I WILL FULFILL MY DREAM! :)
