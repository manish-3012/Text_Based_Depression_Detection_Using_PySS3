I (17F) need someone to talk to.I donâ€™t feel comfortable unloading the details here; that has had severe consequences in the past. But I could really, really use someone to talk to. I donâ€™t know how to cope with what Iâ€™m going through and it doesnâ€™t feel like itâ€™s safe to share it with anyone. Iâ€™ve been fantasizing non-stop about my death, and itâ€™s scary. People typically describe relief when they talk about planning their suicide, but Iâ€™ve just had this gnawing unease sitting in the pit of my stomach.
