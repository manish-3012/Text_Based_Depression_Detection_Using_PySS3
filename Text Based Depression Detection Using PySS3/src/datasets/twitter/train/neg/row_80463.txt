I relapsed and she now wants me to leave or kill myself. Leaning toward the latter.Iâ€™ve been suffering from my alcoholism really bad this year. I was forbidden to drink for good reason but I continued to try to drink by hiding bottles around the house and yard. Eventually this was found leading to a major blowup.

Since then Iâ€™ve been struggling to stay sober. I see a therapist and speak with a group but the urges come when I am feeling intense intrusive depressive thoughts and/or feelings of extreme worthlessness. Yesterday was one such day when I slept through an alarm and forced her to take public transportation to get home.â€™I went out afterward to pick up dinner and ended up drinking some beer. I didnâ€™t even enjoy it. I just wanted to forget the pain for a while.

Well she found out because Iâ€™m not a good liar. She blew up at me and told me we were over. I slept on the patio furniture in our yard until she went to bed. I then came inside and slept on the couch. She took my phone at some point at night and changed the wallpaper to a list of why Iâ€™m such a shitty person. She also texted me how I should just kill myself so she can finally be rid of me and the abuse I put her through by continuing to fall prey to my addiction. She also told me I would never have anything to do with our son and that she would be sure to tell him what a pathetic loser I am.

Sheâ€™s right. I should just lull myself. Iâ€™m tired of feeling sad and worthless every day. Iâ€™m tired of making her angry when I fuck up.

Iâ€™ve already beaten myself in the head repeatedly with my fists hoping I would die that way. But Iâ€™m still here. Iâ€™m not sure how I can accomplish what is needed as I do not have access to firearms. All I know is I just need to die so that she can have a good life. I donâ€™t deserve to be alive anymore.
