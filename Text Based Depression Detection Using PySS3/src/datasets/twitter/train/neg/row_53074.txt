Im scared to die but Its all I think about when sober..Only when im smoking weed do i feel good, but i have none, i cut myself quite badly.
My problem is my mental health team think the hospital is a bad place for me, i've taken over doses and cut my self to pieces and send home next day.

There is no hope for me, all i have is time, the time until i ultimately end it all. I'm just a coward, but if im pushed and i get the adrenaline going i can do it. i was so close before, 1 slice away from instant death.
