Everything is my fault. I feel empty. Everything is getting worse.25/F/Unemployed. I have a degree in a major I didnâ€™t even want because I was emotionally manipulated to take it up. Now I donâ€™t know how to carry myself.  I just want to vent. Want to put this all out there so in case I turn up dead, thereâ€™s some account of why.

Note: My circumstances are not as tragic as most but at the same time feeling suicidal should be neither a competition nor a â€œright.â€ 

Iâ€™ve been depressed for 6 years and counting. My family is Filipino and have a very condescending view of mental illness and being suicidal. The reason I mention my ethnicity is that I think every culture has their own view on mental illness and that gravely affects how people treat it. Frankly, I think Asians handle mental illness in the absolute worst ways possible.

Iâ€™ve been trying to seek help from every source people have given me and none of it has worked. 

Iâ€™ve tried to see a professional and get anti-depressants. But the first time my mom caught me with the pills and she told me â€œthose are for psychos.â€ Then the second time I tried, my dad found the prescription and said I â€œdidnâ€™t need those.â€  Now I canâ€™t afford health insurance so the pills are ungodly expensive, so I have no option to get them until I get myself out of unemployment.

Iâ€™ve tried calling a suicide hotline and the person on the other end just told me to seek a professional before hanging up. They didnâ€™t even bother to listen to me for more than five minutes.

My final resort was finally telling my friends and family that Iâ€™m suicidal and MAYBE theyâ€™ll help me. I wasnâ€™t asking for them to be that â€œsaviorâ€ you see in movies. I wasnâ€™t even asking them to pity me. All I wanted was some form of understanding- for them to know what Iâ€™m going through and see why I may not always be the happy girl they think I am. Or even just a hug. Someone to tell me it was all going to be okay.

But everyone I told either treated my depression like it was some sort of crime (saying shit like â€œWHY ARE YOU DEPRESSED? YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BE DERESSED!!!â€) or they donâ€™t know how to react so they treat me like Iâ€™m the village freak (â€œWhat do you want me to say?â€). They stop talking to me or they treat me like the punching bag. Itâ€™s so condescending and irritating. I have very few friends left because I couldnâ€™t handle how the rest were treating me. 

I worked so hard for my family. Even when they abused me as a I child I still wanted them to love me. I put up with all the belt slaps and the bruises. Even that time when my father hit me with a chair or both of my parents put me in a charm closet, tied me up and screamed at me for getting in a fight with my brother when a friend was visiting. Or even the worst memory, the time I witnessed my mother almost stabbing my father out of rage as I was hiding in the closet. I put up with that because it was all part of the Filipino way of parenting, as Iâ€™ve been told. 

I sacrificed my youth and my dreams so I can support them and make them happy. They wanted me to just study so they refused to let me get a job or attend clubs. And theyâ€™ve even threatened me with kicking me out of the home or taking away all my money if I didnâ€™t comply with their desires. â€œIf you donâ€™t become a doctor, youâ€™re not my daughter anymoreâ€ my mom would often say. They wanted me to become I doctor so badly that last year, (against my wishes) they were so close to sending me to the Philippines so I could attend Med. School there (I didnâ€™t qualify for any schools in the US. Shocker.) 

Iâ€™ve been working so hard keeping this dysfunctional family together through every argument, working hard so I can fulfill THEIR desires, and putting up with their insults against my successes, my interests and now my obesity. Even when I was finally fed up and just told them how I truly felt, they blamed it all on me. That it was my fault for not having the life I wanted. That it was my fault that at 25 Iâ€™m a loser. And theyâ€™re right. Itâ€™s my fault. Itâ€™s all my fault. It was my fault for thinking I could make all those sacrifices and think I just needed peopleâ€™s love and care in return.

Thereâ€™s only so much I can take. I donâ€™t feel like my own person. I just feel like a puppet who just went with whatever people told me. Iâ€™ve given up on so many things that Iâ€™ve wanted and now I feel like itâ€™s too late for me to start over. At 25 thereâ€™s no way I can be a pro artist like Iâ€™ve always wanted. I donâ€™t have the money for school and thereâ€™s so many people who are leaps and bounds ahead of me that if I try to go to school now Iâ€™d be a laughing stock. All Iâ€™ve been doing was practice and practice and practice but it never feels like Iâ€™m catching up. Iâ€™ve lost so many years of learning. Now I have nothing and Iâ€™m stuck in a rut.

Iâ€™ve only ever wanted to be an artist but now that I finally have a chance, itâ€™s already too late. Itâ€™s the only thing Iâ€™m good at and even that I suck. What does that say about me as a whole. Im nothing. Iâ€™m absolutely nothing. Iâ€™m alone. I donâ€™t have my family and Iâ€™ve lost so many friends.

I want to hit the reset button. I want to be reborn in a life where I had the support Iâ€™ve always wanted without having to sacrifice my sense of self. That I had parents who didnâ€™t beat me for wanting to play with friends or for getting a math problem wrong. 

I want to die. I want to die so badly. 

Iâ€™ve been reaching out to the friends I have left for weeks but none of them have texted me back yet. I just wanted to have conversation. I didnâ€™t mention how strong the need to commit suicide has grown. I just wanted to talk about our interests and geek out about anime or dumb new stories. Anything to find some solid ground again even if itâ€™s in brief conversations. 

Ugly, talentless, a terrible person, and now I donâ€™t have anyone who cares enough to speak to me 

I just want someone to distract me from the pain. Itâ€™s been getting worse the last few weeks. It wonâ€™t stop. I donâ€™t know how to make it stop. I just want to die and be reborn. I want a second life. Otherwise Iâ€™d rather not have been born at all. 

They shouldâ€™ve let that umbilical chord choke me out. I wouldâ€™ve been happier dead.
