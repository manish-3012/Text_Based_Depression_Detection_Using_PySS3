Future corpse or future doctorSorry if this is vague but I'm trying to stay anonymous. I'm in medical school and some fucked up shit happened to me out of my control and now the school might kick me out. I joined this sub and entered medical school to help people, now I might never get to do that. 

I'm pissed that the school doesn't have my back. I've payed them thousands of dollars and even more hours of work. Yet they'll sack me without a second thought. I'm in unsurmountable debt due to all the schooling (hundreds of thousands). If I get kicked out I'll never pay it off. 

Would I be able to take out a big life insurance policy then kill myself? I could make it look like an accident. I don't want my poor spouse to be left with the debt. I also don't want my spouse or family to be the ones that find my body... Those are the only things keeping me alive right now.

I'm one of the worst students in the school and don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I'm probably better off not becoming a doctor anyways. I made an appointment with school counselors but can't be seen till next week.
