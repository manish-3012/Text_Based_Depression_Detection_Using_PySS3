Afraid of methodsDoes hanging scare anyone else? I posted here yesterday talking about my personal struggle, and Iâ€™m sitting here thinking about my upcoming deadline. I realized that Iâ€™m not so scared of less aggressive forms of killing myself, ones that are go to sleep and not wake up. However, I donâ€™t have my car anymore and Iâ€™m too broke to go buy something to try to OD on, and I was thinking about how Iâ€™m going to do it. 

Iâ€™m going to have to hang myself, but it seems so aggressive that every time I picture myself in my spot like that, my chest cramps a little. Maybe Iâ€™ll push it back and go make some money....
