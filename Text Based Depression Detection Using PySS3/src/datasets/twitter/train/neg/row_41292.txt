I haven't drank in 6 years since the night I tried to hang myself. I'm sitting here with a liter of whiskey. Maybe I can just drown myself in it.Seems like every few years, something happens that just fucks my shit up royally. Every time. Without fail. 

6 years ago tried to hang myself. Spent a month in the psych ward and 6 months on mind-numbing pills. 

3 years ago a roommate stole $4000, all I had, from me. 

Last week I was in a car accident. I was not at fault. An 18-wheeler read ended me. 

Today I found out that insurance is not going to repair my car, they are only going to give me the worth of the car, and since it's a 2007 that amounts to $FuckAll. 

My car is scrap and now I've got nothing left. Literally nothing left. It's all gone. I can't afford another car and I can't do anything with the measly fifteen hundred dollars I'll get from that fucking cunts insurance. Fifteen hundred dollar. For my entire fucking livelyhood. That's all it was worth. That's all my life is worth. Nothing. 

I haven't touched a drop of alcohol since I tried to kill myself 6 years ago and right now im sitting in my destroyed car with a liter of whiskey. I'm getting fucking drunk tonight. Maybe I won't wake up tomorrow. Can only hope.
