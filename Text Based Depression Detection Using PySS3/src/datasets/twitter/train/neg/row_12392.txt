MondayI'm done. I cannot handle this, cutting isn't enough anymore, everyone is against me, the paranoia has come back and everyone has abandoned me.

First, my girlfriends leaves me for some other fucking guy! Then the school boots me out the door for not making a phonecall that i could never make because i would just breakdown. Then I get laid off at work, and when i turn to my friends, they want nothing to do with me. I can't even fucking cry, over the past few days I've just covered my legs in cuts, but it isn't enough. I have no reason to go on, why should I even fucking try? I hate this, I don't want this life and I don't want to see the fucking light of day ever again. I AM FUCKING DONE!
