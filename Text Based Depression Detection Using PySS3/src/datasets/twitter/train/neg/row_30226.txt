I'm about to end it all.I've been thinking about it for months, almost did it a few weeks back but a friend managed to stop me once she caught on to what I was doing. But the empty feeling, like I'm worthless, the depression, knowing I have no future, all the mistakes I've made.. I have a family and I know they'll miss me, I'm under 18 so no children or anything. But the pain is too much and nobody else understands. Not even my friend, she helps but unless youve been in that situation yourself its pointless. I think I'm going to hang myself tonight, everybody else is asleep so no chance of being found.
