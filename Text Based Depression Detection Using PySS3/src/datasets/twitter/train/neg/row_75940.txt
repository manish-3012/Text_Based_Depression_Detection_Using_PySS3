It's really hopeless.I tried everything. It started this year, when I realized everything was going downhill. It started with my grades. Then it snowballed into rejections. Now I'm sitting with here after getting my girlfriend taken away. To make matters worse, no college wants me. I know you might say, this is silly, just work harder. But, I don't think I can. No one looks at me and sees me as suicidal. But I need to put in so much effort just to wake up and go to school. Every little thing all of a sudden just becomes 1000x harder. My health goes downhill and I don't even know what I'm doing, why am I not dead yet after 11 tries? Well, I guess I should appreciate the fact that this subreddit along with my online friends from games and Twitter has been able to keep me alive for 3 more months now. Thank you. In 5 days, it will be spring break for my school, I hope that on the 14th, I will no longer be alive. Thanks, I just wanted to be happy for the last few days, I know, you might think I'm dumb but hey, just let it pass.
