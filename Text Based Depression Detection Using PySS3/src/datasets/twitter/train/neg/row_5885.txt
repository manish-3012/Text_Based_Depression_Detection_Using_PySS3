I'm just really fatigued and want/need some way to move onI feel like my whole life I've been unhappy with who I am and what I can do. Of all the things I know I can do, I know I can write music, but I just don't show it off, and I don't feel proud of what I'm able to write/create. I want to create something meaningful but its just so nasty. I'm close to graduating with a bachelors in philosophy, and it's useless in a practical sense. A lot of the time I consider buying a gun and blowing my brains out, but I just wish I wasn't such a coward. I want to play my music. It's really pathetic to complain about this shit on the internet, none of my heroes would do this.

I would never kill myself as far as I know, but then again, I really don't love or respect myself. I think the real reason I express my fear and discontent is because I don't think I'll really be happy unless I'm successful musically, which is statistically ridiculous.

EDIT: Just realized this post may not be suited to this subreddit in particular, but in my drunkenness, I really don't know any other subreddits to post to, so forgive me and point me in the right direction. Again, I apologize and my position towards suicide is much more complicated than "I am or I'm not." I'm really more scared and self-hateful than I am personally able to let on, so again I apologize if my post draws from others' needs and attention.
