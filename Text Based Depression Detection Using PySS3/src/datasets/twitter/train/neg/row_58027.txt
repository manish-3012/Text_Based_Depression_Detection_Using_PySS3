college exam pressure.hello all. Less than 1 month left for me to take the sat exam and after all this shit I came to the conclusion that suicide is the only answer. I dont want to go through all those stuff because I pretty much know whats gonna happen. I feel so stressed and under pressure. All I can do is cry.
