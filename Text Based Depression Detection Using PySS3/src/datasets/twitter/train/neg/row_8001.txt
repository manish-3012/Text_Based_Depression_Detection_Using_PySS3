I am strugglingI just had a baby, I'm 20, I dropped put of college, I love my boyfriend but I don't know how to talk to him anymore because I am always sad. I've had depression and anxiety and I'm sure this is post partum but fuck, I want to die. I want to fall asleep right now and never fucking wake-up but I also love my daughter and she makes me so happy. I can't breathe. I hate myself, my body. Labor was traumatizing, the first night alone with the baby was traumatizing. I am so broken and beaten and lifeless. I have nothing left in me to fight. I have a lump in my throat like I'm going to cry 24/7... Sometimes all I do is cry.
