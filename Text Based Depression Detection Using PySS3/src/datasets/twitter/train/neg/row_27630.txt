I need a real reason to live.Intellectually I know I shouldn't be saying this, because if it was anyone else I would be saying "there is so much to do and live for blah blah blah" but I don't see the point in myself. I have missed so much and felt humiliated for so long and every little thing just makes me want to kill myself (e.g. sharing a belief I have and everyone else I'm with when I say it look uncomfortable and awkwardly leave the room.) I would ideally leave and surround myself with more supportive people but to do that I really need money, and I can't handle a job in my current state. Which means I will have to wait even longer before I can actually move on from anything and I don't know how much longer I can take it. There was no childhood/adolescence and I now have nowhere to go.
