I'm tired.I'm just so tired. Since second grade I haven't fit in, I haven't had talents or dreams that I remember. I turn 25 in a few days, I told myself dead by 18, dead by 20, dead by 24, dead by 30 and I'm closer than I've ever been before. I'm a talentless, cripplingly depressed leech that has no ambition, no friends, no drive and no will to carry on. I don't want to die, not really, but it's so close that I can feel it. I don't know what to do anymore, I've been fighting myself for so fucking long and I am so tired.
