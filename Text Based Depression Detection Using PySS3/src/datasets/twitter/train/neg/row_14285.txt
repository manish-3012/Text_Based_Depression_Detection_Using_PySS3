Afterlife?Hey guys

Since im going to be dead pretty soon, im wondering if there really is a paradise after this pain. I was born christian but i dont believe in heaven or hell (if god loved his people why would he send them to hell for eternity) and ive been reading about DMT, higher consciousness,  dimensions, universes, etc. And most of you think theres eternal oblivion after death, which i do understand. I prefer eternal peace and happiness after but oblivion is also cool as well, i mean i wont even be aware about it when im dead. 

Whats your guyâ€™s thoughts?
