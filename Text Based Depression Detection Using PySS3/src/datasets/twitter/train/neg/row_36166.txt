i donâ€™t know how to do anything...literally anything in real lifemy parents have done EVERY SINGLE THING for me. they never taught me anything. iâ€™m 18 and i have no responsibilities, nothing. iâ€™m also extremely codependent. oh how i wish i had different parents. and whenever i hang out with people when i rarely do, i treat them like a parent figure because i donâ€™t know how to do anything. and whenever i meet someone new or even talk to someone at the bus station/doctors office, etc i get severe anxiety. my parents shouldnâ€™t have had kids. i donâ€™t have the confidence to do anything, i donâ€™t have any confidence in myself at all. mentally iâ€™m like a five year old. i have no individuality, no personality. this sent me into a severe anhedonic depression and iâ€™m just apathetic and dead inside. the only answer for me is death.
