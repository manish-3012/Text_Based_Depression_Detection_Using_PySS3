My ex found out I was searching ways to die without pain and he didnâ€™t say anything about it..Itâ€™s a very very fresh break up, I returned his iPad but forget to delete everything.. 

I left some tabs open and it was about painless suicidal methods. He told me a week later that he saw it. Now Iâ€™m thinking why didnâ€™t he say anything within that week? Maybe he wanted me to die..
