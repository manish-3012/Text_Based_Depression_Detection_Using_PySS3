Im pretty much done...Im starting high school in a couple of months and i think its too much for me... My parents (mom and step-dad) think that theres nothing wrong with me but in reality im going to break from the stress alone... My parents are expecting a lot from me since im the eldest of their kids and its too much to handle... They are the best parents you could ever ask for but they expect so much and are pretty harsh if i dont do well in school or anywhere really...
I have the feeling of emptyness and i just want to die... I have had so much shit in my life but everyone thinks im fine just cause i dont show it... My real dad was a fucking asshole who abused me and my sister... Everyone thinks i have recovered after not seeing him in 8 years bit in reality it breaks me more and more... Im sorry if this has been a confusing text to read... Im just so done
