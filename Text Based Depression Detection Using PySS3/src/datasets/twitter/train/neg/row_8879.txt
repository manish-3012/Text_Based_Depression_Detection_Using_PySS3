M, 45, single, unemployed, wondering "why not?"I'm a 45 y.o. male, USA, single, unemployed.  I attempted suicide four years ago via insulin OD, but was obviously unsuccessful (as I have been in almost every aspect of my life).   I am sick of looking for a "light at the end of the tunnel" that never shows up, or if it does, turns out to be me just fooling myself.

The woman I think I love told me today that I should just go ahead, because I'm "so pathetic".   Last night she told me the only reason she is even my friend is because she "feels sorry for me".   She's got issues of her own and I think she is sick of my depression bringing her down.

I have been unemployed for over a year and a half, I've gotten a couple of jobs but was unable to keep them for very long, so I'm broke and collecting food stamps (unemployment ran out a long time ago).

I'm an ex-junkie, and lately I've been thinking about getting back on dope just for the psychic pain relief, but I couldn't afford it if I wanted to.

I've researched some suicide methods and have picked one that I think will work.  My birthday is on Monday, and I don't want to go through another year of this bullshit.   I'm so far down that I don't know where to begin changing my life circumstances even if I thought it weren't futile in my case.

So what do you think?

Tl; DR    I'm fucked financially, have no prospects, no friends I can talk to, and no where to go.  I'm wondering "why not kill myself?"
