I Canâ€™t Do This AnymoreMy life has been so shitty for such a long time and I just canâ€™t deal with it. Iâ€™m only 17.5 but yet Iâ€™ve gone through more than some adults that I know. I lost my mom/best friend around 7 months ago. I have a father who isnâ€™t exactly in my life (he works night shifts and heâ€™s very emotionally distant although I know he cares; I just canâ€™t really talk with him about personal stuff along with the fact that he was always working in my childhood). I just try to move on and accept my moms passing but I just canâ€™t; I miss her too fucking much. Sheâ€™s the one that took care of me and was everything to me. She was truly the only person who mattered to me; if she told me to do something, I would do it no questions asked. Iâ€™ve been dealing with on and off depression for the past 3 years or so. Taking care of my mom the prior 2 years to her passing really weighed its toll on me mentally. Iâ€™ve been in such a bad mindset for the longest and no matter what I do to get out of it nothing works. I go out everyday surrounded by friends and I still feel the same way at the end of the day. I want to kill myself so badly. These past couple of weeks all I keep thinking about is jumping off of a building and just ending it all. Sure their are positives in my life but they just arenâ€™t enough. I think tomorrowâ€™s the night Iâ€™ll do it honestly, unless I somehow end up going to the hospital which is unlikely.
