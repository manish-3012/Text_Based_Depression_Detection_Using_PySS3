I have just had enoughSame old sob story you have probably all heard 1000 times.

Broken heart.

All I ever wanted was to make him happy. Why couldn't he just stick by me a little bit longer? Everyone leaves. He was the only one I had left and he's gone. He was the only person who understood me, him and my dog..and now they are both gone. 

I want to move on. I would love nothing more than that right now. But this pain is fucking excruciating. I have nothing to give but love. It isn't enough. Why can't it be enough? 

I had hope, but he took it with him when he left. I don't know how to get it back It feels impossible.
