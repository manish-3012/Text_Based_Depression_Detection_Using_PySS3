Scaring myselfIt's gotten to the point of my thoughts being so dark that they scare me into a panic attack. I'm so sick of being scared of everything, which now includes myself I guess. I want to be able to leave my house, I haven't seen my friends since before Christmas and they're starting to forget about me. I have counselling once a week but it feels like all I do in between is wait for the next session. I can't live like this any more but I don't know what to do.
