Need some motviationToday I just got stood up, now don't worry im not gonna kill myself over being stood up by some random girl on tinder. Infact I usually make effort to dm people on this forum to help motivate them not kill themselves. So it would be kinda hypocritical of me to want to kill myself. However I have been feeling awful for the last couples months with alot of horrible things happening in my life. The one thing that kept me sane and in check was this girl I was talking to for the last few weeks. Now that i got stood up by her its kinda pushing me towards my limits that I think I can handle. Dont know if anyone has ever been stood up but you feel worthless when it happens. I was just hoping I could hear some words of motivation.
