Sex slave is all ill ever be.Posting on a throwaway to not worry the little people that actually give a fuck about me. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8n78oc/raped_for_over_10_years_and_forced_to_lie_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) is my story. 

I'm always helping everyone else and hiding my reality. Fuck fuck I need help. My life is always waiting on the next panic attack, fast, black out, intrusive thought, suicidal thought. Romantic partners always use me. I cant tell whose lying and whose not. Who isnt trying to use me for the next level up in their priveldged lives. This isn't living. I will get the courage to off myself one way or another. Im staying with a friend but it won't last forever. I'll take myself to the prettiest lake and dispose of myself like the waste that I am :)
