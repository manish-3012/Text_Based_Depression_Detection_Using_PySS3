Something wrong with my faceBasically the biggest obstacle of my own adult life has been my own face. I can rarely get it to look normal/not unhappy. I have all kinds of weird tensions and it moves weird, when I think about it I just see weird floating objects. Nothing seems to make sense about my face. I have the energy to do other things but Iâ€™ve had to shut down about a million opportunities because I just know Iâ€™ll look weird and off\-putting to others. This is the main reason Iâ€™m sick of life/being alive.Â 

Girls are just kind of out of the question, for now. Thereâ€™s always hope things could change and get better I guess. But for about a year now Iâ€™ve wanted to go see this girl but I canâ€™t only because my face \(my whole body I guess really needs a lot of work, but mainly my face\). Iâ€™ve tried exercising, eating better, stretching, living in a different place, making music, learning some new stuff, psychedelics, even had a little girlfriend for a while to prove I could do it/act normal, a lot of self\-care, staring at my face for hours, meditation, even a form of therapy.Â 

Iâ€™m just sick of seeing myself. Hearing myself. Being myself. Putting people off wherever I go it seems like. Iâ€™m an outcast pretty much and I pretty much feel like killing myself lately. Iâ€™m just tired of feeling numb and looking like a freak and not being able to do things I want to because of how fucked I look.Â
