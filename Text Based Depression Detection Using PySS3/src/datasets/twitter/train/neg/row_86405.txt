Suicidal thoughts due to mold exposure?Hello here's some insight on my situation.
We live in a 2 story house (basement and main level), there's my mom, and my 3 brothers one of which has a pregnant gf. 
Mom has kidney cancer at 46 and sclerosis and she has the only income. Right there that's big no no having someone with weakened immune system and a pregnant woman. We can't move because where will we go to? My mom got approved for $50,000 in repairs but I know that won't cover it, as with one problem there's 10 more. 
Anyways my skin burns from time to time, heavy chest, irritation in throat and thoughts. 
Seriously, if it wasn't for my mom I would commit.
