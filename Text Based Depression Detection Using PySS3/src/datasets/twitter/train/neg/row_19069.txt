Giving up.I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve been planning for months and hoping for things to get better but it just gets worse and worse. Canâ€™t land a job anywhere and still in debt at school. Parents think Iâ€™m a failure and I lost all my friends from anxiety. The only people that talk to me are these guys who want to take classes with me only for me to tutor them for free or some shit and itâ€™s annoying how they get to have fun and brag about what they did their weekends and stuff while I sit at home all day applying for jobs and studying. I donâ€™t know what to do.
