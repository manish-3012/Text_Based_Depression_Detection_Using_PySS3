lostI tried to kill myself back in 2014 which didn't work so I decided not to try again and figured out I might be depressed. I told my mom, she laughed at me, said I was pathetic. I found a psychologist, she told me I suffer from depression and social anxiety. I told my mom, she didn't allow me to take meds. I refused to go see a psychiatrist even though the psychologist wanted me to but my mom was against it and I didn't want to disappoint her. The psychologist told me she didn't know what to do with me after a few months so I stopped seeing her. 
It got worse, I can't get out of bed and have like zero motivation to do anything. I'm scared to go to school, teachers keep giving me shit for being 'sick' too often but I'm scared of oral examination because teachers yell at you and they try to make you feel like shit in front of the whole class. 
My parents like to beat and yell at their kids and I really wanna take care of my baby brother and become his legal guardian but that probably won't happen.
Life just sucks and I have no idea what to do, I want it all to end.
