Why do people stop others from killing themselves or guilt trip other people when they let the suicidal person die?I really want to know why. Please don't say that "life is good" and that "you can always find hope". Because it's not the case for everyone. Some people suffer their entire life no matter how much support they have, some people can't afford/get the help they need and some people just can't find it in themselves.Help is not reachable for everyone and even at times, it can not work. And for the 'life is good even though it has its ups and downs', no life is different for everyone.Sometimes life can have more ups than downs for some people and sometimes it has more downs than its ups for some people.Sometimes the 'downs' are more stronger than the 'ups'.Sometimes the 'ups' aren't enough for you to hold on.Sometimes they are. So, i'm asking: is it better to let someone kill themselves or is it better to force someone to live a life that they don't want to live and make them suffer even more? Some people are just lost causes.No matter how much support they have in their hands, sometimes they just can't find the motivation to get better in thenmselves and there is NOTHING no one can do to 'cure' them. Sometimes the only way is to kill themselves.
