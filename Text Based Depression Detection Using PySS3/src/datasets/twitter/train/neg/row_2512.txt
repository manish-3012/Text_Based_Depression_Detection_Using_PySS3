Hello there. I need some help or advice or just anything.As of right now, I am really struggling. I was made redundant, I lost my job and havenâ€™t been able to get another one. Iâ€™ve been applying for weeks now and I know sooner or later that my money is going to run out, I wonâ€™t be able to afford dog food, car insurance. I donâ€™t know what to do. I have horrible thoughts. Thoughts that make me think that maybe what Iâ€™m thinking is for the best. But I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m getting closer and closer to the edge.
