I'm so fucking scared man.I don't know what to do. I can't get any sleep at night and I'm distracted all day. My girlfriend (17) and I (16) had unprotected sex because the condom wasn't fitting well. I pulled out and I don't even think I got precum in her. But I'm so scared that she's pregnant and I'm more ready to die than to be a father. I can't be a dad yet! It'll be weeks upon weeks of agonizing wait until we would know for sure because she can't get access to Plan B and it's already almost too late. I can't raise a family and I think her family and my family would end up hating me forever. I wish I had stayed a virgin. Incels, you don't know how lucky you have it.
