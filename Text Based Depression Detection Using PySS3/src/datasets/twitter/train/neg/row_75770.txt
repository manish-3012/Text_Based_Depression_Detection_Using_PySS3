I'm So BrokenThe love of my life committed suicide 25 days ago. 

I can't bear the hurt any longer. The pain doesn't stop. I don't even recognize who I am anymore.

I think about ending my own life so often. I just want all of this darkness to go away. 

I left a note in my bedroom. I've got a rope, and I'm going to see him soon.
