I've been in school for a month and haven't done any schoolwork because none of it makes any sense. All the laundry is just constantly piled up no matter how much I do, I feel like everyone around me hates me and wants me gone. I just want to die.I'm never going to get this fucking degree

I'll always be a pathetic failure
