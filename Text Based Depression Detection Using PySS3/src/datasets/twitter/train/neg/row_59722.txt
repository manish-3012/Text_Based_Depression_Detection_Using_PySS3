Iâ€™m tired of livingIâ€™m tired of living. Every second Iâ€™m not busy doing something im hating myself. I barely can even sleep anymore. I just want this to end. I miss my old father, I miss my old mother when they didnâ€™t hate me for being a sad piece of shit all the time and failing at everything. Every year this happens and it needs to end sometime soon. I had a bit of a mental break a while ago and I canâ€™t go through that again.
