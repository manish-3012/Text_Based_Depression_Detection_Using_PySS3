I tried changing it all. I still want to dieI don't know. Maybe I am just not supposed to be alive. I can't see any way that I can ever be happy. I am stuck in a hole. 

I keep fucking everything up. I used to be smart. I really did. And now all I do is suck. At everything. I can't find a win.

I just want to die. That's all I want. It's all I think about. Several times an hour. It's all I do. I just wish I wasn't here anymore.
