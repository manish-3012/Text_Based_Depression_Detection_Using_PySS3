It breaks my heart how some people donâ€™t understand anxiety and depression.Yesterday I had a terrible day and today Iâ€™m worse. I saw two things that triggered my anxiety and Iâ€™m literally clinging to life. Iâ€™m thinking more and more about suicide to the point where I think Iâ€™m very close to finally doing it. I just have so much pressure. I deal with these thoughts 24/7 I cry at night Iâ€™m extremely depressed.  

And then I hear my mom talking on the phone to my older brother and the asshole (sorry there are just no other words to describe him) tells my mom that Iâ€™m doing nothing with my life. Heâ€™s basically saying that Iâ€™m good for nothing. Thank you, thatâ€™s all I needed to hear to feel better. He literally just encouraged me more to kill myself. If only he knew how much suffering Iâ€™ve been through. If only people understood what it feels like.
