No self worth, wide has crushed meSo after 11 years of me being disappointed with our sex life, my wife told me she has never been sexually attracted to me.

Over the years she's had reasons for not wanting sex, but everytime those reasons are resolved she adds more reasons. This isn't about just having an orgasm, it's about a lack of connection.

Anyway I'm completely reliant on her financially as my mental health deteriorated over the years.

I've got nothing left. 

Death greets me warm, now I will just say good bye
