I hate that I have to continue to wear a mask because I'm so sad on the other side of itI have been unhappy for a long time for as long as I can remember I can openly admit to the things that I have issues with because I do know myself I have father issues witch means I have always looked for comfort in the wrong places and 6years ago I thought that I was finally going to be happy I was pregnant and glowing and 9months in to it I had a still born and it really sent me into deep depression and I really was out of control for a while after that I just threw myself in to working a lot I really wana die but my mother is the only thing that keeps me going other than that if I loose her I don't know wat will happen to me I don't have any thing to live for except for her
