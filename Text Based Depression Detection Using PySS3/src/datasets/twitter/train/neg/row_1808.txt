I'm afraid.I feel like killing myself. I'm terrified of death though, and the pain. But I would do anything to escape this feeling I get, like its already over. I'm tired. I think all I need is one more thing, one more push to send me over the edge. To make the fear of death less frightening than living with myself for one more second. I've been trying as best I can to get better, with therapy and medication, but nothing is helping. It feels hopeless, I feel worthless. I feel too much, and too little. I don't know if i'm making any sense.
