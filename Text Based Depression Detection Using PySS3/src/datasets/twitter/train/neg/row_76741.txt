Dear stranger, why would you save someone like me?I'm making plans now. Slowly deleting folks who talk to me because they don't need someone as toxic as me to pollute their lives. Family... Never mind about them, I don't need to tell them anything. And I'm also sorry for sullying your life with my presence. 

But stranger(s), I would like to know whether I deserve to be alive. In more than 10 years of my struggle with myself, I think, at the end of the day, what my ex boss implied is right -- I'm an ungrateful and lazy piece of shit not worthy of anyone's attention.

I have a roof over my head, I have a university degree but I still cannot overcome those which cause me pain. For every improvement I make I fail twice more. 

So, why should I live? I'm not worth the privilege of being alive. I should be dead. I just need to find the quietest way possible of killing myself.
