My life has hit a new lowHere's a quick rundown of me and what's been happening lately.

- I'm gay, not out to any family. I'm to anxious to tell anyone and the thought of it scares me. I've known for a few years.
- I've come out of a long term relationship only to find out I've been cheated on during the end of it. I've lost interest and trust in other people
- My studies aren't going well. I'm dyslexic and due to be tested for ADHD. Constantly being labelled by tutors and facing threats to be kicked out. 
- I suffer from anxiety, which is typically health anxiety but also generalized anxiety. Day to day things involving communicating with others is a challenge and it's getting worse. 
- Things I enjoyed doing last year feel mundane and boring today. I've lost most interest in things I enjoyed. 
- My "friends" have no future prospects and would rather take drugs and have no focus on their future. People I want to be friends with don't accept me. Usually sexuality based including people who I saw as friends. 

There's so much more to this but I can't continue. Years of this shit and I've had enough. 

All this has been draining the life out of me. It's horrible. I've been trying to smile through it for ages but I'm giving up. I smoke because I want to die. Knowing that I can enjoy myself and bring myself closer and closer to the end is what drives me to not quit. I feel as if my future is heading for a dead end where I will have no escape from hell. I can't even tell my family how I feel because I cannot open up. I opened up and told one of my (good) friends everything and was on the verge of bursting into tears. Just typing this has got me to this point. 

Some days I feel like that if there was an easy, painless and quick method to end it all I'd be first in line. No hesitation. 

Worst part is I'm 17. 

I can't speak to doctors because of an ongoing phobia of anything medical-related which started when I was young. 

I need to fix this or I'm going to fall into a dark dark place
