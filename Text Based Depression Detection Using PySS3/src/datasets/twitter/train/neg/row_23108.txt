All Depression Wants To Do Is Get You In A Room Alone And Kill YouI have MDD and I'm so tired of it. Constantly feeling alone and like a burden to anyone I interact with. Sitting here day after day with disabilities so I can't work. Money is non-existent. I have to live with someone I don't even like (roommate) to pay the rent. This is no life. Depression is going to win this one.
