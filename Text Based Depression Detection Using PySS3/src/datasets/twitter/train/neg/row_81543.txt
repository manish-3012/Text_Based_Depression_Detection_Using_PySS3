Fuck everything.It's not fair. I should be celebrating today. Instead I'm here. I don't want to be here and I don't want to feel like this and I think it's worse cuz I'm on a lower dosage of medication in order to get off this one and start on another. I'm so fucking tired. I'm so done. I don't like this. I just want a break ... I wish I could just take a break.
