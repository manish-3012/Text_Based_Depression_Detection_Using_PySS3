Super sickI've been extremely sick for years and nobody seems to be able to figure out how to fix it.  I have dozens of debilitating symptoms and each day honestly feels like the worst day of my life. I've spent half of my twenties living at my parents house because I can't work or even really travel. What's worse, the current leading theory across the many doctors I've seen is that I have an illness that's subject to medical controversy, so I can't get disability and I feel ashamed to even bring it up. I'm miserable, every day is a gauntlet, and there's no end in sight. I just get to be tortured in this house and watch the world get older without me while my aging parents struggle to support me. I'm in agony and nobody knows how to make it stop. There is zero cause for optimism. I don't want to hurt the people around me, especially since my parents are religious and would be even more distraught to think that their adult kid is in Hell for killing himself. I just feel like the entire weight of the world is crushing me and nobody is benefiting from suffering. I've been here for years, so most of my friends and family have moved away and moved on. My torture is anonymous and meritless. It's a deathtrap and there's no way out.
