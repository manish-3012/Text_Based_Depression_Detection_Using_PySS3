My mother refuses to buy things for meI own a pet rabbit and I was really excited to go out into town and buy her things today. She doesn't have many toys and I can tell she gets bored sometimes, and we don't have many things to give her to play with. I wanted to go out in town and buy things for her, but I was with my mom, and she wasn't very happy with wanting to spend a little more than 50 dollars. I was hoping to buy quite a few things because I don't have many things for her right now, and as I was getting more and more items, my mom kept telling me to put things back, because she was so upset that I wanted to spend a little more than what she was comfortable with. (I offered to pay for things since I have a job). My mom eventually just stormed out of the store and left me to put three things back. I bawled my eyes out the whole time. People stared. The cashier stared as I ran out of the store and to my mom. I was tempted to just... run, and not turn back, and leave her. I hate being near her. I fucking hate standing close to her. She doesn't love me and I can feel it.

I'm scared my rabbit won't be happy anymore and won't like me. I'm scared my rabbit will die early because my mom doesn't want me to pay for things for her. I really need help. I want to run away.
