I failedI'm such a dumb fuck that I didn't take into account how low the ceiling beams in my house are. I set everything up and realized that it wouldn't work but I still tried and all that happened was me feeling like a huge idiot. My neck is sore and it kinda hurts to swallow but I'm, unfortunately, still here.

It was kind of surreal going to my parent's house right after and everything being so normal. I could have been dead but instead I had dinner with my family like nothing had happened and then everyone just went on with their day.

I could tell my mom. She'd freak out and get mad (she takes my depression personally for some reason) but she'd take me to the hospital and maybe they would lock me up until I stopped wanting to kill myself. I'm kind of a coward, though, so I don't think I can face her right now. I don't know what to do.

It's almost 1:00 a.m. here so I'm going to sleep. Here's hoping I don't wake up in the morning.
