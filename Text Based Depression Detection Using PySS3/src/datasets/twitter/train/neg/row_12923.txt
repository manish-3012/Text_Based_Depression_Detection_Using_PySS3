One more day or not.I have to go to work tonight, and I know how dumb this is going to sound but I'd seriously rather kill myself. Not working and being alive just isn't an option, but the thought of going back to that barely above minimum wage job which I'm completely stuck at sounds WORSE than dying. I can't be a burden on people whether that be my family or society through unemployment/wellfare. Just not going to fucking happen..I owe money and I've already dropped out of college. If I'm not working I can't be alive, but THIS IS FUCKING IT UNTIL THE END. There is nothing left to look forward to. Just a grind until I die. There's nothing waiting for me when I get home but an empty basement apartment and broken dreams. No family, no friends, nothing. I love reading, writing and art but I don't even have the energy for any of it anymore. I come home and just lay there until I fall asleep, and if I can't fall asleep I'm still too drained to do anything but just lay there until I have to get up and do it again.

There is literally no point to my existence. Gotta be there in 5 hours. I don't think I'll make it.
