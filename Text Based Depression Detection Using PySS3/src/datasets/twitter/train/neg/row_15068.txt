(17F) A logical reason to kill myself.I have been considering attempting suicide again and I decided to take a more logical approach. Please bear with me. 

Today I am 17 years, 9 months, and 16 days old. Of those years, I only remember about 13 years (156 months) which completely normal. The average person lives 27,375 days, I have lived 6,498 days so admittedly, I have barely started.  As I reflect on my 13 years of conscious memories, I see that I have been unhappy for most of a majority of it. 

On average, I believe I have been okay(in other words, ranging from happy to merely alright) 3 months of each year. Of course those 3 months were are scattered among the not okay (ranging from depressed and suicidal to just unhappy) 9 months. 

To paint a better picture, here are some rough numbers of the my 13 years in which I can definitively account for. Feel free to skip over this. 

Okay 
Years: 3.25
Months: 39
Weeks: 169.464
Days: 1186.25
Hours: 2870

Not okay
Years: 9.75
Months: 117
Weeks: 508.39
Days: 3558.75
Hours: 85410.1

If any of math is wrong, please keep in mind I was very upset while doing this.

Basically, my point is life does not seem worth it. It has been hell and I see no indication of change.

I am 77 days from 18th birthday and I will make it. Next Wednesday, I am going to kill myself. I will be found on a Thursday and be diagnosed dead on the same day I came into this world. 

I've have endured years abused, watched people I live die, and lost all my friends. I think I am deserve some peace. I don't remember doing anything so bad to deserve this but hopefully my life is enough. 

I've decided I will do it unless i have one more good day before Wednesday. I've only good day this year and it is the only way I can endured more 77 days. 

Not just a day where I don't cry or feel devastated. I am talking a really day. A day where I truly smile and laugh. A day where someone hugs me. I don't remember the last time I was hugged or even touched by another person. Well, that wasn't a hit. I'm talking a touch of comfort or friendship. A day where I am not alone and I can actually have a reason to talk. A day where I am heard. If I get one more of joy, I will endure.
