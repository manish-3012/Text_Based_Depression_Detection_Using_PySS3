When should I stop lying to my doctor about having suicidal thoughts?I want to be this in the beginning as I might be breaking the rules: I am in no way a danger to myself or others. 

Now that's been said ill explain my situation. I work in a career field where I need to visit a doctor at least once every couple of months. On the questionnaire before I go into the appointment, it asks if I have had suicidal thoughts. I always answer no because if I put yes, I am on the fast track to losing my job which is not acceptable.

The reason I said I am not a danger to myself is because I don't want to kill myself. The impact it would have on my family would be devastating and it would have a very negatively influence the future of my children. On the flip side, I am very ok with dying and kind of want it. I feel like I have lived a very full and meaningful life. I have experience things most people never get to. I have travel across the world, seen things people dream about and seen many other cultures. I have reproduced so my genes will continue on, and I got to love another and be loved back. Continuing on feels meaningless because I've already done so much. I do think about killing myself (If I do kill myself, how would I do it/how much would it impact others) and just death in general. 

So my general question is when should I stop lying to my doctor about having suicidal thoughts? Or should I even stop? Like I said earlier, if I do finally admit to having these thoughts, I will lose my job in a hurry and I dont know how I would support my family without a job and dealing with the repercussions of telling everyone about my suicidal thoughts (therapy, support groups, medication). Especially if I'm not considering ending my life at this time. The real concern is I dont know when that end.
