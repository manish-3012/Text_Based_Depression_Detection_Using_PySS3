KimberlyI cheated on my wife. I was drunk, but thatâ€™s no excuse. Drunk drivers donâ€™t get off with a warning. I did the worst thing Iâ€™ve ever done to the most beautiful person, my best friend. She was brave enough to stay with me afterwards. I didnâ€™t deserve her. Things got hard, and with the complete lack of trust that follows infidelity, she opted out. I canâ€™t blame her. I just wish I could have been better. I wish I could have upheld my vows. I canâ€™t be with another woman without thinking of her. I canâ€™t be with my own family without thinking she should be there with me, and that I should be with hers. I hate myself. I hate what Iâ€™ve done to the best thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me. I refuse to go on, leaving more broken beautiful people in my wake. 

Kimberly, Iâ€™m sorry. I love you still, and I donâ€™t want to hurt you again. I know that if I live another day, itâ€™ll be in an effort to come to you and beg you to take me back. We both know thatâ€™ll lead to more pain, since thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m capable of doing. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll do it, but I live on a pretty high building and Iâ€™ve always been fond of skydiving.... no matter how I go, Iâ€™ll be holding the letter you wrote me the day you married me. You were the best thing. Not just in my life, but in the world. I wish you the best and to whomever loves her next, do so with all you are. I hope you die in her arms, at a ripe old age, smiles on both your faces.
