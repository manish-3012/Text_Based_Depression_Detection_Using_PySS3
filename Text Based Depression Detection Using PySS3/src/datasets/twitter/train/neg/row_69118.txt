Is it possible to avoid your death being broadcast on local news?I'm in the UK and typically every death gets reported in local news. Be it suicidal or traffic incident

I'm very unimportant and so when i commit the deed, I really don't want it to be broadcasted on local news. For everyone to view. 

I don't want it like "boy, 19 found dead in woods...click to read more" 

If anyone knows anything, that'll help! Thanks.
