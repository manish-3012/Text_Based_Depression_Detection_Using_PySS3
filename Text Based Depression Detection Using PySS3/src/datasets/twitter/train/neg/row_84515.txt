Don't bother commenting on this thread.Nothing you say is going to change anything. I'm just using this as a forum to vent. 

I'm going to kill myself. I've decided that it's going to happen. I'm not sure when or how, but it will be soon. Unless some miraculous change occurs in my life sometime soon, which is incredibly doubtful, I'm outta here. I just want to leave an impression. 

I'm sick of this world. I'm sick of the pain and loneliness. Maybe I am selfish and a coward for wanting to take the "easy" way out, but that's better than living in misery. If I'm such a terrible person, a selfish coward, then maybe I don't deserve to live. 

It amazes me how people don't start showing compassion for others until they think they're going to die. Show them that kindness and caring all the time. You can feel love and compassion for strangers. You don't have to know someone personally to care about them. Remember that. 

Why can't people just accept that maybe some of us are destined for this? I am not a strong enough person to survive. I have accepted that. Why can't anyone else?
