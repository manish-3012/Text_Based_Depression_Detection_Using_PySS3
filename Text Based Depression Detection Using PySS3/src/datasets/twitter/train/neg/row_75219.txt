What did I doWhat did I do to deserve these thoughts constantly running rampant in my mind? I had a good day today with my family, but I still just want to end my life at the end of the day. My life is in a good spot too, things are great with my family, girlfriend, high school, etc. Why canâ€™t I ever just be happy? I donâ€™t know what I did that was so bad to where I would never be happy again. I think Iâ€™ve been a good person in my life but I obviously did some things wrong. I want to just end it all right now.
