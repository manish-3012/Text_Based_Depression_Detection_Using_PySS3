People say that committing suicide is selfish. But isn't telling someone not to commit suicide just as selfish?I have been thinking seriously about suicide for a while now. The only reason I havent done it, the one reason that I might not, is because I don't want to hurt the people who love me.
I've had two people in my life commit suicide, a friend and an ex. Both affected me deeply even though one of them I barely spoke to anymore. 
I don't want to hurt the people I love by putting them through that. But I also don't know if I can stay alive for them. Its a handful of friends and family, and generally they don't have a lot of time for me. I'm not berating them for that at all, but staying alive for people that I only talk to/see every now and then is really hard work. I have severe depression, and am alone for maybe 80% of the time. Not for want of trying, they just have busy lives and i dont expect them to make time for me all of the time, I dont doubt that they love me.
So that is the only reason i have for not killing myself. Every day I struggle to find a reason to stay alive and that feeling is just awful. Every day I look up new ways of how to deal with this kind of suffocating depression and none of it works. I would be fully content to end my life if it wasnt for risk of hurting people. But thats a difficult thing to hold on to when every day hurts me so much. 
So i guess I just want to know why I should stay alive against my will. 
FYI I'm not looking for pity or anything like that, I'm genuinely curious to find out some reasons for living a life that I'm done with and opinions on why its OK to tell someone that suicide is not an option when it should be: my life, my body, my decision. 
Stuff like "it will get better"- thanks but no thanks.
