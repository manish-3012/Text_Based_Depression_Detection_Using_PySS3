DisgustedI am almost at my wit's end. So today my mother went to a wedding reception and I asked her if she could make me a plate of food. She did, for my brother and cousin only. I had her left overs. Not only did I get her left overs, but I got that plus a cockroach, four actually. I told her I lost my appetite yet she forced me to eat it. She got mad and said I'm ungrateful.

 It's fucked up because I can remember being young and forced to eat food even if it had an insect/insects in them. I was told the saying "It'll only go out one way anyways." I was only fucking 8 and this method was enforced even til now. (I'm 21 now.) I just want to end it all now. How long will I have to deal with the constant images that flow through my mind of my past trauma.... fuck
