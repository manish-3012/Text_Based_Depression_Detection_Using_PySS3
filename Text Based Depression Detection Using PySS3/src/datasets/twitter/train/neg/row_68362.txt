got called selfish for considering suicide (again)When people don't know the battles you fight in your head all the time it's easy for them to say suicide is the cowardly way out. For me, it's a way to escape all the terrible things in my life like my mental issues, my lack of friends and the body I hate so much. I'm hurting all the time and I feel like I'm dying. I don't want to be here anymore and I'm sick of being called selfish when I'm not at allâ€”I'm just sad.
