I lost the last thread of hope I had. Time to say goodbye.The bipolar and depression and loneliness are too much. My wife  told me she wants a divorce. I'm going to drink a cup of coffee and eat every pill I can find. Honestly idk why I'm posting here. I guess because I've read so many posts and they've helped me cope until now. But I have nothing left and just want to end it. I thought about my shotgun and carbon monoxide but honestly I want to suffer some more.its been so long so my pain meant anything, y'all.at least this time it will. 

I want to say to everyone who like me has spent time reading posts here to keep it together...do better than I did. Don't let the silence and emptiness destroy you. I hope you don't end up a failure like me. 

If I stay coherent I'll try to update. Maybe someone will get what they need from it.
