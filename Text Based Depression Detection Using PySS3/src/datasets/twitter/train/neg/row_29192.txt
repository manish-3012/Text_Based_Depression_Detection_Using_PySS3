I'm ready to end it for goodI'm 26, I have really bad social anxiety and the conversation skills of a toddler.  
Never had any friends, relationships and will never be liked by anyone.   
This is my main problem in life but things have being going to shit lately. 

I lost my savings in the stock market, got fired from my job, moved back in with my parents.   
Some guy scammed me, reversed a big payment and the bank tanked my credit to 500 because of it.  
I got no way to repay my debts, so i just ignore the calls. 

I'm screwed, i couldn't even get a cellphone plan, let alone a place to live with a credit like that.   
I've spent many months in psychiatric hospitals for suicide attempts in the past, been given all the resources available yet, nothing is remotely helpful. 

I'm not afraid of dying, last time i hung myself it felt amazing, but sadly the noose broke before i died.  
I think this is it for me, there has always been a silver lining in the past but now there's none, i'm 100% fucked.
