I don't know if I'm allowed to post this here but oh wellMy girlfriend broke up with me today and she was the one thing that made me feel like I matter or that im important. And I know it's all my fault that she left me. But I just really so bad right now just want to jump out my window so I don't hurt her anymore. I just want to hold her in my arms and tell her I'm sorry but I can't. It is so hard for me right now to try not to end it
