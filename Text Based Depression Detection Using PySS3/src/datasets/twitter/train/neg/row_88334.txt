I'm doneHello, I've posted on r/abuse about my mother and her abusing me physically, mentally and emotionally. 
And I can't take it any more. I've tried to commit suicide twice in the past few years and i developed a strong habit of selfharm. I can't take it any longer, I'm constantly crying and I can't go to school anymore, because I'm afraid they'll see my scars and mock me for that and i feel like I'm worthless and useless when i step into that institution. I desperately want to die now and i feel like both my abuser and the rest of my family will be happy.
