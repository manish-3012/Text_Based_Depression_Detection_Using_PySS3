Iâ€™m really sorry to everyone and Iâ€™m just really selfish but I really want to end itWhatâ€™s the point if Iâ€™m anxious 24/7? Thereâ€™s a limit to how much I can take. Iâ€™ve already failed and I think I should just go but I donâ€™t think I have the courage to. I canâ€™t talk this out because I feel like I am attention seeking and selfish. Why did I become like this? I want to be happy again. I have college and my life has to go  on but it canâ€™t because I just canâ€™t seem to function like a basic human does because Iâ€™m always so anxious. Iâ€™m trying so hard to hide that fact but it always comes the wrong way.
