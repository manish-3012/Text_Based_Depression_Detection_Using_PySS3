Thinking of ending it tonight after I found out another of his liesJust coming out of an abusive relationship with a narcissistic cheat and compulsive liar. Been emotionally abused and manipulated in everyday. Gas lighted to an extreme level. I am scheduled for surgery. Physically ill. In a lot of physical pain. I discovered another lie while I am at the hospital because I was about to give in and let him come to see me. I had a thought to check something and it turned out he was trying to hide his online activity to cheat on me easily.

I am thinking that before my surgery tonight, I should just kill myself. I feel like life isn't worth it. I have been abused so badly for the past 11 months by this man that I feel like only death can cure me.
