Out of ideas and optionsHello reddit friends. I write this to you in the hopes that someone will hear and help. Have you ever been down and out? Do you ever feel that the stress us just too much? What does being the good guy get you? Lately theses are the thoughts going through my head, along with many others. I have chosen a career path that has seen me advance and then also get pushed back very far. As such it has changed how I view things. I've stuck around at the job because I need the money, even though I am making much less. It's made me feel as though I am a failure as a man, a boyfriend, and a son. I've been trying to get help mentally and I've been trying for a long time to get a new job. I've had a couple of opertunities yet they are all even less than I can do now. Less hours, and just minimum wage. As a 28 year old I have dreams and aspirations. I'd love to get married and have a family with girlfriend. But with nothing to do it, I feel as though I am even more a failure. How can I do more than just scrape by? Does it get better? Can it get better? I'm about to declare bankruptcy and lose everything. That scares me so much. Then I think about a short drop and a sudden stop and all this disappears. A short term of stress and then it's that. Just that.
