I need adviceI (17m) been having off and on suicidal thoughts for the past 5 years of my life. My girlfriend (16f) has told me that my suicidal thoughts have gotten in the way of our relationship some and wants me to talk to my therapist about it. Iâ€™m terrified of taking to my therapist about my thoughts in fear of my parents finding out or being put into a hospital of any kind. I donâ€™t know how reasonable those fears are and as terrified as I am of talking to my therapist I need my girlfriend. Please send advice.
