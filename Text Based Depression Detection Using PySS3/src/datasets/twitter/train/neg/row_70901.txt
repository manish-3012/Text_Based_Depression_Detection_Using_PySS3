Having very severe depressive episodes over my chronic disfiguring illness...Hello, I'm just having a very very bad depressive episode right now over something I've been struggling with for a few years now. I have a disfiguring disease that causes tumors to grow in my skin all over my arms, legs, and torso. I'm constantly experiencing very severe depressive episodes, panic attacks, and hopeless thoughts. Can anybody please give me any advice on how I can cope with this? I've really been struggling alone for so long and it's really hurting me now more than ever.

I guess what I'm asking is, how can I make peace with the fact I'm going to slowly be more and more disfigured as life goes on and the disease progresses? How can I be happy again with that shadow constantly hanging over me? Is there anybody else out there that lives with a disfiguring disease? Thank you all very much for any advice.
