worried about myselfIâ€™ve had pretty consistent passive suicidal ideation for about three years now, and while there were always times it would take a little dip into active ideation, right now I feel like Iâ€™ve full on thrown myself into it. 

Iâ€™ve got a day planned, how, where, etc. Everything I could think of except for how to communicate w my loved ones that itâ€™s not their fault I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. 

But at the same time, I know theyâ€™ve been worried about me. Iâ€™ve not been around or hanging out and Iâ€™m always sad or smoking pot or just .... I donâ€™t know. 

I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m alive right now, and Iâ€™m ready to go but it really sucks to think they love me and I still want to die. 

I just donâ€™t think I have anything, even them, worth staying for. Nothing brings me joy. Iâ€™ve been on meds for a year, Iâ€™ve been going to therapy, even my long distance boyfriend has been staying with me in person during COVID. I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore. 

But I also feel really bad about it and that part of me is why Iâ€™m reaching out here. Is there any hope for me? Because I canâ€™t find it by myself.
