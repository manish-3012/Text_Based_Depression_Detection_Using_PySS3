Beyond salvationWhilst there is nothing inherently wrong with my sanity, it's been excessively deteriorating and it's withering away with every mental breakdown I endure. My lack of social connections and long history with depression as well as suicidal thoughts have led to an extremely destructive environment in which I've developed my psyche. 

It's been 8 long and grueling years, I no longer have an appropriate sense of self. My true self has since long been buried deep, and the identity manifested through endless tribulation has consumed my being. I'm too far gone. I was diagnosed with psychotic depression 2 years ago when I first attempted suicide, and was put on medication. Happy pills and pointless therapy sessions can never mend my external complications. I'm an introspective person and through many years of contemplation and self reflection I've come to know the ins and outs of my mind, I've no more insight to gain from other people.

I haven't held a proper conversation with anyone for over 4 years now. I'm all alone in this world, my time is nearing it's end. I'm since long ago desensitized to the idea of suicide, and so the only question I never seem to be able to find an answer for is the question of why I'm still here. I guess I'm just hoping for a miracle to come save me.
