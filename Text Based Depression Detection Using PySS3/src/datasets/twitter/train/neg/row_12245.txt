I might do it tonight.I am so sick of living. I literally got yelled at and had things thrown at me for not getting the right pop. i fucked up something so simple. i havent had a single good day this year. everything is weighing down on me. i have nothing to look forward to. I have no reason to live. whats the fucking point of living if i can't  even do a simple task without fucking it up? i hope i dont screw up this next attempt. Ive already tried several times and fucked those up. Im literally so pathetic i can't even kill myself right. Lmao what the fuck. Im so fucking done
