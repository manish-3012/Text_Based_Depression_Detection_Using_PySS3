If I don't get into my dream school, I'm literally going to kill myselfAll my life I've been sacrificing my time and effort (Im raised in an Asian family) towards studies and good grades which have I believe have affected my wellbeing, all for the sake of getting to a good college and a good career. Multiple mental breakdowns that I had to personally cope all by myself as well as the lack of friends and a social life were all the things I threw away in hopes of a much better future. But I feel like all the energy that I put into this dream of my mind will ultimately be wasted if I don't get into the school I've longed to be a part of. The disappointment from my family members, but most importantly, myself, is something I don't want to experience. The depressing, pessimistic side of me knows that it going to happen, that I'm gonna fail either way. I'd rather die than live to see the moment that all my hopes and aspirations crumble and turn into dust in front of me. Probably in some other universe of reality will I be able to live the life that I so often dreamt of. But if it isn't this one, I don't wanna be part of it.
