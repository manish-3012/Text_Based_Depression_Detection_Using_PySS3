Travel for assisted suicide?Is there a country I can travel to that has a legal assisted suicide of some sort? I am terrified of trying something and failing and ending up in a hospital, my worst nightmare. I am a rational middle aged person who has wanted to die since my teens and have no options in life and need the pain and suffering to end before I become homeless due to not being able to make enough money due to not wanting to be alive.
