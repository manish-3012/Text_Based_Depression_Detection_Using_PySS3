Lost once again.Today is different, today I finally cried after sucking it up for many months. Tired of putting up a front, pretending I care, pretending Iâ€™m happy And I ask myself who am I doing this shit for? 
Ainâ€™t nobody care. Iâ€™m a fucking nobody. I no longer got my family or a friend. I donâ€™t see a reason to stick around, but Iâ€™m scared of not succeeding.
