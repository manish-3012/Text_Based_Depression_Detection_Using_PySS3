I'm having an existential crisisIt just makes no sense to me why anyone tries, it is not like anything you ever do will matter. I'm going to die and I'm not going to remember if my life was good or not, so why try for a good one. It doesn't matter when I die because either way I'm dead. I won't know when I died I'll just be dead either way. I want to believe in a god but I'm too much of a skeptic that I can't. I just don't know what I'm going to do I can't even enjoy anything anymore. If I kill my self so what I'll be dead that's how it was going to turn out anyways. Anyone affected by my death will be dead eventually too. I don't know I just don't think I can go on. The crazy thing is that I'm only 16 and I'm already terrified of these things
