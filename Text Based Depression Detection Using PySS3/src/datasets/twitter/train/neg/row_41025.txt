my existence makes everyone miserable. whatâ€™s the point of living.everyone around me is constantly pestering me about my health and well-being but they canâ€™t do jackshit to help me get better. they complain about my horrible social life, they complain about me being a shut in, they complain about how little i eat. 



every time i walk into the room itâ€™s â€œyouâ€™re too skinnyâ€, â€œyou look bleak and horribleâ€, â€œwhen was the last time you left your roomâ€, â€œgo outsideâ€, as if these comments will lift all of the trauma they have created over the past decades. 



if this scorn, this anguish, this anger, this disgust is brought upon by my very existence then it might be beneficial to kill myself so they donâ€™t have to waste their breath lecturing me every time im within a five foot radius of them. 



iâ€™m tired of being a liability and a curse. just leave me alone and let me die in peace
