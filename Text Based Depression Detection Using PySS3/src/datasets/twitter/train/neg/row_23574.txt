A message to the future/past/presentA lot of people think of suicide, for some people they would just love to be gone but when it comes down to it, they are scared to end it.

I also had this issue when it came to the most lethal ways of ending everything, yes I've tried before but I survived with no long term damage, no one knows I've tried

I feel I finally got past the fear of pulling the trigger or whatever it is to end my life, I don't want to be here anymore and I may not be for much longer. There are still things that I want to do before it happens and ill make sure to do them. There's only one thing/person that could change this they will not be named.

I'm finally ready to let go of everything, People think psychical pain is the worse but honestly it is mental pain, it just messes with you and can make you do some dumb things. Truly mental unstableness is the worst thing that can happen to anyone.

Parts of my life have been good, Majority of it hasn't been though, to the future, fuck the future I'm not there yet so why does it matter.
