My girlfriend is suicidal. Help!My gf of about a month (I've known her for years) recently told me that she is depressed and has already been through 2 attempts to end it all. I love her very much and I want to help however I can but she is extremely pessimistic about the future and I simply can't propose an argument to why she shouldn't be. This situation is tearing me apart because I have anxiety and my brain always thinks of the worst case scenario when things don't go smoothly.

Today we found out that her favorite band canceled their visit to our country but they would show up sometime later this year for sure. I told her it's OK, they'll be coming again so when that time comes we'll go together. She started saying things like "who knows what's gonna happen until then" which made me worry too much. So I asked what could possibly happen, but she wouldn't give a straight answer. I then brought up that I'm worried and that resulted in her saying "I'm not going to say anything ever again. I shouldn't have opened up that day at all and I don't want to open up anymore. You already know too much."

How am I supposed to handle this? The whole thing is eating away at me slowly and all I want is her well-being. It should also be noted that we are about 2 hours away by car, which makes things even more difficult because neither of us has a car.
