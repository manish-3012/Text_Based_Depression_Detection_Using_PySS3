Argh, it's a bit strange when you are suicidal even in your dreams.I won't go into detail because it's way 'out there' but a dream had me brought to a suicidal moment earlier today.  Part of me wishes it had continued longer...perhaps then I would have really died as well as committing suicide in the dream.
