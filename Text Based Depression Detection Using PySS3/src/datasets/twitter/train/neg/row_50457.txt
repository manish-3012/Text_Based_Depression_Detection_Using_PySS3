Thanks.You were good company while it lasted. Got a few days till I'm likely homeless, and once I'm living in my car I'm pretty sure I'll quickly have an accident.
Last few months in particular been the worst but for as long as I can remember I've gone to sleep wishing for death and woken up annoyed I'm awake. I tried to resist for family and friends sake but now with about to be kicked out of my house due to rent being almost 4 weeks late, and not having the desire to work to change that it's clear my times come. I could ask for help, have a few times previously, but always just sunk lower, can't keep doing this to people. I'm not sure exactly but I guess I have a week tops before, hopefully, peace at least, in the nothingness.
