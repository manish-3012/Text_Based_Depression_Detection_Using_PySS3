Probably gonna kill myself on holiday.I went on holiday with friends we drink we go out, all of them managed to get dates and i had none, i have no idea how to pickup girls, im feeling extremely alone even tho its 11 of us came, it just reminded me that i gonna die alone. I see no opportunities, of someone offers me some i waste them, i get them very rarely and reality is that all i did during my week stay is drinking. Im so young and already so tired of this fucking life.
