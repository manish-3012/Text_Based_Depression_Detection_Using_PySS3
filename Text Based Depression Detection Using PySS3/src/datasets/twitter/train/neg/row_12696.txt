lost and uncertaini don't want to write too much. it'll just make me sadder than i already am.

my depression is eating me alive. and i can't breathe. and it's really scary. i think about suicide every single day. *i don't want to be alive.* i hate the fact that i exist. i mean nothing to anyone. i have no purpose in life. the world would be a much better place if i was dead. nobody would notice if i was gone, and they wouldn't care if they did. 

it should be easy. i have no other way out, and *yet*â€“

i just don't know what to do.
