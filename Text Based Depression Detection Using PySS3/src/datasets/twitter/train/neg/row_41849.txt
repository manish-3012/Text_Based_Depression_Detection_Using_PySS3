Half of me really wants to buy a gun, and the other half of me knows exactly what I would do with it.Life is proving to be too much work. There's so much you have to do just to survive, and it stopped being fun a long time ago. Why work my ass off when I can't even enjoy the fruits of my labor? I want to get a shotgun. I'd keep it around the house, and one night when I'm brave/drunk enough, I won't have to deal with this anymore.
