I don't know what to do anymoreThe title says it all.

I've been taking medication for 2 years along with therapy: since then, 3 therapists, 4 different antidepressants (not to mention dosage or stabilizers etc) and increasingly suicidal thoughts. I was always problematic but everything became hell when a big friend killed himself.

The main issue is that feeling like shit all the time and being not capable of feeling any kind of pleasure or happiness makes me try to give up. I can't see why I'd still try to live or do anything except for the fear of death - life is such a fucking pain with no actual purpose or significant/valuable entity/phenomenon that I simply can't.

Can't go to work anymore. I've been locked up at home for a week and I want to go out, but I don't know what would make me less shitty out there so... so I am still here. I don't usually cry but the urges to kill me have been so strong that I can't handle the despair and  the sadness to think that I'm so egoistic not to care about my family or that I let my life get on this point.

I need help, but I don't know how. It's not like I'll just get to the hospital and say I'm sick. No one will ever find, for me, a purpose to live for, and I can't either. I don't even know what I'm expecting outta this post but, please, help me.
