Where is the line drawn?How can I be positive? Do I forget it it all? How? How do I forget about the desire to die? How do I ignore it? Is this some pseudo science bullshit? When do I see a doctor? What the fuck do I tell the doctor? "Haha I wanna die lol." What the fuck is gonna happen? Do I just get better? When people wonder why I let our relationships fade away, how will they understand? I sure as hell am not telling the world, but I wish they knew. When will my life turn around? When will I be happy with myself? I'm letting the days waste away. I'm 20. I'm letting it waste away. 

It's absolutely insane how easily it can change. I feel decent in this moment. But what if tomorrow I have a gun to my head? I can't predict what will happen and I sure as hell can't predict how I will respond to it.
