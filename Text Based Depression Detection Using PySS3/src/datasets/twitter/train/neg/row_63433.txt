school just started and i cant really handle thingsthe only reason i havent killed myself is becoase i couldnt do that to my girlfriend. i would feel horrible. she loves me soo much and i love her. but i have struggled with depression since before i met her. now that school has started again i realize i dont really have any friends. also my girlfriend has moved away so i cant see her anymore. 

about an hour ago my mom tried to help me prepae for school. i got so freaked out she was touching the stuff i got today i thought she would mess it up. i ended up screaming. she continued to help me and ended up crying.

i feel horrible becoase i am an awful kid. there is no justifacation for what i do to my mom. i do drugs and treat my whole familly horibly. i feel like i really should just end myself.
