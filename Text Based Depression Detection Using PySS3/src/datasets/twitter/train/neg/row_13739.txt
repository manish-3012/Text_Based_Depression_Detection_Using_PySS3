No more will to liveI'm older, and autistic.  I'll never be normal.  My girlfriend wants to call it off because she says there is no spark.  But nothing has changed as far as I can see.  I always fail at everything.  Anytime I feel good about things something happens to remind me I'm a social retard or a failure.  We put animals that are suffering down. Why can't we do that for people? I look forward to being dead because I won't feel anything.
