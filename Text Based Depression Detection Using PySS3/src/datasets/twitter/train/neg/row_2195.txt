I've created a monster, hell within my head.Greetings to all kind enough to read this

As said in my title i've created a monster, it haunts me it corrupts, it destroys me from the inside and I can't escape it... The solution has become very clear to me in a dream just last night after not sleeping for a week....

The world will not change with my absence, in fact it will be made better... It's a frightening thought when I's surrounded by people who I can't live without, they don't feel the same way I do... 
And so I've decided to finally "wake up" from my horrible dream of a life.... 
Why I'm writing this....I do not know, maybe it's a cry for help....Ridiculous isn't it
