I need help.I have never felt crippling depression as hard as I have since I lost my job in February. Alcohol helped for the first couple of weeks. Then it just became a norm.

Now I hate myself. I have alienated myself from every loved one. I live alone. In the last two days, I have not even left bed. I don't want to hurt myself but I don't know how long that will last. 

The world feels like a heavy concrete slab, and I feel like I am paved under it. I have nowhere to turn and no idea what to do.

Please help me, I don't want to kill myself at all but I am scared for my immediate future.
