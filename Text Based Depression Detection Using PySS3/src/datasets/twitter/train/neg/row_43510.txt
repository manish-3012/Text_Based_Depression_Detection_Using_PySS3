Friday nightWhen youre in the dark for too long the light hurts

Messages of hope are hard to believe and sometimes hard to want

I cant ask you to look for aomething because i dont know what id ask you to find

But if youre reading this, whoever you are, you beautiful person

Stay safe

Its been more than 20 months since i got some space from that side of my mind, and i never thought i would, at the time
