Does it ever get better?It seems like every day is somehow worse than the last and on the occasional good days I still know that tomorrow is going to be hell. It doesn't matter how hard I fucking try depression always wins. Some people are born to suffer and I seem to be one of them. I don't know why I haven't killed myself yet. Maybe friends, maybe family, maybe I'm just too damn scared. I don't even know why the fuck I'm posting this. I don't care about myself anymore. I used to smile, I used to be somewhat happy. But now I'm miserable. Every fucking day. I just want to die. Please someone just tell me if it's ever going to get better. I don't want to live like this anymore
