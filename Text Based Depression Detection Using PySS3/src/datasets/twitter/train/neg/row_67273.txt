Doing it Friday. Suicide note doneIâ€™ve got everything in order honestly. Suicide note is done. Iâ€™ve tried everything I could to make my life better and none of it worked.

I would like to think that my hours spent on here trying to help people and the people I helped at rehab will even out what I did in my sex addiction

I honestly donâ€™t care to ramble anymore 

Itâ€™s up to the universe now.

I donâ€™t want to do this, but itâ€™s my only way out and Iâ€™m done fighting

If I get a random cosmic intervention on how to beat my addiction Iâ€™ll stop

But thatâ€™s it. No advice, words, anything else will stop me. 

Only thing I hate is I couldnâ€™t finish another play through of r/lifeisstrange 

Itâ€™s been fun. Peace Out.
