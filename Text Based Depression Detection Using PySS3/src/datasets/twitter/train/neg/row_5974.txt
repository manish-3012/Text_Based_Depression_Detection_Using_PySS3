My ears are ringing. It didnt work.I aaid i wouldnt be here again i said everything was okay and its not. All i heard was ringing in my ears and feeling like falling asleep until i heard our dog barking. Why did the dog barking make me stop.  
I saw our bed and how messy it was. Why did that make me stop. 
I said i wouldnt do it again but here i am again. 
Its either he hates me or god hates me and my family does. Praying doesnt help. I feel like i should be dead. 
Why didnt it work
