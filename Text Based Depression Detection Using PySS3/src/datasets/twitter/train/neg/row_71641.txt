In constant physical pain with no end in sight. I don't want to punish my loved ones anymore.I'm 30. I have a severe chronic pain condition that took my whole life away 5 years ago when I fell I'll, and I've suffered every day since then. 
I've lost most friends and those I do have can barely be there for me. It's too much to see me like this. I'm stressing them out. I'm giving in to the pain and not fighting hard enough. Later. Tomorrow. I'm busy. Blah...blah...blah.
I have no life.  I can't work, can't drive, can barely do chores and I spend most days crying in pain and unable to sleep or sit down or walk. I can't do anything anymore and I don't even want to nothing brings me joy. Or if it does it's taken away almost immediately. 
If this is all my life is going to be, why should I keep going? Why should I just keep being in pain that will never end? That sounds horrible. I don't want to be apart of it anymore.
