hello againi very much want to die.

i hate my inconsistency. one day i'll be super confident, i'll be polite, funny, i feel like myself. then for like a week it just disappears for some reason, i feel completely brain dead. 

i've been suicidal about my whole life.

while it may seem petty, i suppose i don't really have much to live for, and every day feels like a dream. so a lot of it is due to me not caring much for being alive.

i just feel like i have so much potential to be happy and confident and i'll do so much for myself, but something happens and all of a sudden i feel like complete garbage.

i also really hate myself, and i am addicted to self harm.

suicide just seems like a lil solution you know. nothing too crazy.

yeah i probably wont kill myself soon, but i know for a fact it is how i will die, perhaps i will actually do it soon.

hope you're all staying healthy by the way
