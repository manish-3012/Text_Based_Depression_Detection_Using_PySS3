I just donâ€™t want to live anymore. I think I am calling it quits.Title says it all. Iâ€™m done with this life. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. Nothing makes sense to me anymore. No matter how hard I try, I just think no one ever likes me in this world. I donâ€™t deserve to being liked/loved. Iâ€™m just self hatred trash that everyone should be avoided from. 

Iâ€™m just pushy thatâ€™s why no one wants to talk with me. Iâ€™m by no means to someone that who should live this shitty life. Iâ€™ll try something to do kill myself. Last year I was overdosed so maybe I should give it a try again :(
