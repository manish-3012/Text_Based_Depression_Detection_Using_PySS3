PLEASE READ (STOP WHAT U R DOING)Everyone on this Reddit is loved. I swear to God. Iâ€™m not just saying this. I seriously have read at least 40 posts from the last hour. Please donâ€™t do anything extreme. I am here for anyone who wants to talk. You all have a purpose and there r always new things to experience. There is no second chance and there r so many people who care about u that u never would even think of. Everyone in this Reddit is someone I am going to think about constantly. Please be safe and at least reach out to me so I know everything is ok. I love u all and please be safe.
