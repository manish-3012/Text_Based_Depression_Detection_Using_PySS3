When is it my turn to be happyForewarning I'm a bit drunk. 


I've been having a lot of anxiety over my life lately. I can't stop thinking about how I've been living with major depression for 6 years and I'm not even out of my teens yet. I see posts on here about people having depression for a long time and I'm scared/know that will be me in a few years. 

Honestly I don't have energy in any capacity to keep trying that long for nothing. I also feel so sad because I know it will hurt my family and my friends, I know they care, but at the same time I'm sick of living a life for other people and I'm exhausted. Sometimes I feel like I should just cut my losses and say "fuck it" before I incorporate anyone else into my life and affect them, too. I get scared that one day my exhaustion will overpower my guilt for leaving this world and that will be that, but at the same time I wish it *would* overpower my guilt so I could just get it over with. My sadness is turning into bitterness and anger and I don't want to become that.  I just want something good to fucking happen in my life, is that too god damn much to ask of the universe

like wtf am I doing with my life. I spend what little money I make on weed so that I can block out what I feel when I'm not at school or work. It's an stupid endless cycle and I'm not doing anything with my life.
