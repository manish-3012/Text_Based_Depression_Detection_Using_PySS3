I had sex with one of my friends and now my depression is back full forceHi everybody

So the title kind of explains it. 2 days ago I slept with one of my best friends. We've had sex before, quite often but we didn't really see eachother for about 6 months. Back then I had pretty strong feelings for him, he didn't and kind of let me on. He had sex iwth another girl and I couldn't handle it so I broke it off. 

When we saw eachother again I didn't feel love at all anymore, maybe only platonical. So I thought "great I'm over it". Then at night we started doing things. Yes, I was a bit drunk and it's my fault entirely. Just a bit of side information how horny we actually were: we did it while our other friends were in the same room, twice. One was even sleeping next to us. 

Yesterday I wrote him a message, telling him that I'm not looking or a relationship (which I'm still not) and I know he isn't, just to clear the air. He thanked me and told me he's interested in this girl who lives in his town (we live about 2 hours away from eachother) and nothing has happend between them yet but he thinks something could in the future. Like a real relationship. 

Now I don't want to be in a relationship rn cause I'm not stable and want to kinda fix myself before doing anything real. I've been in relationships before but the guys always turned out to be assholes. The 2019 wasn't great for me, I met 4 guys who only used me for sex. Feeling like a slut when I talk about it. 

After reading the message he send me I had a panik attack and I don't freaking know why. I don't want to be in a relationship with him. I really don't. I cried a lot and started thinking about killing myself, still thinking about it. I just feel worthless and fucking hate myself.
