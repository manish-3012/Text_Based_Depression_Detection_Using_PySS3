It feels like destiny.(40 y/o F)

My grandmother attempted suicide a few times and failed.

My earliest memory is of my mother telling me she was going to kill herself.

Sometimes I feel like this generational emotional pain was all passed down to me.

Like I'm the one who will finally be successful and put an end to this family disease.  (Never had kids on purpose cause I dont want to pass this down again).

I feel like all their pain lives in me, along with my own trauma and inherited mental illness.

I have tried so hard for YEARS to get better.  

I spent 2 weeks this year in a psych ward trying to get better.  

They gave me ECT treatments there (electroconvulsive therapy aka shock therapy) and I am still having them every 2 weeks or so.

I take meds.

Yesterday I peopled and even hugged a stranger who gave me a gift.

I force myself to do things in hopes I'll not be thinking about how much I want to die.

It doesn't work tho.

Nothing works.

Not even me.  I cant work anymore because of all this.

Ive done all the right things (on paper).

Suicide just must be my destiny.
