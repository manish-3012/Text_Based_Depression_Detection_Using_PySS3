I'm thinking of ending it all this week please help me.I go through extreme levels of depressions once in 2 months. I know it'll end soon but today my visa got rejected and since my travel agent filled the form incorrectly, they refused it under section 3.6 which causes an immediate refusal for the next 10 years. I'm upset because nothing ever goes my way. Last time I seriously thought of killing myself, I went downstairs from college dorm for one last smoke and I met my future boyfriend as he needed a lighter. He asked if I wanted to come hang out with him as it was still early in the night and I forgot about my plans to kill myself. He was everything I was looking for and I saw it as a sign from angels that he had to be there at that time. Well, he broke up with me after 5 years and started dating someone the next day. His girlfriend's best friend held my neck at a party recently and when I got physical I was made to leave. He pretended to not know me and saw it all happen. 

Work isn't going great either. etc etc. I just wish something good happens soon, maybe a sign again because deep inside I do want to live. I can't stop crying, This all makes no sense. I told my parents how depressed I have been and think about killing myself and they tell me not to be sad and go do yoga or something . This makes me want to kill myself even more and write a note telling them that I wasn't joking. I swear I'm not such a terrible person though. But these thoughts are stronger than me. It's almost like they're not my thoughts. Please help me.
