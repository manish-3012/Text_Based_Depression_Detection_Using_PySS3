I want to help before I goIâ€™m planning on killing my self when I turn 21, and thatâ€™s 8 months. 
I donâ€™t want to leave without utilizing my privilege and resources. 
I plan on being a donor, but until then, Iâ€™m wondering how I can help others as much as possible before I go. Iâ€™m talking about strangers, and random people. Iâ€™ve considered being a live liver donor, and Iâ€™ve also been painting portraits for others. What are some other things I can do that donâ€™t require money? Thatâ€™ll come last.
