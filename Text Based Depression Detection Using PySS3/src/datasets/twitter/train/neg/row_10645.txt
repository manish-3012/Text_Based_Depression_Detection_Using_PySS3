Life is a jokeI've fucked up everything in my life. Every relationship, every opportunity, everything. I'm an unwanted mistake. I'm adopted and still fatherless. Nobody wants me and I hate myself bc I've created this situation. I really feel like I can't get any lower and the next step is to kill myself. I've always looked forward to the day I died. I'm sorry
