I Don't Know If I Can Make ItI just had a relationship end with one of the people I trusted and loved the most because I couldn't stop right-swiping on Tinder.  I never considered how much it would hurt her until she found out through her friends.  I never intended to cheat on her or to meet up with anyone I matched:  I just had a fucked up desire to get hit on by random strangers.  Needless to say that desire is gone, but at the cost of one of the most beautiful relationships.

I have slept a total of 9 hours in the past 3 days, I am rapidly deteriorating, I don't know if I'm going to make it.
