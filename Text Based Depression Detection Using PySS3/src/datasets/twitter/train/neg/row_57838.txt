I need some support/advice/resources, anything Hi, 
Me: 40ish, bipolar I, BPD

Background: Lost job in October, promised job on Jan. In October my wife (schizophrenic or schizoaffective) wife was admitted to hospital with homicidal thoughts towards me. While hospitalized, her employer (a mental health agency) fired her and drops insurance. Lawyers involved. Behind on mortgage. Late December, my employer backs out of job promise. Jan 2,i tear cartilage in my knee. Need MRI and surgery. Car insurance about to expire. Govt has suspended my drivers license and put out bench warrant for being behind in child support and not paying a ticket. I am in physical pain because of the knee. I am filled with rage, anxiety, anger, depression. I went to a community mental health center 2 weeks ago, they sent me somewhere else yesterday, who will see me in 3 weeks. Now I can't get a job because a background check will show the warrant, I can't get timely mental or physical care because of lack of insurance. I wait hours at food pantries, in pain, just to eat. None of this would have happened if my wife weren't illegally fired. I don't see a way out and figure my life is over. But if I just take my own life then they get away with it. I want to make them pay for what they have done, though I will probably lose my life in the process. But if this saves someone else from going through this, it will be worth it - because as I said my life is over anyways. 

Thanks for listening.
