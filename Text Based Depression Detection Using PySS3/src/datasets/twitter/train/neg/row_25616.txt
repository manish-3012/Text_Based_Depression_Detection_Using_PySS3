A future dateStress, depression, divorce and alimony have shattered my desire and will to live. I was alcoholic but when I got custody of one of my sons I stopped drinking, I realized that my motivation to live was my children. Life is monotonous and as you get older, the pleasure become scarce. 

If you are in your 50s it is difficult to find love again, your body doesn't work the same and your mind isn't up to date with the word. It doesn't matter how much you try, this is unavoidable. 

So this led me to decide to stop living once my youngest son is 18, that's in 6 years and I will be 59, almost 60. I will pay my debts with this world, I will everything to my sons in these 6 years but once the time has come, I will kill myself. In these 6 years I will become a full hedonist, I will stop caring about what others think about me, I won't care if someone gets offended about what I have to say. If I think something I will speak my mind. 

I will do whatever gives me pleasure except drinking, I'm not sure if I should. I would like to do it sometimes but I'm sure if I do I will decay and act like a complete degenerate. If I drink I won't be able to function properly but I'm not closed to alcohol, time will tell.

I think 6 decades in this world will be enough. If someone wasted time reading this, thanks for taking a part of me.
