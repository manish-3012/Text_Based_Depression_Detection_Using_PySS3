Hard timesSome time ago bf left me for my suicide attempt. We are back again but I don't feel like he loves me anymore. I quit games which were my only escape....meds don't help. Real life friends tell me its nothing serious and to stop pretenind like its so important. I asked my bf if he felt bad for what I went through when he dumped me. He said no. Felt like a bullet through my heart. I feel so numb. Im sorry I am wasting your time whoever is reading this.
