Why is it so hard to die when you WANT to die?I've got nothing left. My fiancee left me. She was my only reason for living, she was the one thing in this world that made me happy, made me feel like I had any worth. But then she lied to me and left me. I pointed my parents' double-barrel shotgun at my head a few minutes ago and became so scared, I realized that I could actually die. But...That's what I want. I want to die. So why can't I? I don't understand. I can't live in loneliness and pain anymore.
