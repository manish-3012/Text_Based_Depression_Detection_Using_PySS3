I have to. It's no longer optional.I haven't had any real conversation with my friends for months. Tonight I finally expressed how bad I'm feeling to one of them and everything about that conversation made me feel so much worse. I shouldn't've said anything. I have to die. And it has to be sooner rather than later.
