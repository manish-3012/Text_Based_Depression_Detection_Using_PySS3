I think that tonight is itI'm going to yak for a moment, a final peace if you will, you don't have to read. I cannot stand to live much longer. I am hurting so deeply inside; I thought after my teenage years I would start to feel more comfortable in my life and skin, but I just am not. Being trans weights heavily on me (please keep your comments to yourself on this, I already know I'm an abomination, I don't need to feel worse about it). I will never be who I truly know I am, no amount of medical intervention can change how I was born, and it hurts me worse everyday. I feel completely like a freak of nature, I feel so disconnected from both communities; I don't fit into the transgender community because I hate my identity and hold no pride, and the community of assigned at birth identifiers -- well they don't like me too well either. I feel very alone and isolated. I tried to fill the void with charity work, I went without food last month to help out a cause and it just didn't help, I couldn't find the happiness I've so desperately been searching for. I am hurting so immensely there just doesn't seem like any other way. Thank you all for listening and allowing me a platform, my family no longer speaks to me so it's nice to get it off my chest. Goodnight, friends.
