I don't want to talk, simply answer my question.any chance of killing myself after eating 135mg zopiclone, 15mg olanzapine drunk, 0 tolerance? hell I'll I have about 1.5g lexapro as well but if I survive my body will be broken.

sorry, figured I'd ask here instead of askreddit.

I had roughly 25mg klonipin drunk on 0 tolerance a week ago...all I have access to otherwise...

I want to go easy.
