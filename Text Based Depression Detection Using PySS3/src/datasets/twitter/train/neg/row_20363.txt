Nothing goes right.My personal situation doesn't matter, and frankly none of this does. I'm just scared. I want to die, but I'm afraid of the pain before going. If I shoot myself theres a chance I wont die right away. Carbon monoxide seems peaceful. Anyone have any insight on that method? I have a wife and child to take care of so I wont do this until my million dollar life insurance kicks in... just looking for advice and I dont know where to go. I'm just a piece of shit who is worth more to my family dead than alive.
