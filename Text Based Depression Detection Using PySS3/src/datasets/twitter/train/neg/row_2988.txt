iâ€™m always tirediâ€™m so tired. life is so cyclic. i need to be in college for so long to have my â€œdream jobâ€ and i have no motivation. thereâ€™s always the chance iâ€™ll give up because thatâ€™s what i do. iâ€™m tired of being sick and pushing everyone away, saying hurtful things to people and immediately regretting it because iâ€™m ill. none of the pills do enough and iâ€™m almost out of ones to try, and iâ€™m tired of working 40 hours a week to barely pay my bills. where is the motivation to keep up my grades supposed to come from? i donâ€™t have enough money to give my boyfriend the life i want to give him and i donâ€™t have a family. itâ€™s so lonely. my best friend has this beautiful loving family. she told me about the christmas dinner sheâ€™s going to have and iâ€™m so jealous. it sounds so wonderful. iâ€™m not doing anything. iâ€™ll probably get some fast food like i did on thanksgiving. iâ€™m ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue.
