Trying to convince myself things will get better.I just tried to end my own life. Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression, anxiety, ADHD and addiction for the past 5 years. I spend my life jumping between the usual low moods of depression, and the point of wanting to kill myself. I recently just overcame my addiction to Ketamine, opioids and alcohol. Iâ€™ve felt to put in the best way â€˜mehâ€™ for the past few days. Iâ€™ve been actively trying to break my cycle of substance abuse, but now I have nothing to numb the pain. Tonight it just got so bad, Iâ€™ve been at my doctor no longer than 12 hours ago, and got a prescription for Xanax and lexapro. The past few weeks prior to my sobriety were a whirlwind. I forced away my best friend because I was worried if I do die, I didnâ€™t want to hurt her as badly. But tonight the thoughts just got so bad. I hung up my belt and stood on my drum throne and stood there for about 10 minutes. In the past when Iâ€™ve wanted to end my life Iâ€™ve left notes, this time I tried to write something but all I could write was â€˜Iâ€™m sorryâ€™. This was the closest Iâ€™d ever come and I scared myself. My jumps between meh and suicidal happen like in the bat of an eyelid and I was meh again as I stood there. I took myself down and considered going to hospital, but Iâ€™m living in a country where mental health assistance and suicide prevention is fucking useless. No hospitals generally are able to help with suicidal patients. Iâ€™m worried about the stress that I do cause my friends and family. my best friend texts me all the time just to make sure Iâ€™m still breathing and I feel such a burden. I wish I could end all the worrying for them, but Iâ€™ve lost friends to suicide and I know what it does, but Iâ€™m at a point where it doesnâ€™t seem to matter anymore. And that it will be better if Iâ€™m gone.
