TIFU by seeing a psychiatristWho drew several very personal and hurtful conclusions based on minor details and throwaway comments. Brought up by a single mother - attachment disorder. Boyfriend in a less prestigious profession - attachment disorder confirmed. 

There was some truth, and it was very hard to hear, but there was also a lot of bullshit. 

And basically now I feel really shit about my relationship with my mum and boyfriend which I had previously viewed as positive, loving and supportive. And as I am now feeling something a little more than suicidal ideation it would be really nice to have their support. But now I feel like I'm even more broken for asking it so I can't. 

And in removing the belief I had that my death would negatively impact on those who love me he just took away the single reason I was putting up with all this. 

Good work Doc!
