(TLdr) My family relationship is strained (Trigger warning)Four and a half years ago i self harmed really bad and was going through some terrible shit. Death in the family and i was abused physically and emotionally in a serious relationship i was also having my life threatened by my sisters boyfriend. I self harmed ended up in the hospital and self harming after that. Im currently better then i ever have been but its getting bad again. I have insomnia and my senses get over loaded and can have panic attacks. Today i had a bad panic attack following a few months solid of fighting with my mother and sister. They dismiss anything im going thru. They dont listen or believe anything i say and im paying our phone bill and property tax right now. I did lean on them for a while because of not have cash flow but that isnt an issue and i have no problem with helping with paying bills. But they are never happy not even with 300$ a week thats fuckin 1200$ a month im giving them and they dont fucking care about my issues. My sisters kid flooded the bathroom next to my room pizza boxes and chicken boxes and donut box all over the kitchen and my dog wouldn't leave my nephews toy alone and my mother was getting pissed at me cause my dog was chewing his football. It was so fucking much all at once and i fuckin flipped screaming for all of them to shut up and my sister kept saying hurtful shit trying to have the last word every time and jesus dude i thought i was gonna have a heart attack. Dont have an option to move out do to covid reasons and local area reasons and costs and having my dog. I cant stay with my friends and all other family i have want to stay in out fuckin house. Idk is super depressed and i had to vent.
