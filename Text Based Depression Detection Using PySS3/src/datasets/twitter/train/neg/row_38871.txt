I feel bad for wanting to die when I see many people having it worse than me.Like, sometimes I do wish I could just escape it all but at the same time I have no real reason too, they're just these intrusive thoughts I get when my brain's running. I feel it's not as severe and I'm thankful, but at the same time feel stupid for feeling like this in the first place when ppl are clearly having it worse.
