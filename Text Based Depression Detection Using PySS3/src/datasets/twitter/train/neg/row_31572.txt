How to distribute notesLook, I'm not going to say that which shall not be named here, but if an event occurs in just over a week or so, it's happening. 
I'm resolved, my mind made up. 

I'm trying to figure out how to distribute notes. Is there any way to send a delayed fb message to people. I don't want to send them and then DC my phone, as that's unnecessary stress on people I love. I also don't want it to seem like attention seeking behaviour. 
I want a clean break. 

I was thinking of passing them to a friend in confidence, not being explicit, maybe I could send them all compressed in different named RAR files, with explicit instructions to decompress and pass them on on a certain date? 

I just don't want physical notes, they're too hard to preserve and ensure they get to the right places. I don't want to save stuff on PCs and stuff as they may be seized by police, never unlocked, etc, etc and seem very unlikely again to reach the recipients. 

Any thoughts guys. You'd be doing me a service and I'm very grateful for any help you can give.
