I don't knowI have been clinically depressed for the last 5 years or so, but probably longer in reality as I avoided my doctor. I spent the first 6 months of this year off work and as a day patient in a psychiatric hospital. I am now working through a return to work plan and it has got too much for me.
Whilst I was away from work there have been a lot of changes which have basically turned my department into a dumping ground. I work in a team of 4, one is worse than hopeless and one of the other two is leaving.
I'm getting no rehabilitation support from work and feel like I am being bullied by some managers (this has been noticed by others as well).
In short I do everyone's work because it has to get done.
I have no self worth and I hate the thing that takes up most of my time. Work.
If I see a doctor I'll be signed off which I don't want. I just don't know what to do next.
I don't think I'm suicidal but I do evaluate things that might end my life regularly.
Please help.
