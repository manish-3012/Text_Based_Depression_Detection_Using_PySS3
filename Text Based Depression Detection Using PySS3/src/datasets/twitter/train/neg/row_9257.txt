Whatâ€™s the best way to kill yourself?Hello. Sorry if the wrong subreddit.

(Iâ€™m using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.)

I really just want to die. I live in a constant state of fear and misery, and I want to end it all. My family is shitty, and I have no friends. Iâ€™m also poor as fuck. I donâ€™t have a gun, nor do I have any rope to hang myself with.

Does anyone know the easiest way to die? I donâ€™t want to risk failing suicide; I donâ€™t want to get brain damage.

Besides, Iâ€™ll look like a complete fool if I survive suicide. Iâ€™d jump off a tall building, but I donâ€™t know of any tall buildings nor how to get to one. Am I just out of luck? Iâ€™ll do anything for some answers. Thank you.

(I assume that using a gun is the best option, but, like I mentioned, I, unfortunately, have no gun.
