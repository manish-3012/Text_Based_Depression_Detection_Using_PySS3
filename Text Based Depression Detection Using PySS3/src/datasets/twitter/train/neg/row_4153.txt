Concerned about a friend -- What pill combinations would a person take to commit suicide? My friend evasively asked me whether I have certain medications she could buy. Wouldn't explain why she wanted them, just kept saying she was feeling unwell. I'm trying to figure out what combinations could be dangerous and whether there's a chance she's looking for pills to kill herself, but I don't know what types of pills/combinations would be dangerous.
