I have no friendsI've spent almost my entire life alone. Ever since I was little, I can remember being terrified of other people. I was teased for being different, attacked at random on the playground by other kids, berated by teachers for little mistakes. That never ended, but eventually I found a couple of people who I could call friends. But I was the third wheel. If they came over to my house, it was either for one of my siblings or because all of their other friends were gone. I was always the last resort.

I quickly learned how to keep myself entertained, to not think about how lonely and depressed I was. It's getting harder and harder as time has gone on. Now I can legitimately say that I have absolutely no friends to speak of, and I haven't for a long time. I don't know how to make new ones. Even though I've been going to school for 2 years, I haven't made a single friend. I've never had a girlfriend, and I am becoming more aware of the fact that I probably never will. 

The crippling loneliness, depression and anxiety are slowly beginning to consume me. I don't know if I can do it anymore. Every night for the past three weeks I've fantasized about my own death. I don't know what to do. I just want it to end.
