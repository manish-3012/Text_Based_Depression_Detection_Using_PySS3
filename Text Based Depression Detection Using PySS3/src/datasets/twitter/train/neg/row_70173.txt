I made one last effort to improve my life and it backfired on me.I moved back to my hometown to be closer to family and improve my chances in the dating world after a divorce. I left a good paying job and now I can't find anything decent here. To top it off I rented an apartment that is making me sick and I can't back out of the lease. I guess this is it.. my life has spiralled wildly out of control since the divorce and no one gives a fuck if you're a male in today's society that's down on his luck.
