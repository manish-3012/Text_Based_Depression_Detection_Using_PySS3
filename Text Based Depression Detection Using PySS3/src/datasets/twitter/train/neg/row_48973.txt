This might not be the right sub, but someone please offer me help.My friend (ex-girlfriend) told me last night that she tried to OD, but she called an ambulance and they were on the way. I told her to that she was loved and that she needs to let the ambulance treat her. She replied that she could hear the ambulance coming, but then communication stopped. I don't know what happened after that. I've tried messaging and calling her but nothing has happened. If the ambulance got to her, would she have any access to her phone once she got to the hospital at all? This happened at about midnight last night, so she could have been up all night, but I'm freaking out. Please, to everyone on this sub who is contemplating ending their life, please don't. It may not seem like anyone loves you, but please trust me that you are. I don't want to lose my friend and I don't know what to do. I'm away at school so I can't go find her. I'm freaking out.
