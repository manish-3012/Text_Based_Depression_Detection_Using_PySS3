A few more monthsI think I'll give myself until the end of this year to find some money, so my parents don't have to worry about my funeral. I don't have any reason to keep living. Iâ€™m almost 30, and I have no career, friends, or future. I'm not smart or hardworking, so I won't be able to get anywhere in life. I'm tired of feeling tired and hopeless all the time. All I do is drag people down with me. No one is happy when they're with me. I don't see a happy future for myself. I just want to end everything.
