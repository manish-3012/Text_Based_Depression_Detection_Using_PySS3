I wish my last attempt had workedI donâ€™t expect anyone to read this but I wanted to get this off my chest. A few years ago, I made a really shitty attempt and Iâ€™m still mad that I woke up. The last couple years have been the worst of my life and I canâ€™t help but think that if it had worked I wouldnâ€™t be here. Iâ€™d be alone, wrapped in darkness and silence forever. Nothing to feel or think or say. Just... absolute nothingness. And that sounds better then any of this. But the worst part is that Iâ€™m too afraid to try again and that makes me feel like more of a fuck up. Like my brain is screaming â€œstop talking and just fucking do it already!â€
