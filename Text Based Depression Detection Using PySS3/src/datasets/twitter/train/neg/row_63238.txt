Suicide that will failHi folks

I have posted here some times before.
And my last post was about me getting help. I saw my Doc and at first everything seemed quite good. But in the end i won't realy get any help until next summer. I am on waiting lists for a Mental Doc (sry don't know the english term). But it gets worse and worse. My Famaly doesnt support me in any way. My mum just yelled at me that i will lose everything i have when i continue this bullshit. Today i thought about takeing 10g paracetanol. But i realised i don't whant to kill myself. I just whant someone to help me. And i have the Feeling this will only happen when i try and fail a suizide. Also i can then finally go into therapy. But that isnt right i gues. I am just a burden to everyone. And my own thoughts show me that i am right. It feels like everything i do atm is going to crash in some time so it doesnt matter what i do. I am fucked. i am moveing to a deadline and a last chance i had at my job. I cant pay some bills i have to pay in the next month and i have borrowed amounts of money i will never be able to pay back if i dont work. Anf it is not from banks. Good friends and my parents. And i fucking idiot did nothing else then smoking weed and being an idiot. I just cant get my life that was shit from the beginning to now. I gues if i don't get help soon i will just do it for real the moment everything crashes. And this will be soon. I know this is fucked up to ask but do you know how i can do a good attemp that will fail?
