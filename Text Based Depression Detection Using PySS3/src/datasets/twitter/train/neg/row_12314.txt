I overdosed on a cocktail of painkillers and sedatives last night. I woke up this morning. Why? Why am I still alive?I should be dead. My pillow is covered in blood and vomit, I must've threw up. Family wants me to see a psychiatrist. For drugs. That's funny. After all the addictions and dependencies they've made me pick up, they want me to be on more drugs. There's a nice abandoned trestle a few miles from my place. About 60 meters up from a concrete sidewalk. I'm gonna go hop off that later tonight. I was 18.
