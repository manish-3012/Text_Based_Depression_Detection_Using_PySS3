Ive just endured too muchThings are going to get worse and worse wether I want them to or not. 

I'm just not the kind of person who can handle getting burned and being in pain.

All I hear in my head ALL the time is all the verbal and emotional abuse I have endured. 

As much as I'd like to have the kind of living I always dreamed of, I've kinda reached a point where I just CANT do it anymore, my heart just can't take it. I just don't want to suffer anymore I want to be at peace and just be gone. 

The only real thing that has stopped me from killing myself for the past 12 years of my life has been the worry that it will only be worse or that I won't just be gone.
