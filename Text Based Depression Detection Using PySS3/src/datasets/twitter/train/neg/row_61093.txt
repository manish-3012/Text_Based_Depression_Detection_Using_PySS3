The environment scares me.I'm just really scared. I hear more and more things on the environment and I can't help but feel hopeless. I hear more and more negative things about my future careers and I panic. I'm a Sophie in high school, I had a very comfortable home life and over all am very happy with what I have. 

But the future scares me, I do believe I suffer from anxiety but I don't know what to do anymore. Death freaks me the hell out, but I don't know what to do because if I keep living, eventually we,re all going to struggle to breath, find clean water, find clean clothes, a job, food. This scares me. I don't know what to do. I'm stuck, I was born in the wrong time. I just want to live my life like I was supposed to. But I can't.. Please help me.
