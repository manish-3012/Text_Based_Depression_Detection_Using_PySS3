No one truly cares.I'm too afraid to tell my family because they'll more than likely send me to a mental hospital or something. Like that would even help. I have no more hope. I have nowhere else to turn to. Nobody wants to help because nobody can. Or nobody cares to. I'm broke and I owe rent money and I lost my job recently. I'm most likely going to get evicted. I haven't felt this hopeless in a while but I can't see any way out. Nobody cares. All everyone cares about is money. They don't give a shit about my mental health. About how or why I cut. They care about pieces of paper that's given a special value. I'm just a damn nuisance. To everyone. This life isn't for me. I didn't pick this life. I never wanted this life. I was born out of a 1 in billions percent chance. And now this "miracle" of a human is forced to work for my entire life. It's not fair. And I'm sure people will say "life isn't fair." Or "just make the most of it." Well why isn't life fair? Why does this life relentlessly suffocate me? And why does everyone refuse to help? "You'll get through this" isn't helping. Money is the only thing that can help. But why is that literally the only thing that people care about? When the landlord sees me they don't say "how are you doing?" Or "are you ok?" It's always "rent?" I'm so fed up with it. I just want it all to end. I don't want to live this life. I'm done. I'm giving up.
