I think it's time...It's taken me a while of lurking, to get up the courage to make a throwaway to write on this subreddit with... 

I'm 6 months out of a LTR that I ended. I ended it because I cheated on him, and felt guilty. I couldn't bring myself to tell him, but he found out after we broke it off. Now, things are just terrible. We kinda sorta keep in contact, as we have mutual friends. I love him with all my heart. I've tried seeing other people, but that just led to such a degredation of my self esteem. 

I don't remember the first 3 months after the relationship because I was either high on pills, drunk off alcohol or high off trees. I slept with any guy who'd I'd known for awhile that showed interest. (no.. I just met you lets fuck! tho.. thankfully) The fact that I did that has just added to my guilt.

I hate myself. For what I did to him, for sleeping with those other guys when I was only trying to replace my ex... 

About 3 weeks ago, I was alone at home and just started drinking. 1,2,3,6,9... I don't remember it, but I ended up slitting my wrist. Somehow I came around long enough to call a friend - she called 911. 5 stitches, could weeks and lots of bills later .. it's all I can think about. 

I want to do it right this time - or maybe just skip back to the pills. I miss him so much, and he doesn't give a shit about me anymore. I think it's time I ended both of our suffering. I just wish I was brave enough to do it in this exact moment...
