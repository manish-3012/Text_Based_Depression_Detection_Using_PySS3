Anxiety and depression causing thoughts of suicideI moved back home on a work term two months ago and was forced to continue long distance with my university girlfriend who had been away the semester before. About two weeks in I got extreme anxiety attacks with terrifying feelings of panic. This them led to the thought of the only way to end it was suicide. I went to counselling and he said it was my girlfriend issue, so some I had no other direction I broke it off with who I believe to be my one true love. I felt better for a week but then the anxiety returned, now with depression and soon after suicidal thoughts. I have now been dealing with these thoughts and everything for a few weeks. There is a large bridge where I live and that's the way I know is do it. So I avoid it at all cost. But I can't now help this feeling that living is pointless and we are all going to die someday anyways, I can't remember what it feels like to feel happy and care free. I tell myself that I only have one chance at life and not to throw it away on anxiety and depression, but none of those thoughts stick, only suicidal thoughts do. I'm scared and just want these thoughts gone, they were starting to but I was with my parents and they drove over the bridge and it all came back. Any help is appreciated. I'm in counselling and seeing a psychiatrist soon.
