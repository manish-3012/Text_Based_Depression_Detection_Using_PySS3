I hate my existence; my 20's have been hell.I don't even wanna explain shit because it'll never end, but I'm about to be 30 in over a year and my entire 20s has been a living nightmare. I don't know how the fuck I'm still alive after this shit but it's not ended. I'm a fairly religious dude and I've prayed for a change and I haven't received anything. I'm sick of this shitty life I live. Everything is fucked up. I'm in debt, I have a psychological issue stemming from an arrest that left me with PTSD and now I cannot even pass school. I think my back is broken too. I don't see this shit happening to others my age. All my friends haven't had none of this happen. I literally just want to jump off of a bridge. So sick of this existence, fake people, shitty experiences and JUST HELL CALLED EARTH. If there's a heaven I want in it, and I'm sure suicide probably ain't the way but I don't know what else to do to leave the earth. I hate it with a passion. I hate all of it.
