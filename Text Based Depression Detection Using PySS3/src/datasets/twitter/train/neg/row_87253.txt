Why shouldn't I?I've been alone for over 12 years, never kissed anyone, only thing I've done was hold hands, 12 years ago. My friends don't text me, I have to message them first and when they reply, if at all, it's nothing, no connection no emotion. I cant drive, fail my test for learners and to scared of failure to retry. I work at a shitty job making shitty money, over worked under appreciated. The girl I'm trying to see won't even text me anymore. No life experience, barely passed high school. If I quit my job then I'll be back in my parent's house, 3 years of trying to improve to be back at square one. If I do it there then my mom will find me and that's the worst thing she could find. I'm miserable and I cant change it. I want to write a book but I've procrastinated so hard in life I cant bother to make food 80% of the time and somehow still fat. My hobby is so looked down on, my parents laugh at me, and I'm so invested in it I cant but money anywhere else. 

The only thing I have goin for me are my 2 cats. I don't treat them as well as i should. I'm a terrible cat dad.

My 24th birthday is coming next week. Life is hopeless for me, no goal, no achievement, no love, nothing. So why shouldn't I?
