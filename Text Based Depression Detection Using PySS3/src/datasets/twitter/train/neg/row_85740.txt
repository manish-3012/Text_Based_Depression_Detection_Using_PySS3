I SURRENDERI'm tired. I'm tired of everything in life. I'm an adult who has been severely depressed for the past 4-5 years or so. I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING GOOD!!! I can just feel the bad things. I don't have any self confidence, I don't any friends. I struggle making friends. Words don't work on me! I don't know why!!
My family is under a lot of stress all the freaking time! I can't and don't want to approach them because I know how much pressure they have financially. I mean like we owe $100000 or even more to a lot of people. I'm just an adult who doesn't know how am I supposed to pay it back quickly because it's just too much pressure and I want to save my family from this burden but the interest is killing me when we're not able to pay the amount of debt to someone. Also, I'm from a developing country like India and Pakistan so like 1 dollar is equal to like 75 bucks here. I don't how how am I supposed to pay off the debt. How am I supposed to get out of this soul sucking depression and actually feel something good for once? How am I supposed to live when I can't even afford to consult a psychiatrist for my condition when I feel like life has just been killing me forever. Even if I work hard and get over my depression and start paying off all the debt, it will take almost 40 years of my life to do that and I don't know if I will burnout and go crazy and become depressed again or not. I NEED HELP. Dying is just way too much work and I'm actually scared of death and snakes. I just want all this to end and my family free!!!! I can't even get motivated to do things. It exhausts me so much!!!! I'm done letting life do this to me and my family. Please someone help. Guide me somewhere at least!! I don't want to see my family like this. 

I SURRENDER.
