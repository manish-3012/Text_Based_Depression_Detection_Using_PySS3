I don't wanna live anymoreI feel like my life is pain. 

I feel like I'm too scared or awkward to change. 

I feel like I'm weak in seeking the support of others. 

My depression makes it impossible for me to be happy with myself. 

No one will ever love me in the way that I want them to. 

I can't take this pain anymore. 

I need to end it all 

I don't care about the lives I'd ruin. 

I'd be doing it for myself not them. 

I feel like no one can save me. 

I'm going to therapy tomorrow.
