everyone only cares about themselves, so no one will miss me if iâ€™m dead.i donâ€™t have any friends. the people i hang out with constantly talk over me, donâ€™t acknowledge a thing i say, and make me feel really shitty about myself. i donâ€™t consider them friends. theyâ€™re just people i spend time with to feel like less of a loser. 

people would only miss me for what i did to or for them. iâ€™ve been told that iâ€™m hardworking. yeah, because no one else will do it. people would only miss me on reddit for the nsfw content that i post - of course no one actually gives a shit about some fat &amp; lonely bitch. people would only miss me for â€œbeing a good listener.â€ yeah, because no one ever wants to hear what i have to say. people would only miss me for doing the shit that no one else wants to do. 

i want to end it all. iâ€™m fucking tired, man. i put way too much effort into my relationships with others, just to get shit in return. why doesnâ€™t anyone care about me? why doesnâ€™t anyone love me enough to actually value who i am as a person and not just the things iâ€™m capable of?

i know i need to notice these things within myself, but damn.. how nice would it be to have someone else acknowledge how hard i try not to fucking kill myself everyday? 

life has been so fucking hard recently. 

1 - my dog got sick. i spent over $2k for his treatment and thank god heâ€™s better, but iâ€™m still suffering financially because of it. my job doesnâ€™t pay that much and i feel like iâ€™m never going to get back to where i was before paying everything. i donâ€™t have pet insurance or anything, so everything was paid out. of. pocket.

2 - my therapist is moving on to another role. granted, i only see her once every 6-7 weeks, but those appointments help so much. now iâ€™m going to have ANOTHER therapist who i need to tell all my past traumas to. iâ€™m tired of repeating my story. iâ€™m glad that sheâ€™s found a better job though. 

3 - i got ghosted by someone i was really into. i know itâ€™s a part of life. just sucks a LOT when it happens..

amongst other things that i donâ€™t feel comfortable sharing on reddit. 

iâ€™m so heartbroken. and sad. and alone. 

no one would give a shit if i killed myself, so why not just do it?
