I feel empty.I don't know what to do because exams are cancelled and my mocks won't bring me into university. It's almost like god just decides to fuck with me and *only me*. Everyone else has enough to get into university and I won't. I don't my loving, kind, and awesome parents to have that chip on their shoulder. I want to get into university so that I can be normal for once. BUT NO! god has consistently decided to fuck me up. 

Fuck his plan. I'll end my emptiness by ending it all. I want to restart so that I can be the child that they've never know that they wanted.  


I will kill myself if I don't get admission into university this Friday.
