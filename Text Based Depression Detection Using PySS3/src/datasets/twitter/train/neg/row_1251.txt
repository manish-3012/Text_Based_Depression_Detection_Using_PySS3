Bored and apathetic. I really don't know where to start here. I'm 17 years old (18 in 2 weeks) and just moved in to college. I've been really depressed for many years. I've never been very social, never had anyone I was really close to for very long. My parents are divorced, I'm not very close to either of them. Mom and I always fight, Dad cheated on her and beat me and my brother (only a few times tho). I'm also gay. 

 I've never had any vision of what I wanted my life to be outside of high school, and I still don't. I don't care about studying or what my major is. To me, life is inherently pointless. You're born, you live, you die. Whatever career you pick doesn't matter, and whatever joy you derive from those you surround yourself with is fleeting. It's like I want to meet and interact with other people but I realize whenever I try that it really doesn't matter. I have nothing of interest to say and I don't really care what anyone else has to say. 

I've just been so bored and apathetic for a long time. I can remember lying in bed when I was like 8 thinking how much better my parent's lives would be if I had never existed. 

I've been thinking of suicide for a long time, but have never gathered the courage to go through with anything because knowing me, I'd probably fuck up any suicide attempt I'd ever make. I know everyone here is just gonna give me the usual "you have so much to live for," "it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem" shit. I've heard all that before and it doesn't mean anything to me. I don't value money, success, material goods, or companionship so the rewards of this world mean nothing to me, and the whole appeal of suicide is its permanence. Saying that killing yourself is something that can't be undone is like telling a sex addict that girls have tits. Kind of counterproductive to what you were going for, I think. 

Can anyone give me any reason to go on, because I just don't care about anything, or anyone, including myself?
