What's the point of being alive when you can't connect with othersNothing feels good. Nothing feels like anything. If something feels good it's at someone else's expense. I'm desperate to not feel alone but all I can do is hurt people. I can't help it that my brain isn't working. I don't have any words but I still want company even if it's in silence and I want to feel the warmth of someone else laying next to me but that's inappropriate to ask of friends... But I want it so bad

Why can't this all stop? What's the point of holding on for something I know won't happen? Why am I so selfish and useless? I think I only care about people because their absence and sadness would negatively impact my life. I don't know if I care about them just to care about them. I'm worthless, I have nothing to offer, I can't connect with women and every attempt to connect with men has failed and I don't understand why I'm like this. It's like platonic relationships don't exist, I don't even want a fucking relationship, I just want to be close, I don't want to have feelings for a good friend so why is this happening? Once I declare my feelings then the friendship is gone because I don't want anything more than the friendship, and I've also led the other person on

And then it's back to having 0 people in my life instead of 1

The only reason I'm still here is because I haven't let go of the childish hope that the loneliness will stop, what's wrong with me, how horrible my friend must feel thinking I came all this way just to lead him on when it wasn't like that

And when I go back it's to live with the person who choked and hit me with his fists, broom handles, extension cables, punched me in the mouth so that I needed to go to urgent care for stitches the next day, who spit on me, who complains I sleep on the couch in the living room

If I keep on reminding myself of all this it'll be easy to jump. I just need to keep on reminding myself.
