Thank you.Thank you to everyone for your support. I posted here twice in the past, the most recent time thinking of ending it all. Life has been really difficult since then and I'm not saying by any means it turned upside down, but I started getting the necessary help I needed.

I had made plans and when I had made my most recent post, I was overwhelmed by the amount of support from pure strangers on the internet. Some of which I've been having regular conversations with, despite my stubborn ass sometimes. You are a wonderful community and I've got goals and have had the opportunity to hang out with some old friends and try and get my life on track. 

I don't think I can't spend much more time around here, as it just makes me sad to see all those others where I am on a regular basis. I hope you all find peace and know that if you're struggling with anything please feel free to pm me and I can at least listen, the same thing others did for me at my darkest moments.
