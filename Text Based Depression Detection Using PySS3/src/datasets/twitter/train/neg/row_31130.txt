I don't have any friendsI've done school online for 2 years now. I didn't really keep in touch with anyone from my old high school. Tonight these girls ive been going to church with invited me to basketball game at my old school. I figured I'd go. They told me how many people would be happy to see me and wondering what happened to me. I got there and no one said anything to me. They didn't care about me, they never did. The two other girls just ended up talking to some other guys the whole time. I probably won't be going to church with them anymore. The only reason I went was because of how lonely I am. I can't hold a normal relationship with anyone, it makes me uncomfortable when a girl I like talks to other guys ( which they all do because it's high school ). I won't ever be able to change. And seeing all my old peers with girlfriends, friends, going to partys made me realize how inadequate I am. I'm better off dead. If anyone wants to talk feel free to PM me. I'll give you my number, shoot me a text.
