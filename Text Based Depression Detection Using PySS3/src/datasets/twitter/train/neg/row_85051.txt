My messageJust a reminder to myself that I did all I could to cure my depression. No matter what I do I always feel the same way and experience the same psychological pain. I had a depression since I was 14 and I am 21 now. I can't do anything to feel happy or normal. I tried physical activity, medication and therapy but none of these things seem to work for me. I am just too tired and too sad about all the pain and the best decision that I see is to end it all. I don't think that anything can change and all I do now is experiencing more and more pain. I donâ€™t have a job and any kind of hobby or interests. Everyday feels like the same and every night I go to bed with hope that this night will be the last one for me. I did all I could do and I have no hope left in me. What is life without any hope? It is just plain unending misery. I was thinking about ending it all and only now, I can say that I am ready to do it. There is nothing left that I can do or try and there is no hope no matter what I do. My life will be miserable and I will not be able to connect with anyone. I will try to improve something until the end of this month but I really want to end all the pain and suffering now. Even complete emptiness and darkness is better than waking up every day with false hopes that this day will be better than the last one. It will not be better it will only get worse. I have a plan that I can use to end it all and I feel that I should have ended it all when I was 14.I achieved nothing but pain and misery. I never had SO or friends and I am too afraid of meeting anyone. I have no friends so I will affect even less people than a normal person would. In the end, I can say that I am happy that all of you continue your struggle everyday but I lost my hope for recovery and this may be the end of the journey for me. Nobody knows about my thoughts so I will just wait for a time when I will be completely alone and do it.
