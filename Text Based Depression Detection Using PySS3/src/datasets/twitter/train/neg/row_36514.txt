New year new youTo all of you feeling alone out there, that all hope is lost and 2020 is going to be the same purposeless year that youâ€™ve had every single year of your life, stay strong. I wonâ€™t ever be able to understand the pain that youâ€™re going through but if u need anything just remember that there are people who are willing to listen, help and support u. Focusing on the little victories each day will help you get by and I believe one day youâ€™ll make it out:) 

Just a small note of encouragement to all u beautiful people out there
