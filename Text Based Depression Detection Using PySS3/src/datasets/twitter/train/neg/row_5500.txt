No matter what I do - I just canâ€™t seem to get traction in life. So, it leaves one solution.Iâ€™ve never posted here before - I didnâ€™t even know this sub existed until four minutes ago. Iâ€™m tired - exhausted - beaten - lifeless. I have a near perfect hand in life - Iâ€™m good looking, charming, caring, kind - but Iâ€™m also labored with a insufferable amount of pain and agony - shame and regret. 

What cripples me most - is seeing that few, if anyone, ever survives this. This is what we have - this is who we are - this is what defines us - we are destined to fulfill our existence - alone, fragmented, screaming in pain inside the lonely echo chamber. 

My chest is heavy - my eyes dead. 

I have family and I have friends - but no one wants the responsibility of dealing with this - and I understand. 

My soul is already dead - Iâ€™m just waiting for the body to follow.
