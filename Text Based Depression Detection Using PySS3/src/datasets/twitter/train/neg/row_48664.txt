I'm giving it ten yearsI guess none of yall have to take me seriously since I'm not a threat *tonight*. But this year has been absolute hell, and part of that is because I realized that things have *been* hell for years - I just always ignored it or didn't realize what was wrong. 

They've been bad for my 21 years... a quarter of my life... so why should they get any better? That's just not how my life works apparently. So I'm giving it ten years. If it's not better by then, I'm out. 

My five year plan involves getting a real job, moving out of my hometown and away from the family who has caused me so much pain, and getting married (hopefully to my current partner). Five years is the goal, but I'm giving it ten just to be safe. I'd like to leave the country by the end of my ten years, but I don't know if that's my deciding factor in whether or not I'll off myself. 

Like I mentioned, my family has absolutely ruined my life. My childhood was taken away, and now the prime of my life is being ruined too. I hate them all, except maybe my sister. They can't help me. My partner already listens to enough of my bitching about mental health, and I know it's going to push him away if I keep it up. I started seeing a therapist a few weeks back, but he's not really helpful. Progress so far has been disgustingly slow. I'm better off coping on my own.

I'm just so sick of fighting. I'm so fucking tired of hoping and dreaming that one day I'll be happy, and then when I finally feel like things may be getting better, something bad happens and it's all stolen violently away. I just want to be happy. Please, fuck, let me be happy. If I can't be happy in ten years, which is such a long time away, then I don't see the point in prolonging the suffering.
