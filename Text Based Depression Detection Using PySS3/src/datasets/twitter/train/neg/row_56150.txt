I want to stop drinking but at the same time I don't want to stopI lost my best friend.  In reality, she was all I had. I haven't talked to my family in a long time and don't have an interest to reconnect... it was a messy childhood. I don't have any other friends.. I think she made me co-dependent.. this is the first week in a long time where I haven't had a text.. theres no one. 

I'm not looking for a new friend.. no.

Anyway, my now ex best friend said she didn't want to be my friend anymore because of how much of a piece of shit I become when I drink. She said I am verbally abusive... and I can see how I am. I get drunk sometimes and hate her almost as much as I hate myself. ... I hate her life choices and how I'm always the bad guy.. I feel like I was better before I met her... but at the same time... in a different way better now... like I was emotionally better before her but my image.. my lifestyle.. is better now. 

I feel I'm ranting. I'm sorry 

I don't know. I've felt this hopeless before, but I've never been this lonely before.. not this feeling. I mean I've driven across many a state and city and town and village before.. alone but I've never been truly alone and maybe that's why I'm writing a post... to not feel alone.. i don't know

I want to kill myself.. but at the same time I don't.. and thats not because I fear what comes next or because I'm scared of the process... no...  I just want it to be quick.. and I don't own a gun because I've never been a fan of them... I'm on the highest floor of my apartment but I don't think I jump will kill me. I don't have the luxury of crashing my own car.. and not going to hope a car hits me.. because I might survive that.. I just want a quick way out.. and I don't have one..

but I have alcohol. 

Maybe I'll get the courage to figure a way out.

sorry to waste your time
