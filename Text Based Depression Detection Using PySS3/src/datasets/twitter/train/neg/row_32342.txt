My reasons are fading.I have 3 reasons I haven't done it yet.
1.my boyfriend
2.my best friend
3.my cat

I'm 100% sure those are the only 3 "people" that would never forgive me for doing it. Everyone else would be sad and say "she's at rest now". I can't stand to be hated by the only 3 I love. But the more I think about it they'd be fine.

My boyfriend: he would be sad at first. He would grieve. He would even cry. Then he would be mad at me for leaving him alone. But eventually he would move on. Finish his studies and find a nice partner and have a happy life. 

My best friend: she would cry. For days, she would be so mad at me and her health would get bad. But she would live. And move on and find other friends. Because she has a good support system.

My cat: she'd be fine. My mom would feed her. Take care of her. She would forget me soon enough.

I haven't told them they're the only reason I haven't killed myself yet. I don't think it would be fair for them to have that pressure on them in case we argue or whatever. I don't want them to think they have to choose the right words or filter themselves or anything just because I want to do it. 

Also, they would get blamed. They would get asked did you know? And if they said yes they would get asked why didn't they tell anyone? Why didn't they do something? 

I don't want that. I just want peace. I don't wanna be here anymore.
