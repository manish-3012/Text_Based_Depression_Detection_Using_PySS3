I can't take it anymoreI've been lonely and alone for 5 years now and all my friends and family have told me I'm too focused on relationships all the while they're enjoying theirs. No one takes my longing for love and intimacy seriously and they just dictate to me that all I care about is romance, invalidating every other desire and need I have.

 My mom told me it's probably because I'm ugly. I tend to agree with her. I've spent thousands on makeovers of my appearance, gotten in shape and spent weeks and tons of money on dating apps since Covid restricts me. I don't get any attention. 

I just want to be loved, to love in a way that mere friendship doesn't allow. And it's been so many years, I just want to die. I feel so unwanted and misunderstood. I even have a way, the gas stove in my place. I think I want to blow myself up. Everyone I've ever loved hasn't felt the same. I can't wait any longer. To hell with the people saying I need to "focus on myself" in their generic unhelpful responses. This is the end for me.
