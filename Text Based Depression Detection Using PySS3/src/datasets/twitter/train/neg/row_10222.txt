Last year and a half - mum died, grandma died, fired twice.I got fired from the job that turned it all around for me yesterday. The worst part is I know it genuinely wasnâ€™t my fault but politics got the better of me. 

I canâ€™t do this anymore. I donâ€™t want to put any effort into trying to fix this.
