Happy thoughtsItâ€™s been a tough few weeks. I confided in a couple friends that Iâ€™d been feeling suicidal. We made plans for this week that Iâ€™m off. It gave me something to look forward to. Now my week off from work is here and all of them canceled. It seems silly but itâ€™s really affecting me and causing my depression to get worse.
