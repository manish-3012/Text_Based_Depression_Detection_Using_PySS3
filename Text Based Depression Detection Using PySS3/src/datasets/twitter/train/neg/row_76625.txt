where's a rock to smash over your head into a bloody pulp when you need one?i think at this point suicide is inevitable, it's just a matter of when. one day all of this bullshit is going to become too fucking much and i'm going to snap and end it. no one would give a fuck and i kind of like it that way. i'm the only one who comforts myself every single fucking day, so who fucking cares? the only thing that numbs it at this point is drugs and booze, but even when i'm fucked up i'm just so bored and tired of that too that it just makes me feel worse. I try to think of reasons to even stick around, but honestly all my friends and family would be better off. they wouldn't sse it at first, of course, but in due time they'll realize i'm just as scummy as the rest. i'm in so much pain that it makes me feel nothing. I've been a ghost for years, so why not make it official?
