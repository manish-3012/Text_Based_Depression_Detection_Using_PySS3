Just want to have an in-depth discussion. This will have many tangents(I'm new to Reddit, so any advices as far as that goes would be nice) Sooo, teen here. Suicidal here. But it's not the pain that's getting me persay, it's ideas that are getting me. I tend to ask alot of questions, the simple or straight forward ones getting answered. What's left over is the hard and abstract questions. I've grew this conception that if no one has an answer, then you're just as right as the next guy if you give one. So I've been giving some answers and I've ended up here. I really need to just see a different angle on some of these. So I'll get straight to it without further delay
*What does it matter if I die or not? (As far as you care to look, of course)
*What's the meaning of life?

I think I'll start with those, they will definitely break into subcategories which will divide yet again. I would just like for some people to help me figure out what mess is up here in my brain. AMA


UPDATE: After a failed attempt, it looks like I'm here to stay. I started another thread, which I will now give priority over this one.
