Why?I'm at a breaking point, mentally, emotionally, physically. In school, in my relationships. In my health and appearance. In my habits. 

My room is terrifying, disgusting, a blight to look at. I don't have the energy to clean it up. I want to, I think about it all the time, but I don't do it.

My skin is ruined now and forever thanks to my compulsive picking. My oil glands are all confused, my pores are huge and scarred, my skin is dry and acne-ridden and nothing will fix it. It was perfect before I ruined it.

My GPA is 1.7 and falling. I made 2090 on my SATs; how did it come to this? I skipped everything after my midterm last semester. It's 5 weeks into this semester and I've skipped a week completely, 6 days of one class in particular...

I'm diagnosed with a handful of mental disorders and I fear I have just experienced my first psychotic/schizoid break, I'm not sure. But the evidence is strong and I am terrified.

I never believed in God or an afterlife, so I've never tried to take my life. Ending my life would not end my suffering, merely ensure my family suffered in my absence, you know? 

But I believe now. I believe in the Universe and I'm tired of being here on this planet. I want to set my consciousness free from these mortal coils...
