Iâ€™m 19 years old and a lost causeIâ€™m a failure. I was destined to fail the second I was born. No matter what I do I always fail and mess up. I know my mother is disappointed in me everyone is. I do nothing with my life. Iâ€™m jobless I have social anxiety and this makes me feel forever hopeless. I do nothing to help my self because I realise that there isnâ€™t any point in doing so. Iâ€™m drinking my self to death hoping that kills me sooner rather than later. Iâ€™ve got nothing Iâ€™ve lost everybody that actually gave a fuck about me and now Iâ€™ve only got my self.
