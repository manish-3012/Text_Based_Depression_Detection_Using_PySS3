I feel like such an asshole.Why am I so sad? Why the fuck should I even be sad? I don't have the right to. I grew up so blessed by life to be in a house with two loving parents who have provided everything I could ever need and more. I went to a nice college and got my degree, and hell, I even got turned down by an employer because I was so overqualified for the position I applied for. By all measures, I have a bright future ahead of me, and yet I feel so down in the dumps about even trying to last another day. I feel like I've come too far, done too much, to give up now and kill myself, but it's the only thing I can think of day after day, hour after hour, minute after minute.

If I killed myself tomorrow I'd be throwing away everything anyone has ever done to help me and all I can think is, "What a waste." My life feels like an amalgamation of wasted years and wasted time, moving into a blank future with seemingly nothing exciting to look forward to. I've lived these last few years trying to do as much good as I can in the world to maybe bring feeling and worth back into it, to no avail. I regularly give blood, I try to help whenever anyone needs it, hell, I even gave my bone marrow to some absolute stranger without a second thought, but still I feel empty inside. No good that I do ever seems to measure up and match the darkness welling inside me. Ultimately, I feel like I'm fighting an uphill struggle, but it's like I can feel my muscles giving way beneath me, while everything life can throw at me piles up on my trembling and failing shoulders.

I'm staring Death in the face and I don't feel the fear I used to.
