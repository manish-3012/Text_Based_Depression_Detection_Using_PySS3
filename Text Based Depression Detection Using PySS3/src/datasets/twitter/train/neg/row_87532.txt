Thanks for everythingHe's gone. I guess I should've take a hint when he didn't write anything for the last two nights while he's been up working like he always do. I don't want to go through a long break up process then die. I will single handedly take care of it all. Well it's time to do it. I am suprised I even lasted this long but honestly I would much prefer if I just died on my 18th birthday. I should have seen it coming once again it's my fault for not planning things enough. I will end it all on February 13th. It was the day when we shared the first intimacy and I think it's a good day in general. I will just leave the ring on a table wear my best dress and put on some make up then I will take the final step of my life. I am feeling pretty relieved now that I've arranged a date and even thought of a dress. I am still not sure about the place but it has to be somewhere in which I can see the sea one last time. If anybody is reading this, think of me as someone who just rage quitted a game. And think of this post if you see a news about a poor 3rd world country girl taking his own life. But also think that now I will be at least completly happy for the first time of my life. I had a fun time hanging around here and most of you guys are good people. Thank you for having me and don't waste your chance like me. Don't give up and be stronger. I am sorry I couldn't be. It's just one of my many flaws. That's it, I guess. I would like to say "see you on the other side" but since there isn't any I will just say goodbye friends.
