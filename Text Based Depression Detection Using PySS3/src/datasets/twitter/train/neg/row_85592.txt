Spouse in crisis. Any support/advice is appreciatedMy wife is currently in inpatient psychiatric care. She has a history of PTSD, Anxiety &amp; Depression and attempted suicide a few years before we met. She has been committed twice. Since we've been together she stopped taking her meds and managed fairly well without any therapy or medication. We have a 2-year old and she is the best mom ever to her.  


Over the past couple years, her depression/anxiety has started to come back. She has been apprehensive about seeking care due to the emotional stress it takes to recall all of her sexual assault instances and food issues imposed on her from her narcissist mother. So she has been "squashing it down" in order to carry on. Unfortunately a few recent events have fallen hard on her and she has become unable to function. She feels like a burden and that our family would be better off without her. Recently she has been crying in the morning because she's upset that she woke up. She says she doesn't have "a plan" however she told me that she went looking for my old bottle of Percocets just to see if they were there. I convinced her to go in for evaluation and they opted for inpatient.  


She's only seen one doctor so far in this facility but he shamed her for not reporting her sexual assault and suggested that her use of cannabis could be causing her depression/anxiety which is quite honestly bullshit. They may want to keep her longer than 7 days. I requested she not see that doctor again but I'm just worried that we made the wrong choice in going to this facility. I don't know what to do now. I love her so much and keep telling her how much we need her in our lives. I feel like these doctors are making it worse.
