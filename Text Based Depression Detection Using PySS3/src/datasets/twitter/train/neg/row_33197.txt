Almost 22 with nothing to look forward toIâ€™m 21 and I have no purpose. Iâ€™m not nice to look at. Iâ€™m not good at anything. I was considered â€œgiftedâ€ as a kid and it turns out I really donâ€™t have a gift. I want to enjoy things. I want to get my curiosity back. But Iâ€™m really bad at everything Iâ€™ve ever tried. Iâ€™m getting mediocre grades at a mediocre school. I donâ€™t have any close friends. I got fired from a bullshit part time job. I have no use to the world. I have no purpose. I graduate in a few months and I have no plans and I have had no internships and Iâ€™m not even interested in my major. All my friends are doing so well and I have to pretend to be happy for them while I lay around and give up on my life. Iâ€™m going to kill myself before I turn 22 in May. Any tips on how to make this hurt my close knit and caring family less? I hurt them a lot by being alive and not being happy or successful but Iâ€™m so afraid that my death will tear them apart. I love them so much but Iâ€™m sick of being the family disappointment and I donâ€™t think there is anything I can do to fix my life. I am almost 22 and havenâ€™t done anything to mold a career of a life path for myself. There is no hope for me. My future is so bleak and I think it might hurt my family less to end it now rather than be a burden and a beacon of shame forever. But I really donâ€™t want to hurt them at all.
