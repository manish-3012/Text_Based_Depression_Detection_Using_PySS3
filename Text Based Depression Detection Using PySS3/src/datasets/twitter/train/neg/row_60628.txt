Making efforts or plans for the future seems pointless as I'm not going to live a happy life anywaysThere is a mental state I have lived in for years now that has entered the Unbreakable Stage recently. It's the "who cares, nothing I do will make me happy anyway" mental state.

I have suffered it for a long time but it wasn't until very recently that it reached the next level. This condition used to be "my life will be imperfect, but maybe I should push forward anyways" but now it has evolved into "my life will never be happy and it is pointless to try anything".

And it's not a joke. Considering recent events in my life, there is nothing that can make me happy or satisfied with my existence after this. From now on there is only either pain or death.
