i feel so dirty.i finally got myself to clean my place after i think 6 or 7 months and i feel so dirty, i shower maybe once or twice a week and i wonder how people can stand me. I feel like pure filth and crap, i live by myself and my place is like a garbage can, im not even done finishing, and i just feel like im not worth it. i barely manage to pay rent, the only foodi can afford is dollar noodles, and i have no friends, theres no one i can talk to with honestly and let it all out. this is the first time ive ever told anyone how i feel. i ran away from home when i was 18 but i cant kill myself cause everytime i remember my mom and i just cant bring myself to do it.
