I think I'm actually going to do it...Hello.

I believe this will be hard to explain, but let me try.

I am 17. I have clinical depressin and Aspergers. I have constant migrains and I am unable to hold my stools. It seems pretty funny, now that I'm reading that back, but it's not. I have no friends and I despise romantic relationships. I hate the sun, I hate the outside world so I spend most of my time in my bed with curtains down. I can't wake up in the morning and I can't go to sleep at night. I can't force myslef to do anything useful. I have been goin to both a psychologist and a psychiatrist over a year now, and it's of no help to me.

I think I'm actually going to kill myself. If not today, maybe tomorrow or in a month. Maybe even in a year. But I know I will do it some day.

Are there any other options?
