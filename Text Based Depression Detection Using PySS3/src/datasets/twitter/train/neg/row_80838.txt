Posted here 11 months back. Now i am back with UPDATEhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/70ghu7/been_feeling_empty_inside_for_10_years_and/

Hello, 

I posted here 11 months back to almost an year back and felt like coming back here again with my UPDATE of what has happened in the last year. 

First thing's first, 

I had second child and i can't be happier right now, the responsibilities are more but im really happy. 

We also kept a parttime cook, who cooks afternoon and evening meals for us and that way me and my wife can take care of our kids. My work is also going alright and i haven't better better than this in a LONG LONG TIME. 

Yes, i am facing few small issues like bit of cash flow issue but such is life. Sometimes i have more than enough cash sometimes less. Its okay i guess. 

But yeah, i guess i am feeling a lot better now. 

Also, one most important thing i found out was, recently i got fever and doctor had me run some tests and we found that i was ANEMIC with Haemoglobin of 10.36 , IRON at 37 (Range 65-100) and SGPT at 120 (Liver Inflammation) and i feel like this could have been another HUGE reason of why i felt lethargic , fatigued and generally not interested in life. 

Since i am some Ayurvedic (Not chemicals, mostly plants) medication to help with Haemoglobin and Vitamins &amp; IRON deficiency, i feel like a new SOUL inside me and i have lot a hell lot better. 

I suggest that people who are depressed should also get their HAEMOGLOBIN tested so that they know that they are actually not feeling TOO DEPRESSED due to anemia. 

Thanks and Best Regards, 

Any comments and discussions would be greatly appreciated and help me get through this once and for all. 

Love you all for your help. A lot of you messaged me personally and that really turned the tide.
