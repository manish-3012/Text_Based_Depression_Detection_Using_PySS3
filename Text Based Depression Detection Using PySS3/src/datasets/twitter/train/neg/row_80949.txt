RantAnother kid at my college just killed himself. Since Iâ€™ve started school and then subsequently graduated weâ€™ve had 10 people end their lives. And all people can say is the same bullshit every time:  â€œso sad, sending thoughts and prayers their way!â€ Oh yeah, because thoughts and prayers will really make a difference to anyone in that situation. Fuck I hate that hollow gesture so god damn much. These people donâ€™t really care but they say that in a public forum just so they themselves look good. Why not just keep your mouth shut or send your condolences to the family privately instead of making a spectacle of an already upsetting thing.
