How do I go about checking myself into a mental hospital?I've been suicidal for a long time and my plan has just been to wait it out. after 6 years I realized I can't take another month of this. My life has been going to work, day dream about killing myself or how to, coming home and talking to people or whatever to keep my mind off things until bed. I've seen therapists and have taken antidepressants before and neither helped. I want to jump right into a mental hospital but I have no clue how to do it.
