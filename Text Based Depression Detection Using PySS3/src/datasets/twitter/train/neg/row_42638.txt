Nothingness after death seems perfectI, like many of you have recurring thoughts of ending it. I don't have a good reason, and many of you are in worse situations than me. 

I'm actually very lucky. I am nice looking, muscular body, lots of good friends, and a family which backs me up. I got the best girlfriend(since yesterday an ex), and educating to become what I love. But there is this feeling that comes every now and again that makes everything heavy. It makes it painful, and I cannot describe the reason, since there isn't any.

I feel like I do dumb decisions a lot, breaking up with my girl being one of them. I don't want to suicide for others to notice(although that would be nice), but the thought of nothing coming after is great. Forever gone? Yeah I'll take that, being nothing before I was born went fast as fuck.

I've talked to my girl about it, and she tries to comfort me. I've talked to some bros about it, and they take it very seriously. But the feeling never truly goes away, no matter how much fun and adventures I take.

I don't know why I'm typing this, and this is not a suicide note. I bet more of you feel this way, but I just thought it might help typing it out you know? Like sending a hate email to your boss and then deleting it before you press send
