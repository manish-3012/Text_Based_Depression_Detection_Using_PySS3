I Need AdviceEver since I was young I've always longed for the experiences the other girls my age where experiencing. like having a boyfriend and kissing someone other than your parents. I've never felt like I had a place in the world and i never had many friends. I've been a victim to bullying and abuse. For years now I've wanted to end my life. I have even tried a couple of times. Like just last week I spent some time in RUH. Or as I call it the mental hospital. I'm tired of constantly suffering in my life and need a way to end it without hurting my family because i can't take it anymore. I've suffered too much.
