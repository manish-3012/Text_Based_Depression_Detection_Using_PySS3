Why did I buy a gun?It's the worst purchase I've ever made.

It's not even my plan. I was going to do something more in the way of inert gas and an exit bag with benzos.

But that takes setup. This just sits there in its box ready, and the only reason I dont is because it's so hard to get out of bed when my head aches like this.
