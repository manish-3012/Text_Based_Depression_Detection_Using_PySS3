Afraid yet WillingI'm tired of it,Life. I haven't Lived in so long. Just survived..kept myself breathing. I don't remember what it was like to not have to pretend to be happy. To actually truly feel happiness. I feel dead inside.
I told myself that I'd do it once I finish my degree next year(at least mom and dad won't think of me as a complete failure)
But now, I'm just done with it. I can't keep doing this...
I hurt myself..that helps sometimes...
But i want to do it..I can't keep living like this.
Somebody help me..
Give me a painless death.
