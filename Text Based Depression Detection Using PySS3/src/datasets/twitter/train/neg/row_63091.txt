Uhm so I'm trying to get myself to call the suicide hotline but I have too much anxiety to to through it and would like some help/advice.As I said, I started calling the hotline but once the automated message came on my anxiety really spiked, I could hardly breath and had to hang up.

As it's roughly 4am here and the whole coronavirus lock down is happening I can't get help from elsewhere. I'm just really scared to actually talk to someone, since I never talk to anyone about my problems. I came to a realization that I either need to get help or I will actually kill myself. If I can't get myself to do something about I know that I will kill myself.

Has anyone reading this called a hotline before? Did it go well? Was it really awkward when you first started the call? Did they know what they were doing?

I'm really nervous they'll talk to me and realize how completely unstable I am and hospitalize me. Last time I talked to someone for help I was instantly thrown in the hospital. I tried to kill myself in January, still haven't told anyone I know about it. I also already have a plan for how I will kill myself and can do it anytime as I live alone in a dorm room.

I just don't want it to be awkward or to get put in the hospital as my school year is almost over and I have a bunch of school work I have to finish.
