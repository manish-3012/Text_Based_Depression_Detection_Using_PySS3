Is this the right place for me to go..?I hope I can get some advice. I'm in a kind of fucked up situation.
My mom has been talking about suicide a few times by now (it's like she's just talking to herself and not noticing me whenever she mentioned it) and has become more and more depressed. I see how she's spiraling down and I just sit there and watch.

Her childhood was a mess after her mom died when she was eleven. From everything I know she must be traumatized and I think that's what started all of this.

I am afraid to talk to her directly about it since it would most likely make her feel like she failed at parenting because me, the kid, shouldn't have to be concerned about the mom.

In addition to that, her mood is affecting me a lot. I've caused her so much trouble and I can't always look at her and smile, even though I should. That's making it hard for myself to spend more time with her.

Do you have any ideas how I could passively help my mom? I'm just in a very bad state myself right now and my grades are getting worse. Its causing her even more trouble.

I know that's like the worst conditions to help her but do you have advice anyway?
