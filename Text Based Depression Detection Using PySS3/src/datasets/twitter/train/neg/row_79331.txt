Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™m giving myself two months to get better, and if not, Iâ€™ll kill myself.Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was 12. Into my teenage years, it progressively got more severe. Iâ€™m at the point where I donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth trying anymore. I donâ€™t think anybody really cares about me, Iâ€™m failing school, I hate myself in every way, I can barely get out of bed, I constantly fail at things or give up good opportunities, I canâ€™t focus on anything without getting distracted by thoughts of the few times I was happy, and how Iâ€™ll never have those moments again. I was briefly happy when I was with my ex boyfriend. He gave me a reason to live. Since he left and wants nothing to do with me, I struggle to find reasons again. I know it sounds stupid thatâ€™s breakup is whatâ€™s pushing me over the edge, but he was the only light in my world of darkness. Iâ€™d been contemplating suicide for the past few years, and I guess I feel like now itâ€™s time. I got to experience a little bit of happiness earlier this year, and for that I am thankful. But since then I have fallen into a hole deeper than I could ever imagine. I know what itâ€™s like to be a little happy, and it makes being in this state so much worse. I know what Iâ€™m missing.

Iâ€™m tired and I cry every day. I canâ€™t escape my thoughts. I donâ€™t know who to talk to about this. My therapist moved away. When I try to tell my mom how I feel she threatens to put me in a mental institution. I could talk to my friends, but I donâ€™t want to burden them with this. All I have is myself and my thoughts which tell me itâ€™s time.
