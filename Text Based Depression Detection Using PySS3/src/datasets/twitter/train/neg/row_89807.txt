I need help for my friendMy friend is in a huge mess and I donâ€™t know what to do and Iâ€™m kind a panicking. She is in a group of friends that are extremely toxic and always force her to do things she doesnâ€™t want to do. Her dad is abusive and is going to jail for drugs but is stuck in there house while he goes to court. She says her parents donâ€™t love her and has started cutting and scratching. I just donâ€™t know what to do or how to help her because she thinks she canâ€™t tell anyone or her dad would get mad. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
