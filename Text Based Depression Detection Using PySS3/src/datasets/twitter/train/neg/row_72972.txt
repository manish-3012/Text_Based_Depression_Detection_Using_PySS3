Hey.I've decided how I'd go about it, if I were to do it. I've been depressed for a while and having suicidal thoughts for some time now. Never realistic, though. Always impulsive, always in passing. Never something I'd consider doing. Until just now, that is. I've been thinking - if I do reach that point, I'll buy a ticket to St.Petersberg in the middle of winter and I'll go for a walk along the shore until I stop being cold. I'll die a silly tourist.

Lucky me, though. I merely have a plan, not quite the guts to do it. Not yet, anyways, but I figure this is a major step. A year ago, suicide was ugly, six months ago, a fantasy. A brief escape into the ludicrous. The winter is almost over. 

Still, I wanted to share. To maybe read something and smile in response. Likely, I just wanted to share this thought which I can't share. It'd be a fitting death, though. An illusion. A last mirage for a year of mirages.
