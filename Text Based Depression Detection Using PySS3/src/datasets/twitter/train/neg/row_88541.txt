Feels like a dilemma to end all dilemmasI have a mental disorder. Undiagnosed because I refuse to talk about it to anyone professional but there is something seriously wrong with me. I have no idea what it is and I'm at my witsend trying to manage it.

Im having some sort of episode. Im depressed, i cant stop thinking about suicide. I am filled with this weird persisting energy.. This drive, this focus that is very odd when compared to the crushing depression. 

I had this idea, of flying to Arizona and killing myself in the desert. I have crunched the numbers, made the plans. Its so illogical but yet i feel called to do this. That doing this will solve my problems. 

I need help, i need an intervention. But the problem is getting help will ruin my life just as killing myself would. It seems that it would actually be worse because getting help means I have to pick up the fall out. I have no idea what to do. I dont *want* to die.. But losing everything i have struggled to build will kill my resolve to go keep fighting. I dont understand what is going on and I am scared
