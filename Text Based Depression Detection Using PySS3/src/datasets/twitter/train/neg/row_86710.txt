My flatmate is about to commit suicide and I don't know what to do anymoreOkay so my flatmate struggles with suicidal thought for years now, he also came from abusive family(his single mother is abusive to be more exact). He came to a point when he refuses any help - he always been like that, but not to this extent, he didn't eat for days now. He doesn't want any professional help or to call a hotline and immediately closes off if asked about it. So now I'm only talking to him about his thoughts, without judging him and validating his feelings. But I think that today was a breaking point because I cried in my room about it and he figured it out, I feel so bad for breaking off(I know it's not an excuse but I myself struggle with severe depression, but I'm on medication and I'm also taking therapy so I usually share my feelings only with him, but because of the pandemic i didn't talk to him for month so it became too hard for me to handle, affecting my physical health). He got very upset and felt like a burden so I only added more to his struggles.
I don't know what to do anymore because I feel like there is nothing more I can do about it but I'm the only person that he can rely on atm. He told me he's gonna kill himself very soon and I feel like it's gonna be tonight and I'm so scared, what should I do? I already talked to him again but it didn't go well because of what happened today earlier on he was more hostile. I didn't push him to talk, I was listening and acknowledging what he was talking to me about. I reassured him I'm here if he needs anything. What should I do? Im scared to go to sleep but I have to at some point because I need to get to work and my job doesn't allow me to take days off. Idk if there is anything more really at this point. If he doesn't do it today he's gonna do it like tomorrow or so, he seems the most determined about it he ever been before and there were some braking points before.
