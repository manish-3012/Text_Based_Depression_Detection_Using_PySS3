Looking for some input on some thoughts1)  I know I am not clinically depressed, I am able to get up, eat food, bathe, take care of myself, I even managed to graduate college today, but I still feel really sad about my life.  I have a limited social circle and I feel like I am going to end up to be alone for the rest of my life and this frightens me, however being in social environments with new people gives me small amounts of anxiety and I don't socialize well.  I'm not really sure what to think about that.

2)  On the point of being alone for the rest of my life, I'm thinking suicide is the only real valid way out of this.  I don't necessarily want to die, but it's either suicide or living alone for the rest of my life (and I don't want that).  So what if I where to be able to pay off my student loans and take care of the rest of my rent and even leave behind a few thousand dollars for my parents in cash, then take a gun and kill myself somewhere in the middle of the woods.  Ideally they wouldn't find my body or have a funeral and there wouldn't be any expense, they would take the money and except that I'm gone and forget about me.  Would it work that way?  Would there be other costs to my death that I do not for see?  do they need to find my body to get a death certificate, do they even need one?  Could they just not even report my death?  I guess I would like to know what would be the best way to arrange things so that when I die it wouldn't cost my family anything other then grief.

thoughts?
