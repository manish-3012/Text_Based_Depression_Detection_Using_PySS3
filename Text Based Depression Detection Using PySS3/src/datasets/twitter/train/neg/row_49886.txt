Found a reliable source.. I have never felt happier.I finally found a reliable source who sold me what I needed, it came in the mail today and I am ecstatic. It's becoming so much more real to me now, I have everything ready, my anti-emetics my.. stuff.. I just have to plan a date now, but I seem to not be able to do it, I feel as though I am content with the way things are now, I can always opt-out now that I have my N powder. I think I can live? I never thought I would say that, but I think I can.. I am in such distress, what was the point of ordering everything to end it, to then just keep postponing my attempt.. I feel weak and stupid for wasting my money but im also very happy that I finally have it as a back up. However, I hope something will take me over so that I'll still do it impulsively, cause in the end all I really want is the pain to stop.. But life is so beautiful. And my family is so precious. It's complicated.
