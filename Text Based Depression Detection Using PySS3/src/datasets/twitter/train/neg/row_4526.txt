Waking up in misery every day soon to finally be over. Maybe understandable to othersHi, i would just like to type this as maybe  someone will read it, even if not than its ok. It will be kind of lengthy but I will make it somewhat reader friendly not just a block of text.  I will be dead in a matter of a few days, I will not post how because I do not want to give anyone ideas how but it is 100% success rate. Somewhat painless, but there is always pain with death,

I am mid 20's birthday next week, but I know I will not see the birthday.  I have nothing, and when I say nothing I mean nothing. My bank account has 3 cents in it. The only reason I have a roof over my head and food is because i am fortunate to have parents who are willing to take in their loser of a son. I see a psychiatrist, Ive expressed my feelings but I guess he doesnt take me seriously. Im on benzodiazpenes and gabapentin tried so many anti depressants its not even funny, they helped a little bit in the beginning but my dose has not been increased in 3 years (thanks DEA fuck you!).

Ive had 1 fucked up relationship in my entire life (not even really a relationship so technically ive never had a partner), I was 16 and she was 41. She degraded me and would call me names. Including calling me a "joke". I had severe mental breakdown after this went on for way too long. I was in college and had student loans with leftover money so I went into drugs and escorts. The escorts purpose of just sex got old and eventually I could not even get it up sometimes and it felt good to just talk to a girl. A few actually maybe enjoyed my conversation as they would text me when they were lonely on the road, and they were not coming back to my area so they knew no more money was coming from me. I thought of killing this woman who degraded me, but I realized that this would just make her win more because everyone would feel bad for her and shed be painted as a hero. I have no intentions in harming anyone besides myself.

Fast forward 4 years to now, money dried out, credit cards in default, "friends" disappeared. no degree no jobI have nobody to talk to, not even my own brother. Parents have had enough of me.all i have is music. Everyone is gone, my sadness has turned into rage. I talk and scream to myself, I have permanent nerve damage in a finger from cutting it (i lied and said i cut it cleaning a glass) the only time I leave the house is to see my psychiatrist and pick up my meds. (rare occasions of getting food and supplies). I hear in my head constantly that "im a joke".

On top of everything I hate my physical appearance, Ive let myself go, and am balding. Ive always been embarrassed about my penis and now it looks only smaller because im fat. But it was small in the beginning so what does it really matter anyways? (size doesnt matter is bullshit and we all know it) I couldnt fathom taking my pants off in front of anyone now, it doesnt seem realistic and I havent had sex in 4 years. Balding so young is terrible as well, i look so much better with hair These things bother very much and make me lack the confidence to continue on. I have stretch marks EVERYWHERE. Im an alcoholic now, I drink as much as I can afford my neighbors on my street are nice enough to let me take back their deposits and keep the money, thats how I afford to drink.

Ive came across some money( it was a few hundred dollars but that mineswel been few million) and have decided to finally end the pain of waking up everyday and being in misery. I dont have any money to leave anyone but I wrote some deep letters to the few people around that might even give a shit about me. Accepting the fact I will be dead soon, has made me feel more happy than I ever been. The health problem I have (long to explain but gives me headaches everyday because bad sinuses) will be finally fucking gone. Ive been enjoying some narcotics Ive always wanted to try but detered from in the past for "moral reasons".  Thats my story, and its real talk, no bs. I look forward to finally being at peace.

Goodbye.
