I canâ€™t deal with the pain anymoreIâ€™ve been diagnosed with CPTSD from some childhood issues. I live in a lot of mental pain always, but over the past year itâ€™s gotten so much worse. Iâ€™ve developed incredibly intense panic attacks which are just so bad, they make me physically sick, vomit, and cry for hours on end. 

I try to do everything right - I take my medication, I go to therapy, I try to eat well, go to the gym, but nothing works. Iâ€™m not getting better and I feel them getting more intense. It rules my life and I just donâ€™t have fun anymore. A good day is a day I donâ€™t suffer from one. I hate just feeling that my whole life is just trying to fight this. 

I have just had one and attempted to end it. I got in my car and drove as fast as I could before I realised what I was doing. However, something tells me this might not be the last time I do something like that. Life is not getting better and I know itâ€™s going to get so much worse. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I think everyone around me is just getting sick of it and is about to leave. 

Iâ€™m just running out of hope.
