Facing reality and being around the shitty people in my life aka my family and having no friends makes me want to shoot myselfI wish I could just find a gun and shoot myself. So many people treat me like shit or like I'm disposable and the only thing I wanna do is just end my life. Why should I live in a world where no one wants me or cares that I'm here? Let's say that they DO somehow care that im here...but that's as far as it goes. They care that I exist because if I were to suddenly be dead, then it would make their life hard. As long as I exist that's all that matters.

But when I die, they only care because I hurt them. Not because of how they made me hurt when I was here.
