Iâ€™m pretty sure I donâ€™t want to die.. but I donâ€™t want to live this life anymore, and I canâ€™t think of any other way out other than ending it all.I hate feeling like Iâ€™m such a bad person. My wife lets me know it. I do all I can for her and the kids, but I feel like Iâ€™m always the one who is the bad guy and I just canâ€™t go on living like this. She makes me feel awful. I would feel horrible having to divorce her, so I just want to die right now and not have to face anything. 
But then if I did live and we did separate I could do all the things I canâ€™t do now and life would feel selfishly good again. But life feels like it canâ€™t be selfish. I just donâ€™t want to attempt this and it not work and I just hurt myself real bad. I just want it done. I donâ€™t want to have to deal with this.
