I want to know what the consequences will be if I take my life on someone elseâ€™s property. Is it better to do it on public grounds? Do death by suicide cases get investigated to find out why someone may have taken their own life? And if so, if there is evidence of someone asking for help and others ignoring this person, will there be legal consequences?
