There are armed security guards where i work.Every single day when i arrive at work i imagine ways of how i could grab his gun to kill myself. The good part is that no one thinks i'm suicidal and i know they all look at me like i'm just some dumb and harmless loser. It's always one per shift, but i work till the other one comes in. This one is way weaker and thin than the first one. It would be very simple to grab the gun from him and shoot myself in the head. For some reason, i'm feeling happy and not desperate thinking about this opportunity that i have so close to me.
