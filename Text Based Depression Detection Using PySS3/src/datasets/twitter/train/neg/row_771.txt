Trying this againI don't know why I'm still trying. I keep going back to the feeling of wanting to end it all. I've been trying for so long. I've posted on /r/SuicideWatch before. Everything just keeps getting worse. Everyone keeps saying it'll eventually get better, but for years and years it just keeps getting worse. I'll hold out hope and something will happen that will make me think things are finally getting better, and then the other shoe drops and the rug gets swept out of under me. I'm in so much pain. Every day I get more and more resigned to the fact that my only two options are to either end things or accept the fact that I will always be in pain and just learn to deal with it as a shell for the sake of other people. I've tried to get help so many times, and it's like yelling from inside a soundproof glass cage. I want help so badly. I don't know what else to do.
