self doubtIs one of the things that keep you on the ground and will kick you until you give up, maybe a thing you love or your life as a whole. I jumped a big step between selfdoubt and selfdestruct, also selfdoubt isnt the only one. Its only a part of your mindset. It is because of your lack of trust or selfesteem. Anyway you ended up here. Go out of your comfort zone, take a break, make a hobby, break a habit, it sounds impossible, ask someone for help otherwise you wont do it. But if you let your mindset be destroyed by the negativity, you failed as a person. If you feel suicide is the only way out, i am not going to stop you. Its your choice. But just tomorrow you couldhave found your ticket to heaven.
