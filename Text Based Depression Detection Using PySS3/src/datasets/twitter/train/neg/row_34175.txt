Just getting ready to do it. Almost done.I want to clean my room, pack all my bags and keep everything ready so they don't have to sort too much during my funeral. 
My life is okay except my SO treating me like shit, I know how much he has hurt me for five years I want to give him the same pain just once. I want him to know his douche egoistic behavior has consequences too.
