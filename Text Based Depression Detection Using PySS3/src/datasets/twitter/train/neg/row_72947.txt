I'm done. Time to toss in my chips, and send it home.Well, it's been fun lads. I know I am not going to get traction like everything else I ever post, so why not go one last time? A final memory to an insolent moron like myself. It's been fun, indeed it has. Or has it? Ehh not really. Oh well, nothing I can do about that. Nothing at all. All that's left now is to finish up MLP, and well, time to bite the dust after that.
