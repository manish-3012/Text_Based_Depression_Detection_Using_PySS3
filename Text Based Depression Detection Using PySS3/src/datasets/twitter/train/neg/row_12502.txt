Need some help on thisSo I've been looking at my best options with the main points being : accessible to me (no guns for example), high success rate and painless.
Here are the options I consider : 

A: 2.000 mg of Ambien 
+ Absolutely painless 
+ 100% success chances
- very expensive ~600 Swiss francs (literally all the money I have left)
- have to import it so might have extra costs and might be stopped at the Swiss border 

B : suicide bag with helium
+ Unconscious so painless
+ Very accessible just need to get some helium
- seems a bit sketchy, not much data about this method, so high chances of failure

C : jump from a high building
+ Easy to do an free
- not sure if I have access to a high enough building, and if I fuck this one up I'm very fucked

So what do you think, wich one should I choose ? Is there a good one I missed ? Is one of them a particularly bad option ? Suggestions ? Thanks for the help ! (Btw I don't wanna kill myself right now I just wanna have a plan in case it gets very bad) please comment
