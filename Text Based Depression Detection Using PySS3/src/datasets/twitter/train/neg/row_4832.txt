Did everything I could but death is the only way.How to start with this mess that I call life? Living in depression for the past 2 years. From the "clown" off the class to a guy that hides his pain with a fake smile and silly jokes. But it won't be for much more I just can't take it anymore. 

I already tried to talk to friends, search for my passions, follow my hobbies but it isn't enough the sadness and the regrets don't leave me. Everyday I wake up and the only thing that goes on my mind is "Oh still alive... Maybe next night".

Already tried to kill my self with an overdose of cocaine as you can tell it wasn't a good choise. I'm so useless and hopeless that I can't even kill myself. I fucked up everything I lost the ones I love, I fucked up my grades and lately the only way to hang around is using drugs. I may be surrounded with people and "having a good time" in the reality I'm completly lonely and sad. 

I just dont know anymore what to do. Maybe Death is the solution but I still can't end it. I'm just a coward.
