The mods are restricting your access to life-saving resources.I recently made a post about how the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline often has insane wait times, and that you can get through to an actual person much quicker by calling a local suicide hotline (any local suicide hotline in the US).

I even gave a link to a resource I discovered with 24/7 free local suicide hotlines across the US. My post was instantly hidden, and upon requesting the mods unhide it, was given a vague explanation that they "reserve posts here for requests for support", despite allowing posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jh16cw/the_suicide_hotline_keeps_hanging_up_on_me_lol/) one with &gt;200 upvotes (ironically, ranting about problems with the national suicide hotline). 

I just wanted to get the word out that there ARE other resources other than the national suicide prevention lifeline. If you're having trouble getting through, look up local suicide hotlines. It could just save your life.
