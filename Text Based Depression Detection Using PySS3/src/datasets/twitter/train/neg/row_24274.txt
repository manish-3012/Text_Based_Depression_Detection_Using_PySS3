DilemmaHi all,

So... I need some help. I donâ€™t know what to do. Basically, Iâ€™ve been in a relationship with another guy for a bit other a year now. We donâ€™t live together. Heâ€™s a really great guy. 

Do I love him? Yes. Do I want to be with him? Yes. But the problem is, I find myself asking, am I okay with never doing anything sexual or romantic with anyone else again? Am I okay with this, for the rest of my life?

And the answer is no. I hate that thatâ€™s the case, but it is. I want to hook up with guys like I used to. I want to meet new people. But I donâ€™t want to hurt my boyfriend. And I donâ€™t know if I could handle the guilt. 

I have other people in my life that I want to get to know better, whether itâ€™s just sexual, or a relationship for at least one guy. 

I just... I know Iâ€™m not explaining myself well. 

Iâ€™m still young (early 20s) and I want to experience more in life. Iâ€™ve had so many problems, so many mental health issues and suicide attempts. 

That the gist of it.
