maybe i'll see the game over screen maybe i won'tIm sick of this endless cycle of misery , cant even afford a pup to bring my hopes up. The only way out of this hell hole is to endure a few more years of the same bull or going through with my sick and twisted ideas of ending my conscioussnes . I feel no joy even doing a few push ups or talking to anyone. Isolation has made me literally insane

I really regret the day i decided to put the blame on me for the shitty things that happened in my life, it has been a non stop spiral of missed oppotunities, broken relationships, dreams getting crushed by my own impulsivity, all while my family watched and waited for me to magically snap out of it. 

I feel this lingering sensation of comfort knowing i won't have to deal with this anymore. Like anyone cares really, maybe i'll burn in hell
