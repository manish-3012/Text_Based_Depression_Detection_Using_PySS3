Not wanting to live anymoreI am 19. Used to be full of dreams and goals. Til about 4 years ago. I am depressed as hell. I donâ€™t remember the last time I was happy. Everyday feels the same. Iâ€™m tired of work. Tired of college. Tired of living in the same shit town all my life. Iâ€™m broke as shit. I sleep all the time when Iâ€™m not working. No one to talk to. Donâ€™t know how to talk to people anymore. I always think about killing myself, in many ways. Fantasize about it. I just want to feel something other than anger, sadness, and loneliness. Everything is a joke to me. Pointless. When people talk to me, it feels like a chore just listening. My memory is bad because of anxiety. Iâ€™ve switched medication many times. Nothing works. I just am tired of suffering. Iâ€™ve tried my best to change my life but nothing has came out of it yet. I wanna be done.
