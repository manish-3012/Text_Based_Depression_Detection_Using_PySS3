I think I saved somebody's life tonight SWI was chatting to a friend of a friend on facebook chat this evening started telling her of all my mediocre problems. She listened and helped. In return I promised to listen to her story and I tried to make her think positively just like she did with me.  I promised her I would do all I could to help but as she told me she was contemplating "the 's' word" but only for our small, not hugely personal conversation, she would have killed herself. As I write I'm still talking to her, shit scared what to say but know that as a result of my action I saved a life. I beg of anyone reading this, 10-20 minutes of your time can honestly save a life. I created this account to help solely on SW.
