Not sure if allowed so remove or left me know if notIâ€™ve posted here before and Iâ€™ve recently had a bit of a break through. Iâ€™m feeling hopeful for the first time in years, I feel like Iâ€™m on the right path for once.  I was able to work my way through a project out of passion for it and got through it without any panic attacks or anything like it. Even thought this is someone a normal person can easily do I just feel proud of the work Iâ€™ve done and I think Iâ€™ve done a really good job tbh. 
Wanted to post this so anyone that suffers with depression, anxiety and has suicidal tendencies knows that itâ€™s possible to feel good again, even if itâ€™s for a short while. I havenâ€™t felt anything close to happy in so long and having felt pride in myself it feels like something worth sticking around for and trying to feel again.
I hope youâ€™re all doing well, have a great day guys
