Feel stupid for posting hereI have constant anxiety and I feel a bit tired of it. I am constantly on edge and scanning environment for threats. I feel complete self loathing. I am tired of listening to myself complain about it. 

I feel so sad because when I come on here I see so many people also feeling despondent. I would rather be in a position where I could reassure people. I feel guilty for feeling the way I feel. 

But, mostly I feel tired. I think for about 30 years now I have had suicide in the back of my head as an escape route, but I never really felt like it - it was just a perverse type of comfort knowing I could end it if I couldn't cope.

For the past 10+years I have been hiding a very strong tranquilizer in my cupboard on the chance that I might want to kill myself.  I've been reading articles about whether it is fatal in overdose but I can't get a clear picture from the evidence. I am thinking about rat poison, alcohol, and this particular drug. I don't really want to die but I am tired of feeling behind all the time.
