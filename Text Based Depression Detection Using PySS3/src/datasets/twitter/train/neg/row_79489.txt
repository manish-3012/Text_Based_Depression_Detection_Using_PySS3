so, i started a WoW account a week agoIs this as good as it gets? Is this the best I can do?  Will I be proud of myself if I'm doing this for the next 5 years?  Is this good bye to real life?

I don't have the strength to make myself a real person. I guess this is the best I can do.  I keep getting older, my life gets smaller and smaller.

I think I'd rather just say goodbye and end it all.
