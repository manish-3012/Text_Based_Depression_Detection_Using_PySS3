Is it true that I'll never be normal again?No matter where I go or who I ask. Everybody *(in real life)* keeps telling me that you'll never get normal again once you're suicidal. More or less that I'm doomed to be suicidal forever and have no chance to escape that until I kill myself... Is that really true? Why is nobody saying there's hope?
