Cant stopCanâ€™t stop thinking about suicide this past two weeks

Canâ€™t stop feeling unloved and unappreciated by my boyfriend 

Canâ€™t stop hating myself 

I wish I was dead.

I wish I was never born.

I wish I never met him so I could just kill myself.

I hope that one day Iâ€™ll be determined enough to just end it.
