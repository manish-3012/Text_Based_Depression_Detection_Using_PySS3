A cowardI think I understand why I don't want to live. 
I'm scared of growing up, of the adult world, of the responsabilities. 
I'm not suicidal, I'm just a coward who is too scared to live like normal people do. 
I cowardly hope to die as soon as possible to run away from any responsabilities but I'm too scared to do it myself, to end it myself. 
I'm a disgusting coward who can't do something as simple as living like an adult. 
A 20 years old coward who should have run away sooner. 
How thought ? 
Pain scare me. 
Death scare me... But live do as well. 
I don't want to die.. Or do I ? 
What do I want then ? 
I want everything to just stop. 
Coward. 
Just die then.
