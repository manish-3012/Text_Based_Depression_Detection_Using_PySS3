I feel so fucking empty and alone my soul is in pain.Do you ever just wish people cared about you? Because I do. I wish I had at least one person who would constantly check up on me, show their care, and someone who wants be around me. Iâ€™ve been pushed aside my whole life down the drainage. Maybe itâ€™s due to my personality since I look emotionless/dead/sad or how I rarely crack a smile. I wish my parents were emotionally supportive. I secretly envy all the others who have parents who care for their child(ren). Thanks for listening to me vent.
