My Suicide NoteDear Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Don't blame yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This has been a long time coming.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Those of you that dont know of everything are probably shocked.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Those of you that did probably arent. Youre just sad. Or angry. Or maybe you are shocked.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It looked like I was getting better. Maybe you thought I was happy. I kind of thought that I was happy too. Maybe I was.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Even still, this hole has existed in my heart for years. It expands and deepens and I've been trying to fill it all this time. Nothing could have ever filled it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Love, alcohol, knowledge, mindless tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts in the back of my mind keep creeping up. I've been pushing them back for so long and I just couldnt do it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Ive been putting it off for so long due to fear. Fear of pain and the unknown. Fear that all of you would blame yourselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I know that some of you still will. Im telling you not to. It's not your fault. It's not. There is nothing more you could have done for me. Nothing would have fixed me. Nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Please, dont blame yourself. Blame me. Blame me for not being strong enough. Blame me for not being able to do it anymore. Blame me. Hate me. Please.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I love you.
