Advice NeededI am planning my death, and am trying to make a checklist of things to do/people to speak with, and was wondering whether I should call my overseas family on my way out. I used to visit every summer, and as I got older even some winters. I had a loving relationship with them up until about 21 years old (M24 currently), when I realized I'd never get better and these thoughts would never subside. Also being unable to live with my failures/childhood took its toll on me and I lost all confidence. From there I became distant, and cut off almost all contact with them (and really everyone) as I couldn't stand myself and my failures. I'm sure they are very hurt from it, and I think about them all the time and feel awful about the whole situation. 

Would it hurt them even more to contact them, or do you think it may give them some closure? Should I call, or leave a message? I'm stuck and don't know what to do. Even thinking about making the calls sends me to tears. 

Sorry if my grammar is all over the place.
