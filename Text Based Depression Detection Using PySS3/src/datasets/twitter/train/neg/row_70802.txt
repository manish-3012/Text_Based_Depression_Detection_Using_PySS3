Thinking that it's time for meI really struggle working with people. No matter how much sucking up I do, I always make some sort of mistake that leads me to the wrong end of things. I am a somewhat recent grad, been out of school for \~2 years and have been fired from two corporate jobs for performance and fit. In both cases, there was some mistake along the way where someone didn't like me, even though I really tried to suppress my pride as much as possible and tried my best to work with my team. Man, it was really tough getting back up after the first firing, but after the second one, which was about a month ago, I really don't know what to do next. I'm on employment insurance right now and really lost all my confidence. I've been seeing a psychiatrist recommended by my family doctor but I don't feel it's been much help. Dealt with anxiety all my life and basically have no friends either. I feel like I should end it here.
