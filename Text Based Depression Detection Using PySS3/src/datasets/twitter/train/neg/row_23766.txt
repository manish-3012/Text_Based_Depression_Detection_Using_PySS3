Counting down the daysI'm just so fed up with all of this. Nothing has gotten better and nothing will ever Get better. Everything is broken and I can't hold on any longer. I don't want to keep trying because it hurts too much. Why can't I just fall asleep and never wake up.... If only. 


I've been counting down days to the day I'm going to make it stop. Every night I get closer and closer. I've been waiting for an accident to happen. Waiting for a car to hit me, for sickness to take me.... For Anything. But it looks like its up to me. I don't want to but I have no other choice. 
I'm stuck and don't know what to do.
