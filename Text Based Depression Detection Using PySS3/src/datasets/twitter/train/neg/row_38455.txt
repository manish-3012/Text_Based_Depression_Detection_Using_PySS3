I don't know what to do anymoreI feel so lost right now. I can't help but feel like I'm a terrible person. Like one part of me is a complete sociopath. Sometimes I just have no empathy and could destroy someone's life without feeling a thing. It scares me. I've done terrible things in the past, messed up every relationship I've had. I think the world would just be better without me. I don't want to keep hurting the people I care about.
