Please help me, I can't help myself.My fathers voice is in my head. 13 years he told me how worthless I am, how stupid I am, how I'll always be a failure, how much he hates me, how much of a regret having me was. He moved away, miles and miles away. But his voice is still in my head. 

Every time i fail at something I hear him. Every time I'm proud of myself he shoots it down. He tells me to cut, and then tells me how I'm only doing it for attention and how I'm insane and should be locked away. How I'm a shame to him, how I can't be related to him. 

Now his voice is telling me I don't even deserve to live. MY voice is telling me how easy it would be to die. I'm only 15. Please help me, please. I've wanted to die before but it's never been this bad all I can think about it how it would feel and I can't sleep and I just please does anyone even care, I just need something to keep living for.
