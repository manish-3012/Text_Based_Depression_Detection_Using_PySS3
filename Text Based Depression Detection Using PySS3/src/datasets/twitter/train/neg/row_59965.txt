It's time for me to go, my immoral actions have left me seeing the person I really am.I just can't live with myself anymore. I can't let go of my awful past that I brought on myself, I'm almost 30 years old and I'm just tired of not being able to control my immoral habits. I think tonight will be it for me and I don't think I can go on anymore.
