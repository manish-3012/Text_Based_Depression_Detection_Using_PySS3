feel like i should stop holding on and just end iti've been depressed for years, never had a good relationship with my mother, father left a long time ago. i also happen to be trans, and despite being 18 i just dont think i will ever look good enough, at least not without some facial surgery of sorts, but everything is expensive as shit. at first i wanted to do it this winter, but i decided against it and got on hormones instead to see what'd happen - its great but A) i think i'll still look like shit B) considering how everything is just so expensive, relationships with people difficult (or nonexistant) it would be just easier to end it once and for all. i feel like i should just stop trying to walk up the river and just let it wash me away.  i dont even know why i'm writing this...i guess to get it off my chest or something?

edit: upon some further thought, i think i'll do it. not sure when but i think i will.
