My husband does not get it. He does not get it and does not get it no matter how much i try to tell him. This has made my mind up.I'm relieved. 

I wish I could talk about my chosen method.

Not even sure if I will get to do my bucket list stuff before I do this.

beause my husband is I can't deal with it anymore.

I literally give up. 

Here's a list of things I will do before I kill myself: Watch that documentary the bridge again. It's semi-depressing but also the interviews with the friends of the people who killed themselves just shows how utterly utterly clueless people are. Espeically when someone who they call a ''friend'' is in pain.

Second, I will fast for a few days. This will get me a bit closer to the edge I think.
