Does anyone else confuse feeling suicidal with feeling really exhausted?Like, it's hard to distinguish being tired vs being depressed, but... when I'm really tired, I'll often start saying "I want to die". My therapist caught onto this right away, so it's not new news for me.   
But it even goes so far as actively thinking for ways to die when I'm really, really tired.   


I decided to google this to see if other people felt the same, and I ended up finding this picture that should seriously be used in doctor's offices. It's great  
.... since I can't post it, it's called Emmengard's Suicide Scale, and it's a short comic.   


For me, right now, I'm a 5-6. I see my therapist later this week, though.   
I also know that sleep tends to fix things.   


Anyway, I just wanted to share and see if people could relate.
