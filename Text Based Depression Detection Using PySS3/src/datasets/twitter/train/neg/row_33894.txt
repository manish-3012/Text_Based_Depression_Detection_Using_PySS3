what would happen to my cat?i've been thinking about killing myself in a more serious way recently but i don't know what would happen to my cat. he is my best friend and no one understands him like i do. i live with two roomates that i like enough but i dont like the way they treat him... they're not cat people. he is the only thing keeping me alive at this point. honestly? if it gets bad enough maybe i'll take him with me. i don't like to think about it.. but what else can I do? he's my baby:(
