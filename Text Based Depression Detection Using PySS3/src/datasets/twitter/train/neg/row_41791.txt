killing myself in an hourive had this planned out for months and every time i thought i was ready i chickened out but today is the fucking day. well, night.

i saw my sisters second birthday today. im so thankful ive had 2 years with her and im just glad she wont remember me when the time comes.

my parents will probably kill my cats since no one else can take care of them. 

i think my bio. dad will blame my mother for it. to be fair most of the times ive considered killing myself it has been because of her. 

i dont know what my brothers will do. i know my oldest younger brother will definitely blame my mum. hes heard everything thats gone on tonight. 

i domt know why im posting here. i guess i just needed to put it out somewhere.
