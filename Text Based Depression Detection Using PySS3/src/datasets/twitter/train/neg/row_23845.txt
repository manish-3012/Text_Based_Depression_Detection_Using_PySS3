3 year relationship ended, student loan payments went up, already had a mental breakdown and waiting for another one.I just feel like I've fucked up somewhere along the line and I'm being punished for it right now. My ex and I are friendly still but we were engaged to be married and that's gone. I was already struggling to afford life and now I need to find a new place to live. I'm probably going to be couch surfing for a couple months, I'm losing my cat for awhile (stupid but I'm gonna miss him), I've got a cavity that I can't afford to get filled now... and all of this has gone down in a two week span.

The one bright spot is that I managed to cut weed out cold turkey but... I'm honestly kind of hoping that my car just explodes or something when I go into work today. I'm just tired.
