Always thought that when my fathers die iâ€™ll kill myselfI just donâ€™t connect with people, i try, i really try.
Iâ€™m a functional person, have plenty acquaintances, but else than that i am pretty isolated.
I donâ€™t have a vocation, friends, loved ones, desires or goals more than short term goals which is to buy things and Im aware of this because is what i do while my fathers are still alive.
Donâ€™t have will to live after that
