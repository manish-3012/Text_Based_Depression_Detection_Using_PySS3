Iâ€™m At Breaking Point.Iâ€™m beginning to realise a sad reality. Lifeâ€™s unfair. No matter how much you try to better yourself, no matter how much you think youâ€™re doing whatâ€™s right or what is best you will still most likely come out empty handed. It doesnâ€™t help when the people who you thought cared about you arenâ€™t there anymore either.

Iâ€™ve tried these past few months to ignore these thoughts. I need to vent. I know my feelings are nonsensical but Iâ€™m at a point where I just donâ€™t care. Is that selfish of me?
