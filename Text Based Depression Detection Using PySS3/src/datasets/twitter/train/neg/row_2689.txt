I insulted the woman who raised meWhen I was a child my mother left because of reasons which I now understand more, but it was very painful. A woman who worked at my house raised me, she treated me like her son and to me she feels like a mother. 

Recently I have been having problems at home with my dad and have been in a very bad mood for many days. This woman is a person whom it is extremely difficult to deal with. She made me lunch yesterday, and after giving her a compliment for it she started yelling at me (as I said, she is extremely difficult to deal with and takes even compliments badly).

Anyways, the discussion raised to the point where she told me ''This is why you fight with your father. Nobody want's you around, not even your mother''. I snapped and called her an old bitch and told her to go fuck herself. 

I feel like shit for doing it, but I don't know what to make out of all this. She will never listen to me, and it's either me saying sorry to her (which I do feel) or never talking again. She will NEVER apologize or accept wrongdoing and it kind of sucks that is either me making it feel as if it was my fault, or just not doing anything. What should I do?
