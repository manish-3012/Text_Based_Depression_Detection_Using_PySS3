i wanna just clock outi feel that none of my friends actually care anymore. i used to have so many of them but 1 by 1 they just stop talking to me. they all move on  and i feel so forgotten. i hate that i miss them and can't forget about them. people have made hate posts about me in forums and even made whole discord chats dedicated to talking shit about me. someone who was in one showed me screenshots because they felt bad which just made me feel more hopeless. i feel like utter shit. the only hobby making me happy was torrn apart by 30+ people on a forum. they took my art and they were so nasty about it all. there's also some guy that's been stalking me for around 4 years and doesn't get that i do not want to talk to him. people at school do shit to me on purpose becaause they know it hurts me. everything is so overwhelmjng and i want it to just stop
