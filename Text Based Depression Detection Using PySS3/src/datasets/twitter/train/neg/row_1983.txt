How long to get over a breakup / being dumped?I was curious how long it takes people to get over the initial breakup stage which for me has me wanting to not exist, these are not thoughts I've ever had before, I'm not sure how serious they are but I don't want to exist / be around any more and cannot stop thinking about it. For context everything was okay in relationship no fights etc, very close, but he said he doesn't think we are right for each other. The breakup was yesterday. I've never been dumped before (only had a couple of relationships and they just sort of dissolved, mutually, over a period of time, no one got 'dumped')  so I don't know how bad people usually feel. Has anyone been dumped and had the same feeling (a very resolute certainty that they want to die), but then stopped wanting to kill themself after a certain period of time, and how long did it take. Thank you.
