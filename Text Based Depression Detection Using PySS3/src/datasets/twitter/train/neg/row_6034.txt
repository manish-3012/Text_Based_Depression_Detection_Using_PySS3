He broke up a month ago, I can't deal, I want to dieMy boyfriend broke up a month ago. He says he loves me but the relationship isn't doing him good.
He was my only true friend. I'm sick of this, I don't feel like going forward anymore. I want him back but I'm not foolish enough to think that it will happen.
