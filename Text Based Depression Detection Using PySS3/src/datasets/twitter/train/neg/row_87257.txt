Mood SwingsOne minute Iâ€™m happy the next Iâ€™m angry the next Iâ€™m sad for absolutely no reason. I guess Iâ€™m bipolar but I donâ€™t know that for sure and I donâ€™t want to go on medication, but the suicidal episodes in emotion like the one I experienced today are horrible. Iâ€™m also hopelessly an addict but smart enough so that nobody around me knows, so I suffer in silence. I need help but I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel like I should just leave this world so I donâ€™t burden people with my anger and what they could figure out about me. I have loving and supportive family but I just canâ€™t seem to do anything. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m still alive or how I havent attempted anything yet.
