I only have about a month left.I swear to god that I will not be alive come September. I'm allowed to live somewhere else over the summer but come September, I have to live back at my mom's house. I can't go back there. I just can't. I'm going to kill myself at the end of August, at the longest. 

I lied to the family counsellor about my suicidal thoughts. I couldn't tell her about my abuse because I would just start crying. I'm trapped. They determined that I don't need help because I lied about practically everything.

 I'm such a lost cause
