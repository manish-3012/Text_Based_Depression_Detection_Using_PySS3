We are all just ticking time bombsDeath is inevitable. However, living here at home is driving me towards ending my life much earlier than expected. 

Growing up, I had a pretty decent childhood. Both parents were present, in a way. My dad was always working to provide for us. So whenever I'd have to talk to my dad, it was usually for punishment. 

My parents provided a lot of things for my sisters and me, such as a house, food, clothes, etc. However, they were never there for us emotionally. I don't ever remember being asked how I was feeling or how my day went. I never really had anyone to talk to, so all of these emotions were suppressed.

Fast forward years later, and both of my parents have ran out of patience. I'm my dad's least favorite. He always claims that he loves all of us equally, but that's not true. There was a saying that stuck to me, "The axe forgets, but the tree remembers."

I'll never forget some of the things that my dad has done. Where he prefers my sisters over me.

Fast forward a few years later, my two younger sisters are always against me. My dad always chooses their side, and I'm just so tired. I get yelled at for defending myself. There's so much going on right now. I'd rather end it all now.

Anyways, thank you all of taking the time to read this long post. I appreciate you all.
