I think I'm going crazyI don't have much human interaction outside of work. This weekend will be just another boring weekend where I'm all alone. I sit and think of unrealistic scenarios where I am doing something that I am admired for to for so long that I lose touch with reality. I feel like I'm losing my ability to talk to people. I feel shy and stumble on my words now and can't make eye contact anymore. I went to therapy today and felt like it was useless for the first time and that I'm too far gone. I hate just about everything in my life right now. I'm in an apartment that my ex moved out of and have been driving around with no destination just so I don't have to be here. I hate myself. I hate my bad habits and insecurities. I hate that I have major trust issues when in reality I ruin any trust/faith anyone has in me. I feel like I haven't matured emotionally from when I was a child. I don't know what can be done to get over my issues. The only thing I have is my job and all my possessions I wanted so badly that I thought would finally make me happy.
