i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening to me anymorethings were uncertain and painful for a period of my life. i got through it, and it remained just as bad and painful, but it was stable. now itâ€™s getting unstable again. things i thought were absolutely certain arenâ€™t. things seem to be changing in my life totally randomly. i donâ€™t understand anything thatâ€™s happening or why, and iâ€™m not sure what iâ€™m supposed to do. iâ€™m so desperately tired, and i sleep deeply but when i wake up iâ€™m always so disappointed to be alive, in this reality (if thatâ€™s what it is). iâ€™m hungry but i never stay full, my memory feels like a sieve. iâ€™m weak. i want to die so badly but the thought of doing it is terrifying, the pain scares me too much. i want something to kill me or to be allowed to euthanise myself but it wonâ€™t ever happen. i donâ€™t even know why iâ€™m writing this. 
everything is out of my control. i donâ€™t think it ever was but times like these really drive home that fact.
