Anywho, I just need some people to talk to.  I've never been this close to or wanting to kill myself.  I KNOW it's not the way to go, and I know that it's going to make things worse for everyone around me.  But it seems so hard to believe that I'll make it through this time.

I don't really know what to say, if you want to talk or know things about me, feel free to ask.
