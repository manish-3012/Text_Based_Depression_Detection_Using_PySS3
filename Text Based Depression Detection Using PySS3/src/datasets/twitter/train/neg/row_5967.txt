Chronic pain
Been in pain for 13 years and I want to end it and don't know how. Have seen 10 different doctors with no one who knows how to help. I have a family and don't know what to do. But am seeing a new doctor Thursday I hope she can help. Otherwise don't know what to do. I want the pain to be over. Thanks for listening.
