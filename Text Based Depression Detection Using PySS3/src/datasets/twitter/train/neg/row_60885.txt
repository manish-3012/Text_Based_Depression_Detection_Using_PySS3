I just turned 19 todayI've had suicidal thoughts since I was 12 and nothing has changed. Might aswell make my birthday my death day because I've tried everything to change myself. Tried putting myself in social situations(I literally work as a club promoter so if I didn't get people in I would lose my job) but still i'm a waste of space and no change.
