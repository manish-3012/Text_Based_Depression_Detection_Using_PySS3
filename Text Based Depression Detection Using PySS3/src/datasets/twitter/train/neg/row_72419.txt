If we lose the baby, Iâ€™m going to do itMy wife is pregnant with our first baby, and while Iâ€™m excited about the possibility of having someone who actually loves me, I know I donâ€™t have what it takes to be a good father. I work in retail so I donâ€™t make much money, and I have no skills or talents other than video games. Iâ€™m ugly, people generally donâ€™t like me, and Iâ€™m not very smart. What is the best way to do it? I donâ€™t want to fail and make my life even worse, and I donâ€™t want to leave a mess for anyone to clean up. Also this is just in case something happens to the baby, if the baby is ok Iâ€™ll seek help and maybe get on medication to prevent so much self-hatred. Thanks in advance
