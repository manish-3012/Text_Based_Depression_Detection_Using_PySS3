M19 Shaking ... Thinking about doing itI have a belt tied in a noose in a closet. I am pretty confident I could die by standing on a bucket, slipping my head into the loop, tightening the noose, then literally kicking the bucket.

I'm in love with this girl. She is beautiful and taken, and religious differences mean we probably couldn't last anyway. But she has been seeing me a lot lately and doing stuff like holding my hand during a movie, cuddling up close to me and just generally being flirtatious. She has a boyfriend. Why is she doing this? She starts feeling conflicted and guilty and I'm feeling tortured. I love her so much. I'll never find someone like her.

She makes me feel amazing yet awful. "I find you more attractive because I can't have you" that's just insulting. But yes you can! Please! I'd do anything to be with you.

But it's never going to happen.

I've dropped out of school. I'm living with my parents. I have no goals or aspirations and the only thing that makes me happy is this girl. She deserves her boyfriend anyway he's better than me.

It's not just because of this girl but I feel so hopeless about her right now. 

I asked if she could change anything about me what would it be? She said if I was Mormon again. That's the one thing I wouldn't do. I'm still in fucking shock for seeing the church for what it is: Manipulative, elitist, homophobic, sexist, and obviously fabricated. And I have to reconcile the fact that most of my friends and family will never come around to see that. Including this amazing girl. It makes me feel isolated and insane. My dad. My mom. Blinded by a cult. My brother acts all cold if I say anything critical.

My job is hell. I'm dropping out of school. She is perfect but can't love me. The church isn't true. Fuck this shit reality.

I'm going to put the rope around my neck and see if I can make my peaceful escape from this hell.
