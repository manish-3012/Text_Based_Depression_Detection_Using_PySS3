Fuck i hate posting herei feel so selfish for posting here. but fuck life sucks.
moved 7000km away on a whim to get a change but i have never been more lonely and desperate for contact. had moved back home a couple of months ago because things werent working out, ending things woth my gf. before i left she had already found a replavement and made sure to smeare it in my face. at home things did t get better so i made a radical decision to move 7k km. life is worse here. i miss friends, am unable to make friends as i have never needed too. work sucks ass, even tho i get to do something amazing.

currently siting safely at a resteraunt as i dont trust myself. fuck life sucks. i have no reason to act this way as i am a spoild brat. yet i cant help myself. i loathe my behaveiour, 


sorry for formating. am drunk and on a phone. eating a burger.
