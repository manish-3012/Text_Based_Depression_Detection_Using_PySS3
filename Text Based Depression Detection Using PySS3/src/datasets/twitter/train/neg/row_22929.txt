No reason to go onPost attempt 2:
So my gf/ fiancee broke up with me, it's my fault, I'm not motivated enough to look for a job to pay for this school I've been going to, she's given me plenty of chances and ultimatums(I need to find a job in X weeks or I need to move out), but I just can't gain the motivation to keep applying with no success. I'm almost done with school and my extern site will hire me as soon as I'm done, but she's told me she's fallen out of love with me, and has feelings for a coworker. I keep trying to get her to realize that I'll bounce back, and as soon as I'm making money I'll be back to normal, but she's already made dating app accounts, and seems like she's made up her mind. 

My suicidal thoughts have been going on for years now, even when I thought we were doing ok, but now that she seems so emotionally distant and doesn't want to hold on to what we have, I can relate with my will to live. 

I can't be without her. I know it's probably unhealthy but she's all I have, and if she kicks me out I have nowhere to go.

Sorry if my thoughts are all over the place, I just needed to write them out somewhere. I'm not sure if I will attempt, it's more of a waiting game to see what plays out, and hopefully works out. I appreciate you taking the time to read this.
