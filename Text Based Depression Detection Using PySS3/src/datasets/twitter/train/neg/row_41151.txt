Hey.Life is so stupid and pointless. I fucking hate living.  Iâ€™m not happy at school. Iâ€™m not happy at home. I rarely go any where. I rarely ever feel happiness. Itâ€™s been so long that Iâ€™ve just decided to grow numb to all emotions. Iâ€™m so numb. I donâ€™t feel anything anymore.  I donâ€™t even feel the slits on my arms. My parents are getting divorced and Iâ€™m not even sad. I donâ€™t even care. I feel like I probably should care. But I donâ€™t. My grades are at an all time low. I donâ€™t care if I flunk. Everyday I get up I contemplate if I should iust stay in bed. Sleeping is the only relief I get from the numbness I feel of life. If Iâ€™m sleeping I can pretend I donâ€™t live or I live a nice life weâ€™re I have friends and people actually like me. Everyone hates me. Iâ€™ve never even had a genuine friend. The social anxiety doesnâ€™t help either. Life is a pain. I want to take the pain killer called death.
