First time and scared what SW would think of me.I am lost, sad upset. 
I come and read so many posts. I feel like I can connect with so much of you, but everyone has their different stories. 
Mine is my boyfriend that lives 16,000 miles away. Which I am going to see again in 4 days. 
I have met him once before for two weeks in Christmas. 
It's just so hard to let it all out. 
If I tell you everyone will just tell me to leave him or not go on this trip. 

I'm sorry. I feel worthless. 
In February I OD on my mums sleeping pills. Went into emergency room and my whole family was crying. 

And a few night ago I did it again. But this time I didn't tell anyone and made myself sleep for 2 days. 
I was fucked. 
I will tell SW one day what my abusive boyfriend has called me and said to me. 
Or am I being selfish bitch? A princess who is not getting what she wants? 
Right now I want to OD again but this time mix it wil a bottle of Vodka. 

I want to end my life so bad. 
I feel like I'm rambling, I feel like no one will understand. 
Goodnight
