I'm taking up space for others with valueI'd love to have kids without the guilt that I'm bringing more serotonin-deficient people into this world to suffer. It's all such a big mess.  I wish hourly for an accident or any way to make it look like an accident, because I seem to think my shame will follow me into death. Better to avoid, avoid, avoid. It would be so fucking peaceful to be nothing. Nothing can't hurt or stifle others. I can't ruin what I can't touch because I'm dead. All I can muster is a slow march to cirrhosis. More pain, rotting, stinking shit. No dramatic gesture or action. Just passive silent tears that wet my pillow but don't get seen.  Cowardice, passive aggressive, normal, stupid life and death. I look in the mirror and dare dead relatives to haunt me, you know, for perspective.
