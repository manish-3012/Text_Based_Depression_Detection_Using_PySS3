My mother tried to commit suicide a few hours agoHi,
I got a call from my dad a few hours ago that my mom had took 16 sleeping pills. I live about 100 km away and i instantly returned home to my find my mom in bed, motionless. Apparantly the paramedics came about an hour before me and said she didn't need to be taken to hospital and we should just wait it out (wtf). When i got home i called them again and forced them to take her to hospital, where my mother admitted she had taken 30 sleeping pills.

I am devastated and can't believe she has done this. I myself struggle with depression and anxiety and sure thought about suicide many times but never really saw it as an option. I have so many questions as to why she would do this, even though i'm guessing it has to do with my parents shitty marriage.

But for now, how should i approach her when i visit her tomorrow? What is the best way to talk to her? I dont want to make her feel more miserable than she already is.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
