Losing my dogWe had to say goodbye to my dog yesterday. She was my best friend for 15 years and she got me through so much. She was there for me whenever I was sad and sometimes she was just about the only reason for me to keep living. 
Iâ€™ve never experienced grief like this before. It doesnâ€™t feel real. Being a suicide survivor and not having broken out of my tendencies yet is making this so much harder. Iâ€™m in so much pain I donâ€™t know how to go on with normal life. I donâ€™t have time to grieve. I just keep thinking that if I do it then I wonâ€™t be in this much pain anymore. I feel like I would give anything to see her again. And if itâ€™s true that there is an afterlife that weâ€™ll meet again in, why shouldnâ€™t I just die right now? 
I miss her so so much and donâ€™t know how to go on without her. She was the only constant in my life. I donâ€™t really want to commit, I just canâ€™t bear the pain and would give anything to have more time with her. Iâ€™m scared because I thought I was doing better since my last attempt but Iâ€™m really contemplating it now. I miss my baby so much.
