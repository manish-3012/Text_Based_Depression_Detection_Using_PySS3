People that tell you to have good nutrition and exercise when your mentally ill are dumbI work in Mental Health. For some reason the health care system keeps vouching for good Nutrition, exercise, and drink lots of water when your depressed or suicidal .... Have any of you been recommend this advice????

Like I'm gonna be straight up and say that those are nice things. But when many of my clients are too poor to afford good food or a gym membership, it's kinda insulting. In addition, many people are dealing with depression and such, where getting out of bed is just difficult. 

People I work with telling patients that they need to simply just exercise and eat well, need to take a moment to ask the patient what they are dealing with. What are there feelings. financial situations etc. Telling someone this stuff without considering their situation is placing a barrier that will stop them from asking for help in the future, as they may feel that they are a nuisance for not being able to afford/do the exercise or healthy food.
