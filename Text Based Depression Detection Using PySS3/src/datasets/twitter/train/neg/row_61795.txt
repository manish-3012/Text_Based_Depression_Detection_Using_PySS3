Giving up. Need to make a decision.Quick history of me and suicide:

Wished I was never born from around 8, wanted to die at 9, wanted to kill myself from 11 onwards. I don't think there has been a period of more than three weeks at any point in the past decade I wouldn't have happily died if it weren't for the pain it would cause my family (sorry for the mangled sentence, need to get this out so no editing). I've been taking any step I can to speed up my path to death without killing myself with immediacy. My reason for this is that I don't want my family to know I killed myself, I want them to think I died accidentally or out of stupidity. 

So I smoke, take drugs with frequency, take unregulated medications to transition my gender etc. The problem is that it isn't moving quick enough.

I'm not in the kind of immediate danger where I'm going to swallow a shotgun but I've been thinking of taking up heroin, which would be the equivalent for me. That's me speeding things up.

Here's why I'm here: I'm engaging with life so I can't be so far gone but I genuinely want to die. I feel confused, like my actions are saying one thing and my thoughts another. Kind of. As an example, I have been trying not to lose my job. Why should I care?

I could use someone to talk to if you think you could help me make a decision whether to finally give up or to truly engage with life. This half-way point is getting me down.

Thank you for reading.
