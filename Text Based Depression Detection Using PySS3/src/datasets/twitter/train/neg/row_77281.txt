Whats the point, when in the long run it will be forgotten foreverEvery single action I have ever done within my life time has been useless, I will pass away one day, maybe some people may remember me and talk about me once in a while, but eventually they will die too and every single trace of me having even ever existed will be probably gone in 500 years. One day the earth will get engulfed in the sun and it will be as if I have never existed at all, like I have always been nothing. Anything I do now will be forgotten, whats even the point in doing anything, there will be no divine power from above rewarding us for the good things we have done or punishing us, there will be nothing forever, when people look into their future they see careers, start a family, live a happy life, all I see is nothing forever wainting for me just to cease of existence for rest of eternity. I am killing myself, I only eat junk food, I chain smoke at least 1 pack of cigarettes every day and I get black out drunk every other day, I hate my life, Ive got nothing to look forward to, every single person I have ever met hates me. I wasn't meant for this world, as the line goesfrom the song Riders on The Storm by The Doors "into their world were thrown", I didn't ask to be here, I just started existing suddenly and experiencing all the bad things in this world. There is nothing left for me here, and I can't see myself living much longer, the end is near I can smell it.
