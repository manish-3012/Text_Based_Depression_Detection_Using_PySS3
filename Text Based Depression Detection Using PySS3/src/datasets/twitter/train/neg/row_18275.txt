What happens?If I shot myself, but I called an ambulance just before doing so to give life a â€œchanceâ€ at saving me, what happens if I survive? I donâ€™t want to be institutionalized and suddenly my prospects at the future if Iâ€™m going to move forward to be taken away and ruined. I know people will say â€œthen donâ€™t do itâ€ or variations of that, but it asking an honest question. Me calling beforehand would be me allowing the part of myself that wants to life to have a chance I suppose, so yes, a part of me wants to live. I donâ€™t want someone convincing me â€œlife is worth itâ€ and â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€ right now, please.
