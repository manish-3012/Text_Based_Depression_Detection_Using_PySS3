We end up dead.I don't see the point in anything anymore.

What's the point in life if we all end up dead in the end? It's either a choice of now or later. Does the in between of birth of and death really matter?

Here's backstory for my feelings... as a child, at the age of 9, me and my uncle walked downstairs and seen that our uncle, had hung himself.. and on my birthday, when I turned 13, my grandpa had passed away.. and recently, my girlfriend of nearly two years, who had been battling more severe depression than myself, had passed away.. and I just don't understand why we exist if everything ends with death anyways..
