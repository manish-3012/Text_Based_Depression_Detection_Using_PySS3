Would I be posting here if I was straight?I can't accept who I am. I don't know how I ever will. I'm in denial. My parents would look at me differently. I don't want to be this way. I can watch gay shows and movies, but to be gay, I don't know. I mean I've never been with a woman, so maybe in the end I'm not, and I'm just asexual. I'm 25, I'll be 26 soon. I know no one who is gay. I did for a minute but turns out she'd rather party than spend time with me. I don't blame her though, I don't want to be with myself either. I don't have a purpose. I'm scared that my past ED's will pop up. I've not done anything stupid, yet, but I don't know, I actually miss it/them. I almost want to self harm again but I can't even do that. I live in the South. My mom is a devout Christian. I believe in God, and to be honest, believe I'm going to Hell because of who I think I might be. What I might be.

Would I be like this, feeling like this, thinking like this, if I were straight? A bit of me actually thinks so.

Do you ever feel that you've overstayed your welcome on this earth? Because I do. Like, we are just on borrowed time, or we over went it and somehow are still here.

I won't kill myself. Hopefully never. But it just sucks having these thoughts.
