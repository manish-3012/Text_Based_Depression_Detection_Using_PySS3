Therapist told me my reason to live is not valid enough.Do any of you have similar experiences? I feel like each therapist i go to is worse than the one before. Recently she asked me why haven't i killed myself yet (mind you not in a compassionate way at all, it was as if she was accusing me) and i told her that as much as i hate being alive i can't imagine leaving my little brother alone or what if he was the one who finds my body etc. And she told me that it's not enough of a reason to be alive. I'm not an expert but i don't think telling a suicidal person that their reason not to kill themselves is not valid is the brightest idea. Even thought i don't really agree with what she said, i cant help but think about it and it's getting to me.What IS a good reason to be alive anyway?
