I'm too scared.Happy Thanksgiving, this year hasn't been kind to me, life neither. I come from a good family, and I have a lot to be thankful for. However... Nothing good has come from mine, for years I feel like I'm taking so spot of someone who deserves it. Who lives their "life" to the fullest, brighter than me, better. I don't want it, I feel so lonely and devoid of any motivations, aspirations etc.

This year my love of four years left me, I've been a placid isle of apologies and misgivings, I dont blame her- entirely. My family makes me feel alone, my friends... I keep wanting to light myself on fire, end myself, do the world one last disservice. I hate it all, I can't find joy.
