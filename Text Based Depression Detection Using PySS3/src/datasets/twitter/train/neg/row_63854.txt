Looking for peaceI've been struggling with bipolar depression for almost seven weeks, and it just keeps getting worse.  Nothing the therapist or psychiatrist has done seems to have helped.  I take my meds as directed, keep all appointments, et c, but *nothing* is helping.

There is no safety at my house.  Housemates are very abusive and sometimes dangerous, but I can't afford to move.  One broke my furniture, so I don't even have a room of my own anymore.  My best friend's house used to be my safe place, but his brother moved in and changed all of that.  His brother is a raging borderline and addict who brings chaos wherever he goes.  There is no safe place.  I don't mean to sound self-pitying.  I'm just looking for help with what seems like impossible situations.

Lost my younger sister and mother to suicide.  These days, I see the appeal.  I feel like there will be no peace in my life again.  No safe place.  Not even a stillness in my mind to allow safety there, as my housemate twists everything I say to fit his needs.  Seems like death is the only way to peace, and I'm spilling my guts to strangers just hoping somebody will understand.

Thanks.
