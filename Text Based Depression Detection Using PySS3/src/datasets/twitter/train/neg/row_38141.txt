I am a fuck upI am a 20f who started working last year, and I suck at every job I do. I'm not even able to do bagging at a grocery store right. I think that when they eventually fire me, I will crash my car and make it look like an accident. If I am one of these people who is inherently unemployable, I don't deserve to live. I don't want to suffer through a life where I am always getting fired and told that I suck.
