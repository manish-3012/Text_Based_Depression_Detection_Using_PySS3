I've thought about this for a long, long time.  I've finally decided that I'm done. I am so weary of struggling.  I can't pay any bills from what I make, my partner can't work because of the kids and we are constantly at each others throats.  My son is autistic and it's so fucking hard to deal with.  He insists on sleeping with us so there is zero intimacy.  I'm always fucking something up and she is always keeping score.  I don't want to compete, I just don't want to worry anymore.  When are they going to repo our only car?  Where are we going to find somewhere to live when our landlord sells our rental house?  I can't even pay half of what we owe every month.  I can't work another job because my work commute is long and my partner needs help after a long day of driving the kids around ( dropping me at work, taking our son to therapy) 

I feel like a failure.  I can't provide for my family.  I want peace.  I want security.  I won't have either until I'm dead.
