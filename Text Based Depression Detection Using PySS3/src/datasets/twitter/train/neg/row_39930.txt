I am ready to dieI am thinking about getting a tattoo across my chest that says "Do not treat", so that if I ever arrive dying at the hospital they might just let me. Probably not but at least my wishes would be known.

I am going to get my organ donor card signed. There probably won't be much left of me if I'm successful in killing myself in the way I'm thinking.

I just can't hack it. Fuck it. You go be a hero, I'm out of here.
