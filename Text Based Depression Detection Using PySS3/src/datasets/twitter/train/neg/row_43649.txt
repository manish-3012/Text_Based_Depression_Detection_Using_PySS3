I'm overly dependent on others to be happy, and I want to kill myself now because I don't have anybody.I know there's a whole world out there. I know there's tons of amazing experiences to be had and there's tons of wonder in the world.

But I feel like it's all so pointless if i don't have anybody in my life to share it with.

I'll be suicidal and depressed all day, but the moment someone messages me to hang out, it's immediately lifted and I feel okay again. It's been like this my whole life. I'm 21.

Well, about 6 months ago, all my friends left me. My GF left me for one of my friends after cheating on me with him,  and the friend group decided they'd rather he be in the group than me. So they all shut me out.

I try making art still. I go to museums and to restaurants and concerts and everything. I travel. But I have nobody to go with. And so it feels entirely pointless. This emptiness overwhelms me. I don't feel fulfilled by hard work or discovery or travel.

I guess i'm just wondering if anybody has overcome this. If i'm going to keep myself alive, I need to be contempt in being alone. I hate so much that i'm overly dependent on others accepting me and loving me. I feel like I can't control it though.
