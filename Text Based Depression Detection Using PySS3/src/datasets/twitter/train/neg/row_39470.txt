I cant believe I tried to kill myself last saturdayIt still feels like a dream. I drank a half gallon of alcohol and almost chugged pills but passed out and was unconscious i couldnâ€™t breathe on my own. My ex found me unconscious. I woke up to tubes in my throat and they said i could of seriously died. I was mad when i woke up yelling at my mom after they took the tubes out saying why did u save me.Everyone knows itâ€™s serious but iâ€™m just like was it really a big deal? My family are besides themselves and crying every second. Ugh whatt did i do
