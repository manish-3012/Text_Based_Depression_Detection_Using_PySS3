panicking.I don't have the energy for a full post and I'm on my phone anyway so I'm really sorry if this doesn't make much sense. 

A week ago my dad left my mom, and I went with him because I have a horrible relationship with my mom. I also have an eating disorder which is extremely loud for me right now. My dad suddenly decided that he's going to fix me by forcing me to eat and gain weight, so naturally I'm a mess over that. But it would be one thing if he were doing it in a loving and supportive way, but anytime I get upset or seem to be struggling or depressed at all, he yells the most hateful things at me. It's never ending and I honestly want to die right now, I'm wracking my brains with the "how" and I can't turn it off. I have nowhere to go, my mom won't let me come home. There's literally no escape, my options are to eat and comply and bottle up my emotions which I just am not capable of right now and will make me kill myself anyway or to endure my dad telling me to get out of his fucking life and how he now hates his life too because of me, which I also can't handle. I'm not asking him to do this to me in the first place. I'm 23 and can't leave because he has medical guardianship or else I'd buy a train ticket to anywhere just to spend a few days decompressing- but guardianship means he can call the cops and plaster my face all over the news. I feel like I've thought of everything and there is just no good option for me right now. I'm safe for the moment purely because I don't have the perfect method. So really idk what I need from anyone here, I just need to know someone hears me. I can't stop crying, I'm nearing a full blown anxiety attack. I emailed my therapist but no response yet and the soonest I'm able to see her is wednesday and I can't make it that long. And it would be one thing if I were just suddenly feeling like this but it's been almost ten years and I'm fucking out of hope.
