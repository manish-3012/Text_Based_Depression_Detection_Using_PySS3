My mom is suicidal.She's tried it so many times. She's done horrible things this past year and I hate her for it. We would always get into arguments about it, and she would always give up and go threaten to kill herself. It's not always out of an argument, sometimes she just stays in her room all day crying. It's so traumatic. Having to stop my pregnant mom from downing a bottle of pills. 


She has done terrible things. I judged her. She is sensitive. Me judging her for these things led her to feel worthless and guilty. Is it my fault? I feel terrible. My mother has always had mental issues from day one, they just most recently led to me having to stop her from killing herself.


All of this hurts. I love my mom. I just wish I could go back to elementary when we would still talk.
