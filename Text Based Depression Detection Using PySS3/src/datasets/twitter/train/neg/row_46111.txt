Wife left me after i got out the suicide ward.Met her on a video game when we were 15, always had feelings for her. It didn't work out when we were 17, i grew up joined the military and she came back into my life but with a boyfriend. After they broke up we fell in love all over again, so i thought. Married last october and found out she cheated in 2017 when we were long distance. Its beem since january and my anixety has gotten worse and worse. We kelt fighting 

The military sucks even worse than normal with covid, and i got busted down in rank for some bullshit. 

I was ready to end it and was saying goodbye to her and she asked me "what am i even gonna do if you leave me in this world alone" i went and couldn't go throguh with it. Sje said she would be here for me every step of the way as i was getting admitted. I went to the ward for a week and came out to getting divorced. ðŸ˜” when i was feeling i could find some new life and move in from this stress. Finally on meds and getting professional help. Then she leaves me. 

I dont want to see the future without her. I don't want to live long enough to see how far apart we grow. 

I got drunk and wrote a suicide note monday in my car. The music made me cry as i got drunker. I called my sister and she called my mon to come get me, but i had already drunk texted her telling her how much i loved her, and now im blocked.
