I don't think I am being unreasonable.My life is just terribly difficult in a way that is really hard to explain and there is no realistic way out for me.  
  
I don't think there is anything to do here.  
  
I could not kill myself and hope for the best but at this point it's very obvious that it ain't happening.  
  
Everything hurts me.   
Everyone hurts me.  
  
There are some many things about my life that are wrong and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.
