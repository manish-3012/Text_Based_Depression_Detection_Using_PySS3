I wanna grab the kitchen knife...I just want to die because how the hell am I even here?? Iâ€™ve been here too long. 27 years is too long. 27 years is too much. I just want to die so bad. Iâ€™m not amazing, beautiful, or even passable. Iâ€™m UGLY. Iâ€™m self-destructive. I beat myself up...daily. Every second of every day, Iâ€™m thinking about dying. About the fact that Iâ€™m still livingðŸ¤¢ Why am I still alive?
