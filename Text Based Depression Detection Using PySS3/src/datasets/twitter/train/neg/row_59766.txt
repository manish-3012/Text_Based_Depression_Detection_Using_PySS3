Not sure what to doI emailed my new psychiatrist about 21 hours ago explaining how I really am losing my mind and I need help. They had suggested strongly last time I met with them (the first time seeing them) that I should go into the hospital for a while for inpatient. I am not able to get myself to just call a hospital and tell them I want to be admitted because of my mental illnesses (I know this might seem strange but it's kinda complicated). Not getting a response today from him has really fucked me up and made me feel like he's purposely trying to let me sit here without him responding. He's actually had bad reviews from some people in the past and I honestly feel like he didn't respond today even though he read it and saw the things I said about this being my last option. Idk what to do I'm losing my mind.
