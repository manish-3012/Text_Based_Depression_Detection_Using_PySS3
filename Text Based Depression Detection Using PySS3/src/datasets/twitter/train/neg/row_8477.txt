Adult psych wardsMy suicidal thoughts are getting worse and worse and I really need to check myself into a psych ward but Iâ€™m scared to be in the adult section. Iâ€™ve only ever been with the kids when I was 17. Iâ€™m 19 now. Does anyone know what and adult psych ward is like? Was it scary for you? What was your experience?
