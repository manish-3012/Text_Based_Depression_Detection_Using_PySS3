Help me take drastic actionBeen suicidal lately, been making actual plans the last few days. Logically I know it's stupid and for stupid reasons. Work has dried up, I can't find anything else. I'm feeling so worthless and defeated. I still have a car and about 2000ks worth of fuel. I need to get out of here. I genuinely want to die, I feel like leaving this place will help. Im on NSW Australia mid North coast. 
Where should I go? How do I fix this unemployment bullshit? 
After all, I can always kill myself if leaving doesn't work. 
What else can I do? 
I'll literally take any job, but where to start.
