how do I tell my therapistI think about suicide way too much, I've considered it quite a few times and once \[around a year ago? idk my memory is really bad\] I almost hung myself but I didn't go through with it \[I never told anyone\]. I go to therapy but I don't know how to tell my therapist that I have suicidal thoughts, what if he tells my parents? I don't want them to know, and I also don't want to be put on a medication because I hate pills and I feel like every time I took them I would remember *why* I'm taking them, which isn't helpful at all. Do any of you have some advice on how to talk to my therapist about this, preferably without him telling my parents and/or me getting put on medication?
