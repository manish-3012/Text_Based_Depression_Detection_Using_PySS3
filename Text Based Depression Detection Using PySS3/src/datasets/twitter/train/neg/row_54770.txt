Feel like I have my hands tied.I want to get better, I really do, but after suffering from anxiety, depression, and good old fashioned self-loathing for over a decade, and various life insecurities I won't get into here, I'm losing hope.

It got really bad when I was 18. That was when I got actively suicidal--making plans, but stopping short of actually doing them. Then at 19 I left home and my life seemingly turned around. But it was short-lived. Before long I fell out with my entire family and that, among other things, caused my downward spiral into a depression just as bad, if not worse, than the one I'd just clawed out of.

I'm 20-fucking-4 now. I should be past this. But I still feel like that scared teenager. I'm sick of never achieving anything, I'm sick of feeling like shit, I'm sick of fucking hating myself and feeling like I have good reason to, I'm sick of feeling like such a fucking alien all the time, I'm sick of knowing there's no way to fix my fuckups. I'm just so fucking sick of it all.

You know what's hilarious? I'm in therapy, but the therapy program strongly forbids suicidal people from using it, so I'm afraid to tell my therapist I'm feeling suicidal because I don't want to lose my services, or to get emergency services called on me. And what's also fucking hilarious is that I probably would have committed myself to a mental institution for suicidal tendencies months ago, but 1) I can't afford it, and 2) Even if I could, I couldn't risk missing too much work and losing my job.

I do want to get better. But it really feels like the odds are stacked against me. Sometimes this doesn't really feel like a life at all. It just feels like a constant war with my own mind. And I don't truly want to die, but I can't keep living like this, either.
