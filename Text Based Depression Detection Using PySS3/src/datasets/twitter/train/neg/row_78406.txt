I only experience dissapointmentsFuck, I'm so done. I keep saying it, even though I really need to finally act on it. I suck at everything. Everyone around me sucks. The pressure and the loneliness is killing me day by day.

And, of course, I finally think I found someone, a girl on a dating site who lives close by and seems completely different from the stereotypes I run into each day. Nope, I don't deserve something like that. She ends up being completely antisocial, self-absorbed, not caring about what I have to say or if I have to say anything at all, for that matter. 

Dissapointments arise whenever a sliver of hope appears in my life. There's nothing and nobody that can save me, I'm destined to live in pain or kill myself. I choose the latter.
