I don't know where else to turnFor the past three months I've been dealing with crippling depression/anxiety. I'm 19 and a sophomore in college and I just feel like I can't seem to get a hold of myself. I'm so concerned with getting A's in all of my classes and I can tell that I'm very emotionally distressed because of it. I feel like the only thing in my life that matters is how I do academically, and I'm so afraid of not living up to these expectations of myself. I want to do as well as I can in school so that I can make something of life and know that I'm not just another person who got their degree and found a job and that was the end of their story. I'm so afraid of waking up 10 years down the road and realizing that I'm just another average Joe with no accomplishments to his name and nothing that sets him apart from the rest. I want to go on to graduate school and get my PhD, but if my grades aren't good enough, or if I don't get enough research experience, I won't be able to do that. I have this constant fear of failing and not getting to pursue my dream because I didn't strive enough in school. I try to push myself to do as best as I can, but I still don't feel like I'm living up to my expectations. I get these horrible feelings of depression that just make me feel worthless and I can't even bring myself to do my schoolwork because it will just make me feel worse. I just want to get back to being happy, and feeling like my life is going somewhere great, but right now I don't feel that way at all. Sometimes I just think about how unhappy I am with my life right now and I cry uncontrollably. I have no idea what to do to pick myself up and I could really use some help.
