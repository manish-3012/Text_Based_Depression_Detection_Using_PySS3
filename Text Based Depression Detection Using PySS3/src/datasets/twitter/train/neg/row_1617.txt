Looking for opinionsA little back story - done the meds, therapy, counseling for a couple years at this point and I still fundamentally think that life isn't worth it. It always comes down to "external factors" - think of your family, friends etc. but I when looking for an internal motivator to keep going, nothing comes up. I feel miserable all the time, nothing is ever good enough and honestly today might be the day I just throw in the towel. The self-love exercises, meditation techniques, and medications haven't done anything. I absolutely hate this feeling but I feel like I'm out of options.
