I still feel like no matter how good I feel now, suicide is still an option in the back of my mind.Maybe I'm inherently pessimistic, but I especially feel that life isn't worth the struggle sometimes. I see the shit that's likely in my future, the debt from college, the pandemic crashing the economy, the fact that I'll be fighting thousands of people for every opportunity.

I feel like no matter what I do now, the future is still shit, nothing is proving me wrong. It's still in the back of my mind that I can just "log out" anytime and never bother again.
