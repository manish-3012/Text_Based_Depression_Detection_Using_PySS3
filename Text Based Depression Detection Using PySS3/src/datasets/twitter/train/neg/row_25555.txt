Going O/S next week to visit a (possibly suicidal) friend whose long-term partner died suddenly 6 months ago. Advice?Hi all. 


I don't need help urgently but this has been worrying me for a little while now, and my trip is approaching fast. **TL;DR in bold.**

**Six months ago a good friend of mine (let's call her E) was hospitalised after a traffic accident.** Her **long-term partner (let's call her A, also a friend)**, who she had not seen for a few months (A lives overseas most of the year), flew back as soon as she heard, but **E died a few days later.**

We were all very upset, but A would talk a lot about suicide and the un-fixable lack of meaning in her life. Our group of friends tried hard to look out for her â€“ hanging out in groups, trying to avoid drinking, etc â€“ but when she said things like that we weren't sure how to react. We were all feeling awful, but no-one was in her situation.

A went back overseas soon after, where she thankfully has an established group of friends &amp; colleagues. We've kept in touch, but always just chatted about inconsequential stuff.

**I'm heading O/S to where she is next week, for a 3-week holiday, a lot of which will be spent hanging out with her.**

**A called my girlfriend (who is also a friend of A &amp; E) the other night, after midnight, while I was out. A was upset and had been drinking. She may have mentioned suicide, and kept saying to my GF "please don't tell [seeingmyfriendnextwk] that I'm like this".**

**What's the best thing I can do to help my friend? How should I respond if she talks about suicide?**

**edit:** Forgot to add that A used to be a volunteer counsellor for a suicide hotline a few years back, and consequently says that she "knows all the lines people use".

(Obviously a throwaway acct, since the friend knows my regular username)

Thanks for reading.
