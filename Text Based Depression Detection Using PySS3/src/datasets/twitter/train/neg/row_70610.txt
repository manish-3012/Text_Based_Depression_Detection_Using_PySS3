HelloI just realized this subreddit existed. Iâ€™ve posted in r/depression a few times before about some of my issues. Basically I think about suicide every single day and lately I feel like I am getting closer and closer. I am just so tired. Tired of everything, living, my problems, my job, my debt, my dreams, just everything. 

For the time I am still here Iâ€™ll probably post something every now and then, but mainly just lurking.
