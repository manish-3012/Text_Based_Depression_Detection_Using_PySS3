Would making an attempt of my life during this quarantine put a significant strain on the local hospital/healthcare system?Not sure if this is the right place to post this but a genuine question. I live in the UK if that helps and would not want to do anything that would burden the system during quarantine and potentially endanger people's lives (in terms of lack of equipment). I can say beyond a reasonable doubt that nobody in my household has the virus, so that isn't the concern, but rather if things like ambulances/ventilators or anything like that is in short supply.
