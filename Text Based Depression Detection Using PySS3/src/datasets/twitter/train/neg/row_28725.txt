deadlinei have a close family member...in the hospital...dying...when she is gone, that is my deadline...i will be gone. i don't want to live anymore. this is the end of the road for me. i love her very much. she is the glue that holds the family together. i sit everyday and watch a little more life fade away from her. i have made peace with this. my time is up. the deadline is near. it's time to go. goodbye.
