Recurring thoughts of suicideI'm definitely not an urgent case. Ever since I was 13, I've had thoughts of killing myself. I've never really come close though. Back then it was because I was made fun of a lot in school.

Nowadays, I have a better life. I have my dream job and am respected by a lot of people. I have a girlfriend, a nice group of friends, and supportive family. A lot of times, when I'm around people I know I'm incredibly gregarious and always making them laugh. Lately, I've been feeling more and more numbness brought on by nothing in particular. Yesterday I sat down and thought about how I'd actually kill myself. All the affairs I'd get in order, how I wouldn't leave a trace, how I'd do it calmly and never be found, how I'd wait until my parents were dead and immediately start making my arrangements (they are very depressed and think of me as their favorite...I think the only reason I haven't done it yet is them).

Today I feel more or less fine, but I know this feeling will be back (I fall into planning a suicide about once a month, or more). Is this a common thing? Nobody would ever guess this about me. I honestly can't feel a particular trigger. I just find myself not seeing value in anything - family, friends, relationships, hobbies. I feel so apathetic to some of these things sometimes that I feel like suicide is the only thing that makes sense and that anything else is just spinning my wheels.

Thanks for listening. Guess I just needed to get that out.
