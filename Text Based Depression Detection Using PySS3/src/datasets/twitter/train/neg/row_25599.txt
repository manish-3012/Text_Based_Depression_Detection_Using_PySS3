I don't know where to put this.I've never quite felt this helpless before. I've never had thoughts like this. I feel so depressed, yet so angry. I feel like I went from having everything put together, to having my mental state of mind fall apart. I feel like I'm going crazy. I've never before had such an urge to self harm again. To starve myself again. And I know how dysfunctional that is. I pretend to be so strong, but I'm becoming frayed. I know these urges are gateways into me drinking myself into a coma. I feel like I've been left with nothing, I'm alone in a crowd full of people and I'm not willing to ask for help. I have nothing left to stand on. I feel like it's a matter of time before I become destructive.
