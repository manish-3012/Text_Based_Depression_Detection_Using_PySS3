Friday.My ex has decided to leave me once again because he canâ€™t cope with my depression and anxiety. It haunts him and gives him guilt. I can empathize, as Iâ€™m not much fun to be around (duh). He doesnâ€™t love me anymore but Iâ€™m still deeply in love with him. Cutting off all contact has made me more upset and distressed. 
A job I applied for hasnâ€™t responded, but I guess Iâ€™ll know by Friday. If that doesnâ€™t go well, I have no reason to continue living and I will end my life.

I havenâ€™t had a reason to live for a long while. itâ€™s just whether I am responsible for living anymore.
