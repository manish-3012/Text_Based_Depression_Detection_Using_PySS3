overt hand-wringingPosts like these tend to [deservedly] elicit sanctimonious, half-baked responses. That being said, I have some preposterous half-baked notions; perhaps I deserve discourse from the special kinds of platitude-spewing do-rights that seem to bubble up from the Internet.

Demographics: 35. USian. Dude. Single. No desire to be with anyone romantically, so that's not a problem.

My best friend chose to do "it" to himself in like 2006. His is not the reason I am contemplating it; however it did cause me distress for some time. I moved back in with my father a bit over seven months ago. He's an emotionally abusive man but it's weird; he's supported me materially but he yells about everything. He's done this my entire life. There's a long abusive fucked up history that I won't go into (involving other people too but my dad was out of the picture during that time) but basically I moved back in with him because I was doing shitty at university (burn out, I guess) and he told me he had changed. I thought we could heal together or whatever. That was **such** a load of bullshit. I used to think he was just this way because of his PTSD (he is a Vietnam vet and before that his dad bullied him growing up -- broke his jaw) but I'm starting to think he's just a bigot and a bully now. His dog is hand-shy because my dad threatens him with a fly swatter every time the dog really pisses him off. My dad gets pissed off at little things and tends to yell about them. You can't tell him anything -- I used to show him cool shit I found on reddit and he would almost always contradict it in some asinine way that would end up making me feel small. It's always a chore to explain anything to him because he's losing his memory, refuses to wear hearing aids, and is resistant to anything he doesn't remotely like.

It's weird because he's so duplicitous but I think sometimes he really does mean well. He might be as confused as I am (or even more because he's hardly as educated or reasonable as I am) but he's very macho (e.g. I was a vegetarian for awhile and he called me a sissy -- probably jokingly, I dunno) and he distrusts medical professionals of all kinds. 

Like I said, I went to University. I've been slogging away at one community college or another plus actual university for over a decade. I'm supposed to go back in a few months but there are a shit-ton of academic holds and I haven't even applied for financial aid for this year. I needed to take this calculus class at a community college which I couldn't get into (I managed to get into a prerequisite for the course and got a D in that because I'm still burnt out I guess) but I just let my dad think that I got it because I got tired of him badgering me about it. I feel shitty about misleading him but whatever. I still need the calculus class in order to finish the seven classes (I know) that I need to get the BS in computer science.

My dad is planning on moving to Arizona --  I don't even think he's got anything planned out, though. He thinks I'm going back to school in April. I'm thinking of ending it before then. I'm not really crying my eyes out about it, although I think I may suffer from depression or something. Maybe I'm just feeling sorry for myself.

I have some friends here but my relationships with them are probably as dysfunctional as my relationships with the people in my family. The majority of my friends are just people I grew up and partied with -- total metalhead bros. I'm certainly not, although I think I've sort of fallen in with them. I guess I'm sort of an asshole too. That sucks. I used to be really artistic and into music and art. Nowadays I just sort of watch shit (and not-shit) television shows online and hang out on IRC. I'm not afraid of death, and I feel I may do something soon. I have researched the topic for some time and am quite familiar with the utility of different methods.

At any rate, I suppose this is more than enough whinging. There it is. Now tell me there's hope and that all I need is love. :P

"PS" : I had a thought last night: I'm not a child. I'm 35. All of this navel-gazing is pointless; serves no real purpose. It's obviously some sort of cowardly rambling. Feh.

**Edit:** grammar, clarification.
