Hiding it to an accident?So guys, especially modos, No matter what happens, I'll do it. I created this account especially for this question.
I don't want my family to know it. I know they will be hurt. They believe in God, I want them to live the rest of their life thinking "he was kind and good, I'll find him in paradise". Otherwise it will be REALLY more painful for them.
I need to find a way so ppl think it was an accident. I thought about swimming in the sea as far as I can, so I couldnt come back. But I'm afraid that my body finds a way to keep me away from it.
Please do not supress this post, I really will do it anyway. Don't try to help me, try to help my family to not be too much hurt, to help them go through this.
