I wish I can be euthanizedI have the most boring life ever.I just feel like there's no drive to do anything.I wake up,going to school,going home,lying on bed,and nothing is happening or changing in my life.It's been like this for few years.Completely apathy in my mind and my soul is lost that I know I will never be able to find it.It's so hard for me to have connections to people even with my family.I have no real friends which I get why because even I hate myself.I feel so ugly and fat and dumb and a total failure.
Sometimes I wish I would be kidnapped so I don't have to live in this life anymore.
I wish I can just die.18 yrs is enough and it's too much.
I'm the least important girl in the world.
No one would care.I hate myself so much.
Can I just going to Syria and just to be bombed off?
