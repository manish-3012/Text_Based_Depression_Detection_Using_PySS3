World inside my headAfter the constant criticism I've received all my life, bullying, abuse, sexual harassment, I've gotten to the point where I'm always living in my head...
I have maladaptive daydreaming disorder, and its gone terribly wrong...
I've had it for as long as I remember, and I would always escape to this world inside my head when things got tough but now its constantly, I don't want my head feeling empty or all I'll feel is hurt and pain...
I snapped at my boyfriend of 5 years, I was sick of how he promised to help me with my depression and anxiety when all he did was become a lazy slob, sexually harrass me and snap at me whenever I'd ask him to do something for me...
Now I have an entire life in my head, even a lover, that now I don't want anything to do with my boyfriend...I feel like I'm going insane
I used to love him so much, I used to do anything for him and forgive him whenever he has done something wrong but
I feel pain when he says he loves me, or when he hugs or touches me, or anything at all
I don't believe him anymore
I don't care anymore
I put all my faith and hope into him because life was just unbearable and the only thing that kept me going was the prospect of living with him and becoming a better person, but now that I see its clear thats never gonna happen I want to escape
All I wanted was a normal university life and a new start I wanted to be a better responsible person
but its impossible
I hate how my parents expect so much of me and don't understand and will never understand the pain I'm going through
I hate how my boyfriend says he is sorry and genuinely looks like he is but always never ends up keeping his promises
I hate how people used to take advantage of my kindness in all the schools I've been to and bullied me, and I genuinely love being a nice person and I hate that I've become such a skeptical, sarcastic piece of shit of a person
I hate myself more than anything, I'm rotten to the core, and I live in my damn head and I hate waking up to THIS reality when I would much rather be OVER THERE more than anything

I've lost so much
my dads old personality
my happy mother
my loving and caring boyfriend
all of my friends
my grades
and now, I'm losing my mind too

I doubt there exists any help for me anymore
Just...god, I know one of these days I'm going to do it its inevitable
Please, PLEASE, let me reincarnate into that universe in my head
I don't need it to be perfect
I just want people who care about me
Any universe is fine
Please let me escape from this hell
