After I play the song "Interstellar Main Theme", I will slip off the bridge ledge and just embrace death.I've been thinking about suicide lately. Everyone tells me how I am. I say I'm fine. But I'm really not. I have some sort of evil energy within me. Something always stopping me. Whenever I see people happy I think of killing. I think of anything, a dark force to end anything I hate seeing. I am useless. I am nothing. I am 21 but have not achieved anything. I can picture being lonely for the rest of my life, will never have a wife or kids or a nice house or car or money for a holiday. So what's the point. Nothing changes overnight. Nothing has changed on my time here. No matter what people can say to me, I will feel worse the next day. I cannot do the most basic things like chat to girls in real life or even online. 

I am a virgin, I've never kissed a girl, or held hands with a girl or looked into the eyes of one. I know that's impossible, and I'll gladly die what many people have achieved. It makes me that special. Even disabled people have more love then me. I'm normal but the demons in me stop me from doing such things. I'll never have that golden moment that everyone has achieved, or that good job or that nice car or just a wife I can share stories with. Life is too much worry, too much work, too much morals, too much hate, too much judging. So let me embrace death. And that's it. Gone forever. Will achieve maybe 2/1000 life goals. I just hope this will kill me. When I hit the water, it'll go black, nothing, noiseless. I'll play this song and I'm gone. Forever. Not like I'm of importance. Not like followers or anything will cheer me up. Goodbye everyone. People only care when you die right? Goodbye. :)
