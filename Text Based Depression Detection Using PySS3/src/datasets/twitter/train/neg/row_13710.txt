28 years old and thinking about ending it all.Depressed and hopeless, I ruined the last 4 years in my 20s. I have no career. I know what I want to do in my life but feel like its too late. I'm an university dropout and currently have no money.  I'm a burden to my parents and getting rid of myself would be a gift for my wonderful family. Suicide is the best option because I make so many people in my family suffer and I tried to move or take some action for the last years but I just keep stagnating.
