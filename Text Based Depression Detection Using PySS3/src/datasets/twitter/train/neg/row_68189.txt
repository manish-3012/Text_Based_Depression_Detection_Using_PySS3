I Don't KnowI have had issues since I was around 11. That is when I first noticed my appearance. I have hated myself ever since. I hate how I look and act. No matter what I always feel like I am annoying people. I also am a little pudgy, always been. It's gotten to the point where I will only wear a t shirt and jeans. I won't wear sleeves shorter than to my elbows because I am so self conscious. And if I am not on a diet, I am depressed. My mom sometimes brings home junk food, and I end up eating it then hating myself more. To add to my hatred, I have scars on my body. One time I tried cutting. The cuts were deep and still have scarred my skin though they are several months old. Good thing I don't cut regularly, it never appealed to me again. It hurts me extremely deeply when anyone doesnt like me or is rude to me or snaps at me. I am a people pleaser. I am so worried about people not liking me. Most people don't know how I really am though, I put on this bubbly happy front, because that's what they want to see. I have seriously thought about killing myself before, but am too scared to try. Also too scared of what happens after death. I just want to let it all go. So I guess I kinda want to die.
