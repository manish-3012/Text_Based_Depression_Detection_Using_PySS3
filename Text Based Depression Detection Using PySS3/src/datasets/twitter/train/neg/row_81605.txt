Staying alive for other people is pointless and we're all doing itEverybody always laments how they lost someone to suicide. How if they had just opened up, had they just seen that someone was there for them, they wouldn't have done it. They always say it's selfish, that the person who killed themself hurt them by doing so. And what right does anybody have to say those things? They weren't there. They didn't care. The person couldn't open up. The person wasn't helped by the people around them because they couldn't help. And how selfish is it to say that we all, miserable and suffering as we are, should be forced to live out our lives for the sake of not hurting those around us? Why should we carry the burden of suffering? Let it be spread amongst the people we hurt in our death. What have they done to make themselves deserve it any less?
