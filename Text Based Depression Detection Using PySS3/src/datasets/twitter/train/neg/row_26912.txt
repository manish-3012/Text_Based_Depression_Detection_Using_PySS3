Never quite felt like this.My life is spiraling right now. I've been in bed basically a week. Yesterday was my first day of showering after I took a trip to visit one ot my favorite people and then turned to trash. I have never ever considered killing myself. Sometimes issues with self harm. But I considered spending the evening writing letters and I am honestly so scared.
