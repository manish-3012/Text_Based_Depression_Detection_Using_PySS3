Anyone else having to wait around?I'm in a situation where due to a responsibility I've taken on, I can't carry out my intentions until March. Or at least I'm trying to hold out until then because I don't want to screw everyone over when I promised to help out with certain things.

The wait is horrific though. I never thought it would be this hard. Waking up each day, knowing that there's a metaphorical egg timer over my head is weird. It's also really hard to garner the motivation to do anything when you know in a month or so it won't matter.

Anyone else in a similar situation?
Also this isn't a post to discuss what my issues are or to get help. It's more of a vent to distract myself and hear about any similar situations.
