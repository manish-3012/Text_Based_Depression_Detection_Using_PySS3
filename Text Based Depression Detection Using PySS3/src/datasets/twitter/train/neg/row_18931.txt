Think Iâ€™m going to do it finallyI have nothing to live for. Iâ€™ve lost all my friends. Sorta lost the guy Iâ€™m with for the time being. Iâ€™m never good enough for my parents. And I just donâ€™t feel joy anymore doing the things I love. Iâ€™m supposed to be moving over the summer and life is supposed to become good again but it just feels like itâ€™ll never come. I got into my dream school but I feel nothing at all. I have a date in mind and a plan. I just canâ€™t bring myself to do it yet because I donâ€™t want to burden the people in my life. How do I make it easier for them?
