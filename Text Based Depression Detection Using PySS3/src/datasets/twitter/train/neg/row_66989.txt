Does the feeling of being inadequate ever go away?I'm failing often and I don't know how to deal with it.

Every mistake I make gets amplified and  replayed in my head. I put myself down so often that it has become second nature. All I ever think about nowadays is how worthless and replaceable I am. Because my mind is so cloudy and disgusting, my short term memory and cognitive skills are noticeably laggy.

I've told myself multiple times that it's how I react and move on from failing that matters. That line of thinking helps me temporarily feel better, but l'm not making any progress. I still trip up on words when I talk, disregard deadlines, bomb quizzes and tests, unhealthily lose weight due to poor appetite, and more. Every minor setback sends me into a spiral of self-hatred. 

I'm so exhausted of plateauing in mediocrity and being in a state of disappointment. I go to the top high school in my state, so this feeling of being inadequate is daily. Combined with social anxiety, I don't really fit into any circle of friends either, so the social discomfort only adds on to my exhaustion. I recently lost a close friend who meant the world to me, too. I truly feel alone and invisible. A nuisance for being a waste of space. 

I know killing myself this young is stupid, but the thoughts are pounding in my mind. I hate being a burden to my family and to the few friends I have left. I'm sure they're sick of me complaining about the same shit all the time. The future just seems so bleak to me. I'm scared my social anxiety won't get better, holding me back in college and onward. I'm sick of having every burst of motivation in me to get better and move on getting shot down every time I try to act upon it bc my fear of failure and embarrassment is so strong. please convince me that it gets better soon
