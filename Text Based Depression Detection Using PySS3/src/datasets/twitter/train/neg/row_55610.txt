What sucks the most about being suicidal..You know what just fucking sucks the most about being suicidal??? Being a coward. So many fucking times have I felt like the shittiest piece of trash in the world but I just cant end it... Its not a question of how much I really want to do it, it's a question of why I can't build up the courage and fucking end it. Cutting and excessive drinking are too easy, but the second I decide 'tonights the night, im done' I freeze. I just cant do it. I envy all the people who built up the courage to end their lives! Thats so ballsy!!!!!
