BlankMy life feels like a lie. My thoughts are scattered and over generalised. After sometime they don't seem valid. It feels like I'm in my head. I don't think one ever stops being suicidal. My mom thinks, help come to those who help themselves. And i don't even know how to get help at this moment. I'm so sure that at some point in my life I'm going to kill myself. Thats how i think I'm going to die. I'm not suicidal right now. I just believe thats how I'll end. so i think it would be better if i do it now. Save all the resources and everything. I feel like I'm taking someone's place. If i hold on to the hope i have right now and go on to live mt life, I'll just add to other's misery. The worst part is, it feels everything is in my head.
