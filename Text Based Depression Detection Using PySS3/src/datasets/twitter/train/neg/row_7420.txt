EventuallyLife for me is not something i enjoy. I can't be motivated to just work a job that I hate, and I am always anxious and tired. I decided a couple of months back that I'm going to kill myself. I'm thinking of jumping.


My depression is terrible and its been unbearable for 10 years. I'm posting this because i want to know what are some ways that I should metaphorically "clean house" before I do it. 


I've almost killed myself on a whim just because but i felt like people would have questions or want my stuff or something. I never really wanted to leave a note but does anyone know how i should go about dispersing my stuff or giving answers before i die?
