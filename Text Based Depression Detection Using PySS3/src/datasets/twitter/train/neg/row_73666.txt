I'll get money or I'm gonna kill myselfFuck this. I'll keep this post as a reminder to myself. 

And please don't even try to 'understand', 'support' or any of that fake bullshit. Or maybe if you support financially that's fine lol. 

Those who write online to grab attention as they apparently attempt suicide are stupid attention seekers. I'm not attempting suicide cuz if I was I wouldn't be posting here. 

I'm gonna give myself 6 months (June.18) . If by then I don't have a job, i'll kill myself

If passed, i'll give myself an additional year to get a car (June.19) if not accomplished, I'll kill myself. 

Then I'll give myself an additional couple of years (June.21) if by then I don't have a business that's worth 6-months salary, I'll kill myself 

These things are most likely not gonna happen. As I have enough time to do each task. 

Note to myself: if you go to prison, don't commit suicide until you get out. So you can be happily drugged and have a painless death
