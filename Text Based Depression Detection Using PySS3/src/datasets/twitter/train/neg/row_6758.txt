I couldnâ€™t hold backIâ€™ve been trying not to self harm for ages because I knew if I started I wouldnâ€™t be able to stop. But tonight I just couldnâ€™t cope any longer and Iâ€™ve done it. Iâ€™m 14 and Iâ€™ve got school on Monday and Iâ€™ll have to get changed in pe and Iâ€™m so scared someone will see them. Iâ€™m also scared my family will see them because if they do I might just end it all together so I donâ€™t have to deal with it because I donâ€™t think I can take much more. My mind was somewhere else. I donâ€™t know what to do or how to hide them. Does anyone have any advice?
