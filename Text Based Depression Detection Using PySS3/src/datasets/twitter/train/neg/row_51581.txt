Iâ€™m lost.I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I canâ€™t eat, yet Iâ€™m always hungry. I canâ€™t sleep, yet I canâ€™t seem to get out of bed and face the day. I donâ€™t want to be lonely anymore, but I canâ€™t bring myself to talk to anybody. I want to die every single day, and I tried to kill myself once, yet Iâ€™m scared of dying. Iâ€™m just stuck in this loop of suffering and there doesnâ€™t seem to be a way out. 

Iâ€™ve been depressed for the past couple years, and it was always manageable. Iâ€™ve never really had an identity, never really fit in. I joined the Army because I was hoping it would help me become confident in myself and give me a sense of belonging. Then, two weeks before I was supposed to ship out to basic training, something came over me and I put a gun to my head. I felt ashamed of myself and I never did it again, but looking back on it, it was the first time I felt in control of my life for a very long time. 

Honestly Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m writing here. I guess it just sort of feels good to say all of this to people Iâ€™m not worried about judging me. Right now Iâ€™m at a point in the Army where they want me to either quit or suck it up, and Iâ€™m not sure what the right decision is. More than anything I just want to have a sense of direction, to feel like I have a purpose in life. Have any of you felt this way? If so, how do you deal with it?
