something broke in my brain this time- in the middle of a complete breakdownI was in a psych ward from 10/28-11/4 for almost attempting. Since I got out I've been completely non-functional, losing my shit, haven't had a day pass where I wasn't actively suicidal. I'm so ready to do it. I'm so tired. My psychiatrist says I'm having a mixed bipolar episode and she's right. I'm struggling severely with an eating disorder. Can't get out of bed. Can't leave my apartment. I hate everything about myself. Probably going to have to drop out of this semester of school (third time I've dropped out.) Not totally convinced that I'm not going to kill myself tonight. I'm just tired. I don't think I'm cut out for life. Could really use someone to talk to. Because I'm so ready. This really feels like it. I've been dealing with this for the past 10 years and it feels like it's hitting the peak where it's finally time, it's finally going to happen. Because something is so broken in me this time. Very much in crisis and in so much pain and I can't see a way out.
