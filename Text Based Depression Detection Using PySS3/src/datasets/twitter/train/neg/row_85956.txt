Tonight is the nightI want to end it. My llife is going nowhere I have no motivation anymore just found out I owe money on one of my cards and I don't know how to pay if off. I doont have a job anymore. I took a lot of oxy last night and just woke up feeling sick and dizzy. Life sucks I over it I'm done. Don't lie to me and say things will get better because we both know it won't. Don't tell me to seek professional help because why waste money to have someone lie to face when it happens everyday. The only reason I got out of bed today was because I had class and I don't even want to be here. I'm a failure. So goodbye guys enjoy the rest of your lives. Christ knows I won't
