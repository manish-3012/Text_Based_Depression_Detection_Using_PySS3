Texas Benzodiazepines, opioids and Transgender AfflictionHey guys, I know there's a lot of suffering people here on this sub-Reddit.

But I'm reaching out one last time to see if there's any hope left for me before I crawl into the abyss.

I'm homeless 21, transgender (MtF); have been on the street off and on here in south-central Texas.

I've applied to a Linux administration or even basic technical support positions with unlikely chances of becoming hired.

It's becoming tiring to continue to live alone and without friends

I've been using light dosages of drugs heavily lately to cover the pain before finally lethally overdosing.

I just thought, since I'm going to pass in silence and become unknown I'll leave at least some mark somewhere.

I'm ready to extinguish my existence and become unknown, as so many have before me.

**tl;dr** LEGALIZE FUCKING EUTHANASIA AND END SUFFERING
