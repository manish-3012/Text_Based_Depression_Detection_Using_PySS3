I wish someone beat me to deathmy existence in this world is so miserable, i just cant make a bond with anyone, nobody enjoys my presence or my care.


it fucking hurts when everyone around you is having a great time with their significant others and you're just there, sitting alone because not only you look like a battle scarred goblin, but your personality and social skills are the one of a rock and you're incapable of getting your miserable ass to anything good. It hurts even more when you're young but you still feel like you have lost it already


i don't learn. I can't seem to accept the way I look and behave. I wish someone just fucking kicked my brains out
