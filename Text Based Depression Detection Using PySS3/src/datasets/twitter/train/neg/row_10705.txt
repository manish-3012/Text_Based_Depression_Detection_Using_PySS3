I don't wanna fight anymoreI've been more or less depressed for 5 years. I dont wanna do this anymore. 

For me life is constant pain (also physically). Im addicted to opiates/pain killers.. I have absolutely no energy to do anything, I cant go to work,  I dont want to see my friends at all anymore because Im just so tired. I feel pathetic living like this and Im just a burden to everybody else. This aint life It's just me trying to survive day after day. My family and my boyfriend are the only things keeping me alive, mostly because I dont wanna hurt them by killing myself

Nothing can make me happy anymore. I dont even wanna be happy, I dont want anything anymore. Nothing really matters and I'm just wasting time here. 

I think I should just quit
