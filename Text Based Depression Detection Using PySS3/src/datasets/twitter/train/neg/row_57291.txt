I just want this to end.I feel like am made of utter hopelessness and just filled with the kind of hollow that nothing can fix. So empty and sad and just... what's the point of existing like this.. I can't hang myself I don't want my last moments to be painful life has already fucked me enough. My only way is cutting my wrists or pills they can give me a peaceful ending right? I want to admit something here please don't judge me but from a very very long time I've wanted to be diseased to suffer from something that kills me cause I wanted to go with some dignity. Am a horrible person for wanting that and am sorry am just sorry for existing. I don't know where to get pills but I'll sleep through it right? I won't feel anything? Can someone help me ?
