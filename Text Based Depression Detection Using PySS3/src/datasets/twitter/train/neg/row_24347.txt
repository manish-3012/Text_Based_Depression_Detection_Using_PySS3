To everyone hereThis post isnâ€™t about me. Even though I have depression and suicidal thought, this goes out to all of you..

Iâ€™m so proud of all of you, that might not mean a lot from a stranger on the internet but I mean it. Iâ€™m proud of you all for coming so far, despite all the pain you have, and all of the hardships and depression life has thrown at you.

How brave you all are to come here and talk about your feelings, even though itâ€™s behind a screen, it still takes courage, and it means you still have at least some hope buried in you. 

You all have a lot to live for, and it warms my heart to see all the kindness and compassion here, the amount people care and are willing to reach out. 

I sincerely hope all of you get through this and the help you need. â¤ï¸
