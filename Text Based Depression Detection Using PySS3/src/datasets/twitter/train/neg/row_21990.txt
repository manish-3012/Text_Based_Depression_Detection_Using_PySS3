Has anyone here tried r/nootropics?Have anyone looked into Nootropics? It's herbs and supplements for the brain and mind. I've tried Ashwaganda and Lithium and can say that it definitely does help me sleep better. You do gotta find the right herbs that work for you as each person is different and different things work for different people. 

But even having the best medication I don't think is a solution. You have to have a reason to get up in the morning. Which is what I'm struggling with.
