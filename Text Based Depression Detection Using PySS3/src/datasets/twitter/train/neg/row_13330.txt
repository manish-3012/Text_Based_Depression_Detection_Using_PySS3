I tried to do it last nightI tried to kill myself last night. I took several bottles of pills with some whisky. My neighbor found me lying in the doorway of my apartment with my eyes open but unresponsive. When i came to i told them i was trying to get high and they believed me. I've been in mental hospitals before and i can't take another one. I don't know what to do but i no longer want to die. Nobody in my life knows what happened to me except my neighbor. I have ptsd and the flashbacks keep making me have night terrors. I kicked my dresser last week in my sleep and now I'm limping. I don't know what to do but i think I'm supposed to live. I don't know how to live. There's too much to go through and i don't think I'm strong enough. It feels like every nightmare or flashback takes something out of me
