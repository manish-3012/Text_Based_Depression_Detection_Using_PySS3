How Do I Learn to Accept Iâ€™ll Never Have a Girlfriend or Normal Life?Hello, everyone. Iâ€™ve recently begun to think about an idea I came up with a long time ago: I will never have a girlfriend, much less a wife.

This all began during high school. Like many others, I realized I was different. I have little to no social skills, laugh awkwardly, am not particularly attractive, and (I think) might be retarded. Whenever I would talk to girls in high school, they would react normally. We would have superficial conversations, crack jokes, and discuss classwork; however, we would never get too close. You could still tell they wanted to keep a distance between us.

Flash forward to today, Iâ€™m a student at a college in the northeast. Every time I attempt to approach any girl (not for dates), she will either look at me with disgust or behave awkwardly and look away. Think of when Fiona realized Shrek was an ogre. Now, while I donâ€™t particularly look attractive, Iâ€™m not a stereotypical NEET who never takes the time to shower. I shower, brush my teeth, smile, etc. Whenever I meet a girl, like I mentioned previously, we simply discuss academic topics.

When Iâ€™m at work (food service), will girls shy away when they see me, and the female coworkers I have will observe me from the corner of their eyes. If I get too close to them (about 3/4 a meter), theyâ€™ll back away.

From this, I have learned that women are quite literally repulsed by my existence. Is there anything I can do? I used to be slim (not skinny), but that didnâ€™t help.

Edit: I also want to mention I have already given up on dating and romance as a whole, though I canâ€™t come to terms with it. I used to have a crush on a girl every day as a young boy and teenager, but now I donâ€™t feel anything.
