I'm afraid that I might kill myself tonightI am 18 years old. Up until one month ago, I had the best year of my life with the most amazing person I had ever met. She was my best friend and the person I love. One month ago she decided to remove me from her life. I don't know why, I don't understand. I don't care anymore. I promised myself that if things ended between me and her, I'd have nothing and I was going to take my own life. There has not been a day that I haven't thought about suicide. I don't want to do any of this anymore. I want to be happy. I don't want live my life alone, and I feel so alone. I still have hope in my life that I might find happiness, but I am just so tired of having to try to do that. I just don't want to hurt anyone else in the process.
