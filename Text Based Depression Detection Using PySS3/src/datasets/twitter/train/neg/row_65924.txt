I've tried everything.I've been having these feelings for a while now. I almost admitted myself into a psych ward two months ago because of it. The only reason I didn't was because if I decided life was worth living after doing that, I would be embarressed. I would be a burden to everyone that knew. Always having to tread lightly for fear of sending me into another episode. I don't want that. I don't want to cause anybody else any harm and know about it. I'm treated like dirt. Absolute garbage. I do nothing but good for everyone I encounter. Even strangers. But nothing good ever comes my way. I don't do those good things and expect anything in return. I just hope that one day a ray of fucking sunshine will brighten up my very depressed life. My Father practically wants nothing to do with me. I haven't heard from my Mother in god knows how long. The last thing she said to me was that she didn't want to be in my life anymore. Like she was even a part of it to begin with. She had the nerve to tell me not to contact her again. Like for some reason knowing I was alive caused her a great deal of stress. I spend every holiday usually spent together with family sitting alone crying because I'm not wanted by the people I care about most. I've tried everything. Therapy. Medication. Hell, I even tried believing in God. But then the argument came to my head "If he really existed, why would he cause so much pain and hurt for someone that gives his all for everyone?". Nothing is going to help me. I'm sick of feeling like this. I just don't want to be here anymore. I've put up with too much shit. The people here obviously don't care about me. If I have to to go through one more family holiday crying my eyes out... It's over.
