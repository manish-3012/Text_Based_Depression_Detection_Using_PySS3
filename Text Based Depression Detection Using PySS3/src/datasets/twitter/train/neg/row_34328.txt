Update to I Need Helpu/auroraborealis1985 commented on my last post so I figured to make a new one.

After that post I went and got onto a new medication. It didn't work out so I got onto Lithium a week ago. Lithium is a VERY powerful drug that can easily kill you. Doctors giving it to suicidal patients have to give it in week prescriptions so the patient doesn't try to off themselves.

I've been faithful and haven't tried anything and it's been the most successful drug I have ever taken. I've gone three days without a suicidal thought and my depression is very manageable.

I found somewhere to live cheaply that meets all my requirements.

I can't say it won't change, because life will throw something at me, but I can say at the moment, I'm doing okay.
