My parents are making me feel like I'm a financial burden for getting therapySo 2 days ago, I called the Suicide Hotline then the cops came to my house around 2 AM. They talked to my parents and telling them to get me help is the best option for me.

Then my parents started saying stuff to me...
&gt;
Insurance can't cover therapy! What are you gonna be depressed about? We already gave you everything.
&gt;
DONT CALL THE HOTLINES ANYMORE.
&gt;
VISITS COSTS SO MUCH!
&gt;
I don't know what to feel about that.
