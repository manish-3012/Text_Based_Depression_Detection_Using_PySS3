My parents mentally fucked me up foreverever since I was a kid I knew there was something wrong with me, no matter how hard I try in school I just couldnâ€™t figure things out, put attention or concentrate, or really felt normal. I didn't get the best grades even when I tried my hardest,had bad hand writing or was never that good of a reader and felt constantly overwhelmed,like my mind couldnt keep up the pace. Emotionally I was all over the place.my parents would always say that Iâ€™m not trying my best,that Iâ€™m lazy,that I didnâ€™t study,that i was acting up; So years of this Keep going on and my brother and sister ended up doing so much better than me which lead me to depression, always doubting myself, and just feeling like a failure.

then in my 20s,my fucking 20s,my sister told me that I had all those problems because I had a literal mental deficiency which explained why I felt like this and why everyone else did so much better than me. And my fucking parents knew all along but didnâ€™t have the fucking balls to tell me and made me feel like shit for so long. Well damage is already done i guess now I have all the problems that I listed above for the foreseeable future all thanks to them.

so yeah fuck them
