Is there anywhere i can get help, and get it fast ?I have a lot of issues in my life, and I can't take them anymore, I've been disappointed by so many people, I've disappointed myself, my family and I'm just shaking from fear but I decided to commit suicide today, I don't even have the energy to go forward or to lift myself from bed I just can't.

All the issues can be solved with money, I contacted every so single institution in my country both via email and in person, I even contacted Bill Gates nearly a month ago but he never replied. I tried to get help for so many years now, I cried out loud but it doesn't seem to matter.

I'm so torn inside, part of me doesn't want to do this but I don't see any other way, I feel like my life is a mistake.
