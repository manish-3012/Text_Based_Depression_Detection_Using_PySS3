Itâ€™s hard having happy friendsIâ€™ve recently started going to school again after having to leave the first time from depression. I moved in with one of my close friends and his girlfriend spends most of her time in the room with us. I have such a hard time watching them be happy all the time, not that I want them to not be happy I love both of them and what they have for each other but itâ€™s just reminds me of how alone I actually am and how Iâ€™ve never had anything like that and never will. I canâ€™t even speak to someone I donâ€™t know, tried for the first time in a long time today and she found me even more boring than I thought I was.They can see it sometimes too and try to help but they just donâ€™t get what itâ€™s like trying to fall asleep hoping you donâ€™t wake up and being disappointed when you do. Recently checked to see if I could get out through the window (23rd floor) no dice it only opens enough for my arm, why canâ€™t there just be a quick way out.
