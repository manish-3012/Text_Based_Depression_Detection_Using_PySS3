Botched eyelid surgery... unable to close my eyesBotched eyelid surgery 6 months ago.. unable to close my eyes fully. Can't sleep can't relax. Everytime I blink I feel pain. It's like relentless torture. Sought several different opinions from other doctors... they don't take me seriously, only suggest eye drops as if I haven't already.  Sigh I don't wanna live like this anymore
