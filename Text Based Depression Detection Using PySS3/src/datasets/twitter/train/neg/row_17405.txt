I want to get taken into a mental hospital.I'm scared of what I'm going to do to myself. I feel numb and I just want to constantly die. 

I want to get taken into a mental hospital by my own free will but I don't know how. I'm underage and from the Netherlands and uncertain of how any of it works. 

I feel like my parents would just brush off my problems like they're 'just in my head' which they are. I'm scared of what I'll do to myself if I'm not taken in.
