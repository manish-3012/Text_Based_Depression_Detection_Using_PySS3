50 and I've had enoughI'm a 50 year old woman. I'm on my third marriage, to someone I don't love. He's a an alcoholic who lives beyond his means. Everyone thinks he's a great guy, but since I got laid off 3 years ago I've driven myself mad trying to hold things together. He really is a talented entrepreneur, but he is aging out of his business fast and he won't modernize.

I was never able to get another decent job. I used to be beautiful, but like many women my age, my looks are going. We don't have sex anymore, he doesn't know how to touch me and never cared to learn. I have always been disappointed by love. I've had my heart broken a few times, so I never got to experience my soulmate.

I have two wonderful children who are happy, independent and grown up. I am so saddened by the state of the world and the fact that no one seems to value older people anymore that I'm just ready to go. Everything just seems to be getting worse.

I haven't had a mammogram in ten years, I don't take blood pressure medication, I don't get my moles checked. I'm not interested in living any longer. 

I put on a good show for everyone. I don't want to die too soon, my mother is still living. She's vital, financially secure. Of course, she's a republican boomer who had a government job so she's set for life. I'd like to not die before her, but if I do, I do.

I'm taking anti depressants, I exercise, I don't drink to excess. I just don't want to be here anymore. Having to worry about money for the rest of my life terrifies me, and I would just rather sleep.

I wouldn't ever shoot myself and I'm scared to death of car wrecks. But I think I'm dying slowly of disappointment. And I hope it's soon.
