A complete failure at everything I do... Hopeless,worthless.I need help. I have been seeing a therapist for years, no help. My anger is out of control, I cant fix anything.  My life is misery, despair, and failure. Everything I try to do is failing.  I own my own business, have for many years.  It is failing.  I want it to kill me. I make things for people, I am one of a kind in my area yet I am constantly failing.  Wasting time and money.  Every project is days or weeks of my life worth of money.  I have less than 4 months of money left and a hard machine crash resulted in every dime of that going away.  I did everything right, but still everything went wrong.  I have spent too long living in this terrible situation.  I want out. please, someone tell me that it is okay to make the pain go away forever. I just want it to stop.  I cant sleep, I am putting on tons of weight from my stress, I am ruining my relationships, and weekly I am losing my voice from screaming as I do not know what else to do.  I just want someone to tell me it is okay to die, that they understand.  That they can see I tried my best and do not want to live in this world anymore.  I need out. Please, someone..
