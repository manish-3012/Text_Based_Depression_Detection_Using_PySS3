What is there for a debt ridden, alcoholic fuck up?I was originally planning on dying August 5th because that's the day after the final show of the Rennisance festival I was hired for, but I can't do this anymore. 
I'm trying desperately to figure out why I should stay alive, but there isn't a point for me anymore. I'm 15k in credit card debt, I'm a lying alcoholic with a family that hates me, my teeth are bad, my liver is shot. I have no job, no car and no friends. I don't enjoy anything. Past traumas and the horrible words of my dad 'helping' echo in my head like nightmares. 
Theres no point, and I'm not strong enough to be alive.
