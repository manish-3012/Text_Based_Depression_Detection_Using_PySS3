Finding a way to do it isn't the hard partThere are so many lethal things in this world, you just got to know how to use them. You could kill yourself with almost anything if you're creative enough. I am confident that I would be able to kill myself using a bag of apples or cherries.  But even if you're not as weird as me, there are so many ways to end it. 

I just can't do it because I emotionally can't. Because I don't want to let some people down. Because I don't want to be a burden. Because funerals are expensive. Because of the very few things that used to make me happy and now I so desperatly want to be happy again, even though I know it will take years or maybe not happen at all.

Man I wish I could just end it all. I'm just fucking up everything. I used to feel like my life going down was because of stuff I couldn't control, and felt like shit because I couldn't even change my life. Now, my life is going down because I'm too fucking dumb to be  an adult. This time it is my fault that my life is getting worse. Feels even shittier.

I wish I could just die in an accident so it wouldn't be my fault.

Fuck it, I just want to be dead.
