I canâ€™t anymoreI (24f) was repeatedly raped/sexually abused when I was little and now basically Iâ€™m. fucked up. I canâ€™t deal with it anymore. I literally hate my body and self harm constantly. I have flashbacks, nightmares, and panic attacks. People say to get therapy but Iâ€™m in all these forums with people who have been going to therapy for CSA for years and theyâ€™re still dealing with the same things so whatâ€™s the point? Suicide seems easier 
Idk Iâ€™m fucking sad and overwhelmed right now. I donâ€™t want to feel anything anymore. I just want to hurt myself and not have to deal with anything
