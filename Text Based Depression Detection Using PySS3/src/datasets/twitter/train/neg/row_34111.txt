Why would you text random strangers?Yeah I know, off context, but don't worry, I tried to suicide like one year ago and as things are going I might try again.
But why would people here answer to random strangers? If they are commited they will suicide anyway, if they're not they just won't
Why bother
I'm not criticizing, just trying to understand
