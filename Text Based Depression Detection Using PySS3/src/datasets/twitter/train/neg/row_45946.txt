I'm bored of livingI have nothing to look forward to and it's just apathy all day every day. People say to get a hobby, but nothing interests me. I can't go out and meet people because of my social anxiety, and the anxiety also stops me from telling anyone offline about my suicidal thoughts and stuff- I literally just freeze up and cannot speak. My whole life consists of waking up and barely doing anything- maybe playing my idol games on my phone, watching some YouTube videos that don't interest me because nothing does. Sometimes I just lie in bed because it's too hard to get up. Rinse and repeat, day after day and week after week.

Another day is just too long to bear, let alone the rest of my life. (I'm 15)

I guess that if I put a lot of effort in I could get better but I'm too lazy and not motivated enough. People say that they can't help me if I don't help myself and they're 100% right. Technically I *am* choosing not to help myself. Suicide is just so much easier. 

I don't have an entire plan set out yet but I'm definitely doing it, probably through suffocation (no access to drugs so my best bet is doing it just before I fall asleep and hoping for the best) or hanging. 

My first post here got ignored (or more likely not noticed) so I'm hoping people will respond to this one.
