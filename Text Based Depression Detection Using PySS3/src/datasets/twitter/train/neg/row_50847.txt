HopelessI've been up for 6 hours, most spent in bed. So why am I exhausted? Is it mental exhaustion? Can I be that sick that even feeling hopeless tires me now?

My classes start this week and I'm considering dropping out now before day 1. It's that or kill myself. What a failure. I can't handle it. I'm so worried that the pressure will get to me and I'll crack. I'm so worried that today I even walked myself through what I'd say and do if I needed to admit myself to a hospital for my problems. But that's a last ditch effort if anything. I don't want help, dreaming of death is much more comforting.

I look at myself in the mirror and I hate the face that looks back at me. It's ugly and misshapen and uncared for. I think my appearance was the start of my self esteem issues, which now affect everything I do.

I'm not sure if I'm lazy or severely depressed. It is so uncomfortable to put myself out there and accept any responsibility. My good days consist of staying at home and doing inconsequential things by myself. It's only when faced with doing something that I get defensive and angry and weak.

It would be so much easier if I was dead.
