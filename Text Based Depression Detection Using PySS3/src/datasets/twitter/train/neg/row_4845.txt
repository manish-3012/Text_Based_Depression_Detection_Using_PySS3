Fear of dying old and aloneI'm a 20-something male. Life is okay for now, perfectly tolerable. Only problem is that I feel totally incapable of earning a lifelong relationship, and it fills me with fear of the future. I want very badly to be a husband and father. I look at my grandparents, in their 90's with over 60 years of marriage, with three kids and through them many grandkids and great-grandkids who all visit them a lot and make holidays great big events full of life and love. My grandparents have lived a full and wonderful life, and I only hope to live the same 

But my greatest terror in life is the thought of reaching their age and having no family there for me. What the hell will I do on Christmas morning when I'm 80 years old and I have no family to be with? If I never find love and fatherhood I'll just want to kill myself before the loneliness settles in with old age.
