Iâ€™m just confusedIâ€™m still young only 15 about to be a sophomore in high school a three sport athlete and have a varsity letter but for years Iâ€™ve been thinking about killing myself. For about a year and a half I was depressed but about 6 months ago I didnâ€™t feel depressed anymore but I didnâ€™t feel any other emotion either. Now I donâ€™t care what other people think about me but I still contemplate suicide a lot. Iâ€™m not depressed and I donâ€™t harm myself in any way but I just donâ€™t feel motivated to keep up in school keeping up with friends and family or just living in general. Iâ€™m always tired and Iâ€™m just really confused and wondering if Iâ€™m the only one like that. Iâ€™ve never told anyone about it but I just needed to let it out.
