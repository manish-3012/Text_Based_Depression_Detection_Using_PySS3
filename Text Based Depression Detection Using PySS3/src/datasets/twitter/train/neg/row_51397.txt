What is this?I know I am feeling depressed, but I don't feel suicidal... I just feel like laying here until I die.   I recently quit my job for no reason.  I don't have any close friends I can turn too or talk too.  No family either.  Is this the beginning of the end?  I feel like crying.  But I can't.  I feel like drinking but I don't.  Just laying here.  I feeling like yelling for help but I don't know what for... the is no reason for this post.
