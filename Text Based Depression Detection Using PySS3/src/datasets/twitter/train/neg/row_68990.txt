The only thing I want is to kill myselfNothing is enjoyable anymore. I donâ€™t want to do anything with my life. Iâ€™d rather just die right now. I will kill myself before I am 22 years old. I am currently 18 and I donâ€™t want to live in this world anymore. I am not made to live in it and I have no purpose to be alive. I have no useful skills in life and I donâ€™t want to improve myself. For now I just eat loads of junk food with no regard for my health. I donâ€™t give a shit about being healthy because Iâ€™m going to commit suicide anyways.
