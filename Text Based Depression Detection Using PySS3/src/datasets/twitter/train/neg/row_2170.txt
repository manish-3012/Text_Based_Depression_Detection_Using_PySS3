I want to die but don't have the courage to end itYet. I don't know if I'm more afraid of dying or staying. Or the pain, which I'm sure will be intense, but is it any more intense than what we go through day to day? I just lay in an empty bathtub imagining what it would be like to bleed out.

And of course, I'm afraid for the pain I'd put all my loved ones through. But I can't take it anymore
