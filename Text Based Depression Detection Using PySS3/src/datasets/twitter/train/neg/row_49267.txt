I do not want to wake up tomorrow...10 years since I stopped self harming. Iâ€™m supposed to be happy but Iâ€™m not. I canâ€™t take another year of uncertainty and more suffering. I canâ€™t take another year of job searching and trying to gain purpose and independence, all for it to end in declines and no responses. All for there to be nothing on the other side of this nightmare. And of course the one escape I had is gone. The one person that kept me smiling and motivated just had to leave me even more damaged than I was before. Whatâ€™s the point anymore? I do not want to wake up tomorrow.
