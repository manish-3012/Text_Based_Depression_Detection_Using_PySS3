Feedback needed. Has anyone been to a hospital?Hi, 

Iâ€™ve never talked to anyone that deals with si and donâ€™t have anyone to relate to about this outside the internet. I wanted to know if anyone here has been to the hospital for not being able to stop thinking/wanting to end your life and at what point of severity did those thoughts bring you to action and get you to go there. 

I am about to graduate college and had a job offer from my internship that was retracted due to the economic situation, I get to stay on part time which is better than nothing considering whatâ€™s going on. I am also a veteran, I did 6 years active duty and switched to the national guard while I finishing school. I have struggled with depression since 2014 and it has gotten significantly worse in the last 3 years. Getting help, as youâ€™re instructed to do in the military, lead to me being medically separated from the national guard. I was good at being in the military, did my job well, got promoted quickly and never got into any major issues. At the time I didnâ€™t realize how much of my identity was removed by that separation.

I am on Wellbutrin currently and itâ€™s working as far as getting me moving and able to focus but suicide is becoming almost all I think about. To the point it is impairing my ability to function socially and at work. I donâ€™t know if everything being over zoom is helping or hurting his situation. I also am starting to feel like nothing brings me any sort of joy or even satisfaction, and itâ€™s impacting my relationship with my girlfriend heavily. I constantly feel like I want her to leave or I need to breakup and thereâ€™s no reason to feel like this. I am also getting nothing out of my hobbies or anything I liked to do. I donâ€™t have any appetite anymore at all, I eat one meal a day, if that, and often find myself forcing a meal and having to remind myself to eat. 

I am worried that I am starting to lose my grip on things and something is very wrong. My memory is getting what I would describe as loose. I donâ€™t know what do to. I donâ€™t want to slip and make a mistake that will hurt my family or my friends. I just canâ€™t find any sort of peace in anything anymore and donâ€™t really have the drive to keep going. Has anyone experienced anything like this and would like to give some insight, as well as been through a voluntary hospitalization and has any insight there as well?

I would ask other veterans but most Iâ€™ve talked too want to turn it into a who had it worst contest or a between services comparison. Iâ€™m not trying to say anything like that and just want honest insight. Iâ€™ve never told my family about this and donâ€™t know how. My girlfriend knows but I donâ€™t want to talk to her about it because it really makes her upset. 

Thank you anyone who was willing to read through this and share their experience.
