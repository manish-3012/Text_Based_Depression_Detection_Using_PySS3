An update.. I posted on here earlier this week and got on overwhelming amount of support and kind words. I just wanted to give you guys an update on my situation...

Thanks to the kindness and generosity of you guys I was able to stay in a hostel this week and will be staying here until Sunday morning. 

I was put on probation yesterday after going to court for the past 6 months over the rediculous charges pressed against me by the father of my children. My probation officer isn't exactly sympathetic to my situation though and let me know that if I'm not in an apartment or a stable place to live by the next time I see him, I will be put back in jail. Not exactly awesome news. It makes me freak out and get even more over worked. At least they took the gun from me.

My father wrote me a note this week. Hes disowned me and asked me not to contact him at all. His neighbor let me know that he took down all his pictures of me. 

The father of my kids also let me know that he's going for full custody. That his family feels I'm not stable enough to be around my kids and theyre afraid I'm going to run off with them. 

I'm not doing much better than I was a few days ago I guess. I'm trying hard to hold on, but I'm not sure what there is for me to hold on to. I wake up and don't know why I bother getting out of bed. 

I had a job interview and even though I tried to paint on that mask and pretend I'm living the good life and am "normal", I could tell that they weren't interested in me. They could see the hopelessness in my face. I didn't get the job. I wasn't "qualified" even though its a simple waitressing job and I've got plenty experience serving. 

So after Saturday night, its back to wandering the streets. After Monday my phone will be disconnected and I won't even have you people to talk to. I guess its for the best. Just a sign to give up and lay down. 

Thanks for listening guys. Sorry for wasting your time.
