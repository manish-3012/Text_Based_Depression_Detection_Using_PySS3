Iâ€™m an assholeIâ€™m not a great person. I put on a front...Iâ€™ve done everything I could to treat my gf well and be a better human for the both of us. Sheâ€™s got me in the â€œI donâ€™t know what I want anymoreâ€ spot. I recently put my dog down and lost two of my best friendsâ€™ mothers to cancer. All in the span of 4 months. She has a bad past with an ex who used to threaten suicide when she tried to leave him, and now I feel like I canâ€™t discuss my feelings about it with her. Which makes me feel like an asshole. And so I decide to live, knowing Iâ€™m an asshole having to deal with the thoughts that if I killed myself Iâ€™d be even more of an asshole for leaving people behind. So itâ€™s this vicious circle that I canâ€™t come out of. No matter where the circle stops, itâ€™s always on â€œIâ€™m the selfish assholeâ€ and no one wins. People will move on, live their lives. Sheâ€™ll find someone worth her time that she can settle down with. Every time though for me, Iâ€™m the selfish asshole. I literally have nothing left in me. If I killed myself years before I met her, weâ€™d all be ok.
