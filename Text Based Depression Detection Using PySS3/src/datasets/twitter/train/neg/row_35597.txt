I'm financially trapped and I have no support. I had dreamed of moving out of my father's house sometime soon, but I finally received the letter telling me my loans from dropping out of college were coming due. $100 a month when I only make $350-400 a month. Worse yet, they've been cutting hours from the part-timers at my store, so I'll be getting even less than that pretty soon. Adding to all this the fact that I've been heavily "self-medicating" with alcohol lately and that whole idea kind of flies out the window.

My father insists that the military is my only option at this point, but I really don't think it's a good idea. For strarters, the one thing I want more than anything else is to experience a loving relationship, and with a whopping 14-20% female population in military depending on the branch, combined with my social ineptitude and boring personality, it basically means that that would never happen for another 4-5 years. Additionally I've been suppressing transgender feelings for more than half a decade now and would really like to get around to addressing those at some point, and the military doesn't exactly lend you a hand for those sorts of issues.

I've been throwing around applications in hopes of finding a second job, but it took me eight months to finally find this one, so I don't really have confidence that that will work out anytime soon. I just made an appointment with a local mental health counselor earlier today to see if they can help me work through this, but it's going to be $40 a session, so it's not exactly making my financial situation better.

I had been feeling vaguely suicidal for some time now but getting that letter really pushed me over the edge. It's going to be such a long time before I have the financial freedom to do anything. More and more I just feel like there can't possibly be anything worth fighting for on the far end of this situation. It would be sparing myself so much pain if I just ended it now.
