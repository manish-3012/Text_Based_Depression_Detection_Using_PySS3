No reason in livingI just feel like there's no point in living anymore, I've always lived with the thought/ plan of killing myself after my parents die and yet I always sortove feared death still but I really don't anymore. I don't even feel like living for them to not experience my death anymore really and I'm not afraid to die infact I'm more then ready. The world's or this life's just not for me and I'm okay with that I don't really want it to be. Every second is just tiresome and really there is no point in being happy in the end even if i felt I could be i don't want to be. It just really does not matter. Idk why I'm even here writing this i feel I've made up my mind and I'm comfortable with my situation I guess I just wanna know people's thoughts on this way of thinking since i find it kindve interesting, but maybe I'd feel different if i was happy with my life who knows but idc anymore
