Is constantly thinking about death the same thing as being suicidal?Occasionally I'd think about killing myself but I'd rather it just happen. Sometimes I think about what can happen to me. Or getting cancer or something.

 I know it sounds petty. My issue is just feeling irrelevant. Especially around women. I feel like I either annoy them just by saying hi, or overall, they don't care to know me. This girl at work, she's amazing. But usually when I say hi, she acts distant. But when she interacts with other guys no. 
 I've always felt like the odd one out. 

 Around family, and friends, I often felt like the stupid one, the one that everyone knows will make some stupid mistake. I try to avoid that but often when it happens, it is heavily scrutinized. Often I always felt inferior.

  But especially when it comes to women, I often feel like I do something wrong. Maybe I give bad vibes? I often try to be easy going and funny. Usually at work, I'd keep to myself unless I am comfortable talking then I can actually be funny. But deep down I feel like I just wanna be hit by a truck. 

  I don't think about committing suicide because I don't actually have the guts to do so. I just think about dying alot.
