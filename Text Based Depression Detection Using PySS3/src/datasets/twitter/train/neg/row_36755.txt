the world doesn't want me. i'm not terribly enamored with it, either.everyday is a constant struggle to keep going. i'm 30, single, gay, ugly, alone, talentless, no family, no real friends, i don't have a car, my job is a dead end, i have insurmountable health-related debt. i've tried to do so many things in my life- art, writing, technology, programming, fgc stuff, music- i've failed at all of it in spectacular ways. i am worthless and miserable and experienced enough in the world to understand that it's too fucking late for things to turn around. really the only thing keeping me from killing myself at this point is natural pain avoidance. It's fucking bullshit that I don't get to have a say in whether or not I'm born.
