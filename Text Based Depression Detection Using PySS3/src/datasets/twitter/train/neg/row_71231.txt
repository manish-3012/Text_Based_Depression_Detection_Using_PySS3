fuck thisI think I'm just done. I don't know how to deal with the stress of college and money and living.. It's all too much. I can't do it on my own. I found out last night I owe money I don't have and I don't know how the fuck I'm going to be able to pay off this shit. My mom said she would help me by asking my brother for money (he saves a shit ton of money and never uses it) and then giving me some also. But my sister just told me she's also going to ask my brother for money and.. he probably won't be down. I don't think I can rely on that. My dad refuses to help me at all. And it just sucks because I don't know what the fuck to do. I didn't learn this shit in school, i'm so helpless.

My sister is about to leave town and it would be a good opportunity to just do it today. I can't even stand looking at social media or talking to anyone right now, it all feels fake. I just want to die so bad. I wish someone would just kill me so I don't have to do it myself.
