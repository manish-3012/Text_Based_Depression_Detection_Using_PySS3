Gf is in hospital most of the time, i am drained to the point of collapse.My girlfriend suffers from frequent cluster headache attacks, which have been exacerbated by a large benign brain tumor. She also suffers from PTSD, depression and anxiety attacks, for which her psychologically abusive parents are responsible. She is emotionally dependent on me, but while i love her a lot, trying to take care of her is draining me physically and psychologically. I am about to move to a new town for my Masters course, but the present situation has greatly affected my preparations. Im torn between doing more for her and trying to take care of myself. Knowing the kind of a person i am, i will probably fail at both.
