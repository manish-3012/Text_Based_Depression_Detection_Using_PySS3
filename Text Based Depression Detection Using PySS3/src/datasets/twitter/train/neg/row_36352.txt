Anxiety is ruining my lifeEveryday is a struggle to get through with constant worrying, it wears me out and I've just had enough of it. I always worry about things in my future and how I couldn't deal with them, and every time I just tell myself I'll kill myself before then. 

The only reason I'm not dead already is because I don't know how to do it. I just hope that something out of my control kills me at some point. 

I'm moving out to university in less than a year and it will probably be the worst experience of my life so far. I can't make friends because I'm too socially anxious so I'll just be alone all the time, not that that's much difference to now. I feel lonely 24/7, I would do anything to have a relationship with someone but anyone I have a crush on is way out of my league and everyone always says you'll find "the one" but I don't know who would want to date an unattractive socially awkward bisexual.

I feel awful for putting all my problems on the 2 people I do speak to, I feel they just think I'm attention seeking, they don't know that it's made me suicidal.

Sorry for wasting your time
