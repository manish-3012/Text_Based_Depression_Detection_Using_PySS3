Anyone out there?I can't stop this vicious cycle of self neglect. I sit all day and do absolutely nothing. This is not right. I have a child and an elderly father I should be taking care of. I hate leaving the house because I am a toothless freak. I don't shower or change my clothes. I was never like this. My life was fun. Somewhat tough but I had fun. Now all I think about is death.
