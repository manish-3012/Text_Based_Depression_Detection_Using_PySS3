"Don't end your life, just change it"I am sick of people saying that, if you're unhappy with  your life make a change, even if drastic change, let go of everything and start again. 

No, that's not how it works, I don't hate my current lifestyle that it can just be changed. 

I dread my very existence that's haunted by its past and can never have a future. I cannot change the essence of my existence, I can change my job, my city, my friends, even family maybe, but none of it can change the way I am
