I'm about to let it goAbout a year ago, I got diagnosed with depression. Every fucking day seems like I am a stake getting pounded into the ground and hammer hits me further into an inescapable hole. I'm 18, never dated anyone, never kissed anyone. I've tried but I get rejected. I consider myself unattractive and I feel like the lack of interest of girls helps support my claim. I start college in January and I don't party or anything so I won't have any luck finding someone there. I can't get myself to love myself. I feel like if someone loved me, I could finally accept myself, but after dealing with another rejection today it doesn't look like it. I've tried suicide twice. Once I pussied out, the other time I fainted before painting my walls red. I can't fucking stand to live in a world where i'm trampled on and feel like im left out. I have (had) hobbies but i just lost interest in them. The only thing that puts me off from doing this is my family which i feel guilty for, but I guess you don't feel guilty dead...
