RationalitySometimes suicidal thoughts occur with great emotional upheaval and upset. Other times it dings like a microwave finishing it's cycle. 

I don't think I want to die. I think sometimes it would be nice not to have existed - and therefore not to have to think, scheme, plan, worry, and be tied in to a myriad of experiences, emotions and responsibilities that I didn't ask for and don't know how to manage. Not to have to ask 'who am I', why do we exist' and 'how do we go on'. To be truly free of encumbrances. 

Running through lists of potential causes: Emotional under-development. Bad biochemistry. Stress. Poor support network. Poor upbringing. Bad biology. Loneliness. Lack of targets. Poor self-actualization. Bad diet. Ego. Brain damage. Weather. ?

I want to rid myself of these unhelpful thoughts but I don't want to take drugs for it. Will I ever get away?
