RelapsedSo recently, I started back on escitalopram after taking myself off of it stupidly. I've been feeling extremely depressed again and this week I began self harming really deep and frequently after a year and a half clean. I'm so disappointed in myself. 

I've been thinking about overdosing but I don't know. I need help. What should I do?
