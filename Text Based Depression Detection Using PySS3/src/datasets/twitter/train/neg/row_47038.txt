Cutting I know I posted this elsewhere but I thought more people needed to hear it.

For anyone who is cutting can I recommend other self-harm methods, I stopped cutting about a month ago and I did that by finding other methods to self-harm like EXTREME exercise or ice that is less permanent and a lot healthier these helped me to overcome my cutting addiction and the exercise even makes me feel good about myself.

Do some research online and come to a method that works for you but please don't cut it is very easy to go over the top and cause serious damage with a knife and cuts if not treated will scar and can get infected.

Please use this advice and try to get better for the people who care about you.
