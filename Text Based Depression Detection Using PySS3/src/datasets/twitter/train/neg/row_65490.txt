I just want to sleep forever.I hate having so many responsibilites and people depending on me. All I want is to take a whole bunch of meds and sleep sleep sleep. 

I just took a 6-hour nap after taking 2mg of xanax and a sleeping pill and I only woke up because my kids are back from school. Now theyâ€™re back to screaming and being loud and just being kids and I canâ€™t fucking take it anymore. My husband is being such an angel taking care of them. Iâ€™m skipping dinner and staying in bed like a fucking teenager running from my responsibilities. I am NOT a good mom. I know it. Iâ€™m just a ghost wandering in the house.
