School worrying and debtSo Iâ€™m in college and on academic probation and Iâ€™m really worried about my classes- well history for the most part because I donâ€™t know how I did on my last test before break and the only grades are 3 test and I got a 72 or 78 before and itâ€™s stressing me the fuck out I keep thinking like oh â€˜what if you got less than 30 and thereâ€™s no way you can passâ€™
And idk what would happen to me! Do I loose my finaid for spring? I donâ€™t have family, I donâ€™t have anywhere to go and test and money have beeen stressing me out and this stupid week long break makes everything worse 
I already had to live in a shelter when my family kicked me out, I got my first credit cards and my stupid threapist encouraged shopping therapy until I was in debt and then she encouraged me to join the army. Cause Iâ€™m so sure the army is looking for suicidal homeless girls to join.
Iâ€™m so tired and just suck at everything I try to do for myself.
I couldnâ€™t even go back to therapy. Not when my family left me all those were going to kill messages and the dumbass was like well maybe just show up and say you were wrong!
It just so frustrating! I feel so fuckking tired, stressed, and worthless.
