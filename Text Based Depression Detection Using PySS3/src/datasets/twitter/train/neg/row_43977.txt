I will live 2 months. That's it. Recommend me activities before deathI just need to hear some fun and final things to enjoy before death.

The only thing that is motivating me to live on is my website in development. If it succeeds, I can enjoy income on auto. I am putting all my saved money into it. 

My medicine doesn't reduce the depression I fought since 12. I yell at people in my head from time to time. 

I don't want to improve my life, anymore. I found a peaceful way to die.
