Is suicide wrong if it saves undue suffering?I'm 35, have had two strokes, am in constant physical pain (Central Post Stroke Pain Syndrome), have lost my job, became homeless, and struggle with basic things like walking down stairs (I fell again yesterday).

I don't have any family, both parents dead, nor any friends... 

On top of all that, I'm still fighting with social security, who thinks I'm not really disabled. My only doctor is through the VA, and VA staff refuses to work with social security, so I didn't even have a doctor's testimony for my alj hearing. If I get an unfavorable decision I'm just going to do it. I don't want to live my life in pain on the streets, with no chance at ever doing better. I can't work now, not at what I was doing. I even tried returning to the lowest easiest position at my job, and couldn't do that.

Is it fair to ask me to endure near constant pain, solely for the sake of existence?
