Does anyone else find that the fear of whatâ€™s on the other side keeps you from killing yourself but somehow that makes you more depressed?I just feel like that survival instinct that kicks in just makes everything ten times worse. And people who say well thatâ€™s a sign that you shouldnâ€™t do it donâ€™t get how that isnâ€™t it at all. Iâ€™m already not human Iâ€™ve already lost my mind I have nothing left. Like it just feels like torture.
