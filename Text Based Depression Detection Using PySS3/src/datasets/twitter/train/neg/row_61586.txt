One year anniversaryThere's always been something wrong with me, no matter what my diagnosis is, my primary symptoms are a depressing emptiness, self-hatred, and loneliness. I think I had my first diagnosis before I hit 10, but the last year has been completely unbearable. 

One year ago yesterday was the last time I could say I genuinely felt happy. I didn't need to buy anything, or drink, or go out and do anything fun, to be happy, I was just happy for a little while. I know I was still "depressed", I could feel it, but I was managing and I was genuinely content with my life. So, "happy" may have been too strong of a word, "content" may have been better. Point being, I was okay, I was stable, and I had a positive outlook on the future for the first time in a long time.

The late hours of March 31st or the early hours of April 1st, will make it one year. That is when my life went down this suicidally depressed spiral that I can't escape from. I don't think it's getting better.

I don't want to be like this anymore. 
I don't know if I'm going to make it to the 2nd.
