He told me to go die.. will I?He blames me for everything bad he does.  If he drinks and calls me horrible names or degrades me, it's my fault.  If I complain about something he does that hurts me, he always makes me the problem.  I'm sitting here, alone, right now and thinking about what he said.

*Go die somewhere else.  Just not near me.*

He makes me question myself.  I know what gaslighting is and i know he's doing it to me, but I still feel like it's my fault - all of it.  I just keep hearing the lyrics from a Postal Service song:  "And I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving."  Over and over over and over.  


People have hurt me - abused me and assaulted me.  Sexually and otherwise.  Since I was a kid.  It never ends.  It just never ends.  


I'm not too old, but I'm in a high risk group for the virus.  I have asthma and almost died before when the Avian flu was a thing, though they could never find out what happened.  ARDS.  It is no joke.  Ventilators.  Coma.  I'm so lucky to be alive.

When he tells me to go die, he knows this.  He knows I almost died.  He knows I've thought about it.  He knows that I've considered taking it into my own hands.  He knew I spent some time this summer researching methods.  He knows I went on certain disreputable sites.  He knows I've been trying to get medicine from my doctor.  He doesn't know that ever since he started being cruel to me and since this virus talk is spinning me around and around.. that I am thinking of using it go away.  He knows that he triggered my PTSD the other day.  He knows and he told me to go die.  He lied to be about someone else; he controlled me, made me do what he wanted and lied to me about the time he spent with her.

I can't get it out of my head.  It's different when someone else says it compared to the voice inside.  I feel smaller and sadder, less worthy, less good.  Less everything.  I feel like I'm made less by his words, his desire for me to die.  It makes me tiny and insignificant, worse than I was before.  He stomps on me like I'm an ant and grinds me into the ground and I think of being sick and I think of the medicine I could go get today.  I think of the medicine I've had.  I think of how it felt to have it race through my veins; my pain went away.  Not just physical, but mental, too.  I think of the way that I haven't felt okay since then, not really.  


I don't want to die by the virus, so I can't go get the medicine.  I don't want to die by the virus, so I stay inside.  I've thought of it, considered it, but how, how, how.  


I'm sorry I wasn't good enough.  I never have been.  Never.  I am broken beyond words, shattered and sick.  There are things I think that I don't share.  I want to cry and I want to plan and I can't stop thinking about it, thinking about it, thinking about it.  I saw him cut himself and bleed a week ago, but I'm too pussy for knives and razors and all of those things.  It's the pills, the pills, the pills and the combination and putting everything together.  Will I do it, will I..

I'm so tired of hurting
