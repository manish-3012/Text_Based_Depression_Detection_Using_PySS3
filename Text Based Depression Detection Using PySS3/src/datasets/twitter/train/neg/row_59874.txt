Finally worked up the guts to tell my family I was actively suicidal and they all just politely ignored meWe were talking about my postponed doctors appointment and I mentioned that I think most of my symptoms pointed towards depression. It wasn't some half hearted hint or a casual mention. It was "I think i am suicidal". Silence. No response. Then my mom just continued to talk about the dogs.


I try so hard to reach out, and it's so difficult for me. Why do I even bother...
