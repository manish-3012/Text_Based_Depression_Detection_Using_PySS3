Holding on to strawsThese past few weeks have really wrecked me. I've been dealing with some self-esteem shit, and my mum isn't helping. We have this thing on the system my school sets work on where your parents can see all the work you do/quizzes you've done, and of course she went through them. Nitpicked basically everything she saw wrong, barely payed attention to the large majority of work I did well in. I've already been dealing with a lot of self-hatred for the past 5/6 years, and depression hit me pretty hard the start of this year. Constant suicidal thoughts, and I was doing okay until like 2 weeks ago. I can barely get out of bed in the morning now, not to mention the current state the world is in has just completely berid of the faith I had in humanity. Shit's just been hittin' the fan.
