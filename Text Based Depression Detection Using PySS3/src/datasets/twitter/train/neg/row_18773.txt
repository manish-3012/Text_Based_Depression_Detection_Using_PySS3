hello?ive been strugling with depression for the past 3 years and ive been suicidal for 2 of those. it all went ove the edge when my ex killed herself and left me and her son. i was 15 atm and im now 19 and everyday is getting harder to get through and all night i get nightmares about either my dads abbuse the rape i went through or my exs suicide. i dont know if this will do annything but i just needed to get this of my chest. sorry for wasting your time and have a nice day
