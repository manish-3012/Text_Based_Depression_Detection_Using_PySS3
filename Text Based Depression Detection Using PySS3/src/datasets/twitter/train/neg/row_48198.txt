I dunno why people try to stop people from commiting suicide when we're all gonna die anywayIm not encouraging people to suicide, but i dunno how commiting suicide when your lifes doomed, and when nobody gives a shit about you anyway is worse than dying from an accident or natural death, especially if the normal death occurs when youre happier (if thats possible). I think most people try to stop them for themselves/to be a good person, even though its only delaying the inevitable for some and subjecting them to more shitty days, weeks, months or years of feeling impossibly shitty every day. Why torture somebody? We're gonna die, like it or not, so i dunno what the big deal is tbh.
