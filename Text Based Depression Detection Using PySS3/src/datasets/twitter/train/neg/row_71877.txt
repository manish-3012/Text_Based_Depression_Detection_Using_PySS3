Help meAfter three years, she left me. We had an LDR, and she gave up on me.

I was an ass about a couple of things, but she didn't just talk with me about it, or I didn't listen. It's my fault either way.

I was insecure and scared of losing her, and I lost her because of it.

I was here for her when she was at her worst, and stayed up to make sure she was ok every night she asked me to. I feel used.

But wait, there's more. My mom's dying. Been an alcoholic all my life, and she's getting closer to the end. I've been taking care of her and it's killing me.

I dropped out of college because of my fucking OCD. I got scared and paranoid and shut down.

My only real life option is to move 2000 miles away to live somewhere I hate and leave all my friends behind.

I won't end it, but I really want to.

If I ended it she'd care again.
