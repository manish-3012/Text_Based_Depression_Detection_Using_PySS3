Well, that's itJust found out I'm failing out of college which I honestly already expected because some days I can't even go to class because I don't have the motivation to be alive, much less go deal with shit. I've been suicidal for three weeks solid now and I'm at the breaking point. I just tried to open my forearm but my blade isn't sharp enough to get through the scar tissue. I'm literally frantic and don't know what to do
