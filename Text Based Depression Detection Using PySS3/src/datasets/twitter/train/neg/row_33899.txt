I don't want to liveI have no purpose in life. I'm a young female and over it. My sister was murdered almost 4 years ago now. My entire family fell apart. Everyone said things will get easier. I have consistent nightmares where I forget that sheâ€™s dead. I'm hitting so many milestones and she wonâ€™t be apart of them.  I haven't eaten in over a week and my life is meaningless without her.  I have tried anti depressants. Lots of them. We all go to a good afterlife right? Guys, I can't continue without my sister and I want to go where she is.
