Is this suicidal ideation?I don't know if this counts. I don't want to kill myself. I don't want to die. I'm terrified of dying. But I'm in a very bad place right now and there are times when I wish that I didn't exist and I want everything to just STOP. I'm waiting for a call back from my therapist to schedule an appointment and I'm going to discuss this with her, but I just want to be able to put a name to this feeling.
