Goodbye everyone!Alas, the day has come! I donâ€™t feel super upset just a little bit on all the things Iâ€™m gunna miss out on, like weddings, birthdays and all sorts of family events. I sure wouldâ€™ve loved to stay honestly but I do not deserve to see them, I hurt too much and I would like it to stop as soon as possible but it seems unlikely! I hope I die and god shows mercy upon me anddd I get to see my family in heaven esp My girlfriend ! Although she wouldâ€™ve probably gotten over me by then , so Iâ€™ll probably leave her alone. I hope no one feels sorry for me I really do deserve it!!!! Iâ€™m not really good or useful at anything so if anyone was to lose me, in all honesty would make no difference to them or their lives. I wish I could wake up tomorrow and be super happy all the time but i canâ€™t be, I know. Iâ€™m so sorry about the way I am. I never thought Iâ€™d grow up like this, thought Iâ€™d have my life figured out by 20 but Iâ€™m more confused. I cannot wait to die and rid myself of the disease that is me. Iâ€™m so sorry, I hope in my death my family take something from it. I donâ€™t really care too much that they will miss me, if I donâ€™t kill myself tonight I will have done so by February 21st
