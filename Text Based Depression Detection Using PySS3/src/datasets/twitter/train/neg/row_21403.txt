Iâ€™m thinking of killing my self but I donâ€™t want toThe title says it all. Iâ€™m 13M, this past year has been hell, and it doesnâ€™t seem like anythingâ€™s gonna get better. I hate myself and my family. I donâ€™t think my friends like me. Dysphoria is starting to physically hurt me (stomach ache, chest pain) and I donâ€™t want to tell my parents because I donâ€™t want them to know Iâ€™m a failure.
