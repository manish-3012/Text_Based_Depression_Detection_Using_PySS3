I just want someone to tell me it's going to get betterI got my dream job about a month ago but due to alcohol, I ended up quitting and leaving. Literally, this was my dream job. The one I had wanted since I found out about the place about ten years ago. I was doing what I loved which was helping sick animals, getting them better and finding them forever homes. I've gone from being on cloud 9 to being in the deepest despair. I have never felt this hopeless. I feel I have let everyone down, that I am a failure and that my life will never be as good as it once was. I just want to know that life will get better. I just need to know that these feelings will get better. Because right now, I don't think it will. I think it would be easier to just not be here than to keep experiencing these feelings. I just want to feel better.
