Can someone please keep me company and talk me down?I'm having a panic attack and intrusive thoughts and I just can't be alone right now can someone please help me?

The source of my panic is a genetic disorder that causes many tumors to grow all over my arms, legs, and abdomen. Basically I'm having a very severe panic attack because I feel like I'm being eaten alive by this disease and I'm really scared of my mental state right now. It's a benign disease but I'm being slowly disfigured by it and it's making me feel really bad about myself and it's just going to keep getting worse. 

Thank you so so much to anyone who helps me. I will do my best to type but unfortunately I'm shaking and trembling really hard right now and I just really need someone here for me please because I just can't be alone right now. Sorry, this is embarrassing for me but I just really need someone to talk me down and convince me that it'll be ok.
