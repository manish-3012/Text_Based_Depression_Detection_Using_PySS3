Sometimes the only thing that keeps me from suicide is the memory of the aftermath when a friend killed themself.F* throwaways, this is me. I cannot believe that my end of life would leave people unaffected, I know there are people who love me and would miss me; my life doesn't suck any less for that knowledge. I have wished for my life to be over for nearly 40 years, ever since I realized life is not permanent. I've survived 3 attempts (separated by 6+ years) and I'm feeling close to #4, a more final and definitive action. The first time I just wanted to fall asleep and never wake up; the second time I tried crashing my car; the third, I tried to starve myself to death and we see how that worked out.

Due to chronic illness I am disabled, my mobility is severely limited and there is zero hope for recovery. I don't want to die but I can see no reason to continue living, I bring nothing of value to the world and I'm tired. I'm done. I don't want to do this anymore.
