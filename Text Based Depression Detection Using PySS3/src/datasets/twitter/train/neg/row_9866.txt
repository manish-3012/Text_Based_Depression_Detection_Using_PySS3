Iâ€™m ready to go.I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m on three different meds, I get violent outbursts, I lost my girlfriend months ago, my family despises me, my younger cousins hate me and constantly insult me. I dropped out of school a while ago. Iâ€™m also overweight, and have no friends. Thatâ€™s not an exaggeration. Fucking zero. Iâ€™m not happy. I just want to fucking kill myself. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold on. I used to be happy. Ever since I turned 13 everything has been spiraling downwards. Life isnâ€™t meant for some people. Iâ€™m one of them. Even the things I enjoy (IE: Star Wars, Skyrim) are becoming stale. Truth is, Iâ€™m probably going to end it all very soon.
