16 F stressed and very depressed.Last night was very shitty for me. I told my crush I liked her and she said she adores me and im her #1 best friend but she isn't looking for a relationship and I just feel like I wanna cry. I don't get any enjoyment out of playing video games and im so behind in 2d art where we have one project due this week and the concept for another project. In which its almost the end of the fucking semester. Term classes are the worst. Especially when the teacher bullshits her way through 3 quarters of the class only to rush 3 projects onto us. I have 3 essays due for my english class and next semester, I have gym. Im usually the only one there who's borderline fat. I really just want to be dead and I have no hope for 2019. It was a really awful year for me this year and I don't think its going to get better.

Might as well just try to OD on my depression and anxiety meds.
