Waiting for the inevitableI don't really know how to explain the way I'm feeling, but I'll give it my best shot. It's been almost a year since I last attempted suicide (29th Jan). Since then, I just feel like it'll happen eventually. As in I will die by suicide at *some point*, whether that be now or in a few years. I've just lived day by day, feeling empty, and being shit scared of the fact I'm doing nothing. I'm 17 and not in college or school or work. I fucked up my test results at school, because of some weird thing inside me that seems to make me sabotage everything whenever it goes well. I'm just sitting here, thinking my future is most likely to live with my parents since I can't do anything for a couple years then kill myself, probably before I'm 20. I think COVID was actually a bonus to me, because it meant I had less pressure from family to get a job or go to college. If they kept up maybe I would've died this year. I can't stop thinking about how I felt when I attempted earlier this year and how happy I felt when I thought it was all going to be over. Sorry for the horrible formatting, I'm on mobile right now.
