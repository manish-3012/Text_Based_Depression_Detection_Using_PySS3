My Brother Needs HelpMy brother needs help.  In the last year, he has come to terms with the fact that he has a serious drinking problem.  He has said some really rash things in the past, and at one point had to be "committed" briefly for a couple nights because of his threats.  He has taken some positive steps since then, quitting drinking with only one relapse that I am aware of, getting medication, seeing a therapist, but it doesn't seem to help.  See [this brief exchange](https://imgur.com/a/uq0LcFF) from today.  It is difficult because he is *soooo* misanthropic and hopeless feeling that I feel like any advice I can try and give is just laughable.  e.g. "I understand Stalin.  Just scorch the earth, fuck everyone", "Well it sounds like you just need some good ol' fresh air!"  I do think exercise is important and it has helped me with my own struggles with depression, but in response to such angry, genocidal statements, it does seem comical...  however, he has taken the initiative with the things I've mentioned above, and I am just at my wit's end with what the next course of action should be.
