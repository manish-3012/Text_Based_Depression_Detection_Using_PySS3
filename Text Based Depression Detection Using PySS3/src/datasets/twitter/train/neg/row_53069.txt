I'm terrified I'm going to lose my job, and so much moreI am not okay.

This job is all I have. My life is in ruins. I'm broke, I'm lonely, I'm unqualified and I can't see any brighter tomorrow. This job, and the people I work with, are the only thing I have left in this world. I have an "official meeting with me and my manager about a complaint regarding my behaviour". I've already received a written warning. I've defiantly acted unprofessionally,  and I can't sleep or eat now. I've considered ending it before, and I've been hospitalised for it. But I'm scared that if I go to work tomorrow, I won't make it back home.


TLDR: Im petrified of losing my job. It's all I have. I don't think I'll make it home. I'm not okay
