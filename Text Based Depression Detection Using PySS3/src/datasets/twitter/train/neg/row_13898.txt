I want to end it tonightNothing has changed since I was 14. Im just as depressed and stuck in my room with no friends at 25. My social skills has gotten worse too because of it when it was quite bad already in the first place. It sucks because everything else in my life seems great. I make good money, have a great family (mom and sister), Im healthy and Im good looking but whats the point if at the end of the day Im just by myself again feeling lonely because I cant keep up a conversation with another human. I go days without saying a word. blah blah blah Im done with whining. Im omw to downtown chicago to jump off one of the high scrapers right now
