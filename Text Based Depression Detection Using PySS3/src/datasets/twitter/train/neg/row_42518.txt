I have plans to end my life. I just don't see anyway forward.I'm so tired. I've tried to be a good person. I think I have. But I've never been a successful person. I'm soon to be a two time college drop out. I'm just so awful at being a successful person. People always seem to take advantage of me. I get hurt by so many people. I know there are people who care. That's the only part that makes me hesitate. But isn't it enough that I've worked to help other people. I've worked so hard to make other people happy. I want to die so badly. Why do I have to feel guilty about it? I just want to die. I've done so many things to earn it. I'm not happy I won't ever be happy. I can't even remember the last time I was happy. I'm never going to be happy or successful. Why should I have to continue this miserable existence. I have no future. I'm out of options. I just want to go. I don't know what to do or say. 
Thank you for reading. If it helps, assume that everything worked out.
