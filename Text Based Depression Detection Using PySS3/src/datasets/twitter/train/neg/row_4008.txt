Time passes, but nothing ever changes for meEveryday is the same. I got clean about 2 years ago but I canâ€™t feel time anymore, my memories are like dreams I can barely remember, time passes but Iâ€™m stuck. Everyone looks at me like Iâ€™m doing so well just because I got clean, I work and do well in uni. But Iâ€™m Fucking drowning. I feel nothing, completely empty. I have no want to make friends or find a boyfriend. I remember when I used to live life but I havenâ€™t for a while. I try to tell myself Iâ€™m happy or Iâ€™m doing well, but in reality Iâ€™m not. Today I realized that I donâ€™t have to live like this, I donâ€™t have to be a shell of a person. Yes I could relapse and get some relief from this hell, but how would people remember me if I died from an overdose? As a junky? A fiend? I rather people see me for what I really am... broken... idk maybe thereâ€™s a better way to go... I just canâ€™t do this anymore. I havenâ€™t been happy for a long time, I havenâ€™t been sad... I just want to feel something but I canâ€™t and this is no way to live life. Maybe Iâ€™ll wake up tomorrow and love myself and my life... thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been telling myself. But it never happens... so yea Iâ€™m just here floating in time while everyone is living their lives...
