Wish I could just dieLast year I planned on killing myself after christmas. Then my cat got cancer and I decided to wait until she passed. I didnâ€™t go trough with it I felt like I couldnâ€™t do that to my family but now again Iâ€™m thinking about it. 

I graduated school which I thought I couldnâ€™t or that I would kill myself before it happened. I expected relief but that was stupid. I donâ€™t know what to do or what I want to do now I got into the university I wanted at the time I applied but itâ€™s wrong I donâ€™t want to go I donâ€™t even want to work within that field, all I know is that I want to die I have nothing to live for. People keep saying my friends or family but I just want to die it maybe be selfish but everything is too much. 

I start school in a week I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll make it. All I want to do is just lay in bed all day and do nothing for the rest of my life. I keep wishing I could be in a car accident or that someone will break into my house and kill me. Everything hurts.
