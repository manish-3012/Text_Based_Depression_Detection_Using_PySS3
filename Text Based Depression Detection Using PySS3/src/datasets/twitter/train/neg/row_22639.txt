Finding it hard to not just give up entirely..No job. Job hunting for over 6 months. Despite several interviews, it appears I am unemployable. No employer seems willing to take a chance on me. The well of money has dried completely. I have a family who are dependant on me. I am unable to provide.

I can see no way out of my current situation other than just ending it all. Every day is a struggle. Applying for jobs is a struggle. Existing is a struggle. I don't want to struggle any more....

I'm fucking done.
