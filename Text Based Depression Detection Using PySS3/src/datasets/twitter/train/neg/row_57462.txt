Iâ€™m canâ€™t keep going like thisMy parents are loving, and have allowed me to live at home while they pay for therapy and a psychiatrist to get me better. Everything looks great from the outside but everyday I am more and more miserable. I donâ€™t talk to them, so they just see my actions as me being lazy, so they yell at me. Their yelling and disappointment leads to further depression, self-hatred, and anxiety. This leads to more actions that they view as lazy such as not getting out of bed or wanting to sleep a lot.
I just want to end it. Iâ€™m tired of their judgment and disapproval. Iâ€™m tired of feeling alone. Iâ€™m tired of hurting and having no one see or believe my pain. My mom has ambien (a prescription sleeping pill) and I think Iâ€™m just going to take as many of those as I possibly can and then drink vodka. Also Iâ€™m going to take all of my antidepressants too. Hopefully I will do it later today or tonight
