I just wish I could do it, I just want the pain to end. I posted last week asking for advice, I got some and carried on with my life hoping I would get better, I rang my counselling service and today I had a phone call asking details and doing the usual checks to see what is wrong, no one knows that I am doing this I'm just hoping I will get better

I realised the only reason I stop myself from going through with suicide is because if my family, I don't want to leave them and destroy there lives because of me, I just can't do it anymore, I think to myself, what if I do it today, where would be the best place to do it, how would I do it, but what about my family, eventually I fear I will just slowly stop caring enough about anything else that I will go through with it, I know a lot of you will think well you're not suicidal if you're just thinking of your family but right now there the only thing keeping me from doing it

This probably doesn't make sense, sorry my head is everywhere and I can't think straight
