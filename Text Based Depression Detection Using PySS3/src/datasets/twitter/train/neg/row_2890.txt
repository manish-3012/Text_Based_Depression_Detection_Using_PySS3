I wish I didn't feel like I needed to do this.So, I just can't. I feel so lost and confused. I try and put as much effort into doing something good, and every time I do, my father plays the "Better than me" act. I'm a nurse-in-training at a fairly good college. I've stayed out of drugs, alcohol, the "bad" group of people. I avoided being the problem for people, even at my own expense. And trust me, I have taken my fair share of abuse. 

My dad's ex-military. Doesn't drink, smoke, drugs. But he LOVES to be right. ALL the time, EVERY time. Specifically when you try to have a disagreement with him. He holds things over my head that are from years in the past like they are still relevant, to besmirch my years of hard work to make a better future for myself. And he loves to start the hostility with swears and his famous temper. You can be having the best day, but say one wrong word for another, and you are gonna be screamed at. And no amount of explaining your point will convince him you are right. And I don't know how much more I can take. 

I'm not posting this because I want attention. I wanted to vent, and to ask those of you here... who else is going through this? I just really want to talk to someone about this right now. And maybe I can help someone too.
