I think i'm gonna kill myself within a few weeksI struggle a lot with homocidal thoughts, I wanna kill and get the urge to kill random people, even people I love for fun. The only things stopping me are: 
the fact I'm not strong enough to kill people with out weapons around
I don't wanna go to prison 
I don't wanna kill someone when there are other people closeby 
People will obviously hate me if I do it and will think I'm crazy

I don't know why, but I really really want to kill someone. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna do it if I stay alive for some longer. I want to kill myself so I can protect the people I love from me. I'm protecting and saving them by dying.
