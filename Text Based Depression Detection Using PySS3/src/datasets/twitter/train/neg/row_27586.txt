No motivation to change my lifeEver since my mother died when I was 12, I've had almost no energy for life. I've had essentially zero friends throughout high school to now and the only social interaction I would get is from strangers online that I would never form a stronger relationship with. 

Now at the age of 24, I'm a virgin who still lives with his dad. I leave trash and cases of beer all around the place and all the while he ignores it along with my existence. There are pictures of all my siblings around the house, none of me however.

This lack of support throughout my life has made me hide from things I should do to improve it. Seeing a therapist, eating better, trying to meet people, these are all things I know could possibly improve my life, but all the isolation I've endured growing up forms a mental block in my head preventing me from actually taking the steps to do so.

I think about suicide daily, but not sure if I could ever go through with it seeing as how I never go through with anything else in my life. I just want my existence to end.
