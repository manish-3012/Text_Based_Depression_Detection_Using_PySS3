Iâ€™m so anxious and I just want it to stopIâ€™m at like, peak anxiousness rn. Iâ€™m convinced people are watching me and looking for reasons to berate me or get something from me. Iâ€™m anxious all the time. I donâ€™t deserve to feel like this all the time. I was suicidal a few years ago and made it out but now, the thoughts are back full force. I canâ€™t stop thinking like, hey, if it gets really bad, I could just end it. I could always just go ahead and do it and it would all be over with. No more anxiety. No more feeling like this all the time. Iâ€™m so upset about it I want to cry, but crying doesnâ€™t help. I just want it to stop.
