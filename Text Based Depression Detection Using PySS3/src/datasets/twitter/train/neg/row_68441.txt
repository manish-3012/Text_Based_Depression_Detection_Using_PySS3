When you wake up in the morning and the very first thought is that you want to dieYou want to die when you eat

You want to die when you try to sleep

You want to die when you work

You want to die when you exercise

You want to die when you shower

You want to die when you are on your phone


Sure, sometimes I get focused on the present and forget it about because Iâ€™m in the moment but obviously soon enough the though comes again.

I wonder every night if the next morning the thought would stop coming to me like magic but of course the very moment I wake up the thought pops into my head as if it was my daily ritual.

Itâ€™s not like the current situation is hard for me. The only thing thatâ€™s hard for me is that I canâ€™t get my thoughts to come true. Either I have to get my thoughts into action or have my thoughts be gone. Tried twice already and it didnâ€™t work. Wasnâ€™t able to do it to myself. I donâ€™t know if I was afraid of being suffocated for a several minutes. Maybe a gunshot would have been easier.

But with the country I am in, thatâ€™s not possible.

Iâ€™m sick of therapy. Iâ€™m sick of the same tests that I took for the last few years. Iâ€™m sick of talking to strangers that have to encounter me just because itâ€™s their job.

Life is just boring. Used to like gaming, used to like technology. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t do those stuff anymore, but they donâ€™t interest me anymore and the only reason I do them is because Iâ€™ve done it before and those are the things that I know about. Current me is merely a remnant of the past.

Used to be very curious. Now nothing really intrigues me anymore. Miss my old past self but heâ€™s gone now.

Iâ€™m just tired. Tired of living. Just like how people get hungry when they donâ€™t eat long enough, I want to die because Iâ€™ve lived too long without any pauses. Just wish it was easy as eating
