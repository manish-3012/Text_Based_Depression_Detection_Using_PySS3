The cycle won't stop repeatingSo i can't sleep to get the thoughts to go away and found myself looking up painless suicide methods. obviously won't mention any of them.

I'm just so tired of trying to be a normal functioning person and constantly fucking up in social situations and losing friends over and over and over again. at this point the meds don't really help because its no longer a chemical issue and more i just can't stand the sadness and regret and pain from hurting others through my actions. I'm feeling pretty numb while typing this but i realize i should at least seek some sort of something. i don't even know. i just feel alone with little to no outlet for my feelings.
