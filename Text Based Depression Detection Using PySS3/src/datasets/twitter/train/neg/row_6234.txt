I just joined. Spilling my thoughts.I am a dude in my mid 20s. I have always suffered from mental illness. Iâ€™ve tried several medications and talk therapy. I was able to keep afloat and hold down a job and such, but the last year and a half have been jobless for me. I havenâ€™t been able to work. But I also canâ€™t get disability. I feel like Iâ€™m letting everyone down, including myself. I was fairly successful before it got worse to where I couldnâ€™t work.

Iâ€™ve been with my girl for over five years. We own our own home. We have a good life. Relatively little to stress about. 

But Iâ€™m unable to bring myself to clean. To walk the dog. To bathe. I feel like I canâ€™t do a thing. And I am a person that used to run on determination and motivation. But now... Iâ€™m just eating like shit, passive aggressively killing myself by not taking care of myself. I wish my doctor gave me anti anxiety meds a while back because it wouldâ€™ve helped a lot. And even though I have no history of addiction, neither of my doctors felt like giving me something for my sudden anxiety episodes.

I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going with this. But I think about suicide nearly everyday. Prozac felt like it was starting to work. But then I reverted back to my old ways. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. And I donâ€™t really have anyone to talk to about it. And even if I did, I donâ€™t know what to say to be honest.

I am just so exhausted.
