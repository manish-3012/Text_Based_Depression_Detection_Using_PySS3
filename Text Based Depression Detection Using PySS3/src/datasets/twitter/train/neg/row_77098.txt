Every day I want to give up forever.Every day I want to give up forever. 

I do not want to keep going.

I did not want to begin in the first place.

The only thing holding me back is the possibility that what comes afterwards is worse than this already is.

I should just suffer less now.

Life as we know it to be is short anyways. 

The longer I live the faster it goes. 

Nothing makes sense because there is no overarching purpose.

Everything is fleeting and bothers me.

I do not want what I need and I do not need what I want. 

I keep to myself because others are unbearable and unable to be trusted, among a myriad of other reasons.

Just the fact that something can exist, does exist, can go wrong, and does go wrong, has shut me down.

There is no reason for my words to be spoken as I do not care about any responses.

I am trapped with this mind.

Or is this how it is supposed to be?

I canâ€™t get along with anyone anymore. 

Did I truly get along with anyone in the first place?

Iâ€™ve never been able to get along with myself. 

I have to cope with the fact that everything is unnecessary and nothing matters in the end.

Nothing mattered in the beginning.

Nothing matters now.
