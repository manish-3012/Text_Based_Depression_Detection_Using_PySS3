Whatâ€™s the point of all of this?Iâ€™m 16 years old. Anyone in my situation would say Iâ€™m living the dream. My family arenâ€™t rich or anything like that but are just a little more well off. Iâ€™d say weâ€™re lucky more than anything. Despite having loving parents, a wonderful little brother and a few close friends that care for me very much, I feel alone. I feel empty. I feel numb. I donâ€™t know why because I should be doing pretty good compared to some others, but Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m dying inside. School is just too much. Iâ€™m a junior and I have no idea what I want to be, where I want to go for university because I lost my passion for everything. I donâ€™t see myself having children or a spouse. I donâ€™t see myself getting my so-called â€œdream jobâ€ whatever that may be. I donâ€™t see myself growing old. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m strong enough. I would have to watch my parents die and Iâ€™ll probably lose some of my friends along the way and I just have to live with it and move on? I canâ€™t. I would rather die first even though I know it would hurt them and it sounds extremely selfish but I just canâ€™t handle it. I would have to watch my generation and everything that came with it die out. I know Iâ€™m not strong enough. I want to end it all but I just canâ€™t bring myself to do it. It will crush the ones I love but I donâ€™t want to continue. I wish I was never born (Iâ€™m so sorry but I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to this about and I just needed to get this off of my chest. Thank you for listening to me.)
