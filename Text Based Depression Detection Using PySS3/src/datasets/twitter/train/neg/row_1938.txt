Flipped a coin to see whether I should just get it over with or stick it out for the rest of the weekCame up tails, so I'll give it till Sunday and see what's up. I may be able to finally set up a job interview soon, I should find out tomorrow. Hopefully things turn out in my favor cause I've been sending out applications since April and I'm out of liquor and running low on cash. If that doesn't happen and I can't manage to make anything else in my life change then it's back to the coin.
