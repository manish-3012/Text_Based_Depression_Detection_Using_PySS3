Scared.I'm 25. I have 3 kids of my own who I love more than anything on this Earth, a husband who pretends to care about me (actions speak louder than words) and 2 stepkids that I could never see again and I honestly would not care.

I've been in a deep depressive state for months and I honestly don't care anymore. The only reason I'm alive is because of my children.

I don't tell my friends about these intrusive thoughts. I had to move to a pretty remote part of town because my husbands court order says he has to stay within the same school zone as his ex. 

I hate having my life run by a piece of literal trailer trash (actual trailer trash. My stepsons room was a closet in a trailer for a while.) 

I hate that my mother let her brother molest me as a child and she blames it on me. I hate that she treats me and my kids like crap and only comes around when it makes her look good. 

My stepson intentionally gave me a concussion in May and my husband didn't take any time off work to help me because he had just taken a week off for himself a few weeks before that. I was in the hospital 2 weeks ago for kidney disease that I have. I have a kidney stone that's stuck and won't pass, and its causing me absolute agony every second of the day. No one cares or is willing to help. My husband had to go to the ER last week for something minor and now he's off work for a week, but doing nothing to help. 

I feel so alone and I don't know what to do. I feel abandoned by everyone. Should I go to the ER?
