Is there someone out there to talk to?I know I keep reaching out for help on here but people seem to stop talking after 1 conversation or even halfway through. Either have to get on with their lives or I'm a burden, so if I am dont respond but I just panic right now and I want someone to talk to but I have to wait until I can get therapy and I dont have nobody to talk to in real life so I just didnt know what else to do other than post here again
