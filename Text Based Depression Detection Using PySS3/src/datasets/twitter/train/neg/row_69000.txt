Worried for my SOI don't know where to start, so I'll just start throwing it out there. My wife is recently having panic attacks, severe anxiety, suicidal thoughts that she has voiced to me. All the symptoms of clinical depression are there, too. She's 34, in ok physical health, but she's always been a worrier and a bit high-strung. She won't talk about this, but I know she's always prided herself for being in control and capable of taking care of everything by herself. She has a hard time accepting help with anything from anyone.

She called me this morning to tell me that she harmed herself. She has never harmed herself in the almost 17 years I've known her. She is really scared now because she's never harmed herself before. Now she's worried that if she talks to a doctor she'll be committed for observation because she harmed herself. 

I don't know how to help her. Please give me some advice. I've read the guide on how to talk to her, but I don't know if we should go to a doctor, what kind of doctor, or what. I've never dealt with this before. But I love her very much and will do anything I can to help her.

Thanks for reading.

Edit: Went to counseling yesterday. Got a recommendation for a psychiatrist to see. I talked to my wife about hurting herself, and she said she'd tell me or call me if she felt like doing anything like that again. In the meantime, we're just hanging in there until we can get to the doctor. Thanks again, everyone.
