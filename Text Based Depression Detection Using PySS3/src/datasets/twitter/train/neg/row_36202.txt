Just wrote my suicide note. Felt so calm. Why?No, I won't divulge my boohoohoo stories. You lots are miserable enough as it is, ha-ha! Had bouts of depression, suicidal, and it got worse the last 2 years. Yesterday, I wrote my suicide note. For some reason afterwards, I felt happy a bit. Calmer, though I did think death even more now (surprise....). I felt invincible or sorts. But when I was at the convenience shop earlier, nearly broke down crying... I don't get it.

Edit : Just in 2 hours, I already felt how therapeutic a support can be. I mean, even dogs need and get talked to, what more a human being?
