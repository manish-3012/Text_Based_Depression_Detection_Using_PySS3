My Acid trip gave me a taste of what death felt like. And I liked it.Iâ€™ve felt death, or at least a touch of it. Ego death, after the most intense acid trip of my life. 

I felt each and every one of my memories decay into nothingness. And after that, there went any semblance of personality and individualism I had. I felt a deeper understanding of life, death, and the human condition. I became both nothing and everything at once. 

I had slipped into the void, a dark place where nothing exists but everything returns to. A black hole of time and space. 

All there was, was experience. Just the purest form of perception. â€œIâ€ didnâ€™t exist, time didnâ€™t exist. Nothing mattered, nothing was real. 

I want to go back, but I know if I wanted to stay Iâ€™d have to die.
