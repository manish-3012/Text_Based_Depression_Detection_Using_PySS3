I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do thisI have spent the last 2 and a half hours sitting in a chair thinking about suicide. There is nothing here for me and every day all I think about is how much I just want to sleep. I have talents and opportunities but I know Iâ€™m going to be a failure and waste it all. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m still here. Nothing feels as good as it was anymore and itâ€™s just getting worse and I donâ€™t know how much more I can take.
