stop pretending to be helpfulNo insep do in  and then they went for the throats they went in and got them out so cose ain h h e  then w  well if he ever knew of it then he wouldnâ€™t have done it but he knew it so she he knew it and he did it so itâ€™s his fault de n n  day classes we went to at 10 in the morning the cattle drover wontâ€™t go see him today and i donâ€™mt thinj i will be able to finish this homework when they wonâ€™t come out like this they wonâ€™t come out like this thatâ€™s why i keep getting in trouble and failing and trying and losing and giving up. i bet my friends are so tired of me i keep giving up im so tired of trying because all they do is make it harder for me. no one has helped me i have gone through my whole life with the mental health system failing me every chance they got my mother told them i was lying then everyone thought i was lying well when you have a dead child on your hands mom i bet you wont think i was lying. nothing helps no one wants to im in pain my head hurts my emotions hurt my feelings hurt. feelings are pain they translate to pain for me and i dont know why i dont mean mental pain these hurt differently they hurt physically its not the same. i bet my friends are so tired of me because i just keep giving up things always happen to me and i talk to them and i feel bad because professionals wont help me so what am i supposed to do i dont tell my friends too much detail i tell them im sad im depressed i want to die and i feel like a burden for never being good enough to hold myself up on my own. reach out everyone says and i do and i do and i do and i do but i get turned down. i fall through the cracks. and no one wants to believe how serious or urgent the situation is because â€œpeopleâ€ can get help so they cant believe one person cant. i hope all the college faculty that pushed me to this point get fired when they find me dead because they ignored me and they said i was having a temper tantrum and i cant stop screaming. everyone gave up on me and everyone has given up on me and i have no evidence to expect this will change.
