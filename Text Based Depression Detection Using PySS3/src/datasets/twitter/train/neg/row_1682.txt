i dont want to kill myself but it seems like the only solutiononly bad things ever happen to me regardless of what i do. i try to change something sith the help of my therapist and it backfires every time. i truly mean it when i say i feel like im cursed. nothing ever goes right or even OK.                   
                          
i suffered trough years of csa, verbal abuse, physical abuse and im so fucked up from all of it im legally disabled. im always one foot to homelessness, im reliant on the gov to keep me alive because i can barely sit trough a movie let alone hours of work. theres so many things wrong with me it would be endlessly long to list them all here but just one of them is often enough for people to kill themselves.                   
                  
i feel like every day i dont do the only kind thing of killing myself im signing a contract that states bad things will happen to me. im scared of the now and the future and theres nothing fond to look back on. its not fair, i wish my life was worth living. i wish i had a love to come home to who would give me stability and help me. friends to cook for on occasions, weddings to go to. but instead every day im alive im prolonging my own torture.
