Just blew $600 on gamblingAnd I lost... hahaha it was predictable. I was having a really bad time and I felt super stressed because of the ever-decreasing value of the currency of the country I live in and everything becoming super expensive. I still can't graduate from college and get a proper job because I am severely depressed and suffering from social anxiety. Every day of my life is painful even though I am trying my best to change it for the better. I have a part-time job but it pays like shit and I wanna move abroad some day.

That $600 was all the savings I head. Which means I'm now literally living on a shoestring and there's no safety net. I had a similar gambling spree a few years ago but the losses were smaller and I could recover somewhat quickly thanks to the game jam I won. I hate my life and my job and myself and my country and everything.

I still see a psychologist and a psychiatrist and there are obvious improvements in my life but honestly it's never enough for a comfortable life. I'll always suffer till the day I die so I might as well make it quick.
