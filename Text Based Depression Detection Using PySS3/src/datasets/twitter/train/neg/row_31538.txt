Iâ€™m not your emotional punching bagFuck the people who have verbally and emotionally abused and bullied me, whether in real life or online. Whether in elementary school, high school, church, or college.
Fuck you assholes :)
I wish you bastards misfortune and pain and suffering. 
Iâ€™m not going to waste my time thinking about this pain and hurt youâ€™ve given me and Iâ€™m going to look into ways to treat my PTSD more effectively. My life and existence is way more important than them rotten bastards. Theyâ€™re the scum of the earth. I donâ€™t deserve to be in this much pain, they do.
