please God just let me dieI am afraid of suicide, but I can't bear to live. I had a decent life just last year, but due to mental illness, job loss and poverty I am losing my home and my pets. There is no path out of my current predicament and I don't have it in me to see my fate unfold. I want my old life back but I know that is impossible. I can't rebuild, I am ruined. I don't want the kind of life that is available to me now. I am going to have to get up the nerve to kill myself soon, but I am so scared.
