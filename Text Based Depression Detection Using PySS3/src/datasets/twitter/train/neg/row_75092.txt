I've come to accept the idea of me killing myself.I've always been a bit scared of the act and had a number of excuses to not go through with it. But i think I've finally reached my breaking point. The depressing and overwhelming thoughts are so intense, I can't go a day without contemplating how much better things would be if I could stop existing. It's gotten to the point where I'll be sitting there as my best friend is talking to me and all I can think about it that I would be able to go through with shooting myself. It all seems so simple. I can easily buy a gun. Whatever I have to do, I need to do it now. I can't live this way for one second longer. My desperation for relief can be resolved. The pain it will put on others makes me feel guilty, but I don't care anymore. I can't go through this cycle forever. It's only a matter of time now and I don't feel like waiting.
