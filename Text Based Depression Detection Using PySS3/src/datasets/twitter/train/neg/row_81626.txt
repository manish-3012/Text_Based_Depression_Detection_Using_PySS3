I don't want to die, but I'm preventing myself from living.I went swimming today, in hope that maybe, just maybe, this would be the time I would break through. Obviously I didn't. My lack of coordination and my poor fitness are never wished away.

This is basically the last thing I need before I can apply for a dream job with a straight face. But I am always quitting for months at a time because I suck so much. 

The only thing keeping me alive is being destroyed by none other than the massive fuckup that is me.
