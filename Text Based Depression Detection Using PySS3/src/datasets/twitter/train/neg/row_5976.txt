How do I help my severely depressed girlfriend? I'm running out of energy...I try so hard for her everyday. Giving her good advice and trying to motivate her to get better but she just shuts me out and seems to get worse. It's exhausting and it's taking a toll on me. She has counseling this Friday and her family knows about the depression she's going through. She's also on antidepressants. What else could I possibly do? I feel like I've done everything to help her?
