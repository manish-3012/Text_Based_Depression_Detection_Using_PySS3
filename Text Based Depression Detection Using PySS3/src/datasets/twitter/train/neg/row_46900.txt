I don't want to die, I just want to check out for a whileWhile I've been obsessing over methods and their success rates and looked into it, I always come around to my senses and decide I don't want to die. I do however want to stop my life for like 3 months. This is my first summer out of college and I miss my friends. I have nobody home and my family is too busy for me. I'm sorry if this breaks the rules because I'm not on the verge of ending everything, but I'm wondering if anyone else shares the sentiment of wanting to check out for a while. My ideal summer would be spent in a coma.
