This is really it.I posted yesterday, something quick to outline my story. I just can't do this anymore. I just want to post a few last words.

I'm so sorry to my friends and family. I'm so sorry to everyone who reads this.

I wish I wasn't like this, I wish I could go out stoically and silently and not bother anyone with this. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 

Thank you everyone who tried to help.
