I'm tired of fighting.For the last few years I have been in a job that has deeply affected me. I spent many years in school and in training to do what I do. Along the way I encountered many setbacks but overcame them by persisting and pushing myself to do better. 

I took a job far away from home that made me separate from my wife for a long time. Longer than we expected. This nearly destroyed my marriage. At the same time, the people at this job are incredibly sleazy and are always lying and stabbing me in the back. It has made it so I can't really make myself work hard anymore. 

I resolved to give up. Try getting a new job, doing something else. This hurts, because I didn't do anything wrong. I worked hard. I got attention in the right ways, but ultimately I go fucked. 

Now all I can think about are those liars- those thieving, unscrupulous bastards.

 I can't focus on what I need to do. Just how much I hate them. How much I hate myself for failing. How half of my life has been wasted on this and I don't want to start over. I just want it to end.
