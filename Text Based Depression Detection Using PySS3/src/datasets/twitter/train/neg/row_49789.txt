Wanting it to endI've frequently thought about suicide and the most "ideal" way to do it, but idk if I could ever actually bring myself to do it. Nothing really seems feasible. Lately I've been hoping I get some terminal disease like cancer or something that I can let run its course and get rid of me. Unfortunately I'm only 28 so there's not much chance of that happening anytime soon.
