Iâ€™m doneI know this is a shitty thing to post, but I donâ€™t really fucking care.

To start, I cannot sleep for a multitude of reasons and I havenâ€™t been able sleep easily for as long as I can remember being alive. Most of it honestly stems from a lack of ideal sleeping conditions, but I canâ€™t seem to fix these conditions despite my best efforts. If you do not have severe sleep issues, I understand itâ€™s hard to fathom the dramatic consequences of this. Do you know what it feels like to be severely, clinically sleep deprived for years and years? Probably not. Iâ€™m happy for you. Iâ€™m fairly certain my depression and all my other mental illnesses are aggravated by my lack of ability to sleep, but nothing Iâ€™ve tried ( Iâ€™ve tried literally everything) has fixed me. 

So. My sleep has been even worse recently and I want to kill myself; Iâ€™m really done with everything. The problem is that recently Iâ€™m literally too exhausted to even figure out the proper way to do it so I wonâ€™t fuck up. Iâ€™ve planned this a million times before, but never put it into action. I want to take care of everything before I go so it wonâ€™t be a huge bitch for everyone else, but I donâ€™t have the energy. I need advice on how to get the energy to be able to take care of things before I end it. Iâ€™m not even mentally capable enough to feel confident Iâ€™ll be able to think of everything I need to take care of. Also - and let me make this very clear - even if it were still possible to fix my sleep and cure my mental illnesses, I still want to kill myself now. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™ve struggled enough at this point in life in general that even if the remainder of my life is mental ecstasy, it wouldnâ€™t even make up for the rest. I just need help on how to do this right. I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m asking because most of you all arenâ€™t going to give me suicide advice even though thatâ€™s what I really need. I need someone to help me for once with this. I know if youâ€™re not someone who suffers from severe depression, anxiety, shame, and/or someone who has slept more than 1 hour in three days you will likely think Iâ€™m being dramatic and â€œit will get better!â€ Ok. I donâ€™t give two fucks if it gets better, I need out. Iâ€™d like to have it all taken care of before the end of October and I will take any suggestions or advice.
