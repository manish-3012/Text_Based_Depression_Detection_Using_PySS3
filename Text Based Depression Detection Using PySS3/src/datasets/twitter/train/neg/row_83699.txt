and all because of some stupid politics...this seems like the best place to post this. i'm probably overreacting here, but i feel like the only way i can escape all this political stuff in the USA is by suicide. Donald Trump, ISIS, Ajit Pai... politics are everywhere. last time i checked, even overseas people know about them. if i'm dead, i won't be able to hear about this stuff anymore. but what do i know? i'm just some random middle school student.
