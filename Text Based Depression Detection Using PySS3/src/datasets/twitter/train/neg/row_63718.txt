I'm not sure about this life anymore.I know you don't get a second chance. I'm a Christian, and they say as long as you believe, you go to heaven. _x000D_
Well, I'm ready to go._x000D_
I've had suicidal thoughts since the fourth grade. I'm now a junior in high school. They were really bad during junior high, i always cut myself. I haven't cut in over a year._x000D_
But lately I've hate my life. I feel like i do everything wrong. I feel like everything is my fault. _x000D_
I know better than to really end my life, but i feel like that is starting to be my only option. _x000D_
I can see myself killing myself, or commiting homicides then a suicide, bit i can't imagine what my family will think when i'm gone. _x000D_
Only my mother knows out of my whole family that i've been depressed before. _x000D_
I feel like i have nothing in this world to make me right again.
