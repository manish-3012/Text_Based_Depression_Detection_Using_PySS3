I should have done it.It's been almost 3 years since I went to the hospital for planning to kill myself. I thought it was the worst my life could get. I was wrong. I used to think I could be something special. I was one of the smartest kids in the class, I was creative, I had hope. Junior year of high school, I became so depressed I almost tried to kill myself, and I've been trapped ever since. I failed high school, had to get a GED instead. Being smart was supposed to make up for having no social skills, no friends, and no talent. And I couldn't even pass high school.
The next year I went to community college to try again with a fresh start. I did well in my classes, made the first love of my life, and I was never happier. The second semester, I began failing classes, then spiraled back down. I became so anxious that I had to break up with my girlfriend, the kindest, most caring person I've ever known, to avoid the stress of maintaining the relationship. It's my greatest regret. I failed college, went back home, and a few months later got a job at a factory.
Today, I am completely alone, my last friend online ghosted me, I cry myself to sleep most nights, and I feel like I'm already dead. I have no more hope. If I knew what my life would become 3 years ago, I wouldn't have waited one more night to kill myself, let alone 3 years. 
I don't know why I'm telling you guys this...I guess I just want to talk into the void, pretend I have a friend to talk to on a lonely night. I don't think I'm gonna make it through the week. This is how I'm going to die, I've accepted that much. I just have to grow the balls to go through with it. Someday....someday really soon. I'm gonna go to sleep now, probably sleep in for a while, so it'll be some time before I reply, if I ever do. If you made it this far, sorry for wasting your time. Goodnight, friend.
