Iâ€™d rather die than feel cold...So quick background, Iâ€™m 20, diagnosed autism, conduct disorder and ADHD as a toddler, and depression as a child, and ASPD 1.5 years ago (I donâ€™t believe it). My depression is completely out of control, no psychiatrist within 60km will take me on, Iâ€™ve been rejected from every hospital and head space and all that stuff too. Winter is beginning here in Australia and itâ€™s the coldest in a long long time, itâ€™s been snowing for days where I am, that usually only happens in July once or twice. I also just moved house and the heating doesnâ€™t budge the temp in my bedroom because my window doesnâ€™t close all the way and itâ€™s a rental and the landlord wonâ€™t fix it. I had a tiny fan heater that worked really well but it just died because Iâ€™ve been blasting it all day for the last month. I canâ€™t afford another one until I get a job which wonâ€™t be for at least 2 months because Iâ€™m doing a course. My parents are telling me to toughen up and deal with it but thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m getting out of bed tomorrow if itâ€™s this cold and I donâ€™t have a heater to turn on. Iâ€™m going to kill myself if itâ€™s too cold, I donâ€™t care that itâ€™ll be warm in a few months, itâ€™s not worth the wait. I have a thermometer on my alarm clock and it said 23c when the heater turned off, itâ€™s been 10 minutes and itâ€™s saying 12c. When I woke up this morning it was 4c in my room and I could see my breath, when I inhaled it felt like knives, and the left over water from my shower last night had frozen onto the floor and walls of the shower. My parents say that everyoneâ€™s room is like that and Iâ€™m exaggerating about how cold but I have proof from the thermometer and it isnâ€™t as cold ever because they have working central heating going all night. Itâ€™s literally refrigerator temperature in my room at night and Iâ€™m not dealing with it any longer.
