Iâ€™m donePast couple months have been crazy. Started feeling suicidal the beginning of 2016. Shit got really bad this past October tho. I got admitted to the psych ward twice in December. Then i went to this dumbass partial hospitalization program and it didnâ€™t fucking help. I dropped out of high school so Iâ€™ve been fucked since then. My life is fucking useless. Iâ€™m just gonna be stuck at my fast food job doing nothing with my fucking life.
