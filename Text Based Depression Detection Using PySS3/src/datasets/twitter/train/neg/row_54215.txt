I can't continue. I'm so sorry, i won't make it to my 19 birthday.i don't even know where to begin. This is my first post here. I'm using a new account so nobody will know who i am. I think this week is the day, my pain will finally be over. I'm suffering so much. I haven't told anyone. I have no friends. I'm a loner, a failure. I deserve death. I smile, i don't look depressed. But deep down i'm so sad,hurt and tired. So fucking tired. I tried to slit my wrist 2 months ago. I..........i couldn't do it. Don't know why. I just couldn't. I really had to dig to keep going. Maybe it would get better. Well guess what? I't didn't oh what a surprise huh. So i just want to say goodbye to everyone. I love you all i hope all of you find peace and happiness. I won't. This time i won't fuckup and succed in my plan. I'm just scared of the unknown. Not death itself. I will write a letter to my parents. Because this is going to be a huge shock for them. I just can't keep going.
