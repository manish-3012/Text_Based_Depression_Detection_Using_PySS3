There is no hope for people like meI am too far gone. There is nothing I could do that could make me better. Nothing will stick. I'm useless.
At 27 I'm just a degree collector. I am so alone--that's also never going to change. 
I've just finished my first week for a mental health counseling degree....I'm a joke. 
I deserve nothing. 
I wish I could kill myself and make it look like an accident.
