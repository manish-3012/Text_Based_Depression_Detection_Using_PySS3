Too young to die, but itâ€™s all I think about.Iâ€™m 16 F, I left high school during the first month of my freshman year 2 and a half years ago to start online classes, and I havenâ€™t interacted with kids my age until 2 weeks ago when my therapist forced me to go to a therapy group. Even then, I didnâ€™t talk to anyone in the group. I have 2 friends at the moment, my best friend since kindergarten who lives in another state and my LDR boyfriend of 1 and a half years who lives in another country. My relationship with my boyfriend is dying, my grandma died almost a month ago from cancer and I witnessed her passing, my mom is pressuring me to get a job, my dad doesnâ€™t talk to me, I have no real relationship with my half sisters, my entire family thinks Iâ€™m weird for having depression and not dressing like a normal girl. 

Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression and anxiety ever since my dad moved back to Mexico 6 years ago. Iâ€™ve been struggling with going to school, I used to skip a lot because I was too afraid to get on the bus and look for a seat and on many occasions the vice principal would come to my house and ring the doorbell until I came out. Iâ€™m overweight and because of this I donâ€™t dress â€œlike a normal girlâ€ I like to wear menâ€™s graphic t shirts/hoodies because theyâ€™re comfortable and I feel like they hide my body and this has caused quite a few of my family members to assume Iâ€™m going to become a lesbian which is not going to happen. 

Iâ€™m so sick of living a life I never wanted in the first place. Iâ€™ve tried killing myself twice before which only ended up with me being hospitalized, and that didnâ€™t help. Iâ€™ve been struggling with self harm over the past 3-4 years, and I have a strong urge to start again. Iâ€™m so ready to give up and every day I imagine how Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I contribute nothing to society, I barely have friends, I never leave my house, all I do is play video games and sleep. I procrastinate constantly with my online classes. I could have â€œgraduatedâ€ by now if I wasnâ€™t so lazy. Iâ€™m a huge disappointment to my entire family. I live with my mom and her boyfriend and in the 5 years Iâ€™ve lived here with them, Iâ€™ve talked to him maybe 10 times. Iâ€™m always on edge, my anxiety and depression are only getting worse and Iâ€™m sick of everything. There is nothing worth living for anymore.
