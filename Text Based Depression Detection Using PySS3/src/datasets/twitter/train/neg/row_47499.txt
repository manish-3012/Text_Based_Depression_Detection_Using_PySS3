I'm full of shit.I say constantly that I'm working on things. That I think things are going to get better. 

Woohoo, 2020 is the end of the decade! So long 20teen's you've been the problem, you cursed decade you!! 

Or at least thats what I try to say and believe. 

But really, I know thats bullshit. The problem isn't the year. Or the decade. The problem is me. And that's always going to be the case. No matter how hard I try, no matter how much I lie to myself to get through the day, week, year, the only real consistent thing is me. Me, the fuck up. Me, the selfish manipulator. 

I cant hold a job. I leech off of others emotions, their finances...hell maybe their happiness too. 

I don't even have the gall to be subtle about it.

They would all be better off, this I know to be true. Everyday a voice in my head tells me to do it. I've planned so much, I've wasted so much time I might as well go through it already. Its not gonna be pretty, and that idea that once held me back and steadily failing. I don't care if its a pretty death. I don't care about the clean up. I care about not hurting anymore. 

I don't want to hurt anymore.
