I just want to give upI'm a 32 year old man that just wants to give up on this pathetic life of mine. I work 60+ hours a week at a job that is highly stressful. The stress has caused me to completely lose my appetite and I have been dropping weight rapidly. The only good thing about the job was my boss, we were spending so much time together that we became best friends to each other ( her words, not mine). I have never had a girlfriend and really have never even caught feelings for anyone, but she was different. I couldn't say anything about it though cause she was my boss. About a month ago, she got a promotion and now that we weren't working together I decided to tell her how I felt. Needless to say, it went badly like everything else in my life seems to go. Not only does she not have those kind of feelings for me, but I also lost a very good friend by making the situation awkward between us. I feel so alone and just want this life to hurry up and end already. I can not remember a time in the last decade that I have truly been happy. I don't think I could actually commit suicide, but for the first time in my life it seems like an option.
