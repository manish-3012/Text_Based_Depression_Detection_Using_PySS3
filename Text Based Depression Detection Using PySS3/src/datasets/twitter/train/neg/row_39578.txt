I don't want to... Can't get it out of my headI don't want to do it.  I have a few things to live for and I admit that.  I ahve two kids that are playing in the room next to me.  I have two parents that I live with that are doing their own thing in other rooms.  I still can't stop thinking it would be easier to just end it.  I know that is a selfish thought but I just can't stop thinking that it is the best option at this point.  I've been drinking and I know that doesn't help either.  My kids are the biggest reason I don't want to do it but would they be better without me?  Their mother seems to think so.  I have called a suicide hotline before... it was years ago but she basically just made me feel like I was retarded.  I dont' know what to do.  I'm at the end of my rope and I want there to be more but I don't know that ther is.  I'm not sure that this is a "normal" place for a suicidal person to be but here I am.  Not wanting to do it but fuck it, I don't know what else to do anymore.

On a side note.......  CAPTHA is a lot more difficult when you're durnk... 5th attempt at submitting this here
