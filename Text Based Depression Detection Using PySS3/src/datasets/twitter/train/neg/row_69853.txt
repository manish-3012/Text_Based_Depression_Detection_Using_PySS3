It's actually getting.. better :)Ok so, probably you would understand only if u red my last post. In case, this is like a part 2. 

Ok so, when I got out of the bathroom, my companions looked at me. 

it was so embarrassing. 

I noticed that some girls felt guilty, but nobody told me anything. After class, I went home normally.

 The next day, however, I saw that a couple of girls had a "last minute" gift for me! I was so happy. They invited me to go to the park with all of them to open them together at the end of school. 

When we walked out, I found that they are not that bad, they looked nice! At the park we talked a lot, we had fun and even held a photography contest, where I was the judge. I think I found some friends! 


Thanks a lot to all the people who texted me or who supported me in the comments of my posts. I love you guys.



(And thanks to google translate who helped me posting ;w;)
