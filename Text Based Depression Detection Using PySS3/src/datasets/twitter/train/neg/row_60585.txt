for the first time in years ending myself doesn't sound that badhi i'm a freshman in college and i'm about to share a brief history of my depression

i was diagnosed with severe adhd in elementary school and clinical depression + generalized anxiety in high school, along with OCD and mild tourette's somewhere along the way

I coasted into high school because I was just naturally really smart but once I got to high school things started getting really bad. because of the adhd i had practically no motivation for school for a long time and i struggled really hard with it, which caused me a fuckload of grief over the years

that compounded with the fact that ever since starting high school i felt like i had an abominable time feeling like i belonged anywhere. like ive always been kind of awkward in groups but low key i'm pretty fucking funny, but i always struggled feeling like people actively wanted to be my friend instead of just passively not minding my presence. the defining example of this is the fact that for as long as I can remember i've always had to be the one who initiates contact in any friendship i've had (my closest friends in high school were far more antisocial than i was, so our usual method of hanging out was playing games online, which was still super fun, but it left me still wanting physical interaction with other people). I can't help but feel jealous seeing people post shit to instagram all the time or go out with their friends to do whatever the fuck they do when my entire life is pestering people to eat with me and when i can count on one hand the number of times people have asked to take a picture with me (and no one has ever posted a picture of them with me to their instagram. maybe i'm some kind of petty bitch but sentimental shit like that feels really nice but i still feel shitty when i'm always the one asking people to take pics with me for my own accounts).

the adhd/motivation/depression catastrophe was a lot bigger of a problem for me throughout high school, but i'm talking more about the loneliness problem because that's what's fucking me up worse right now. surprisingly i got a lot better with the first bit when starting college; i'm actually taking care of myself a lot better than i did at home, i'm still kind of shit at paying attention but my classes are super easy, and my parents are proud of me and shit.

but being practically friendless and alone is what's fucking me up in college now. i feel like i was trying my hardest to be cool and make friends but it's like everything has evaporated. one girl who i considered my best friend completely cut me off because I made her feel bad by telling her i was worried about how she was drinking (she was coming home blackout drunk every weekend) and it fucked me up for weeks thinking that i meant so little to her that she had no problem ghosting me because she didn't like me worrying about her and making her feel bad about it.

then this next bit is complicated so bear with me

i overheard two people who were supposedly my two closest friends' best friends talking some mad shit about their (and by extension my) friends that I really felt like they needed to hear, so I told them, because what the original two said made me really upset. things were alright for a while, and in this alright period i ended up confessing a whole lot of the awful shit i was feeling to one of my two friends which made me feel really good, then the following day I went out to party with her and others which was actually really fun. then fast forward a few more days and long story short the whole shit-talking situation blew up and suddenly everyone involved just completely hates me and refuses to talk to me even though i felt i was doing the right thing by telling my friends that what i heard made me upset. now really quick i'm gonna rewrite the politics of the situation to better explain who's who (in chrono order)

Girl A, Girl B, and Guy C are my closest friends at the time

Girl D is best friends with Girl B and Guy C, Girl E is best friends with Girl A

One day I overhear Girls D and E talking shit about Girls A and B and Guy C and saying things that best friends really shouldn't say about their best friends imo

I try to ask them why they're feeling that way because it was making me upset, but they refused to talk about it with me although they didn't seem to care that I could hear the rest of their conversation

I feel that my friends Girls A and B and Guy C deserve to hear what their best friends are saying about them, so I tell them

They seem appreciative of me telling them and I said I don't mind them confronting Girls D and E about it even if it means D and E won't like me anymore

things are alright for a good while, during this time Girl B ended up noticing that my depression was getting worse (because it was, for seemingly no reason) and I ended up telling her everything which felt good. then i went to party with Girls A and B and Guy C and I had a great time

A few days later someone confronts someone and Girl A ends up lying to me (I knew I was being setup but I came anyway) to get me to come to some fucking meeting she's setup with Guy C and Girls D &amp; E to get everyone to talk out their problems. It devolves into Girl D yelling at me the entire time and I didn't say much because I didn't want to go off on anyone. I end up finding out that Girl D is straight up denying that she said a lot of the shit that I heard her say and she's trying to call me the bad guy

Afterwards I get upset with Girl A for feeling the need to lie to me, then I go to Girl B thinking she can make me feel better like the last time I told her about my depression but I ended up blaming a lot of what I was feeling on her and we argued a little bit

SO SINCE THEN: Girl A hasn't talked to me since the fucking meeting she tried to set up. I tried to reach out to her today and she never responded to me. I've apologized to Girl B for blaming stuff on her on two separate occasions, and she tells me not to worry about it and she appreciates the apology but it's clear as shit everything is not the same between us and it's killing me. sorry for spending like two thousand characters on fucking petty drama but I just can't help but feel like this is representative of how miserable i've always been and how it's validating every part of me that i hate. I feel like I trusted these people involved the most and i felt like i was doing the right thing for them and then i ended up getting cut off from them and now i cant help but feel like they hardly thought of me as anything more than a nice distraction all along. 

the basic point is that it feels like i'll never be able to have friends in the way i see fucking everyone else on earth does, and starting recently i've just been having this fucking stupid urge to off myself instead of continue this pathetic charade of me trying to convince myself that others are actually genuinely interested in me as a person and are invested in keeping something nice between me and them. i mean the chances of me killing myself are pretty low for the sole fact that i like my sister too much and i still have to play super mario odyssey but for fucking real if i could know that my family wouldn't be upset id be really fucking tempted

i guess what i'm looking for here is finding out how i could possibly be comfortable with existing when the entirety of my connection to other people is me practically begging them to spend time contributing to my delusion that other people like me because otherwise no one would ever consider wasting any time thinking about me

i'm very sorry for this being so scatterbrained. i'm all over the place right now and i really needed to share because i have practically no one to do that with anymore
