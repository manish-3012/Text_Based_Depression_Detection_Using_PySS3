Iâ€™m so tired.I have a good manufacturing job. I work loads of overtime. I have a good car and a roof over my head. I have two children and am 7 months pregnant. I have everything to be happy in this world. But Iâ€™m miserable. 

I am bipolar but cannot take meds because of said pregnancy. 

I donâ€™t want to be pregnant. 
I donâ€™t want to keep existing. 
I want out of this fucking world. 
The only reason I canâ€™t allow myself to finally rest is because I donâ€™t want to fuck my children up anymore. They have my dna so itâ€™s a toss up if theyâ€™ll struggle like I do but I canâ€™t burden them more with offing myself. 

But I want to die. 

I wish I would get t boned and die so at least theyâ€™d get my sizable life insurance. Theyâ€™d be better off without me. 

I need to hold on. But my fingers are slipping and holding on hurts. 


I feel so alone. People everywhere and itâ€™s like Iâ€™m a ghost walking through this world. 

Can it please stop.
