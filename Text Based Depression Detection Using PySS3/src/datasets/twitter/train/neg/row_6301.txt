All you can offer is pity and arrogance what a worthless species you areNo one is willing to help me. No one treats me nicely. I cant get over my bad childhood because adulthood is just as bad. I hate getting less. I hate working on anything at this point. I hate living with other people. I'll always be poor. I'll always be unintelligent. I cant socialize, people will always take advantage of me. I'm hopeless, I have no money, no true support, I want to die.
