Worth more dead than aliveI've only heard how much of a burden I am to people and how negative of a presence I am in people's lives. I know in a strictly financial sense, me dying would mean no one has to pay my car insurance, health insurance or my school loans. If I provide no more value to my family and friends, I'm quite literally worth more dead than alive. I wish that was something that I can think about to overcome my animalistic instincts to kill myself. 

Also, please don't say how this relates to "It's a Wonderful Life." This isn't like that.
