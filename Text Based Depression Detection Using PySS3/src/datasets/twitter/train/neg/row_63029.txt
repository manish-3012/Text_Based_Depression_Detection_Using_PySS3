Need tipsI diet, I exercise, I study, I work, I meditate, I do yoga, I try to socialize even if I loathe doing so because of having to put on a facade. The opposite sex finds me favorable a lot. I had to cut off a potential love interest solely due to my feelings of worthlessness. I test of out many college level classes at age 20. Yet I still find myself as a failure, a fuck up, no good. It's becoming harder and harder to resist the sirens call of death. I don't know what to do but sit for hours contemplating my downfall. Therapy does not work, nor does medication, I've tried, for a long time. I've got a shotty with a slug, so ive got quick guaranteed means. Won't do it tonight, might not tomorrow, or the day after, but I'd estimate within the next few months. I've tried various outlets, games, mma, art, etc. I don't self harm, anymore at least, shit I don't even do any drugs, and rarely drink. What's next?
