Really be cautious of the content you view and donâ€™t repeat my mistakes.I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing here. Maybe to warn others, maybe to subconsciously seek help, i really donâ€™t know. I just finished watching a tv show. Sounds stupid, i know, but that show...It really brought back a lot of buried emotions. It made the memories of my brothers suicide surface, the memories of all my failed relationships, family life problems, addictions and most of all - the failure of becoming a man. 19 years old and i have only a 9 grade education, iâ€™ve been an alcoholic, drug addict and a controlling, abusive boyfriend. Iâ€™ve basically become my father. The one man i always swore to never be like. I even failed at that. The thoughts of that, just make me want to get some fentanyl right now, OD and die in pleasure. Would i be able to do it sober? No. Am i completely sober now? Fuck no. Do i want to hurt the people around me, by passing on the pain? Hell no. But the loneliness, the guilt and shame iâ€™m feeling are taking over. As i said, i donâ€™t really know what i want to accomplish with this post. But i really do hope nobody repeats the mistakes iâ€™ve already made at my young age. Thatâ€™s all.
