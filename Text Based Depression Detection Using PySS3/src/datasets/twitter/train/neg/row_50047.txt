I know the "secret" to true happiness and contentment that that so many desperately seek to attain. I just don't really feel like reaching out and grasping it.This "secret" to true happiness and contentment that that so many desperately seek to attain. It is not something that takes schooling, knowledge, wisdom, intelligence, money or other forms of "success" it merely takes a very limited level of knowledge that even a child could acquire. The reason it cant be so simply taught is it requires a level of trust and acceptance of what is so clearly true but for many it's hard to believe. Despite being able to obtain what people work there entire lives for and what people would kill for I have no desire to apply what I have come to know. I have a hope and not just hope but full assurance in a promise I am confidant will come true and yet I have lost the desire to just bare with life just a little while longer so as to attain what is so highly valued by many.
