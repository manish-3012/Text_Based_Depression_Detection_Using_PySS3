It feels selfish to be so depressed, selfish to want to end it.I can't even remember how long I've felt bad. 
It seems like I always have. I mean, even as a kid. I remember starting to hurt myself when I was 12, but obviously, like everything, it gradually got worse. 
Continued to get worse. 
When I was in college I think I got a little better. I escaped from my mum's house. Well...I was kicked out by her arsehole boyfriend. 
And I'd moved in with my soulmate (platonic soulmate), and it was better. But it was hardly two years ago, and I can't remember being happy, just being complacent. 
I'm in university now and I have friends, I have people who care about me. It doesn't have to be my Mother, or Father, because there are still people here for me when I need them. 
It feels so selfish of me...
That every day all I consider is how it's almost stupid that I'm living. 
How, if I died I'd be forgotten. 
My Mum would hardly blink, my dad would get over it eventually.
My friends would soon completely forget about me.
Everybody I've ever know would forget.
I'd completely die, in their memories, their love, everything.
