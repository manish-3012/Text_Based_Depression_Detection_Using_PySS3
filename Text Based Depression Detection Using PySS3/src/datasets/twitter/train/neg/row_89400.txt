I feel like ive tried everythingI seem to always get phases of real down times, and I just cant get out anymore, Ive quit nicotine,weed(only used occasionally for anxiety) picked up exercising Ive spoke to people about it but I just cant get better, I feel like im getting worse everyday and everyday Im just hating myself more and more and I dont even want to live if Im just gunna be like this for the rest of my life, even if its on and off... I hate my job, I hate myself and ive lost all contact with friends I just feel alone and just shit. I know I will hurt people but im getting to the point i dont even care because why shoukd i have to live suffering to just stop someone hurting for abit..

The truth is everyone whos been apart of my life has had no benefits just been pulled down by me and my fucked head. I think ive come to the realization Im probably going to kill myself, I just dont see the point
