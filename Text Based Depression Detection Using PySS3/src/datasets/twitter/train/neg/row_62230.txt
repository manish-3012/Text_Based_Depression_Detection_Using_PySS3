I had it but it's getting harderI had those urges for a while. But lately I get up almost every morning finding myself thinking that I want to die. I don't think I really want it but it's always there and is getting stronger and stronger. I have a wonderful girlfriend and really nice friends and a nice job and my appartment and everything. But almost every morning when I wake up I see myself and feel myself wanting to end it all and the same when I go to sleep. It's like another me that wants to hurt me and to kill me. I do everything I can, sports, reading, music, work, friends but I just cannot free myself from that big opression that is getting harder and harder every day. I had it for a long time but lately is just getting worse and worse and I hate myself for letting it get to me. But it's just always there and I don't understand how can I like my life and want to die at the same time. It's getting worse. I don't know how to silence it anymore, I can't ignore it anymore it is getting too strong.
