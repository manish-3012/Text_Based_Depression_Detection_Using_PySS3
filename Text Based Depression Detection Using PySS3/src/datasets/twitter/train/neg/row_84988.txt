I'm scaredI just took ~240 atarax and ~35 Ativan pills and I'm scared. I'm scared it's gonna hurt and I don't have anyone to talk to. I might end up brain dead but I don't wanna live anymore. I called the suicide hotline but I heard them talking about calling the police. I don't want to be found... Alive at least. It's going to hurt isn't it? I might not have even taken enough to end it but I just don't want to see tomorrow.
