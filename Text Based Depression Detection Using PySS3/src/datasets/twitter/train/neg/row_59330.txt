I have ruined my husband's life. I don't know what else to do.Well, the title has already explained it really.

&amp;#x200B;

I am unemployed, possibly unemployable, and I am pregnant with my first child. My husband can't stand me anymore. We have been together for ten years and because I can't keep a job and couldn't motivate myself to study and haven't been stable within that time I have cost my husband his career and any chance at a hopeful future. For this, I don't believe he can ever forgive me. 

The future looks hopeless. I am terrified of tomorrow. I have just sent emails everywhere practically begging someone to employ me so that I can at least contribute a *little* to the family finances. But after sending numerous applications I have received very little in response. 

I'm scared. I'm scared of a future with a husband who hates me. I am scared I've trapped him in a miserable marriage. If I could, I'd make it so that I would work full-time and he could stay at home and look after his kids. I want that because I think the children are better off with him than with me. He is a better person than me.

It has occurred to me that I could get my husband to agree to some life insurance for me. We could insure me for a lot of money because I am female, able-bodied and otherwise healthy. Then if something were to happen to me maybe my husband could have a fresh start doing something else. He will never forgive me if I kill myself, but he's never going to forgive me for anything else I've done either. The only problem is that I'm pregnant. I don't think my baby deserves to die. 

I really need help.
