Im running out of energyWaking up every day hoping to make small changes is just a drag. I try and succeed every day but in the end I do a full 180 and im back to my old self if not worse off every time.

Today, I had a depressive relapse and told HR im quiting and leaving at the end of the day. 

I had a no childhood. (Raped, sexual trauma, living with strangers, DV, you name )

I had a few failed attempts and dont know what else to do. Life wants me around but Im ready to go.

God please accept me and send me to hell for ending my life
