Tried again. Failed again.I gave up on dating for so many years. So much rejection with no benefit. Lost count of how many times it makes me physically sick.

Met someone. She was so into me. Thought we would work out. Gave myself the opportunity to hope again. I was cautious. Played it safe. Thought that the nightmare might finally be over.

Rejected again. Typical. Not sure why I thought anything would be different. Just another for my pile of failures.

Just crawl back to my hole.was wrong to leave. I'm not wanted.
