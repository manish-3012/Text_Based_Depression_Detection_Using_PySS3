I've ruined my lifeI've smoked an insane amount of cigs and joints so I'll almost certainly die a horrible death because of lung cancer. I smoked a pack of cigarettes per day and at least 5 spliffs per day for 9 years. Whenever I think about the future, I know I'll die because of cancer and leave my future family behind. With every good habit I've adopted since quitting smoking, I feel an insane regret because I should have never smoked so much and just done that instead. My life is currently just waiting on the inevitable diagnosis of cancer. I hate myself, don't deserve any love and should just end it because by allowing people to love me, they'll just have to suffer because I was an idiot who wanted to smoke.
