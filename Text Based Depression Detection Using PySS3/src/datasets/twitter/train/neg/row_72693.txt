It is so hard to deal with disappointment in my lifeI dont even know what to say. I ve had it with me life. I cant sleep, I cant concentrate. All I want to do is SOMETHING. 

I keep trying to improve my life but I keep falling back into depression. I am getting my Masters, I moved out.. I try to keep in shape. nothing changes...

I am so sick of being alone all of the time... 
I dont want to die but I dont want to live. I just want to turn off and wake up as someone else.

I miss having a therapist... I really do. I estrange everyone in my life and I have no one to talk to.
