So i think this is the end for meHi I am Samantha from WA,

I wrote my first suicide note earlier today. I just don't see a way out. I feel like everything I do I just fail at. My family, I think, feels bad that they had me. I am this little queer trans girl, and they are a bunch of waspy fucks from the conservative ass middle east. I wish I had a more close and loving family. I just don't want to live anymore  


Edit:

I have not decided on like plans to commit just yet, but I know I am only one stage before that really
