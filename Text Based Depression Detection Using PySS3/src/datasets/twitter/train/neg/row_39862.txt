I really want to be done.I've been depressed since i was 11 and suicidal since I was 12. I'm 15 now and My dad has always been an alcoholic and always screams at me and my sister. All I want to do is smoke pot or lie in bed all day and eat. I feel like i all my "friends" just talk shit abut me behind my back. I've known I was gay for a while now and can never fit in with my friends or anyone at school. I have the most acned up face in the school  and have tried every damn way to try to clear it. I have type1 diabetes and can't take care of it and i know i'm just going to end up fucked over by it. My entire family hates me because I smoke pot and i really don't care about any of them.I just don't want to deal with the entire school making fun of me and losing all my friends because I'm gay. 2 of my friends already have found evidence of it and are already avoiding me . So I've decided that this weekend I'm going to smoke a 40 by myself and then hang myself.
