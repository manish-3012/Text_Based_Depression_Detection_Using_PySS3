Feel like I'll never get back on my feet22, no job, and currently living in my car 300 miles from anyone who knows who I am. If it wasn't for plasma donation, I'd be royally fucked.  
  
I'm going to run out of money soon and I don't know what I'm going to do when that happens.  
  
I've applied at every place I can possibly think of and yet not received a single call back. Even places you'd think would hire the most desperate of people.  
  
I'm a disgrace and a failure. I thought i could run away and start my life over, but I was wrong.
