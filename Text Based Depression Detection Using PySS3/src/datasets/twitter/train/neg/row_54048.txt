My best friend just gave up on meHe was all I felt I had left. I woke him up to talk to him we talked for half an hour then he hung up. He keeps keaving ke on read so I'm just done. I don't have a reason to want to keep going on at this point, I'm so alone no one cares anymore. I'm in my car now in the middle of the woods. I have all my meds and a bottle of bacardi 151 I stole from my parents. I left a note in the kitchen and forwarded all my savings to my near ex girlfriend. I hope it doesn't hurt.
