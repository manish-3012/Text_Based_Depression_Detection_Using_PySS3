Feeling like people are ableist. There's nothing wrong with me. I'm on the autism spectrum.I feel like people think there's something wrong with me because I'm on the autism spectrum. I feel like I'm surrounded by ableist people. This has bothered me for years and I'm trying to express how I feel. There's nothing wrong with me. I'm very angry with people. I also always believed in the concept of neurodiversity and that I just think differently. I'm very angry and suicidal over this. I feel like society is against me too.
