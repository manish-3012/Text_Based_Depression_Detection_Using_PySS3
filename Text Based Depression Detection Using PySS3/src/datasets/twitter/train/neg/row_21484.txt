I screwed upMy sister wanted me to do one of her college course's work and paid me $70 to do it. I've gotten her to 10 out of 95 points so far and when I did start trying to do the work it is so overwhelming. I only sleep about six hours a night cause that's the only time I can leave to get to work, I donate plasma cause I don't make enough money. I just feel so overwhelmed.. I don't know what to do.
