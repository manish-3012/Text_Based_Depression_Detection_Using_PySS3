I have nothing to live for but suicide is scary, difficult and painfulI've been in the hospital many times for drug overdoses, with one particular attempt fucking up the nerves in my legs for 2 days. I've stood at the top of tall buildings unable to jump. The next attempt will definitely be hanging. 

I honestly have nothing to live for. 21F

I live with my narc dad and I hate him. Life here is unbearable for many reasons. 

Was bullied throughout growing up which led me to be mentally ill. (Social Anxiety, Body Dysmorphia, Depression and Borderline Personality Disorder) 

As such I'm too mentally ill to get a job to try and save up and move out because no one will be willing to hire a train wreck like me plus I have 0 experience. 

Too mentally ill to go to uni and study and even if I did I'd still end up at this hellish place every summer.

I have no friends and no relationship experience thanks to my mental illnesses and spend 100% of my time alone. Even when I had friends they saw me as a burden and never wanted to go out anywhere with me. 

Because of my age and the fact I'm not in education the chance of me realistically making friends are slim to none so I get to enjoy a life filled with loneliness.

I hate my body and my face (want/need surgery that I can't afford for above reasons) and think I'm too ugly to be seen in strong lighting so I never go out during the day. I only go out late into the night. Can't remember the last time I went outside when the sun was shining. Pretty sure I have a severe vitamin D deficiency. 

No matter what time I go to bed I always fall asleep at 5am due to stress and anxiety. When I manage to get up I realise that I have no reason to get out of bed so I'll just stay there all day despite having 5 alarms to keep me from sleeping. 

I'm burnt out, fed up and tired and most importantly **I don't want to try anymore**, so I'm just waiting for something to push me over the edge at this point.
