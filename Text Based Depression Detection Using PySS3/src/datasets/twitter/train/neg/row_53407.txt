i can feel it - i'm going to kill myself soonmy mother hates me. i'm terrified to live in my own house. i can't sleep. i flinch whenever someone raises their voice near me. my crush doesn't love me back. i'm stupid, worthless, disgusting, hideous, fat, unworthy, untalented, etc. there is nothing good about me. i've struggled with these thoughts for years, ever since i was 9, but nobody cares because i'm just an edgy teenager obviously. i can't think anything negative without shaming myself for being edgy. i can't get help. i'm not worthy of help. life is stupid and i don't want it anymore if all that it is is this. i get hurt over and over, i haven't had a friend for longer than 6 months, what the fuck is wrong with me? i deserve to die, i'm nothing but a empty hollow shell of a person. i'm testing the waters by cutting myself, hopefully i will be able to die in a bath of my own blood soon.
