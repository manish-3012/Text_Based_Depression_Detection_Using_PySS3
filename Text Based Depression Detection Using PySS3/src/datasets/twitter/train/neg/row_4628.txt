I'm just getting through every day. Suicide seems pretty appealing when compared to going through this 16984 more times.That's my life expectancy. I'm 27, have basically no relationships outside of my family. My family loves me very much, but it's not enough for me. I feel guilty and greedy, because I read people's posts here about how they lost the love of their life, got abused and traumatized, have no money, etc. Meanwhile my only real problem is that I'm so scared of social interaction. Last week, I talked to girl I found very attractive, she gave me her number, and we texted for a day, after which she stopped responding. That "rejection" has crushed me. People tell me I'm young and I have the whole future ahead of me. I don't feel young. My friends who are a few years younger than me have meaningful romantic relationships. I can't get a girl to talk to me for 48 hours. I'm not in immediate danger of killing myself, but I think about it every day. I think about shooting myself in the back of my throat so that it will hopefully destroy my (brain stem?). I think about how my hand could jerk and maybe just turn me into a living shell, brain dead and tormenting my family even worse than if I were successful in killing myself outright. I think about how to avoid that by building a guillotine and severing my head off of my body entirely. It would be more likely to kill me. I don't think about my future or what I want to do this weekend. I think about this. I'm still far away from acting on it, but I've been drifting in that direction for a long, long time. I need to change course or that may very well be where I end up.
