Praise Gooooood Halleluja, i'm still depressed (venting post)If you're wondering what is the title all bout, it's from District by Brockhampton. Perfectly describing my feelings at the moment. Why am i so "depressed" u ask? Basically i'm being forced to stay around toxic people, mainly by my parents. Maybe they like those people, but me, i despise most of 'em. I don'tt wanna go into details, but the toxic people (mainly their kids) won't shut the fuck up ever. And then we go home, blaming me for not enjoying the occasion. I hate my parents SO FUCKING MUCH. I just feel weakened. Quarantine has been a bitch i guess. Not to mention there is still more problems that i've already posted here, ask about them in the comments if you want to. BAck to topic, shit has gone WORSSSEEEE. Im almost 24/7 on something. I take 1-2 0,25mg xans in me just to get a little calmer or something. Doesn't help that much, but i feel it's there. i just, want a way out of the pain. Death maybe aint a solution they say, but same time what is? Maybe my problems written  here are described differently from what is reality, but pÃºaefmÃºp,dpsfspfmopm, FUCK IT JUST HELP ME
