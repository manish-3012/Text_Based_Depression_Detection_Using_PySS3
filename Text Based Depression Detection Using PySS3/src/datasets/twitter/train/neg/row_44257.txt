Next week Im going to kill myselfI've thought about killing myself since March, and since things are just gonna keep getting worse and worse. I have decided that suicide is the only way to solve my problems. My social life is pernamently ruined from covid. My personality has gotten extremely dark and I've probably turned off people from being a dark and unhappy person. For me the only thing that makes me happy is going out and socialising with others. And because of how bad the usa screwed up on covid I'm never going to be able to go out and party again. People have told me not to kill myself because I would upset other people, but I've gotten to the point where I don't care if my decision to kill myself hurts other people or not. And because there's no benefit to me saying alive, suicide is the best solution for me.
