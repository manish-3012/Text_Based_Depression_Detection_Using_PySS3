lost everything in 1 yearLost old apartment, left toxic 3 year relationship ( she was basically a junkie and i was the one working and helping her).

Moved alone to another country for a job ( I have a education in IT ) and quit after 1 year, tattooed my hands like a idiot there.

Probably my biggest regret besides wasting my life on useless women.

Now I'm doing laser removal, on 3rd treatment in April need 5 more and 1 year till its gone. 

Zero job now besides my own game development, only thing giving me real hope.

Staying at my parents now, they're great and supportive, same with my family.

I'm looking for any type of work and looks like i can get a apartment soon.

Things could be worse, but that doesn't help me. 

I guess i just hate myself for all my bad decisions in the past, and hate to think about where i could have been now.

I'm 27 and losing my will to live. I don't wanna die, but i can't stand to live anymore.
