im tiredi got beat an hour ago and then yelled at and this happens at least once a week and im not sure if its my fault or not anymore. im so tired though and ik theyd be happier without me and im just exhausted. im sorry for rambling but i cant think rn bc im just exhausted w trying to be the person they want and never being that. idk if this is abuse or not bc ive gotten so used to it but im at the point where im just irritated w it and i want to end this cycle
