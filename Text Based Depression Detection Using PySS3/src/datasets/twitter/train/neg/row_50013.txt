20 year old virgin loserSo pretty much as the title would suggest I am 20 years old and am a complete loser. The only time I ever thought a girl liked me turned out was just a giant prank on me and the only message I ever got back on online dating fourms was "You look like a serial killer". I've tried to improve myself via lifting and better fashion but in all honesty it's like putting make up on a pig.

I work with many attractive young women too, they all have equally attractive boyfriends which is not surprising but I feel like shit compared to them. 

I don't really know how to even word this all properly to show my emotions but I'm so sick and tired of being a loser and doing everything in my powers not to be one. I see the path of the ones who made fun of me involved them getting into prestigious colleges where they'll be set for life with family connections. 

There really is a hierarchy of people, some are worth more than others and I'm worth nothing
