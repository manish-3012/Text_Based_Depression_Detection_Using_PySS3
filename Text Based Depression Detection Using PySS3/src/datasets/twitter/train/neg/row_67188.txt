Done with it allMy wife just told me this Friday she wants a divorce. We have been married 2 yrs together for 7. Her and the kids are the only thing I have. I have no other family. Since she broke the news to me I have been a wreck. She wants me out the house, but I have no where to go. I just want to end it already, been contemplating it the last 2 days, but I still love my wife so much I don't want to put that on her or tr kids, but I'm to the point where I don't know what to do anymore....
