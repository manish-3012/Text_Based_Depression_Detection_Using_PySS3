Iâ€™m tired. I donâ€™t have a say in this life.Iâ€™m in love with my boyfriend of 5 years. My family vehemently opposes us. He doesnâ€™t live in my country. I bought a non-refundable ticket recently to visit him. Thinking about letting my parents know makes me want to die. I have a dysfunctional family. Itâ€™s creating so much anxiety in me.I want to just close my eyes and never wake up.
