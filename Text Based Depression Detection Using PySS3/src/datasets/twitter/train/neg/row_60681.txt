idk what to do anymoreHi there. I have Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depression, ADHD, and anxiety (generalized and social).

My boyfriend is the only person who seems to understand me or even care about me, but I'm scared that he'll stop liking me eventually. Everyone seems to. 

I'm annoying, lazy, fat, and just all around horrible. I try to be nice to people but I guess I don't do a very good job. It probably doesn't help that I'm also the most awkward person I know.

You want to know what started my downward spiral tonight? Someone in a game I'm playing telling me I was doing bad. I know I should just ignore it, but because of my BPD, I can not take criticism well at all. I've been trying to not cry over it, even 3 hours later. 

I just. Wish I were better. I wish I had any talent. I wish people liked me and didn't abandon me when they see how mentally ill I am. 

I'm sorry this post is all over the place. I feel all over the place. I keep having really gruesome thoughts about things to do to myself and they won't stop and they're tempting.

Idk.
