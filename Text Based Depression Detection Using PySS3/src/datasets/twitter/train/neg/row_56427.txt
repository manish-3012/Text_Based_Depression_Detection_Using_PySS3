A Violent MotherHi! I am a girl and Iâ€™m 18 years old. Today my mother slapped me for a silly reason. Not just today this happens many times in every week. She usually slap me or punch me on my back for small reasons. Just because I want her to be with my dad, she hates me. If she is blaming me for something that I have no idea what she is talking about and if I say something to defend myself, then she starts to scream on me and slaps me. There is no one to help me. I just canâ€™t say anything. I have to shut my mouth every time. I canâ€™t share my situation with police or other people because I donâ€™t want her to go to jail but I feel so stressed. I donâ€™t know where to go. Maybe Suicide?
