If there was a way to make my death look like an accident then I would've done it already.I want to die simply that but I want it to look like an accident so my family doesn't have to know that I was suicidal. Every day I wake up and go to school with a smile on my face but in the end I'm thinking (why didn't I just go walk in traffic). I refuse to tell anyone about my suicidal thoughts and mannerisms. Instead I just keep smiling on the outside but crying on the inside. I hate my life I've always did. I hate life,I hate people, and I hate being alive. I've always wondered if I died would people care? And they won't. I'm just a pebble on the large dirt mound known as earth and I'm sick Of trying to be a happy person it doesn't work because in the end I still want to die leaving my attempts nothing but meaningless grains of sand in a barren wasteland. I hate my fucking life and I want it to end.
