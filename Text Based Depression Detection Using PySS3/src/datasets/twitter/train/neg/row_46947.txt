I'm so tired... So Fucking tired.I'm not posting on a throwaway because I don't even care anymore. I'm tired, so tired of being alive. I have a bone disorder that I was born with and it causes me huge amounts of pain, probably gives me some other things since its a mutation in my genetic code. Work has been hell and makes me not wanna go because all I am is invalidated, told I'm too young or to suck it the fuck up, (I work in a pharmacy, am 20 years old, and disabled - but I walk and look fine.) I left on Friday in tears and I called out today or rather yesterday because I didn't want to deal with it. 

My mom who is like my rock is on the other side of the country and taking care of my grandfather. The only thing holding me here is that is devastate my boyfriend of 4 years, and I have trouble thinking about that since he's already lost so many people, I couldn't crush him like that.

I'm lonely though, I stay home all the time because I don't drive and live in the suburbs and can't walk, I'm poor, my best friend broke up with me basically and while we've forgiven each other its not the same. I'm tired of being alive, I'm tired of the pain, and I think about this every night when I'm alone.
