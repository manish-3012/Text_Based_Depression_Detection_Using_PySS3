Killing myself tonightHi, I've been depressed for many years now and I'm thinking about trying tonight. Long story short I've always been a lonely kid, bullied from kindergarten to the end of highschool. I have very low self esteem now. Last week for the first time I had an awesome time with a wonderful girl, we ran in the grass at night, layed down side by side, hugged and she passed her hand in my hair multiple times. We talked for 8 hours about everything, from basic life to my suicidal tendencies and she showed a lot of support. We saw each other again and I fell in love. We have a lot in common and she just won't leave my thoughts. But tonight she told me I won't become anything more than a friend and that she was sorry for giving wrong thoughts to me (broken english I know but I'm too drunk to try at this point). I consider this a killing blow. 

It's not the first time I get this close to a girl I like mind you, but it Always ends up like this and I think I've had enough. My studies are not going anywhere anyway and most of the people I Care about seem to vanish at some point. This girl, we had so much in common, I rarely talk a lot as I'm shy but there I managed 8 hours without breaking a sweat and I did it again the day after. This is extremely unlikely for me. I just can't take it and I know my story is as basic as it gets, but I guess you can't just choose to be happy
