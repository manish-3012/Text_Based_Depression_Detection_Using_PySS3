Just like to shareWell I was in the middle of posting a block of text and then I accidentally pushed close all apps on my phone and lost it all, so I'll make this quick. 
I was having a sobbing fit thinking about my life and unhappiness and how I dont want to be here and i texted my boyfriend, who is away from me right now. After talking to him a little about what I was thinking, I said i was sorry for being a downer and bringing him down with me all the time. I got a response that made me start bawling again, but this time, out of shock that someone could care so much.

"I dont want to hear that. I dont want to hear that 'sorry i'm such a downer and I dont want to bring you down with me' and then you're just gone the next day"

All he's doing is trying to help me and sometimes I forget that he thinks he could lose me and it devastates him. For now, I can rest a little easier. Hopefully anyway, it is almost 4am here. I'm hoping that with his help, I can eventually find the happiness we all so crave.

I hope you're all doing alright, and I wish you a good night.
