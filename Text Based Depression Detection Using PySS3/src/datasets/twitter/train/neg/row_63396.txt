The Anger is too MuchI am in high school.  I just got out of school for the summer.  However, I'm  still dealing with shit that happened a year ago.  I was sexually assaulted during a water polo practice by another player.  Long story short, the coach called the police after five weeks of doing nothing after I came to him about it.  I was humiliated in a way I  cannot describe.  This was all just to cover his ass, of course.  When the season  officially started after the summer practices during which this had happened, I was forced to stay on the junior varsity team, despite being easily good enough to be on varsity and being on the team the previous year.  This was total retribution for me talking to him about what those assholes did to me.  It was made a hostile environment for me and I was forced to quit the team. The ones who sexually assaulted me are still on the team.  There was no punishment for them, only for me.  I hate them so much. They need to get what they deserve, but my parents, despite claiming they would get a lawyer, have refused to do anything. I want to end it all, just so maybe that damn coach may see what his actions have lead to.  I can destroy the guys who assaulted me too by telling everyone what they did through social media before doing it.  They would be alienated, and would finally feel what I have felt for the past year. I have lost all semblance of confidence in myself due to this and I've been emotionally damaged beyond repair, but no one cares unless I die.
