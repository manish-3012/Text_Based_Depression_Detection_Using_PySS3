I need to talk without holding backHi my name is Sam, Iâ€™m 15 years old and Iâ€™ve suffered from depression and anxiety since I was 10 and right now itâ€™s worse than it has ever been. Iâ€™ve started cutting my wrist, for the life of me I canâ€™t tell you why, it just feels right, maybe itâ€™s to reassure myself that can actually feel something. 

I have a very good life, I have two parents and two siblings all that love me more than life itself. And I go to a great school that supports me. 

So it confuses me so much that I find myself wishing to die. My confusion only makes me more depressed. 

I only have 2 or 3 actual friends, 2 of witch go to a different school than me so I rarely speak to them. The rest are just acquaintances or assholes. 

I could do well at school if I wanted but I find myself completely unmotivated to do so. And almost every hobby I try to get into becomes uninteresting

I always joke about being depressed and suicidal without showing that Iâ€™m dying inside.

I find that the only thing keeping me from ending it is my mum because I remember her saying while she was driving that if she lost one of her children she wouldnâ€™t be able to survive it. 

If you read through this whole post, thank you. It means the world that you would let me talk about myself without holding back. Thank you so much
