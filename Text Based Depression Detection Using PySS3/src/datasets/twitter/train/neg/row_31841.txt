This must be a nightmareMy mind hurts all the time. I can't make it stop nor can I level out the rollercoaster that is every day. I don't know what I did to deserve things turning out like this or feeling this way all the time. I'm only 21, I can't have done anything that terrible yet, can I? Goddammit, the main reason I'm even reaching out on here is that I have late work to turn in that I've barely started and need to make the pain stop so I can get it done. I'm so pathetic I can't even adequately describe the specifics of my issues in this post, just vague, overly emotional sentences like the one I'm in the middle of right now. All I can say is that it seems like there is truly no help and no real hope. Why is existing this painful?
