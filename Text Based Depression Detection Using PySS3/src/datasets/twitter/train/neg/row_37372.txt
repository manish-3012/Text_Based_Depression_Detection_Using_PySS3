People care I guess and thatâ€™s the problem.I hate having family and friends that actually care about me.
I hate having people tell me how much they love me. 
Because I will eventually end up taking my life. And Iâ€™m just going to hurt them, but theyâ€™re the only reason I havenâ€™t offed myself yet. 
I think itâ€™s selfish of them to make me feel guilty about ending my life because Iâ€™m in constant pain.
Iâ€™d rather have no one love me. Itâ€™d be easier that way, Iâ€™m trying to push people out of my life but they just stick around and I donâ€™t get why. 
This shit is too hard, I wish all of the time that Iâ€™d just die in some freak accident. Someone kill me please.
