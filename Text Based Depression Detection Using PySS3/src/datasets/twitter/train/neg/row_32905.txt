iâ€™m so tired.i left my abuser this past month. we shared a phone bill, but as iâ€™m disabled and unable to work, he willingly took on the responsibility of paying it. however, unbeknownst to me, he hasnâ€™t been paying it at all and now i owe verizon $900+ because itâ€™s in my name. because it isnâ€™t paid off, i canâ€™t remove him from the account, so we still have contact. i canâ€™t find work in my hometown (canâ€™t drive, middle of nowhere) and i donâ€™t know what to do. i had to move back home with my transphobic dad who misgenders me constantly. i really, truly do not have the mental fortitude to do this anymore. iâ€™m so exhausted and nothing makes me happy. i feel like the only way out is to kill myself.
