Im not sure what to do anymore.For as long as i can remember everyday it gets harder and harder to wake up in the morning. Every night i lay in bed for hours dreading my life, hating every aspect of it. Im 22 soon to be 23 on the 27th and nothing has gone right in my life. I feel sad all the time, i have no friends, i pushed away my girlfriend..twice...so thats done and over with.  I just dont know what to do anymore. Ive thought about it a lot, over and over again. The only family i have that cares somewhat is my mom, but even then majority of the time she makes me feel worse than i already do. Ive tried talking to people and ive tried finding help but its to expensive. I think maybe its time to hit my off switch, its hard to feel this way all the time and i desperately need it to stop. Ive given myself until my birthday. If i havent found a way to make the feelings stop through other means then ill use the only method I know is effective.
