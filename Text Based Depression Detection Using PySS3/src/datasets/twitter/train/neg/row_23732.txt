Planned my suicide for yesterday, made a big thing of 'turning it around and telling my parents about it instead' but now wish I was dead and still fucking hate myselfJust got a message from a friend of mine. I'm 18, she's two years younger than me. She's all pissed up and coming back from a party and turns out she lost her virginity and she's all eeee and happy about it. Me? I'm a kissless, hugless virgin. Absolutely no fucker wants to go near me.

I have depression. Big whoop. I'm suicidal. Even bigger whoop. I have severe body image issues and anxiety. Just a great person aren't I? The stock answer is 'oh but' - seriously, let me stop you there. I *try* to make myself normal. Honestly. I don't look like a hunchback, I would say I look ok. I'm not amazing, I'm not a fucking model, but considering absolutely nobody has done so much as *touch* me in the 18 dismal years of my life makes me think I'm missing some huge flaw, somewhere, and I can't see it.

School was dreadful for me. I made some friends and lost nearly all of them either because they just suddenly decided I wasn't cool enough for them anymore or they moved and I lost contact. Sure, the few friends I had I valued above everything and they helped my depression but.... nobody, ever, once, invited me to a party. I was the social outcast. Bullied for 5 years, called every name under the sun, threatened to be 'put in hospital', had my name chanted at me by a whole sport class on a field, alone (that was *really* fun and I totally don't get bad anxiety hearing my own god damn name now).

My friend is fucking flawless. I've only gotten to know her in the past couple years but, she's one of the most funny, creative, understanding and relatable people I know. I watched her get into a relationship, but I couldn't be happy for her. I have no idea why. I have issues with *being happy* for people. I don't think I've ever been happy *for* someone. I either feel a mix of burning jealousy, envy or I just suddenly compare myself to them and become depressed.

Case in point, tonight. Friend messages me saying she's lost her virginity and she's coming back from a party. Ok, sure, she's a bit worried cos she didn't use protection but like, there's various remedies for that.

I felt absolutely no happiness *for* her. I wanted to be her, have everything she has, because clearly she's got her shit in check to get with someone and go to parties and oh yeah, she gets amazing fucking grades too so like, she beats me on every score. Looks stunning, thinks stunningly, has stunning things happen to her. And she just, walks it all off cos it happens every day. Zero hardships. When she tells me about something crap happening I'm already thinking like, shit - what is it? Someone in the family ill? She's feeling really down? But then it's something like - 'I only got an A when I wanted an A*'. Like, how flawless do you have to be to the point where something already astoundingly fucking amazing isn't good enough for you? And you have to go one step further?

Oh also this fucking ridiculous thing happened recently, didn't want to tell my parents about suicidal thoughts etc. so kept it hidden, but I told all my friends. I found out, *the day before*, that they fucking schemed to send a letter - behind my back - to my mum basically telling her about it. **'for me'**. I'm glad I found out, but then they essentially blackmailed me into telling her the next night. She took it well but, she's clearly worried. I don't want the treatment because it sounds horrible and it sounds like it takes ages and ages, plus I saw a friend relapse really bad off meds and I don't want to have that myself. Plus I have a phobia of medication. I know - pitiful fucking human right? I'm a genuine, pitiful piece of shit.

But the main thing here is that, I'm literally *that* fucking pathetic. Nobody has kissed me, nobody has hugged me. Certainly haven't had sex with anyone. I'm about to go to university - place of, popular people, people who have got it all, people who aced high school and went to all the parties and fucked all the guys - and I go alone, depressed, suicidal, having absolutely none of those things happen to me, and I have to wing it and pretend to be a different person.

Oh god yeah, fucking work. Managed to get a job this summer and I fucking hate it. It's these, 4 hour shifts. But I'm convinced time stops there. It's the most - monotonous, dreary job ever and it lasts for so fucking long. Especially if I do something wrong too and get picked up for it, then my anxiety skyrockets and I can't hold a fucking pen straight for 5 minutes, and then I'm on the brink of tears for the next couple hours too. I'm that fragile and that weak. Which makes it no wonder - to be honest - why nobody wants to even go near me. Jesus, look at him, can't even take criticism without crying, the fuck is wrong with him.

And then everyone always goes, 'oh ok but what do you do? like hobbies-wise?'. and then i tell them.

*fucking everything*

It might be out of desperation, to be noticed, i don't know. I fucking,

* Play piano
* Do art
* Produce music (electronic stuff)
* Write (books / poetry)
* Do programming (what I'm studying at uni)

and *desperately*, honestly - *desperately* look after my friends and check in on them, ask them how I am, and in turn when I feel terrible I go back to them and tell them and they also help me back. But at the end of the day nobody loves me, still.

Also - fuck that old saying of 'money can't buy you happiness'. Money *does*, and absolutely **can** buy you happiness. I'm a poor kid from a single family who went to a private school on a 95% bursary. I watched kids constantly fucking happy cos Daddy bought them the latest apple phone and they're going to Magaluf next week and they have top-range cars and their parents are still together and they don't get bullied and they go to parties and have all the booze and sex and weed they want cos they're rich.

One of my friends has the same dream as me, producing electronic music. We both do it. We've done it for years.

He's hitting the big time with his stuff *because he can buy it*. If you talked to him he'd tell you it's cos he's self-made and he did everything himself - but it's bullshit. His parents are both top-ranking medical professionals. He's loaded. He can get any equipment he wants, any music pack, any VST, any vocalist, any promotion, any gig. Anything. He just flashes the cash and he's in. And then has the nerve to tell me I 'give up too quickly'. No - I keep giving up (Which i don't tbh, I spend most of my day making music because it keeps me alive) because nobody listens to my stuff compared to him, I've only ever had 1 gig and that was as a support act (it was still an amazing night though, one of the best of my life and I thank the main guy for putting it together) and I'm not Mr. fucking Popular at school so nobody had heard of me there.

Oh shit yeah I remember the other big point, I've lied to this amazing flawless friend of mine. About being a virgin. As far as she's concerned I've hooked up before and, *Ohh yeah done all sorts and it's easy and happens all the time*. And I can't bring myself to tell her the truth because it's so embarrassing and life-ruining. *Jesus i'm 2 years younger and i've gotten with way more people than you*. How sad does that sound?

Honestly I'm *this* close to just kicking a stool cos I'm sick of it. I tried, honestly. Did all this shit, tried to be a popular, talented person, and ended up with mental disorders, no social life and desperate suicidal tendencies. Here's to me wanting to hang from the ceiling ASAP. Just need to get to uni first.

Fucking kill me.
