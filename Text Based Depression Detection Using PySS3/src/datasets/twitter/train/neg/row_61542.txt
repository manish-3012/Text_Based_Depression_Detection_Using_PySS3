Too scared of death to die, but more and more I feel no reason to live.I'm a 27 year old male. Most of my problems come from the fact that my social skills are terrible, and I feel very alone most of the time. The good friends I have had in my life have all moved away, and I'm so paralyzed with panic attacks that I can't even stand the car ride to visit them.  Now I occasionally meet people, but have trouble relating to them, or striking up conversations. My main concern is in my relationships with the opposite sex. I've had one serious girlfriend in my life, but for the most part, I feel like I repulse women. A few months ago I got involved with a woman I shouldn't have. She was engaged, and though it started as friendship, I found it hard to resist her advances. I fell in love with her and she told me she loved me, but the fact that I knew it wasn't going anywhere brought me a lot of pain. Soon she stopped showing interest, and I panicked, becoming very clingy, and eventually she told me to leave her alone, and that she never wanted to talk to me again. A month later I finally get her to open up and she tells me she only got involved with me because she thought if she gave me attention, I'd be satisfied and leave her alone. She told me I was repulsive to her, and that I was pathetic. Even though I've felt like I never want to see her again, and have tried to move on, I'm realizing more and more that I'm getting older, and I'm probably not going to meet anybody. I try to socialize, but after going to parties and attempting to do so, I usually just feel worse, like more of an outcast. I don't know that I want to die, but more and more I feel like my life isn't worth living. I don't enjoy anything very much anymore, and I feel like I'm a failure at everything. Honestly, I hate myself, and wish I were someone else. I'm feel that in general I'm getting more and more depressed. I'm in therapy, but there's only so much they can do.
