Instead of doing my homework, I'm writing goodbye letters.I'm only a sophomore in high school, but I no longer have any will to live. While all my friends are applying for scholarships, I have no interest in the idea of life itself, nor do I wish to continue it. 

I've been told I'm too young to think this and that everything will work out, but so far things seem to be getting worse and more out of hand. I get anxious at the thought of life after high school, and all I can think is that I don't really have a place in life, nor do I even want a place in life. 

So while my friends are busy doing whatever, I'm writing my goodbye notes to them instead of doing my homework.
