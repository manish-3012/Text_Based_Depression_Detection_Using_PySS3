Will my death avenge me?If i kill myself tonight? Will my parent who pretend to care and love hurt till death? Will they get a taste of their own medicine?
Will it be worse than death for them? Will people in our society looks down on them? Will it destroy the entire family? Will they get to suffer some more? Will it drive them crazy and push them to the edge? Will they wish they were dead? 

Iwish the answers were yes to all of them but my â€˜momâ€™ will probably die and my father will live longer to ensure everyone suffers more. 

Donâ€™t get me wrong i wanna kill myself regardless but it would be nice if it payed off...
