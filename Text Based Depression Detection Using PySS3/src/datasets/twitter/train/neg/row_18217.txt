Can't wait until ThursdayI'm too young for this. I've spent too many years with chronic depression. I've tried to get help. Mostly everyone in my life has abandoned me. I don't think I just have depression. Over the two past years I've gotten so numb and apathetic that nothing phases me. I can't wait to get out of this hell on Thursday. That will be the happiest day of my life all pain and anxiety finally gone. I can't wait to overdose. I can't wait for nothingness instead of being stuck here with so much shit on my back. I don't think there's any reaaon to talk to anyone. I've been lost since I was born, people like me are only destined for sadness. Hope it's not a failure. Can't wait for death. Only thing left to do is pick final song I want to listen to. My laat thoughts will only be filled with my dad, dog, and music. Good times.
