I think I tried to kill myself.Mom threw all of my medications. I've been taking it for a while, so I guess the chemicals were still in the system that time.

That night I drank way more alcohol than I could handle, threw up, and blacked out on the way to my bed. I woke up around 4am feeling very nauseated, dizzy, and sweaty. I suspected it's a bad hangover, but then I realized all those antidepressants and antipsychotics could have done something wrong. I wasn't new to either of those medication's withdrawal, but considering that I have drank bottles of booze with them made me scared for life (ironically). Mom just considered that I was having a worse hangover, and told me it will take some days for the symptoms to wear off. But little does she know, going through withdrawal is such horrifying, so I was constantly worried if it was just a hangover.

Since I'm still alive, living with an additional physical pain was just unbearable. So I finally paid a visit to the doc after some days. I told them I think I was suffering from a hangover, but I was scared to tell them that I had been previously taking other meds for months right before getting intoxicated.

Have I really tried to kill myself?
