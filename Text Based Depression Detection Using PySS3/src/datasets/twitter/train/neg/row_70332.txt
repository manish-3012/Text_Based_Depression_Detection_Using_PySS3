Considering SuicideHey I am 19.

How am I suppose to find a job and work 9-5 when I can't even play video games or even jerk off due to these being boring as well.

Everything is boring, this includes drugs as well (haven't done any drugs since 7 months, it's not like I'm hardcore anyways).

I literally pick up a hobby and get bored with it in a week. Most of the time less than a week.

If I'm never going to be satisfied with anything, why should I bother wasting my time being a slave to the system. I don't want a girlfriend, I don't want kids, I don't want friends. I don't want anything, it's actually crazy.

And no, I'm not depressed. I am bored. And I can't do anything about it.

I would really appreciate a talk right now, thanks.
