It's All Beginning To Be Too Much...Depression is fucking *harsh*. I'm convinced it's the most vile and disgusting thing in this world.

It's making me fail my classes because I can't concentrate on my homework and I just *can't* do anything. I get distracted by things too easily, and just can't focus. I get carried away by my own thoughts. *And not to mention* that I can't remember shit. It's only getting worse, too, as I fall deeper into depression; a few months ago, I just forgot what homework I had or what I left in my room, *now?* Now, I can't even remember what day it is. I can't remember what day or time it is and what responsibilities I should be doing. I can't remember anything, not even to shower or eat.

Depression has made me tired and I'm starving but at the same time I'm just not hungry at all. I can't sleep because I'll sit there for *hours* but my head won't shut up, and when I finally do fall asleep, I keep waking up at random times in the middle of the night. And if I don't do that, then my dream conscience is a *bitch*. When dreaming, minding my own business, a thundering voice says, "don't take your medication, it's disgusting poison", "don't try to get in shape, you'll fail anyways", "don't trust her, she's a liar". I *hate* depression.

I hate this. I'm scared of death, and yet there's that stupid little voice in my head saying "just kill yourself". I hate depression. I hate this. I don't want to kill myself but I can't stop thinking about it because my conscience thinks it's a damn good idea.

This is *exhausting*. I might knock myself out cold to avoid this pestering voice telling me to just off myself.

EDIT: How do you guys even *cope* with this? How do you ignore that stupid voice and just get on with your life? Don't tell me medication is the only option because I *really* don't trust medication and brain-altering drugs like that. They're just easy methods of controlling people, because people take them so willingly.
