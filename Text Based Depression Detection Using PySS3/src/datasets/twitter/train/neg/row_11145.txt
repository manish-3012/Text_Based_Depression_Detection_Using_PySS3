here it goes againI'm 33. I've been depressed most of the time since I was 14. I've arguably had anxiety since the day I was born. A few years ago, I was also diagnosed with autism. I don't connect with people, no matter how I try. I'm tired of trying. Therefore, I'm alone.
The suicidal thoughts have been growing in intensity for nearly a year, I think, save last month when I got a reprieve for a few weeks. But they're back now and I can feel myself sliding right back to where I was.
I've been through everything: exercise, diet changes, therapy groups, individual therapy, partial hospitalization, inpatient hospitalization, and nearly every combination of medications that a psychiatrist is willing to throw at me. I'm used to things being bad during time periods where I wasn't getting treatment. I've been scared and hopeless because I've now gotten worse than ever while being treated. I'm scared that this is as good as it gets for me, that the darkness is just going to keep getting even darker somehow. If that's the case, then suicide is an inevitability. Fighting this hard to still feel this bad is exhausting and futile. Somewhere deep down I know my life is worth the fight, but it's harder and harder to remember.
