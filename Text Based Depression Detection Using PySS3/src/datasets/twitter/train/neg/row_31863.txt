I don't think I can do the "life" thing anymoreI never thought Iâ€™d be writing a post here. I always thought I was strong. I always thought it wouldnâ€™t get to this. But everythingâ€™s changed, I guess. My anxiety is so bad, I donâ€™t think I WANT to live with it anyone. Anything that I could possibly worry about, I worry about. My anxiety is so bad it always gives me phantom pains and I convince myself Iâ€™m having a heart attack or a stroke or some shit. Iâ€™m only 16 years old. I shouldnâ€™t be living like this. I should be like other girls, just carefree. My anxiety was a lot better for awhile, but itâ€™s taken a turn for the worse and I donâ€™t wanna live with it anymore. All my friends do is get mad at me and it makes me feel SO shitty. I put my parents through so much shit. Iâ€™ve had little mini mental breakdowns. I barely have a relationship with my dad. I love my mom so much. All my mom does is worry about me and she does so much for me and iâ€™ve treated her so shitty in the past and it makes me feel like absolute shit. I hate that I always worry her. I know it would just be better if I was dead and gone and didnâ€™t exist because then I wouldnâ€™t be causing her pain. 2 kids that live on my street have killed themselves i know she's scared for me and doesn't want me to feel like that and think i need to commit suicide. I hate that I feel this way. I hate that i just wanna free her from the pain that is me. I donâ€™t wanna feel this way. I donâ€™t wanna feel anymore. I just wanna be gone. I wanna be free from this pain. I'm crippled. I'm drowning.
