Just make the pain stopSo after years of no luck with girls. Getting nothing but rejection and being ignored. After years of looking for someone on tinder/bumble/pof and nothing ever happening. I finally connect with a girl who is everything Iâ€™m looking for. Sheâ€™s nice, polite, easy to talk to, talk, funny, gorgeous, and above all else totally into me! For once all I had to do is be myself and it was more than enough.

We texted each other constantly, like we couldnâ€™t get enough of each other! She had problems I helped her feel better about and she made me feel like I was worth something. After three weeks, I think we are on the road to getting together and becoming boyfriend and girlfriend. Iâ€™ve been waiting for something like this my whole life. Iâ€™m 28 and girls have never shown any interest in me. Itâ€™s like God finally said, itâ€™s over, youâ€™re finally entitled to some happiness.

Now out of nowhere she tells me that sheâ€™s moving to Boston like sheâ€™s always wanted to. Uhhh WTF!!!! If you werenâ€™t planning on sticking around why were you looking for someone on Tinder?!?! Did you think I wouldnâ€™t mind???? My heartâ€™s just been stepped on and now I feel like dying.
