What do I do?I can't do it anymore. My sister laughs at me all the time even though she knows im severly depressed. My mom and dad dont give a shit at all even though I told them a few times. All I want to do is end it. It's the only way. There is just one thing that's holding me back. My only friend. She's also depressed. And she actually threatened to kill herself too if I finally did it. I have felt hopeless for years. Suicide truly is the one and only option. But I only want to know how I can get her to not kill herself when I do it so I don't have her death on my hands. When I finally talked her out of it I can find my peace.
Ps: I tried getting her to hate my guts but it's just not working.
