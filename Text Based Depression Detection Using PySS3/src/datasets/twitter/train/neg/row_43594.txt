Letting the Coronavirus kill youHi everyone. I just had the most profound realization: I don't need to be afraid of the coronavirus anymore. I can literally go outside without a mask, go anywhere I want, do whatever I want, etc, and not worry. Who cares if you get the virus if you don't want to be alive anymore? My only issue is that I don't want to contract the virus and live if I get it. Does anyone here know their stuff when it comes to the virus? How do you maximize potentiality of death if it's contracted? Thanks.
