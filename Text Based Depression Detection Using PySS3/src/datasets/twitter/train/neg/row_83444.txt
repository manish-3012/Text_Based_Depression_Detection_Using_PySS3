My family has been falling apart ever since my dad lost his jobMy dad lost his job a week ago and since then my family has been falling apart. My mom and Dad have been nonstop screaming at each other. My dad said heâ€™s about to leave our house. My sister isnâ€™t helping, sheâ€™s making it hard on my dad like my mom is. Iâ€™m not saying my dad is the right one hereâ€” both â€œsidesâ€ are acting insane. Nothing is working out right now.

Theyâ€™re making me so suicidal right now and I havenâ€™t spoken a word all day. I canâ€™t deal with this anymore. My mom made dinner and then randomly walked out of the house with our dogs. When she comes back in I can just imagine what might happen. 

Iâ€™m so sick and tired of this
