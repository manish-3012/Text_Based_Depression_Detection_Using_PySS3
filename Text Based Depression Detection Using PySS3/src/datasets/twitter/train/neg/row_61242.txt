I lied to myself.Two weeks ago I was ready to give up on myself. I'm not sure why but I decided to talk to a friend to see how she was doing. She asked how I was, I told her about my situation and suggested I see a therapist, or at the very least tell my family. So first week of class I started to feel myself wear down throughout the day and decided to tell my brother. So I did, I promised him I would call the psychiatric department of the hospital to see when I could get an appointment. Only available was during school hours and I decided against it, the lady I talked to was real nice, told me to call in the morning I want the appointment to see if it was free that day. I never called back.

I guess since I had always kinda been like this I always had something. I've been getting worse I can barely sleep, with every day it seems less and less of a good idea to call. What happens to me if have to take medication, how different will I be, how different will I feel with every day. Where my mind is right now, it's hard to remember some stuff, I don't know what I like, or what I would want to do, I barely have any drive to finish high school. 

I'm not sure where this part would be better suited. I can't tell if I like this one person, or if it's my mind just trying to cling onto anything that can make me smile.
