I don't know what to doMy best friend (we're both juniors in high school) doesn't believe that she matters or that so many people care for her, no matter how much I try to comfort her and let her know how much she'd be missed and how so many people care for her.
This past month she has gotten more and more depressed. Her parents caught her self harming and took away everything she could use and check on her. Since then she has expressed how much she wants to die. She "feels trapped, she just wants to escape and be alone, and die." 
Sorry for the wall of text, I just love her and care for her so much. I don't do very well with situations like this, so I'm scared and don't know what to do.
