I don't know how to feel after my father passed away.It's about to be 4 months since he has passed. I don't have anyone to express my feelings with but here. I have a lot of passion to accomplish things but it is so hard. I've never had to experience a death of someone I had loved in my life ever. I've never had pet die, the closest I had was my step grandfather. I'm halfway through my sophomore year in high school and I have fallen off mentally. I have good grades, I'm in great shape for track this  coming spring but there's still a void inside of me. I've cut off relationships with my friends and potential girlfriends because of this. I haven't allowed anyone in my life. The only thing that has kept me going and keeping from crying is to let him know that I am strong. I have no one to talk to, I've only had a few people like a counselor from my school and one or two very close friends that have reached out to me but I refuse to talk to my closest friends about it because I don't want them to look at me as someone needy or a victim and I don't want to go to the counsellor at my school bc my schedule is already full during the weekday. It's days like this where I'm taking a rest day off of running and not having school and being home alone that I have a lot of time to ponder about my father. It really bothers me. I don't know how to feel.
