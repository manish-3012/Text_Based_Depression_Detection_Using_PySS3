I need helpIâ€™ve had a headache for almost 83 weeks now... I have migraines every single day. It seems like any medicine I try works for a little while then stops working. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m tired of hurting all the time Iâ€™m just ready to end it. I donâ€™t see a point in living if Iâ€™m always gonna b hurting. The only thing that can take my pain away is drugs and I think Iâ€™d rather b dead then end up being some junky that spends all their money on drugs. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
