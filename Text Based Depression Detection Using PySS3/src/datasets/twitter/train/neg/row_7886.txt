A year ago today, I tried to kill myself.What a horrible night that was. I'll never be able to forget my decision. Sad thing is, I'm not any better. I haven't made any more attempts but I still think about doing it. 
I'm sorry for anyone who's been through the same stuff I have. Depression is a living hell and I think we need more awareness on this topic. My suicide attempt last year led to a falling out with family members and friends, my school kicked me out and my life went downhill. 

Hopefully all of us suffering can get through this together.
