I am completely, utterly lost and so beyond the point of rational thought about this.In the past few weeks I have lost basically everything I cared for, and I've been completely alone since. I haven't slept more than 3 hours a night in almost three weeks now and I can't eat. I can't get the voices in my head to stop and they're trying to kill me and I can't get myself to think of any reason why I shouldn't because honestly I think my brain is just done. This sense of calm about it all has sort of settled in and I feel like I don't even care about the matter at all. I'm honestly not sure what I should do, let alone what I can do. I also don't know if I want to do anything about it, because life has just gotten so painful at this point I feel it would just be easier this way and I'm starting to find my peace with it but I know I shouldn't. Please, any advice or anything would help.
