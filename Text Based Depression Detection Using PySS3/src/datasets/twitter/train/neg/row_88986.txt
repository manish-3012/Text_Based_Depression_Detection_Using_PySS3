Can't I just die? Anyone have ANY insight?Move/delete this if this isn't the right place.

I don't want this to be massive story, so ask me details as needed...

Bottom lineâ€”I want to die. I currently lack the means to do so rightfully. I have time, so perhaps someone can change my mind. Give me something I haven't yet done. Teach me something I don't know. Any insight, anything useful. Anything.

**As it stands:**
I have an eating disorderâ€”more than an eating disorder. Depression. Minimal self-esteem. Constant anxiety. Apathy is rampant. Mood swings, cravings, perpetual thoughts of suicide. Getting lost in my own mind for hours on end. I feel insane, but that it's my ability to make sense of what's happening that makes me feel that way.

**Necessary History:**
My life was great until I was 15.5 years old. I was arrested late one night with my best friend en route to lighting off a molotov cocktail for fun and video taping it. At the time it turned my life upside down, as I was a good, bright kid. Mentally and emotionally I got over it as it was resolved over time. But I emerged with a changing sense of self. I wanted to change who I was because of the mistake I made. Though I forgave myself, I wanted to consciously become "my best." My intelligence told me that was perfection. Somewhere in this time the root causes of my current situation began.

I was already a straight-A student. I was already an athlete. Through the latter half of high school I became more successful because of that quest for perfection. I became obsessed with nutrition, sports performance, task efficiency, and other ways of being better pragmatically and proactively. I worked harder in school, I learned more, I became fitter, I became faster. Eagle Scout. Team Captain. More than a dozen first place finishes. Two-time state qualifier in cross country. Accepted in college of my choice. Good girlfriend, decent family, close, reliable friends. Etc, etc.

Somewhere in that line of achievement there arose a dark side of me. Not just a fear of failure, but some kind of compulsion that drove me to overeat (binge) on unhealthy, sugary food. I can't pinpoint the first exact incident, only the first I can remember. 

Binges are mysterious and monthly at first. During senior year of HS binges become more and more frequent, but generally doesn't escalate to severely effect my quality of life, activities, etc. Though personal guilt, shame, etc was present as a result. 

Between HS and college, binges cease for a bit but come back larger and worse than ever as a college freshman. Binges are weekly and begin to affect mental health, academic and athletic performance. Obsession with the problem and overall anxiety grows. Try to get help through friends and weekly therapy, no changes. Girlfriend leaves me, grandpa dies, I feel nostalgia for the past constantly. Academics and athletics continue to hold me together.

Between freshman and sophomore year, mental health and quality of life deteriorate a little more. Weight gain occurs for the first time (~10 pounds). Sophomore year, suicidal thoughts begin because I get sports injury that keeps me from my favorite passion indefinitely. Grades plummet. November of sophomore year, suicide attempt number one. Too afraid/unsure to do it. December of sophomore year, attempt number two, don't do it for the same reasons.

Winter holidays of sophomore year of college. Rediscover some sources of motivation to 'fix' all the problems. Resolve to tell parents a little and do everything possible to get back to normal. I lose 15 pounds, get really fit, work very hard to get a 4.0. Binges reduced to weekly or less. Then I got an internship back home, binges resurface due to lack of willpower and post weight-loss fallout, etc. Gain weight. Become apathetic with suicidal thoughts again. Just kind of float for a while. I re-enter therapy, it doesn't really do anything for me. Continue to float for a bit as I gain weight and lose more fitness.

Junior year of college, age 21. Resolve again to make serious attempt to mitigate overeating, fix running injury, etc. I couldn't conquer the binges. One step forward, two steps back. Mental/emotional condition deteriorates further...

**Necessary details for help/analysis:**

*I'm gonna be as clear as I can, because I want whoever decides to read all this to know what I know and help me make some kind of practical decision, if possible...*

I know what's wrong with me. I know what I want in life, I know what (I think) makes me happy. The biggest, most mysterious problem is that I have this visceral, insatiable desire to eat all the time. I think about food and my disorder and all that anxiety as long as I am awake. My eating disorder and it's surrounding problems *prevent* me from doing what I love and self-actualizing.

I have tried absolutely everything I can think of to get back to eating normally, healthfully. I have tried to control my eating, to get myself to stop overeating, but at some point I fail every time. A powerful drug addiction is the best way I can describe it. 

When I overeat these days, pretty much all I do walk around campus eating whatever the fuck I want, when I want, because I am infected with apathy and I have so little willpower left anymore to stop myself. I can't get myself to do school work, to exercise, to do anything productive (or even fun). It's like all I want is to eat. This goes on until I somehow my willpower recharges, I tap into my motivational reserves, and try to turn my life around. Either in 3 days or a week or some short period of time, I fail and binge again. And so after a few more days of constant overeating, I try again. And again. And again. 

This is what I refer to as "the soul destroying cycle." Every time it happens I care less and want to die more. So here's the conclusion I've reached, the help/advice that I need:

If my eating disorder, etc. will always exist, if it's something that honestly will never go away and never get better, if it's a behavior that will only push me to keep eating until no one cares about me, all my progress in life is gone, I have no friends and my family rejects me, and I'll die from it, what's the point of trying to fight to live? 

Like, I doubt now that recovery is possible. It's like I always want more food no matter what... I can't enjoy life because of this. I'm always afraid, always anxious, and I'm not just making this up. I used to be so successful and happy with myself. I mean, I sometimes see a tiny bit of a bright side to things, I have a friend or two, I have some sort of fun things to look forward to, but they can't cure me of this eating disorder. If  I do feel happy, I just feel like I should be eating to further that happiness. 

Here's what I'm left withâ€”where I *really* want to hear from anyoneâ€”I believe I have two choices: 

A) Let go completely of everything that I'm trying to control in my life. Fuck grades, fuck fitness, fuck working hard for any of my dreams and goals. Just do whatever I want, whether it's food or not, and see where I end up in like a month or so. To see if my desire for food ever goes away, like a passing fad. This would be the expense of *literally* everything: what my friends think, what my family thinks; I'd be creating career sabotage, college sabotage, doing a complete U-turn and saying "fuck you, world!" It'd be like committing suicide, only not dying. I feel that in this choice everyone would hate me, but my family and friends wouldn't "suffer" because I'm dead. They can just be forever angry or whatever with me instead. Maybe I could try and explain everything. Not sure. 

B) Kill myself. Looking like the better option. Since the rest of world beyond the small amount of people I know won't care. Society won't miss me, I already know of a dozen people that are better than me with less arrogance and selfishness that can make my former communities better. In short, I'm replaceable by others for any standard of value or accomplishment. ... Yeah, my friends and family will mourn and miss me. But what's worse? Asking them to suffer a little for a few weeks until they forget and move on, or suffer myself from all this soul destroying shit for the rest of my life, forever disappointing anyone who may have actually cared about me? Because let's face it, since very, very few of those people close to me know about these problems of mine, if I'm dead it'll just be easier for them to accept. But if they see me deteriorate into societal/cultural worthlessness because I decide not to die so they can be "happy" with me alive... that just doesn't make sense to me. 

So what do I do? What *can* I do? I'm fucking tired of this shit.

**TL;DR: Fairly certain I want to die. Used to be successful, happy person. Now, multiple mental health issues, including "perceived incurable" eating disorder. Can't decide if it's better to live or die. I'll answer any questions you have.**
