I want to die!! but can't seem to pull the trigger!So I've been dealing with severe depression and I'm not taking any pills to deal with it and its gotten to the point where i will drive my truck to the middle of nowhere and just bawl my eyes out. I've gotten to the point where I'll pick up my gun and hold it to my head but I just don't have the guts to do it and so I usually just throw the gun to the side and cry. I haven't gone to a therapist in over five years. My depression has gotten to the point where it's starting to affect my everyday life. My gf has noticed a change in me and I can't tell her what's wrong with me and it's tearing me apart I really need some help.
