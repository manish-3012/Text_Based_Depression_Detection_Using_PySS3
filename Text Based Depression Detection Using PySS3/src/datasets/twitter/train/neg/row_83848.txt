License suspended. Life suspendedI'm screwed. No money. Can't work because I got laid off in rescission and couldn't pay off fix it tickets (no dui or moving violations) and im a auto mechanic. After about 4 years I feel my body cannot take the stress anymore. My heart is always racing just trying to get to the store. I cry and think about dying every day. The only reason I'm still here is because of my beautiful, amazing dog who always is there for me. I feel robbed of my life because of something so stupid and meaningless. Every part of my life suffers. I have no family to help. I've been on my own since 16. I'm struggling to stay alive in the California Bay area. If only the courts would let me make  $20 payments.
