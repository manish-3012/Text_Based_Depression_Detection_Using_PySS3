I am Out of Reasons to StayHonestly, I keep trying. I tried getting help, I tried recovering. I did my best and for a while things got better. I got a job, I had someone I'd fallen in love with, I was making new friends... 

My social anxiety has broken me. I feel like I can't go more than a couple days without a panic attack because my social anxiety is literally crippling. The girl I love just bailed on me. She said she'd be back but the goodbye was clear. Even if she does it's over. The friends I made have all fallen away. I try snd I try but for every step forward I take 10 back. I just don't know what to do. I feel like death is the only way to make it stop. I am so tired of hurting and feeling worthless. 

I thought for a minute there that there was hope for not just living with it but actually finding my way out. I was stupid and wrong. There is no way out. There's only windows into another life I can never have. 

As soon as the shock wears off I will probably just end it. Feeling this numb and broken... I just can't. No one cares. No one actually loves me. They can't. I am just not a part of this world and it's time to make it official.
