Could use someone to talk toIâ€™m pretty isolated right now and donâ€™t really have any friends I can count on. I know Iâ€™m gonna do something stupid soon if I donâ€™t get help. Heavily contemplating overdosing on OTC pills. Could use a friend, if youâ€™re a fellow Christian thatâ€™d be cool but obviously Iâ€™m desperate and would take anything.
