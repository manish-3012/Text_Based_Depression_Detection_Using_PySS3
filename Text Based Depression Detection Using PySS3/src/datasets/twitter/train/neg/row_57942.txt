Losing control of my life and feeling alone. Wish I could end things but I donâ€™t want to fail this time.Feeling so alone. Iâ€™ve been really depressed for a while. My girlfriend doesnâ€™t understand or seem to care and we just keep getting into fights. Everything is always my fault in her eyes. I canâ€™t talk to my best friend about it because she(my gf) gets mad when I talk to him and not her about my feelings. Iâ€™ve tried talking to her but she makes me feel like I canâ€™t talk to her and Iâ€™ve just given up trying. I canâ€™t tell my therapist how seriously Iâ€™ve been thinking about ending it because then Iâ€™ll just get stuck in the hospital. Work has me so stressed out. I feel like Iâ€™m losing control over my whole life and I canâ€™t do anything about it. Iâ€™m just stuck and thereâ€™s no where to turn. If I had any real means of ending it and I knew Iâ€™d be successful and not have to live through the aftermath of a failed attempt Iâ€™d do it in a heartbeat. Iâ€™ve failed an attempt before and Iâ€™m not dealing with what comes after another failure. Im just so drained of everything. I feel like Iâ€™m barely functioning and Iâ€™m all alone.
