How do I reach outI am a very closed off person and I don't know how to reach out for help. I don't know how to tell my mom or best friend that I feel suicidal and I don't even know how to tell my therapist I feel suicidal. I am a very closed off person. How do I reach out more easily? It may be getting too late, I don't want to hurt myself but I feel like that's becoming the only option.
