Does anyone ever feel the need to die clean?Iâ€™ve been in jail since Friday morning &amp; havenâ€™t showered since then, though I got out Saturday. I have food all down my sweatshirt. I stink. I donâ€™t give a fuck cos Iâ€™m fucking depressed.

I feel like I want to take all my antipsychotic medication and my sleepers. Iâ€™m three gins down &amp; counting. 

But whatâ€™s holding me back is how gross I am. I want to die clean, in nice clothes. Needing to take that shower is holding me back right now. I guess thatâ€™s a good thing.

But I donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™ll feel that way. Or how long til I take that shower.
