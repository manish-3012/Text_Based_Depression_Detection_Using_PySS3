Suicide is my only option now.Iâ€™ve taken on too much and Iâ€™m failing in every aspect of my life. I hate my self more now than I ever have and I donâ€™t feel thereâ€™s any fixing that. I donâ€™t have the energy now to do anything. I just take pills and sleep as much as I can to escape my life.

I have a plan. Several actually. In the past I always waited for something. I always put it off until I finished something. Thereâ€™s nothing now to wait for. 

I guess I need professional help but I donâ€™t feel like I want to get better. I just want this to be over.
