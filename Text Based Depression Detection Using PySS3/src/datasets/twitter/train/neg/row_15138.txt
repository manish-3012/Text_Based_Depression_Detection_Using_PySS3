I haven't wanted to live in a long time.Well, first of all, I have tried therapy. I have tried drugs. I have tried everything that I have access to, but nothing works. Every moment of every day I am alone, whether it be at school or at home. My family is not interested in talking to me, I don't doubt that they love me, bu I know they don't like me. If I had any real friends, I would talk to them, but I don't, so I'm stuck going to Reddit and similar sites to get any sort of human interaction. I only ever feel sad now, for the past 3 years, and its a deep sadness, that has a physical pain in my chest. I think of suicide constantly, literally. I can't really remember when I had a day go by without the thought, or want to end it all. Life seems meaningless to me, and I have no reason. I'm always alone and always sad. I don't want to live anymore. Please don't just say "think of those who have it worse", as the fact that I've been alone all my life means I lost a good portion of my ability to empathize with others. I tried writing a journal, and all it did was make me more depressed. I realize how insignificant I am, and I accept my role. I don't want to live anymore. I just can't think of any future for myself. If life is always going to feel like this, this unending loneliness and this awful enuie, why would I continue to subject myself to this? Why am I always alone? Why dosent anybody like me? Why does everybody else seem to have other people? I just can't take it, I don't want to live anymore.
