â€œYou donâ€™t owe anybody successâ€
In America (and elsewhere Iâ€™m sure), the ferocity of competition is incredibly damaging to the soul. We blame ourselves for not becoming rockstars or billionaires because weâ€™re told â€œanyone can do it!â€ and itâ€™s horribly untrue and destructive. 
Capitalism has done great things, but at the expense of our humanity. So motherFUCK anybody who passes judgement on you for not becoming what they think success looks like. 

On this sub I see heart-wrenching stories of absolute terror...horrors that are so foreign to me. But also some that are not, such as the feeling of utter insignificance. There are well-hidden realms of hell in this world that masquerade as innocuous and even pleasant and so when we start tearing ourselves down despite no true wrongdoing (murder, rape)...we would be wise to realize that it is only a product of our brainwashing, and that we are perfect exactly where we are. This isnâ€™t hippie-talk...this is the truth. 

Of course, working to better your surroundings is a totally cool goal...but donâ€™t attach your self-worth to it. You are not worth only what you can produce. Your life is immensely valuable all on its own. Think back to when you were a kid. Were you upset because you werenâ€™t a prodigy like Mozart? So then why do we set such high standards as we age? Our programming.

I fucking love everybody on this sub. Stay strong through the dark. Youâ€™re all soldiers fighting a battle you didnâ€™t enlist in. Have some empathy for yourselves.
