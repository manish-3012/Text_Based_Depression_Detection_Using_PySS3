ParentsThe only thing really keeping me alive right now and for awhile has been my parents. They rely on me too much for me to do that to them and I just wish I didn't have to worry about it. I just want it to be over. Any good in my life is sucked away by the pervasive darkness of my mind. I'm in the worst depressive episode of my life right now. It already was intensely suicidal at the start of the summer, when everything in my life was going exactly how I would like. Amazing girlfriend, good new job, great friends, supporting family, plenty of things to do that I was eager to do. Yet I still just wanted to end it. Now my girlfriend left me, my dad almost died in a car accident 3 days later, and the job stresses me out beyond what I can handle and allows my thoughts to build and build and build. I barely keep myself from screaming and running out of work in tears and my parents have such a hastle with dealing with my dad's injuries that I don't want to bog them down and take more money. I don't want help (done inpatient treatment, CBT, and medication), I want it to be over. I feel like I'm being ripped apart in a hurricane of emotion and I can't fucking deal with it anymore. What's the point in going on if every good thing that happens will eventually get torn down by my fucked up mind. It just doesn't seem worth it and even stuff I want to do in the future doesn't make me want to live enough to push aside these urges. Fuck me man, this latest episode has been too much and I'm sick of spending at least half of my year depressed as fuck every year.
