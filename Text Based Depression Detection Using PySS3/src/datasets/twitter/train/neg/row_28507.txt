The train tracks would look pretty painted red.I take the train back down home tomorrow. Maybe that could be my way out.

I've been suicidal for years. A few months ago I abandoned my two closest friends who helped me through more than they know. I regret it so much.
I left twice before and went back and they understood that I wasn't well. I don't want to go back this time because I can't keep doing this to them. Plus they think I'm dead because I sent one of them a suicide note prior to a failed attempt. All I know it I was that truck didn't swerve.

The person I sent the note to, she was the only person who ever gave a flying fuck about my wellbeing. It wasn't until recently I realized the other was a damn snake who never cared. 
 I don't know what I want people to tell me, I guess I just needed to get this out. 

I just want to be done. This train is my way out. Fuck my life. I hate myself. I've been denying this shit ever since I left and I told myself it wouldn't get to me. I lied. I'm losing my mind. 
 I WANT TO PULL A KNIFE OUT OF THE BLOCK AND CUT MY WRISTS
