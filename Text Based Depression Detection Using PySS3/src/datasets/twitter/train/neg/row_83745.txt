I donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™ll go onIâ€™ve been depressed for the past 5 years along with having stress and anxiety. Iâ€™m just so tired. So tired I canâ€™t even wake up in the morning. Iâ€™ve told my parents and they donâ€™t seem to get it. Everyday that goes by just makes it harder to go on. Iâ€™m just laying in bed all day, doing nothing at all. I want to be productive and achieve things but Iâ€™m too tired to even eat. Iâ€™ve signed up for therapy but thereâ€™s a long waiting list. I got kicked out of school a month ago, so my parents took away my priveligium to go out and see my friends. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore, Iâ€™m constantly trapped with my own thoughts, I just want to end it all. Stop it from hurting. Iâ€™m tired of everything
