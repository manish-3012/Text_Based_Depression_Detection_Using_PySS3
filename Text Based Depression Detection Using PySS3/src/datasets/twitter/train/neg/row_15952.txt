Going mad with uncertaintyI have been suffering ever since I started school, and it hasnâ€™t stopped since. Constant bullying with no assistance despite my pleas to teachers, having so many friends betray me, even loved ones, even a sexual assault accusation which got me basically expelled. Iâ€™ve had a couple â€˜girlfriendsâ€™, but almost all of them have just used me for sexual favours, with nothing in return. All Iâ€™ve ever wanted was some loyal friends, a romantic relationship, a stable mindset and a hopeful future. All of those have been crushed, and I feel like I have nothing left to do with my life. The only path I have left to take that includes living is having constant meltdowns, failed attempts at love, taking prescription drugs every moment of the day and a broken uncertain future. This isnâ€™t the extend of my problems, such as over-self-awareness (worrying about everything I say or do), and isolation, but Iâ€™d be droning on and on, and Iâ€™m already taking up too much of your time, if you actually got this far. But Iâ€™ve just given up at this point. Iâ€™ve been told to keep going, to keep trying, but thereâ€™s only so many second chances I can handle. The only thing holding me back from taking all my meds at once or finding a decent sharp object to finish what i shouldâ€™ve done years ago is false hope and made up futures. Iâ€™ll edit this with any extra information that is required.
Thanks for bothering, people
