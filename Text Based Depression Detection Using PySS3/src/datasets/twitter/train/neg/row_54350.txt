My friend will commit suicide December 31My friend is suicidal and is planning her suicide December 31, can you please help me choose the right words to say. I know when I was suicidal all I wanted was a hug, but I live 5h away from her so almost all I can do is message online...

Feel free to give advice or anything I am just so f*cking worried because I love her so got damn much!

Thank you sooo much for any advice and I really mean it when i say I wish you the best of luck. I am sending 1GB of virtual hugs to every one of you!
