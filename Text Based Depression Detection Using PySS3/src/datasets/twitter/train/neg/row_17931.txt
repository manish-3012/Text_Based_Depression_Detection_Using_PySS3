Why am I the only person who hates me?Iâ€™m a 21m everyone says Iâ€™m fine everyone thinks Iâ€™m ok and I I have some friends but I seem to be the only person who hates me and I canâ€™t stop hating myself I think of myself as this creepy monster when I know Iâ€™m not really that but I canâ€™t help but think itâ€™s true itâ€™s like Iâ€™m fighting myself I just want it to stop
