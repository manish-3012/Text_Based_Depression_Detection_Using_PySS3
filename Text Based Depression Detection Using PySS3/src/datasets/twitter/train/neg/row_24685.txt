Suicide bringing relief?Note: I am not trying to encourage suicide in any way with what I am about to say. I have always wanted an open discussion about this, and this seems to fit. I am not trying to intentionally offend anyone, but if I do in the process of expressing myself I do apologize. 

I have had suicide ideology for about 10 years now. I did not realize my thoughts had a term for it until last year when I committed myself for mental health treatment (nothing to do with actively trying to commit suicide).  Lately, I have been seeing suicide as a relief from life. When I think about it I feel a bit calmer at the thought of not existing anymore. I feel a sense of warmth that comes over me knowing I do not have to deal with life, and that makes me mentally smile in a way that I can never genuinely do in life.

Itâ€™s ducked up thinking, I know. I also feel that the only reason I feel guilt about thinking this way is Bc of how suicide is thought of in society. If I didnâ€™t have the influence of what the general culture feels about suicide, I would be fine with my thinking.

Why would I want to? I feel like Iâ€™m just going through the motions. Just existing. Just doing what is expected, and achieving. Sounds typical, right? I have reached all the typical milestones that someone in their mid-twenties would achieve. My thinking is â€œis there more to do?â€ I would rather just fast-forward to the end and die. Why wait to experience this feeling?

My family will be okay. It would suck for them temporarily, but Iâ€™m okay with that. They have been okay with a lot of things that were not okay and hurtful. They will get through it. I feel as if itâ€™s the best decision for me. If i decided to carry it out sooner than later I will be prepared to do so. I feel happiness at the thought.
