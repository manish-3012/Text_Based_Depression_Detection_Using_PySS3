I have no idea what's going on... I think I should be deadThe night before last, I posted here. The weird guy with the grape cocktail of drugs. That night, I only drank half of it, got tired, feared throwing it all up, I just went to sleep. I thought, "maybe that was enough." Woke up, my liver felt uncomfortable. I will live another day, as I promised my ex girlfriend. 

Last night, I watched LeBron get defeated. My ex said she would talk to me "later" and she didn't message me yesterday. Forgetting my new gmail password, I signed out, cutting all contact I had with her. 

When I woke up approximately 4 pm, I wasn't even sure if I was alive or dead. No one was home... Someone is always home by 5. But my parents were not. They just got here at 6 which never happens. My biggest fear is that they know I tried to kill myself, or that I blacked out and threw up and someone cleaned up. I haven't seen another human being today, so I don't know 100% if this is real. Maybe it just hasn't kicked in yet 

edit: No one knows. I think. I watched some tv with my brother. It was kinda nice. He didn't mention anything. I thought my last real words to him would be "everyone loses" in response to what happened with the Championship game last night. But obviously I woke up, and we watched a couple episodes of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. I even wrote out a will on this computer here, giving everything to my brother, except my xbox 1 which I asked to be gifted to my good friend for his 21st birthday next month. And I told my cousin to be a great dad to his baby boy, whom I love dearly and wish I could give some important things to, but I think he is well taken care of already.
