I have to live with my abusers for the rest of my "life"I'm only 20, I am really ill with severe myalgic encephalomyelitis, currently in a nursing home. I cannot do almost anything on my own at this point I cannot walk, I cannot tolerate light and sound,  I need help to eat and drink. My existence is just endless trauma misery and torture. I am genuinely starting to believe I'm in hell, that at some point I have died and this is the afterlife. I cannot figure out any other reason to why this is happening to me.  My options are 1. Nursing home where I'm at now living with the abusive nurses. option 2. Moving back in with my rapist "father".  At this point I dont know anymore which one of them is the worse option. 
I pray every single day somebody would just come and save me and to get me the fuck out of this place, I'm too scared to attempt suicide because would likely fail with the nurses around 24/7. if I try to hang myself the will find me. If i stop eating and drinking they will just force me to be tube fed again. But I have no reason to keep on going I have no family, no one who would care about me, I have to live with abusers and with this horrible disease for the rest of my miserable existence.
