I donâ€™t know what to doAs a forewarning, I donâ€™t want to turn this into a pity party. I really donâ€™t want blind comfort and would greatly appreciate true advice. As an additional disclaimer, Iâ€™m not too sure how Reddit works. Previously, I never would have considered posting on a forum such as this, but I feel as if Iâ€™ve run out of options and had recalled that this forum had been an outlet for an old friend of mine. Anyways, I understand if no one reads through my whole rant; I acknowledge that I write a lot and it can be a drag to read through it all. However, I would greatly appreciate it if at least a handful of you are willing to give me any degree of advice.

So....about me. Long story short, Iâ€™m a female high school student who is on track to getting an AA degree by next year, yet still simultaneously failing a good majority of my classes. Iâ€™ve never had more than a handful of friends at a time, nor have they been the kindest of people. Iâ€™ve been a cutter since middle school, and have only just recently begun to cut back on doing so. Iâ€™ve also been psychologically abused by previous boyfriends, as well as blackmailed into performing acts I was vehemently opposed to. As a result of rumors and pictures of me being released that expose me in an unconsentual and indecent manner, I made the decision to change schools in hope of a new beginning elsewhere. Unfortunately, my optimism failed me and I found myself in yet another uncomfortable situation. This time, I found myself unbelievably alone and without a support group to rely on. To make matters worse, I became paranoid of neglect and would cling onto anyone who got relatively close to me. Granted, it wasnâ€™t the same as before, but abandonment seemed to sting even more than mockery. After two years of social isolation, I received a proposal to attend another school with greater prestige, which I graciously accepted.

This leaves me where I am today. Although it is true that I have many friends, I have none that I can truly rely on. My boyfriend, who I care for deeply, is unintentionally abusive and I donâ€™t want to leave himâ€“for not only my sake, but his own. My grades are suffering not because of a lack of intelligence but rather a lack of will.

I have previously attempted suicide, but was saved by my own fear combined with the concern of a previous boyfriend. Although I had hoped my urges would go away with time, they have yet to do so and I honestly donâ€™t think I want to put up with them anymore. Iâ€™m really trying to keep my head above water, but Iâ€™m not even sure if itâ€™s worth the effort it requires. Iâ€™ve been on the verge of suicide yet again for the past week or so and I think this is my last attempt at closure or recovery or whatever I need.

In closing, Iâ€™m not even sure where to go from this point. Suicide seems like the easy way out, but I donâ€™t feel as if thereâ€™s any other option beyond that to fixing my issues. Iâ€™m fairly open to suggestions, so I would greatly appreciate any input. Thank you.
