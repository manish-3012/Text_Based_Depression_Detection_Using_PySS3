Itâ€™s so hard to keep goingHolding on to all these terrible feelings. I want to keep going so I donâ€™t hurt anyone else but I really wish I could stop living. I just donâ€™t really know what to do and I have no one to talk to where I am. Iâ€™m at work at the moment just barely keeping it together. I just wish I was I wasnâ€™t alive.
