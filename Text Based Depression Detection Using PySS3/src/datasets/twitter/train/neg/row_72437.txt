Does anyone else put off their suicide for this reason?Over the last few months Iâ€™ve decided that despite all the improvements Iâ€™ve made to my life, nothing is really going to change for me, so Iâ€™m going to kill myself come July.

So why July as opposed to right now? Because I donâ€™t want anyone blaming themselves for problems Iâ€™ve had since I was 11. 

Recently I had a large argument with some friends, another friend of mine who I was supposed to be close with since I was a child has been progressively making less and less effort with me, my parents are going through a really bad rough patch, and the woman Iâ€™ve been dating the last 2 months has moved away for work for 2 months and just ghosted me this week. Honestly, I donâ€™t particularly care about these events themselves. If people donâ€™t want me in their life, thatâ€™s their loss. 
Iâ€™d honestly just feel awful if people blamed themselves for what Iâ€™m going to do myself. So whenever Iâ€™m feeling like killing myself and something like an argument or whatever happens, I usually decide x amount of time means theyâ€™ll just forget about what happened and not end up thinking something like â€œoh did me doing that play a part in what he didâ€?

I donâ€™t get why people blame themselves anyway for a decision Iâ€™m making of my own accord. But Iâ€™d rather it if people didnâ€™t blame themselves so I want to give them less reason to.
