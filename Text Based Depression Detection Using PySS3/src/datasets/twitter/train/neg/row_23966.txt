My depression has made me become such a good liar. Itâ€™s frightening.When you tell everyone youâ€™re okay but youâ€™re actually not. 

You promise them you wonâ€™t do something, but your mind tells you otherwise. 

Itâ€™s hurts being under such intense emotional pain. 

Itâ€™s hard seeming like youâ€™re the happiest person out there and fully functioning but know deep down inside while youâ€™re alone that youâ€™re so fucking unhappy. So fucking unhappy.
