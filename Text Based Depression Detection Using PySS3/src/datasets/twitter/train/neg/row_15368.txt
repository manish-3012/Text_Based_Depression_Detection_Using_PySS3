Just sad not suicidalSo my boyfriend and I wanted to move together and marry but I don't have enough family and my family abuses me lots so it seems like It wont happen, soon. Anyway I even starting to think I am wasting his time but oh well. Yesterday he sent me couple of messages saying that if I am not serious about our relationship and things and that he is upset about it and even said that he hates me. All messages were sent in different times. Recently he made fake acc to spy on me check if I cheat on him or no and seems anxious if we care about each other or no. What to do? I feel like being alone. It seeems like i make him miserable and I can't get out of my problems. I really want him and need him but I don't want to be selfish. Do you think he ghosted me? His last message was sent at 3 a.m and now it's 3 p.m and he hasn't talked. I am so sad. I just want to hug him and fall asleep on his chest. What to do
