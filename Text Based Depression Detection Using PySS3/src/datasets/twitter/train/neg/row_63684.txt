I attempted suicideI obviously failed and that bullshit about suicidal people feeling horrible and wanting to live and realizing it is a mistake isnâ€™t true I felt free and liberated. It was honestly the best I have felt in a long time thinking that the pain was over even though I was in a lot of physical pain only for me to wake up in the morning alive. I am extremely disappointed and will honestly probably try a different method soon
