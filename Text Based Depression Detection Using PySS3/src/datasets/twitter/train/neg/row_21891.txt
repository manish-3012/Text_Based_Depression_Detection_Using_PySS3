What are the benefits of being alive?I live in my car my family doesnâ€™t want me around and if they do itâ€™s what money can I bring and the answer is never enough Iâ€™ve been pushed aside as I put other people first my whole life and when they get what they want Iâ€™m just thrown away like yesterdayâ€™s trash I donâ€™t want kids or a wife just is not worth it and have no interest Iâ€™m considering suicide as a viable option I do have severe depression and anxiety I canâ€™t get 1-on-1 therapy because itâ€™s â€œcase by caseâ€ where my doctor is so I just get to think about it all and when my family doesnâ€™t want me around anymore because I to â€œangryâ€ due to depression and the brain damage I might have I just donâ€™t know if itâ€™s worth it all anymore 

Sorry for the rambling and the post
