16m. Should I destroy myself to avoid destroying my family?Hi reddit.  Some background:  I'm 16 and a junior in high school.  For the first two years, I kept very good grades.  But this year, through a combination of stress, severe ADD, and inability I've more or less annihilated any chance of scholarships or getting into a good college.  I have no desire to waste the college money my parents have put forth.

My parents are married, but my father has never really been in my life.  Just today I was in a concert that we've practiced months for, but my dad decided not to come and he didn't ask me about it when I got back. This kind of detachment has been present with him my whole life.

 My mother might have loved me, but my recent (in)action to fix my life have only driven her further away, and she is even more wrathful and depressed because of me.

Additionaly, I have no close friends as I am very awkward and withdrawn, and I can't recall even being invited to "hang out" with anyone since middle school.

I had about a year long relationship with my girlfriend, who I still love dearly, but I kept this secret from most everyone as she and her parents are atheists, and I feared my parents reaction.  Last weekend I broke things off, though, because I've been under so much stress that it overtakes her whenever we're together, which is profoundly unfair to her.

I've witnessed my parents marriage go from stagnant to deteriorating over the last few months, and almost guarantee it is a product of the stress I have brought them.  So my question is this: Should I commit suicide to avoid hurting my family further, or if not, what other alternative is there?  
Regardless of the answer, if you could be somewhat detailed so I can minimize the impact of my decision on others, I would be very grateful.
