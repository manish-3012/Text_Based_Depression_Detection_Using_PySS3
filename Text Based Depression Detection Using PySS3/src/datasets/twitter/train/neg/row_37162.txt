Abused. Botched. Suicidal.Was sexually abused by a family friend from the age 14-18. Fought hard to overcome my depression and ptsd. I recovered and became the strongest and happiest Iâ€™ve ever been. I decided to do a cosmetic procedure for myself and was badly botched. I donâ€™t even look like myself and I have a deforming scar in the center of my face. I lost my job and moved home with my parents. For me, this pain is way more difficult to get over than being abused. Now Iâ€™m wearing the trauma on my face for everybody to see. At least before I could put on a happy face and pretend like everything is okay. I could even have fun. Now I spend all my time in bed crying and thinking about suicide. Iâ€™m terrified. I feel worthless.
