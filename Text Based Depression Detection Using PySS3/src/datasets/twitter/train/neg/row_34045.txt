My anxiety will be the reason for killing myself. Either with a gun or liver failure.My parents used to be alcoholics and kinda fucked my childhood. Recently I became old enough to drink and I very quickly realized why they did it. Cause I do it regularly now. It's basically a quick and easy cure for anxiety. At least for a few hours. But nothing else has ever even come close to having that effect.

Anxiety has consistently fucked me since way too young and now after 20 years I'm getting regular breaks from it, that I didn't even know were possible. I feel like I've opened a door I can't close again.
