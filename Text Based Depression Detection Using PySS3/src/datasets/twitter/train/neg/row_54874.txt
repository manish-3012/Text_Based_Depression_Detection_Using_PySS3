I don't know how to let go of the past and it's ruining my present and killing my future.I'm not very good with loss,i lost my father when i was 9,whom i was very close to and not long after that my life spiralled into hell as my mother fell into hard drugs. 

But i never get too sad about that,somedays i am a little bummed about it but not often and not too badly. 

However,i am a complete mess with relationship loss,or i was. Three years ago i had the best relationship of my life,i was really happy and felt loved and important, something i hadn't felt in a long time and maybe it's the reason i'm still alive because i know this feeling exists. 

But as you can probably guess,things didn't work out,the first year i was a broken mess,I've hand a few more relationships since but i haven't had any other bad break up since that particular one. I feel that's because i haven't loved anyone as much as that one relationship or that i've distanced myself emotionally. 

I've dropped high school when i was 16,now i'm 23 and i'm trying to finish it,they say it could take around 2 years before i enter college. It feels like i'm running out of time,i don't want to enter college and not be able to join any circle because i'm too old. 

To be fair i feel like i'm also not yet good enough in what i want to study to be entering college yet but knowing me, I know i'll think that too when i'll be done with high school too. 

3 years later and i still can't let go of things that are over,it makes my present pretty sad to a point where i don't even want a future. 

After all,what is the future of someone who's only talent are video games and speaking English.
