I'm suicidal everyday, but today the impulse is stronger than usual...I'm bipolar scizoaffective. Despite all the drugs I'm taking and the years of psychotherapy, I think about suicide everyday. I've learned to make it a passive thought and just ignore it. However, on some days, there's an impulse behind it, and what to do it. My usual plan is to overdose on my medication. I have an attempt under my belt and failed. As a result, psychiatrist has deemed me dangerous for almost two years now and has asked the pharmacy to refill 7 days at a time of medication so I wouldn't have too much with me.

I have developed coping techniques such as talking walks, calling the distress centre and dialing 911. I don't want to go to the hospital again and be loading with tons of olanzepine and clonazepam and turned into a zombie. However, my most effective coping technique is talking to people. My family don't really understand it and I don't talk to them about it. My friends are hard to reach, especially today, not sure why.

Not sure why impulse is strong today, my symptoms have been a bit stronger than usual. Lots of hallucinations and I've been dissociating painfully regularly throughout the day. I have the gut feeling that I'm going to enter bipolar depression pretty soon and it's going to hit me like a rock any time now.

My life itself isn't perfect, but it's fine. I have everything one would need to live a normal life and whatever is going wrong already has a solution in the works. 

I don't know why I'm so suicidal today, it seems to just have come out of nowhere. I want to end my suffering that has tortured me since my onset ten years ago. Usually, I feel like I'm strong enough to cope, but not today. My drugs are waiting for me.
