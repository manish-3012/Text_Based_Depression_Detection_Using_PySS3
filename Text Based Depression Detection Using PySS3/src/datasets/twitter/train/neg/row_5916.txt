I wouldn't want to do this but suicide is the only solutionIâ€™m 21 y/o male have been struggled with several mental disorders adhd, trichotillomania, anxiety and major depression. I tried everthing I went therapy I took medicines nothing is helpful for me. I have been very bad childhood, mentally abused by parents still have trouble with them. They donâ€™t like me and I have always be a burden to them. I started to think about suicide 5 years ago when I was 16 but I didnâ€™t attempt because I didnâ€™t have courage to do that and I always had a hope to get better but nothing get solved and I swear everything gets worst. I have no other option I wish I had stable mental health I wish I get treated. I have to do this otherwise me and people around me will get more pain.
