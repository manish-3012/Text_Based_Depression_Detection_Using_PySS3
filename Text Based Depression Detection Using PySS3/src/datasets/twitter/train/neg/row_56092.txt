ConsequencesUntil the day I can fully go through with my suicide and hopefully succeed, I will be torturing myself. Im going to cut until my arms until they are raw, Limit my food intake so I can feel the physical consequences again. Isolate myself so I can feel the loneliness just like I deserve. I don't deserve friends. Especially after today and what I did. everyone's talking and it's obvious they all don't like me. So why am I here? It's bad enough I'm a loser with no friends in the real world, now all my online friends hate me. I can't even have friends online which Is sad enough. I'm obsessing over cutting, i haven't cut in so long and I'm ready to ruin myself again.
