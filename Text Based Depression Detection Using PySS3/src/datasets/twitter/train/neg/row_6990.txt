Please don't. We care.  Not joking, I do.  If I do, other people do.  A permanent solution to temporary problems is selling yourself short.  I've been through ugly times and can say the thought's crossed my mind.  I'm happy I stuck it through because today I'm a happy camper and life is going well.  I know it will get shitty again, but that provides the context to appreciate what I have now.

The choice is yours, I hope you choose life, love, and new beginnings.
