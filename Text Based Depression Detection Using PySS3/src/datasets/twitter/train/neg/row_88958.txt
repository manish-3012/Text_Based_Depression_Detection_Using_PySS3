I Want to Kill Myself, What's NewI just can't be fucked to live anymore. 

Last year I built my life up from rock bottom after I left college. I got a good job, made friends, got on the road, I was happy with myself.

I hit my head at Christmas and have been recovering since. I cant do my job because my head is fucked still and even when I'm feeling better It'll find a way to shoot down that positivity. 

I just cant be arsed to work my way back up to happiness again, I don't reckon I'll ever be well enough to go back to my job because of how precise Ill need to be. Im going to struggle financially as I'm too ill to work but not disabled so I cant get any help with that side of things.

What is the fucking point anymore, I'm hanging on by scraps just for my family who are there for me, who feel helpless because nothing they can say and do will reverse time and I feel guilty for that.
