I can't functionIt took me over 3 hours to do a small 30 minute assignment for my class. I had to read a short story that was 11 pages long, and I had to write a one paragraph response to it. This is fucking ridiculous. I don't understand why I can't focus on anything. I think that I am just a huge fucking idiot that can't function in society because in every single way imaginable, I am slow compared to everyone else. I can't fucking think like anyone else. I am just left behind in every single regard, and I know that there isn't anyway that I can rectify it. I also forgot to mention that I remembered fucking none of the story once I was done. My response consisted of me criticizing the writer for not being able to keep my attention, but I know that it's only my fault. I am such a fucking broken mess.
