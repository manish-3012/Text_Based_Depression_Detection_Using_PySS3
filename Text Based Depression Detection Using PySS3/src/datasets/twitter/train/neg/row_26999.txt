Why can't I just kill myself?I have no fear in death, I find it very desirable as it will once and for all will take me out of all sufferings. You can't find better alternative, it's just eternal happiness.  
But I still not dead. I want to, but I can't make it. It's somewhat similar to me wanting to find any social contact whilst not doing anything to achieve that.  
Turns out, I am loser even if it's about being dead.  
That's very disappointing, because I don't even know what am I doing here, in this world, if everything I feel is pain or hate.
