I'm really tired of thisI wanna reach out I really do I really fucking do wanna get help but it's hard and I'm just giving up on trying to now at this point, I have gotten help in the past, I got anti depressants and a counselor but the meds didn't work and the counselors just left me not even saying that they were leaving, they just gave up on me I'm really that much of a burden am I. I'm tired I'm so tired mentally and physically I'm tired of being told to get help and that things get better. most of all I'm tired of being left and abandoned from people that I had the guts to talk about my problems to and then it gets thrown all back at me, I give up all my work was for nothing my dad doesn't even try to understand me he just says he does but in truth he doesn't and then says that everything's just in my head and that I'll get better. my mom hasn't tried to talk to me after my 1st suicide attempt. none of my relatives cared, I'm done with everything, I've been alone my whole life and had no one to talk to I've been groomed and been touched by one of my grandpa's friend and talked about it once and just was laughed at and haven't talked about it since. everyone gave up on me I guess it's time for me to do the same, I'm 14 everyone calls me mis except my family and I'm tired of life and been waiting for 6 years for everything to get better and nothing has it's just been getting worse. I'm a mess
