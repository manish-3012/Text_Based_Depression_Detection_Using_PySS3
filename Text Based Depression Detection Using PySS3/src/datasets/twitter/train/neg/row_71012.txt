14yo and heavily suicidalStarted at around 10, started really considering suicide at 12 and it's gotten worse since.

Currently in a situation where I am considering doing it every day and it's been like this for a few months.

I have never told anybody, IRL at least.

Do things really get better? My current age is said to be the best time of most people's lives and yet here I am miserable so I doubt it's going to get better with time.

I have absolutely 0 desire to continue living and I am basically wasting precious time, waiting to die.

What do I do?
