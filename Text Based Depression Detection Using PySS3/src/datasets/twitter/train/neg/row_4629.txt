Losing hope by the hourSo I am a bipolar 28 yr old inventory counter and my life has been turned upside down so fast.

Last week I got a writ of garnish for a credit card I haven't been able to pay on because I don't make much money. I get paid weekly and they wanna take 250 bucks a paycheck....my last 4 weeks paychecks combined were only 600. My rent is 200 a month which I have been able to work out before this writ came along. A couple days ago I came down with bronchitis. Coughing so much there is blood because my throat is so raw. Bruised ribs, no appetite..the works. Shark week started yesterday and will continue til the 4th. We are talking the debilitating curl up in a corner and sleep type. I work the 3rd through the 16th with no days off while in all of this pain. 

To top it all off I had to call the EMTs for my mom when I went to see her yesterday because she has been sick with the cold everyone has but her lips were blue. She is now in a coma and they don't know if/when she will ever be released. They told my dad had I not called them at that time, or had my dad drive her...she would have been dead. I had to call out at work tomorrow because I haven't healed enough to be any use at work. So I just lay, curled up in bed.

Ive barely been able to sleep for days so I don't even know if all of what I wanna say is in here...or why I am even doing this right now...I am just so overwhelmed.

Update: Mom is so puffy she can't even open her eyes when they do these tests every 12 hours to make sure her functions are still good. They are talking about dialysis. I still haven't gotten healthy enough to go see her...it's looking grim.
Thanks for the gold, whoever you are! Did not expect that.
