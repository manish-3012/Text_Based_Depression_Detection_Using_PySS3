The only reason Iâ€™m not dead yetThe only reason Iâ€™m not dead yet is because I have this fear that I will fail and become a vegetable and be even more burdensome on everyone I meet.  Yet every day I come closer to dating â€œfuck itâ€ and attempting yet again and just praying I donâ€™t screw it up like everything else.  Iâ€™m just so exhausted from constantly being battered by suicidal thoughts since I was like 8.  And that was before I had any trauma in my life.  
Iâ€™m just so tired.
