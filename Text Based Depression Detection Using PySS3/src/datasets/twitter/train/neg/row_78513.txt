Plain ole depressionI am to the point of just thinking everything and everyone is bullshit. Get on reddit and share an opinion: get told to eat a dick. Bitch about annoying patrons at work: get dogged by coworkers for complaining while shoving â€œpeople ainâ€™t that bad man come on stop being that wayâ€ down my throat. Fuck me. Express my transparent observation of the world around me: get told by my brothers Iâ€™m a negative fuckhead. Iâ€™m miserable in a relationship with someone that coddles me. Iâ€™m like literally fuckkng it up out of pure selfishness. I am deeply sensitive about my failure as a boyfriend in such an important relationship. Sheâ€™s 7 months pregnant and I still wish she had an early abortion. I have the easiest life ever and I hate it. I have body dysmorphia and dwell on my body 12 hours a day even tho Iâ€™m only 30 lbs over weight it would take 3 months in a gym to over correct any physical issues but Iâ€™m stuck to the fuckin floor just dis satisfied with everything. Like. I look around and see the system. I see the games we play. Iâ€™m aware itâ€™s all lights and clockwork. Thereâ€™s nothing special about any of this shit. Like emotionally Iâ€™m dead so please donâ€™t mistake this tone for me over here crying these words out. They are bland and dull. Iâ€™m just shrugging around until I have a flip out I guess. Anyways. Hey.
