Please help me.I posted here a lot of times asking a lot of questions and looking for someone to talk to, either someone who overcame depression or someone whoâ€™s still going through it. Iâ€™ve been depressed for 5months and in that short period of time I know, itâ€™s getting worst. I canâ€™t feel anything, I feel detached to everyone and everything (even my mom and my sister). 

But these past 2 weeks, I managed to go outside of my room (I literally isolated myself, not talking to EVERYONE, I only showered 3x in 1month, my sister brings me food so I can eat because I canâ€™t go outside) and I managed to go outside our house and talk to some of my friends who knew whatâ€™s going on with me (and everyone thinks Iâ€™m becoming insane) 

And thereâ€™s this one â€œfriendâ€ of mine, I donâ€™t know if sheâ€™s concern or sheâ€™s making fun of me and thinks that Iâ€™m only doing this because I want attention. She told me that if I really wanted to kill myself, I should do it tonight, and I will do it and wonâ€™t care about anything because I really wanted to kill myself.

Can someone explain this to me, because I really canâ€™t understand if sheâ€™s doing that to make me feel better or make me feel worse ðŸ˜” because right now, Iâ€™m thinking about doing it and comeback to my worst self since no one can understand what Iâ€™m going through ðŸ˜” I really need someone, anyone who can make me understand this. Please help me.

Iâ€™m sorry for my grammar, English is not my 1st language. Please help me.
