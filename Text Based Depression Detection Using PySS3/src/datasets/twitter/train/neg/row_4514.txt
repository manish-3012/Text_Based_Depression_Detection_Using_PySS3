Anyways. I think i'm gonna do it finally. I've been pushed off edge and i'm so tired. I've practiced and planned this. I have plans to do it this week hopefully. I wanna lay in my bed, tie something around my neck till i can't breathe, and "sleep." Obviously it wont be pleasant and will probably hurt, but it wont hurt as much as the mental pain i'm feeling, so i don't care. And yes I'll probably die before I "sleep," but i mean "sleep" in a metaphorical way. I'm so angry and sad and lonely, yet I feel empty. I've wasted my life and nobody cares about me. Im ready to end this pain.
