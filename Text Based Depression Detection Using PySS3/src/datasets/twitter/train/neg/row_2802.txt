What's the point?My parents hate me, and I probably was an accident child. Im failing half of my classes. The every kid i see at my high school hates me, and they openly say it. I have literally 0 friends. I dont want your sweet talk, I just want a reason for why not. Nobody will miss me, promise. I know I have a computer and all that, but like people say, happiness is not what you have. Fuck. I'm sorry if i never reply.
