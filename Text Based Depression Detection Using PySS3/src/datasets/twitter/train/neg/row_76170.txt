LoveIt started a few years ago... I felt bad, but it was OK, I thought I would get over this... but no, it returned, and every day, 3 years ago, I felt terrible... and it still feels terrible now, but in a different way, every day feels terrible because of this, and its killing me every day, and then I started having feelings of love for someone, which awoken all the feelings inside me that have been dead for years, and I hated it because they don't feel the same way about me... and its been like this for 5 months and I can't shift these feelings for this girl... And I hate it so much... and even over half a year ago, I felt suicidal because of how I am and she has made it even worse.. And it's pathetic really
