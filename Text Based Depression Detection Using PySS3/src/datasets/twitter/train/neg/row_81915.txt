I don't know what to do anymoreI'm gay. I can't accept myself for who I am. I resent that part of me and that resent piles up inside of me and makes me feel empty all the time. I tell everyone I'm bisexual as a cover up, but I know its a lie. I always feel incredibly lonely and empty inside, even when I'm with friends. I always think people don't like me and no matter how much I try, the thoughts never go away. I get attached way too quickly and I'm afraid people will leave me all the time. No matter how hard I try to calm myself down, I always anticipate the worst. Why does this happen? It's mental torment. I'll admit, I do have the occasional good day, but those are starting to come farther and farther apart. I'm stuck in this world and I don't want to be anymore. All I ever want to do is get high and sleep my life away. I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up, I can't keep living like this. I think I'll have this resentfulness until the day I die because, quite frankly, I hate not being normal. I can't do this anymore. If tonight is my last night on this Earth, so be it.
