Why can't I get fucked enough to not care about pulling the triggerEvery day is a blur. Every night is so painful. I hate seeing people who used to be my friends. I hate that I can't text anyone I used to love. I hate that I have literally, actually literally, no one who will notice that I'm gone.

I've lost friends and been around those who have lost friends, way too often. People find out this terrible thing happened to someone they cared about. Everyone lost is celebrated for their life, and they should be. It just hurts to know that everyone I care about is so ephemeral, that I don't have any friends, and that no one will know I'm gone.

I've intentionally ruined all of my friendships. I have pushed everyone away. I don't want anyone to have to deal with this part of my life.

I'm so scared. I don't want to fuck it up. I don't want to survive or linger. I don't want to lie on the floor gasping for air, suffocating in my own blood while half my brain is splattered on the wall. I want to have the strength to pull the trigger. It's why I bought the gun. Not for self defense, except in the sense that I need to protect myself and everyone else from how toxic and horrible I've become.

I've made my arrangements. It was pretty complicated due to my situation. I want it to help the people I cared about. I want to leave something behind that might make a difference. I just don't want to be here for that part.

Please give me the strength to just get it over with. I'm not scared of being dead, I'm just scared of fucking it up
