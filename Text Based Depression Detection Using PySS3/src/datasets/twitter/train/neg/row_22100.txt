Things are getting bad againMy (23f) depression is starting to take over my life again. I am so beaten down from the abusive relationship that I just left, and I have resorted to doing drugs to numb my pain. I tried to talk to my parents for help and my dad said â€œwhat the fuck do you want us to do, put you in a psych ward?â€ And I told my mom and she just said â€œwell I didnâ€™t do anything wrong so donâ€™t treat me like that.â€ I just wanted someone to talk to. I canâ€™t handle this pain and Iâ€™m starting to wonder if I deserve to feel this broken?
