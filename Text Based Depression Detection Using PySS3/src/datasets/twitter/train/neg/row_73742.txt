Everytime I see a photo of me / video, I wish I was never born.I don't know if it's just me, but everytime I see myself, I just want to kill myself.
I can't see how ugly I am, NOT looking at me, but once I do... man, I so fat and fucking ugly as hell.
I love my family. My brother don't deserve me, I'm just a waste of space and fatness. They don't deserve a ugly asshole like me.

I'm so sorry to even exist. I'm sorry. :')
