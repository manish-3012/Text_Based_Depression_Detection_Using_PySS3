i don't know why i bother anymorehey reddit,
ive always lurked on this site more than posted but i figured why not. im going to kill myself. i don't know quite when yet but i definitely have a plan. i lost my dad, my brother, and a close friend to suicide. in other words, it runs in my blood and mind basically constantly.
i'm failing school for the first time ever. ive never had to study or try, but i can't even pay attention or find the will to do homework anymore. i've had to retake my calculus class, and im going to fail it again. academics is the only thing ive been raised to be good at, the only thing ive ever been able to impress with. im not even in the top third of my class anymore, which im aware doesn't sound bad to many, but definitely to me.
im a lesbian. my mom hates me for it, ive lost my childhood best friend over it. my girlfriend is literally a perfect being, gorgeous, #1 in our class, empathetic and generous. im none of those things. im fat (indisputably) and lazy, and i can tell that she's losing interest. people have even pointed out to my face that she deserves better. it's true.
i cope with humor, and no one really knows how fucking close i am to dying. i almost took my entire bottle of lexapro last night, but upon further investigation i realized that ssris wont really kill you. so instead i just laid in my bed, neglecting my studies, and stared at a wall until 6:30 am. i almost relapsed into the self harm i'd steered clear of for an entire month, the only reason i didn't is because the blade wasn't in sight and i couldn't find the energy to move.
i don't have a single reason to go on. i need one, but the petty reasons i can find are just hollow words. i don't know what to do.
