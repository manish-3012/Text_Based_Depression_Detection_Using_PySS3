theres no hopetheres no way i could ever have a happy and healthy life. im ugly, im mentally ill, and im closeted. i will never be happy in my body. i will never see me the way i want to see myself. my boyfriend will leave me and ill end up with no one. he said he wouldnt fuck me if i were a guy and he told me hes bisexual. i very likely have a brain tumor so whether im suicidal or not ill still be dead in 5 years minimum so whats the point in living it out. im tired
