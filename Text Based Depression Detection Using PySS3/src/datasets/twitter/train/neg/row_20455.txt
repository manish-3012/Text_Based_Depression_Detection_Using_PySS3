im a complete failure and i dont deserve any more chancesi am fucking pathetic.  i am failing college for the third fucking time.  i am unable to get out of bed on a consistent basis, bc i cant fucking get shit done when i need to, nor can i fall asleep at reasonable hours.  so fuck me and fuck me for not growing the fuck up and being normal. ive had depression for 6 years or so and i havent learned much.


i dont deserve any more opportunities. and i never deserved the ones i had anyways.  i wish i could stay alive but not be a burden on my family. i am the oldest child in my family so i will ruin the lives of my siblings but i guess id do that anyways, with all the disappoints i cause  yearly.

dont feel sorry for me. im a piece of shit spoiled loser who cant do anything but lie around and feel sorry for myself.  i dont have insurmountable problems esp. compared to others posting here, but i never asked for an easy life and i never promised to work hard to deserve it.  

p.s. im fat and ugly, so im not a high priority for rescuing.  also i was once told that i was smart/had an above average iq, but ive realized that ei, emotional intelligence, is way more important and that i dont have much.

there's only one thing i know for sure in life and it's something hemingway said: Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.
