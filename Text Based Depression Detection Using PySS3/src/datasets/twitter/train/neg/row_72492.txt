Don't know how much longer I can go on.I'm such a failure. I'm so exhausted being here. Every day, a new disappointment, a new source of pain. I live with extreme feelings of guilt, shame, and worthless every second I am awake. I'm on so many meds I'm probably 60% medication. I don't think things will ever get better. I'm not able to go to the hospital. In the back of my mind, the idea of suicide is so comforting. It would be so easy. I don't want to be helped by the medical establishment or my friends or my family (what little of them I have). I can't bear to be even more of a worthless burden than I already am. I just don't know what to do. I can't go on like this. Stagnating. I'm a walking, breathing corpse. I want to live, but not like this. I want a re-do. I want to be someone else. I want to leave my failures, guilt, shame, depression, everything all behind.

I used to talk to my friends when I felt this way. Slowly, I drove everybody away through a combination of overtalking, saying how I really feel (this is the big one, nobody really gives a shit and it's just annoying to them), and being too clingy and concerned about being abandoned. Not to mention my habits of isolating and assuming people hate me, which leads to them ACTUALLY hating me. Nobody wants to be around someone like me, who has their flame extinguished. Who is 2 words away from full-on sobbing. From someone who has nothing but bad news, negativity.

Quick edit to say I'm not planning on committing suicide today, tomorrow, or even the next day. I'm not there yet. But I do feel like my life is coming to an end shortly. I can't see myself celebrating another birthday.
