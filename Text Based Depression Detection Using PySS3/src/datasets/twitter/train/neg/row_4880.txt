Final Post on Here (Hopefully)Not that I'm necessarily killing myself, but either things will get better or I'll be gone. I doubt any of you will find out either way. I guess this is my form of a suicide note. Goodbye everyone. On the off chance that I do kill myself here's a message to everyone who knew me. I'm sorry to my parents for giving you seventeen years of disappointment. To my friends, I'm sorry that I wasn't strong enough to live, and I'm sorry you won't be able to try my Christmas cookies. To the one person I want to read this, to you I am truly sorry about everything I put you through. I hope that you'll find someone you can enjoy life with and I hope you put more consideration into the things you do. Please don't be sad. I'm in a better place now. Finally, to everyone reading this post: Goodbye
