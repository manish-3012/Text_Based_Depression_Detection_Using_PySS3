I don't have a lifeThe person I used to think of as my best friend doesn't give a fuck about me anymore. I have lost so many friends the last years, simply because I've become boring as hell. I avoid going to school, because it hurts so much to hear about how everybody had the time of their life while I sat in front of the computer jerking off and binge watching south park. I've tried asking to join parties, but it is so obvious that they simply accept to be polite. I seriously can't see how things will get better, I've been this way my entire life, things won't change. The only reason I'm still here is because I'm to much of a pussy to take my own life.

I feel sorry to post this, it feels like I'm only whining, but i need to tell someone and there is nobody in real life that I can talk to.
