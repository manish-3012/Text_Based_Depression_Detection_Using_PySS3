End of the line - black male 29Graduated top of my class, still living in poverty.

Making minimum wage in most states. Can't find a decent job.

Can't pay bills

No friends, intimate relationships, not much family

Can't afford depression treatment, no healthcare, or money for meds

No kind of fun or personal life.

Just spent Thanksgiving alone.

I don't see why suicide isn't a legit choice for me.

I did everything right and my life turned out to be shitty.

I don't know what to do
