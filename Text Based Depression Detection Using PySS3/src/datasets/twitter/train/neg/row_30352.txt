Spamming RefreshI keep refreshing my reddit hoping someone would message me or comment, Only one guy actually tries to help me but he is so busy with his friends/life that I don't want to bother him anymore.  I am depressed and punish myself for ruining my family's lives.  Please I want someone who will actually talk to me, not message me once a day or post "message me" and then never reply.  Please
