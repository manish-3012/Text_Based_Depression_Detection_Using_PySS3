One of my closest friends wants to kill herself this june... I don't know what to say or do to if not stop it at least postpone the date so she can see things do get better.

/SW I really need your help with things that help someone realize that things do get better...

My friend suffers from two types of schizofrenia, as well as paranoia and trichotillomania... she also has always doubted her beauty and I feel that those combined along with school stress (taking several college classes as a highschool freshman) and her lower economic level (her parents working in "lower end jobs") has gotten to her and does not stop building up as each day passes...

In the past I've made attempts to try and talk with her and see what caused what, conversations could last from hours to days but they would always end up with her telling me to leave her alone because she didnt want me to be hurt...

I as well as many others love this girl and do not want anything bad to happen to her, we don't want her to lose her life or give up on everything, not when it can get better...

/SW... what do?
