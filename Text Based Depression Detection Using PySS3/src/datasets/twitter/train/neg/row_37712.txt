I can't live normallyI have the horribly naive life goal of knowing everything. I want to know every person and every ounce of information that exists.

Before, I could distract myself. But as I get older, I have lost interest in things like Video Games and TV or Videos. The only thing I'm truly passionate about is music. I want to be the greatest musician to ever live. I want to be the greatest person to ever live. I'm an idiot. I preach the death of ignorance but I am ignorant in saying that  I am not ignorant. 

It's stupid shit like that that just makes me want to fucking die. There is never an answer to anything. I feel like anyone who claims to have an answer to something is just too naive to come up with another question. There is never a finite end. Even me saying that there is never an answer completely contradicts itself! It just goes on and on and on and on forever.

I'm 17, I get that I'm very young. I get that I have my whole life ahead of me and all that bullshit. But I just can't live with the fact that I can't possibly achieve my life's goal. 

And now, I thought that maybe I could find happiness through love. And I thought I loved someone but it all came crashing down around me. And I'm sick and fucking tired of people telling me that it gets better. I KNOW it gets better! I don't want it to get better! It only gets better because you grow to ignore it over time. But my entire philosophy revolves around the opposite sentiment.

I know how I felt in the moment, I know how happy I was and I know that that is gone. And regardless of the fact that I will be happy again, I will never have those moments back. I've always even thought that the best times were underwhelming. When I have to wait so long and suffer so much for a tiny pay off, it just doesn't seem worth it anymore.
