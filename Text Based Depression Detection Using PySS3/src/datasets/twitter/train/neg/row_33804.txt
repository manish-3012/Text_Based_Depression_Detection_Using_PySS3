Iâ€™ve realized what Iâ€™m feeling is real...Iâ€™ve always thought that what I was feeling wasnâ€™t that bad, and that I would move on from it in a little while. Iâ€™m young anyway, and as they say, I have my â€œwhole life to live forâ€.

I wanted to believe that for so long, but at this point, I donâ€™t feel like going anymore. Iâ€™ve never felt so hopeless and lost, I just want to stop. Iâ€™m not the best at describing my feelings over a Reddit post... but all I know is Iâ€™m about to give up
