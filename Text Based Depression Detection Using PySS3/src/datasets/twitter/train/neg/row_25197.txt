Would I be missed? [RANT]Sometimes I feel like a basket case no one wants to deal with. Iâ€™m bisexual, I barely have a relationship with God, and I sing. And everybody hates my singing/voice. And Iâ€™d like nothing more than to be on stage singing my lungs out. But none of my dreams have come true. 

On another note. My friends never call me, unless I call them. My family doesnâ€™t call me unless I call them first. Iâ€™ve tried to kill my self twice and yet Iâ€™m still here. And sometimes I hate the fact that Iâ€™m still living. 

Part of me wonders if Iâ€™d even be missed. Nobody calls me unless they want something. I canâ€™t even find a good place to kill myself. I was gonna do it at home by then I realized if I killed myself here my parents wouldnâ€™t be able to sell this place like they talked about. 

Iâ€™m just wondering, would I even be missed? I donâ€™t think I would be. I know things would be a lot quieter without me around. Theyâ€™d probably save money from not putting me through school. And thatâ€™d be one less person on their insurance. And I donâ€™t think theyâ€™d want a bisexual as a son. Maybe I should just kill myself.
