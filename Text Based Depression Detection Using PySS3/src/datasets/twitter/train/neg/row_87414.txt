My batteries are low and is getting darkI'm just tired, I'm 23, I can't find a job, I had just find one but then covid started and I lose it, I can't finish college either because I don't have money to pay for it, without college without a job, I'm just depending on my mother to be able to eat, I'm tired of this, I'm trying, I'm really trying, but somehow everytime that I'm doing fine something happens and all goes to shit.
My father died of a heart attack 3 years ago because of that I started having a strong depression to this day, I live in a bad neighborhood with neighbors who put loud music every single night, police won't do anything, I just can't keep doing this.
I didn't ask to be born, I don't want to exist anymore
