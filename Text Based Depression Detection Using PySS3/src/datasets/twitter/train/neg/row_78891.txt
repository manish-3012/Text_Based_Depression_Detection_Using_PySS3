I want to die more than everMy mind is out of control. I feel utterly and completely trapped in it and cut off from the outside world, even when I'm out amongst it. I look in the mirror and I wonder why the pain doesn't show. I constantly think of my ex and how she moved on so quick and slept with three people within weeks of us breaking up after a five year relationship. I was a terrible boyfriend. I honestly tried but I cheated. I couldn't contain my emotions. Then I moved away to get sober and get better for our son and she started soaring when I was gone. I'm a drain on everyone I get close to and it is so hard for me to get close to anyone. I cant leave my bed now. I lost my job. I was clean 4 months but our relationship deteriorating has wrecked me. I constantly want to die. All day I went hiking with my dad and his gf and all I could think the whole time is should I get a gun or a rope. I'm too scared to even kill myself though. I went to the hospital two times and they kicked me out and referred me to outpatient. I reached out to family and they offered supporting words but nothing else. I'm a 26 year old man baby. I was diagnosed bipolar 2 and generalized anxiety with a substance abuse disorder. I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired. I did everything right, I did the meds, the excercise, the dieting, journaling, meditation, and i still lost everything. I cant even be a good father. All I can think about is how she moved on so quick and how I'll never fit in anywhere. I'd rather not exist.
