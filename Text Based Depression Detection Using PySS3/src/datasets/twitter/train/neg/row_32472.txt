overwhelmedeverything feels too overwhelming. i thought that i was finally getting rid of these thoughts but they've returned the second i missed a dose. i will forever be chained to these pills because without them i can't function. hell, they're not even prescribed yet they're doing me better than anything or anyone in my life. i have nobody to lean on im so lonely. i don't want to talk to anybody i hate everybody but is this my fault? everything is a mess and i can't seem to find order in things. i have no interest or motivation to stay alive. it's too much for me. i miss being numb. i miss not caring about anything. i want to find comfort in nothingness again.
