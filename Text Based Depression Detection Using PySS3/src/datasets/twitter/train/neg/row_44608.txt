I don't know how to keep goingHeres the thing. I have everything in my life that should make anyone happy for the rest of their life. I go to a private school, have loving family, big house, go on vacations all the time, have all the friends I want, and a girlfriend. Im just so tired, anxious, depressed, bored, and just cant keep going. Ive never tried suicide and i dont plan on it. I have no hobbies anymore due to me getting kicked off my lacrosse team. I JUST DONT KNOW. Ive been having many mental breakdowns and I just feel like a fuck up. I wont ever live up to the expectations set for me and that destroys me. I just cant stop the pain. None of my friends or family have picked up on what going through my head and i dont want them feeling bad for me. I have been getting shit grades and wont get into aa good college and i never have been a hard worker. This is turning into a rant and i wish it wasnt but i need to get my thoughts down. I just need someone to talk to or if someone else has been feeling the same way.
