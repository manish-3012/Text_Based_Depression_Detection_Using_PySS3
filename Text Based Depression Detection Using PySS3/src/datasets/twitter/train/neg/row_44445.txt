Hanging myself in an hourI've been needing to die for a long time now. I'm a hideous, socially retarded loser with zero friends and no sex life. The last time my life felt worth living was eleven years ago, when I was 12. My life has been non-stop pain ever since. I'm morbidly obese, I'm a nigger, I've been balding since middle school, I have an ugly face, I have a tiny penis that couldn't ever make anyone feel good, Im socially retarded and have no idea how to hold a conversation, and even when I do speak I have a severe stutter so I just look retarded no matter what I do. I'm supposed to travel by plane with my mom in an hour but I just drove to a deserted parking lot and texted her to go without me. A few weeks ago I bought a rope and tied a noose with it. She found it and threw it away but she doesn't know I immediately went and bought another one. In a few minutes Im driving home and hanging myself with it. I'm putting a trash bag over my head before I do, so even if the knot fails somehow I will suffocate within a few minutes. I can't wait to die. I can't wait to be free from the pain. Everything will be better when I die and I'll finally be happy. I'm just sorry I didn't do this a long time ago. I wanted a lot more from life but I humbly accept that I'm not good enough for any of it. The world isn't meant for people as shitty retarded and ugly as me. So it's time for me to leave now. I didn't choose to be born but I can choose when and how I die and that's a beautiful thing. The gift of death is all I need. Good-bye.
