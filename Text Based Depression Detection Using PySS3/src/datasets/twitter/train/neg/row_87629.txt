I want to cry, but there is family nearbyI want to die, but I'm not sure if I should even try

I want to kill myself as soon as it's possible, so nobody has to listen to me crying behind the curtains. 

Thinking enlistment in the army can help me kill myself, and not make it seem like it was anybody elses fault, except for mine.
