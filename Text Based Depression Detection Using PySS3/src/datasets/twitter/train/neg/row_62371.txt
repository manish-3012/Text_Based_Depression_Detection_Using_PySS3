Every time I get so closeEvery time I get the strength to put myself in the car grab my gun go far away from everything and everyone so far that I have no signal nothing and no one is around me or even close even to here the shit  I put the gun to my head close my eyes ask god to forgive me but I can never pull the trigger and I feel like less of a man everyday because of it I want to go to sleep so badly I want it all to end the pain the thoughts the nightmares the constant reminders the insults but I can never pull it all the way back i just want to be gone I can give more to Society as a bag of ashes to be placed in the dirt
