Depressed/ suicidal and I don't know whyI'm depressed and I don't have a real reason for it and I'm having suicidal thoughts but my life is honestly alright. And the main thing that's keeping me alive is that if I end it people are going to think I was selfish and I took what I had for granted. I'm talking all the AP classes I can and am on varsity lacrosse and CC and am artistically talented and can play the piano and the violin and but I am not passionate about any of these things. They exist more as chores to me. I do them because I have to not because I am passionate but because my parents are. I don't want people to think I just ended it despite being "so promising" or whatever the bullshit phrase is. 

No matter what I do it doesn't fulfill me at all. In my little free time that I have I usually just lay in bed listening to jazz and thinking about my own mortality. 

It makes me feel as though I'm greedy for wanting to die when there are people who would kill to be in my place.

Ps: fuck Asian parents they're assholes and Asian culture is shit and I hope all of Asia gets nuked by North Korea till there's nothing left

Pls: I know this is written terribly but I'm angry and I'm mostly using this to vent and I don't care what you have to say
