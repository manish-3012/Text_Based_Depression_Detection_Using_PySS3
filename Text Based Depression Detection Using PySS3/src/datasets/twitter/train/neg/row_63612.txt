So here I amI'm fighting myself right now. I don't know if I should just delete this post and walk away, and do it, or not. 

I can't do it now since my family is around and I don't want my brother and sister to see it. 

I'm in debt, I am struggling in college right now, I feel alienated by my family. I've lost the better part of the greatest relationship I've been in. I had to move home, I have no friends, I have... nothing.

I was doing fine but... it all just hit me, all at once.
