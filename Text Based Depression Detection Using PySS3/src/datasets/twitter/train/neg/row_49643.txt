Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m two people. I canâ€™t take this anymore. Itâ€™s time to take matters into my own hands.At the core of myself Iâ€™m so happy. I have a great family, great husband and great job. Around the outside, Iâ€™m falling apart. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore doing the same things. No matter what, it never seems to be good enough.
