I canâ€™t deal with losing my best friend, losing two of my other â€œfriendsâ€, and school and homeworkI have known my best friend for two years, letâ€™s call her Andrea. This year, I met some of her other friends and joined her friend group. I already knew two people. Andrea and one of my friends, â€œCrystalâ€. I joined the group and met everyone and everything was going well. Then, I came to terms with one of my long lost friends and we became friends again. Letâ€™s call him Floyd. We talked in person and on Instagram. One day, he found out about a really bad embarrassing thing I did. I thought we were friends again, but he blackmailed me. He forced me to tell Andrea and she was ok with it and understood. Then he said that wasnâ€™t enough and I had to tell all my friends in the friend group. I told my part of the story to some of them and then Floyd told them and blew it way out of proportion. He also teamed up with Crystal, who I thought I was friends with, to tell them what I â€œdid to himâ€ and how â€œtoxicâ€ I am. Turns out, we were friends before but she got mad at me because Iâ€™m â€œtoxicâ€ and never told me. She was acting all nice around me and didnâ€™t even tell me that sheâ€™s mad. They talked about me, blackmailed me, and then told my best friend bullshit. I texted Andrea and she said that sheâ€™s not going to be involved with me because Iâ€™m causing drama. I begged her to let me explain and she blocked me. I have talked her out of suicide several times and sheâ€™s scared of me now because of the bullshit Floyd and Crystal told her. I havenâ€™t talked to her in a few weeks, but Iâ€™m still freaked out about this whole thing. I made new friends, but I still miss her. And I canâ€™t stop wondering if my friends actually like me because of what happened with Crystal. Iâ€™m so stressed about school too. Iâ€™m in all AP classes and I have so much homework. I also have band practice for three hours after school almost every day and itâ€™s so hard to get everything done. I even have tons of homework on the weekend. I need a break and I canâ€™t even get one on the weekend. I just want to die, I bet Andrea, Crystal, and Floyd would be happy.
