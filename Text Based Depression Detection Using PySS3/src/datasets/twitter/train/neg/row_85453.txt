I don't want to keep on living, but I don't feel like I have any good reason to feel that wayLike, my life isn't total shit. I'm a somewhat poor college student but my family is supportive and would be willing to help me out if things tanked financially. I don't have that many close friends, but I'm an introvert who doesn't have much of a desire to go out and make more friends. But despite the fact that I'm meeting my basic needs, I still feel so depressed.

I just feel like life is almost entirely a painfully monotonous crawl towards death with the occasional exceptional good or bad experiences strewn along the path. I've got around a year of college left, and then it's off to be a wage slave for the rest of my life. Sure, I'll have some good times and some bad times along the way, but most of the time will be spent in dull, crushing monotony. We're all going to die anyway, so why not avoid the monotony and just get it over with now? 

But dying sounds pretty painful, whether it's by suicide or not. I can't get a gun and if I fail I would regret it. One of my previous roommates hung himself, and I don't want my current roommate and my family to go through what I had to go through. I doubt I could get my hands on any drugs that I could overdose on, plus a lot of deaths by overdose sound painful. Cutting, drowning, electrocution, jumping in front of a train or off a bridge sound really painful. Plus I don't want whoever finds my body to be traumatized, so it looks like I'm stuck living.

I feel like life is a drug that gives you extreme highs every once in a while, extreme lows once in a while, and is just kind of boring for most of the experience. Plus by the end of the day it'll kill you. I wouldn't do heroin myself, and I wouldn't get a baby hooked on crack. Why would I want to keep on living? I guess for the same reason a junkie keeps shooting up: I'm afraid of the comedown.
