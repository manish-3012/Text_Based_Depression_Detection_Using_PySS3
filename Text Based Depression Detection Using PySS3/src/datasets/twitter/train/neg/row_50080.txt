10 days.This is a bit of a follow up to one of my original posts, titled [april 1st](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5t2fmj/april_1st), I suggest reading it before reading this if you haven't. If you don't, that's fine, but I want people to hear me out.

I had set my date as April 1st back in January, but I wasn't really open about it until February. I've found many things/people that make me happy, but some days it seems like it just... isn't enough. My best friend has been calling me and talking to me until I pass out recently, because he doesn't want me to do anything.

I'm scared. I don't want to do anything on April 1st, but at the same time I really do. I have a fear of it not working, or regretting it halfway through. However, no one's really been too supportive in real life. Hell, I told my mom that I wanted to kill myself. You'd think that my own mother would try to her fourteen year old daughter, but nope. She told me to kill myself, because she's "Sick of hearing me go on about it".

She's given me enough reason to just end it at this point. According to her, I'm "not depressed", I'm just an "attention seeker". 

My mother has given me enough reason to do something on April 1st, but I'll look so stupid if it fails. And if I do kill myself, my siblings will be taken away from my family, but in reality my parents treat my siblings so fucking well.

I don't know where I'm going with this, I'm moreover venting. However, this shit has ten days to fix itself, or else I'm gone.
