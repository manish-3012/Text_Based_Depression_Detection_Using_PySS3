I don't want to talk about itThe first thing the people from the hotline say is to talk to a professional and to talk to the people close around me like my family and friends. But I don't want to do that. I really just want to not live anymore.

I feel like if I talk to them about it, they would convince me not to hurt myself. But thats what I want to do. I want to stop failing my classes, I want to stop my mom from getting mad at me, I want to  stop disappointing my friends. I just want it to stop.

Im tired of all this self-inflicted pain that Im causing my own actions. I am one lazy piece of shit, just a huge procrastinator. In the end I feel like i deserve to die. My parents make so many sacrifices for me and I dont even make it for them. Its like I dont even care. If action speaks louder than words than yeah I guess I dont care. And then I shouldnt talk about it and keep my mouth shut.
