I have to do it right this timeIf I survive, the few people i have in my life will disown me because I've tried 3 times before. They said they cant handle the drama. 

All I can think about all day is trying again but I'm a coward. I'm scared I'll fail and be all alone in life. But I'm so done. It's been so long; I don't even remember what happiness even feels like.
