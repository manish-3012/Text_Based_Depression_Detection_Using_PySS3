just need to get it off my chesti had a gun in my mouth last night; i was ready. i didn't, but to know that i was that close terrifies me. i have to quit drinking, but i don't know if i can. i won't go into details about why i am so upset lately, because i don't want people to connect the dots if there is anyone i know reading this. i just needed to tell someone.
