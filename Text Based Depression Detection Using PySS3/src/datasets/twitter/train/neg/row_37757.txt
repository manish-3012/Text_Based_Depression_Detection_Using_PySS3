Stuck in an existence I wish never came to be in the first placeI came from a high school in Silicon Valley, where my classmates were killing themselves left and right.
I've felt strong urges periodically but never did anything about them.

I decided to go all in on life, to pour everything I had in it in the hope that it would get better in time. In time the pain would go away and I would be happy.

When the pain lingered I kept telling myself the same thing: 'Just wait another year. Life can change so quickly, in a year your life will be way different. You might look back on this time a year from now shocked that you thought about suicide because life is so good for you now.' That change has never come. Sure my life has changed, but my desire to live has not. To make things even worse, I achieved a ton in the past several years, and I feel worse than ever. I accomplished several things that I thought would make me happy, would finally kick me out of the rut I was in. But the rut persists.

Many times since I first had a strong urge to kill myself seven years ago, including tonight, I've looked back on my life and realized that I should have just killed myself back then. Nothing got better, and to make matters worse, I made several other people's lives worse. I broke the hearts of three girlfriends, I left them and wrecked their lives for some time. They would not have gone through that pain if it wasn't for me.

I sincerely want to kill myself, but I won't because of what it would do to my family. I wish, so strongly sometimes, that I had never existed in the first place. The world would genuinely be a better place without me. So much fucking better. I'm stuck and I don't know what to do. Stuck in an existence I wish never came to be in the first place.
