I don't know how to deal with the thoughtsI am so sad, where I am having thoughts of 'wanting to die' but that's because I don't know how to deal with the sadness. 
My family put me under a 'stressful environment' for 'their happiness' I don't know where to go from there.
The only thing keeping me from doing so is a cat. t's just so fluffy and loving T nT why can't people be the same (loving wise)
