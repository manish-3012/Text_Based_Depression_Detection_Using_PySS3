I got firedI liked going to work because it was something to do other than listen to my brain. It's been a week and I haven't left my bed. I haven't showered. I can barely talk. Opening my mouth to talk just feels like I'm making noise. My friends and family are distant and short tempered with me.

I just want to sleep. All I hear is the broken record in my brain telling me to set myself on fire. Or hang myself. Or stab myself. My brain wants me dead in the most horrific and bloody ways possible. I'm so tired of it.
