Iâ€™m gone now, but just pretend Iâ€™m alive and you wonâ€™t miss meYou donâ€™t call or text or write or care while I am alive. I have always been alone. I will continue to be alone in death. Save your sadness and anger then, you have no interest now while I actively struggle. Itâ€™s ok. I know the lack of feeling you have for me while I live doesnâ€™t alchemize into extreme compassion and understanding when I die, itâ€™s just more empty words to make you feel better. The made-up â€œheartfeltâ€ posts you write will be creative fiction â€” you donâ€™t know me now and you wonâ€™t know me then. But those will be easier for you because you still wonâ€™t have to actually talk to me. To avoid â€œsadnessâ€, just pretend I am alive, somewhere in the world, and you can continue to feel nothing for me as you do now. 


(Iâ€™m not dying today, but needed to get this out)
