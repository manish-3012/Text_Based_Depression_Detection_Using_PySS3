Overdosed for the second timeI tried to kill myself last night and it didn't work. I keep feeling so terribly alone, like no one cares enough to notice my cries for help or notice that I'm not okay. Everyone at school kind of knows of my situation but they just don't care. If a pretty, popular girl tries to kill herself, she gets immediate love and people try to talk to her and help her.. when I do it, nobody  even tries to reach out to me. It makes me feel worse, like I'm undeserving of support.
 I want an escape. I need to leave my life, I need to be away from it all, I need to be free from judgement. I'm so, so desperate for a change.   
 
I've had dozens of gestures and several attempts over the past few years. I don't talk about it very much anymore, but I just desperately want real help, and It always seems so out of reach... I've been to 2 mental hospitals and both were extremely traumatizing experiences and I was abused to the point where I developed an eating disorder immediately after my last stay. I'm so scared... I want help. I need it, and I don't know how to get it. Therapy never worked (I've been to 7 or 8 different therapists now, and one of them dropped me after 3 years because I was so bad) and medication made everything 10x worse, in addition to the weight gain it caused. Nothing ever gets better when I'm on my own and I just want someone to care about me. I feel pathetic because I can't even kill myself right. I don't know what I did to deserve to be so alone, and the longer I'm alive, the less people I have. I'm a burden on them and they all are tired of me not being normal. I just want the pain to fucking stop. I want to stop feeling alone. I want my family to be able to be happy, and I'm holding them back.
