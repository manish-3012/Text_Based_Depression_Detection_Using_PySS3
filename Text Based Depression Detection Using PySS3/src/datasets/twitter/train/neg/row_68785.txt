I canâ€™t make it fucking stop!!!It used to only be when I drank too much, but it slowly crept into my everyday life. It feels almost normal now, I get myself to sleep with suicide fantasies. I know itâ€™s wrong but I feel most relaxed when I think of ways to take that trip. Iâ€™m in the military and Iâ€™m scared to reach out for help and lose the income I need to live.
