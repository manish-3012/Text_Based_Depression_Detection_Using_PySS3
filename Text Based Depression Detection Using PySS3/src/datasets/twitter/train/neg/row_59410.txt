Really messed up at the moment...asking for hugsUGH. 

I am so drunk.

How long can I go on like this? I am killing myself. My neighbor (the same one that had saved my life) said I DEFINITELY have a drinking problem...she has seen me through this last week and how I have been drinking. I have told her about my past history with alcohol and how I used to get drunk every day for 7 years.

Sigh, what is wrong with me??????????????????????

Eh.

Don't think I have a problem but I do need some hugs...feeling suicidal but not able to commit the act.

I need a hug.
