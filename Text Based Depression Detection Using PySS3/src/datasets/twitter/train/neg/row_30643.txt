Does not killing yourself after saying you will kill yourself mean you have no honor?So I am in a better place now, found reasons to live thanks to this place and some old friends. But one thing still bothers me. I said that I would kill myself, so if I donâ€™t, I am concerned that would be dishonorable if I donâ€™t keep my word.

I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s a way to get around that one. I said I would do something, and if I donâ€™t do that thing I have no honor, correct?
