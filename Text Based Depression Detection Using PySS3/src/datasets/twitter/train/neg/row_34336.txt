17 years of therapy and still strugglingHello internets. The basics: I'm 23 and have been in and out of therapy since I was 6 for suicidal actions. At this point going to therapy makes me feel more hopeless as I still wish every attempt had worked. My therapy now just focuses on talking to my family about how I feel so they can hospitalize me when things get bad. But I'm so tired of having every serious talk end with threats of hospitalization. And when I do get hospitalized I get more suicide plans from the other patients than actual help from doctors. 
I hate being a burden to those I know. They all think they can help, but after all these years I truly believe this is who I am. And the worst is I'm a super bubbly person so when I have had my serious attempts they are so caught off guard and feel guilty for missing signs. I want them to understand that they are helping and that they can't do anything to prevent it. Every day I am here is a struggle I do for those I love. But I want them to know that when I give up (again but successfully this time) that I am getting what I've always wanted. 
I wish getting help was helping. I wish I wanted to live. I wish I could get better. But I would take a loaded gun over a trip across the world, a paid off house, and all the happy memories I've had. I want my people to understand and let me go so I can stop suffering for them.
