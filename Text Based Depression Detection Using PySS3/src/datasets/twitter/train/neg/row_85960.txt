What else can I do?Before I begin....
This is a long post &amp; I hope you take the time to read this. I need help. 

I think Iâ€™m a very rational person. I understand the impact of suicide and how it will affect those who are connected to me. 

But, I am not feeling myself. I honestly believe I have peaked as a human. I hope writing this out to a community of strangers, may help find me some relief in the constant tightness I feel in my chest. Maybe there is someone out there who can relate with what Iâ€™m going through. 

Since Iâ€™ve hit my 30s, my life is starting to reflect my mistakes. Yesterday Iâ€™ve moved back in with my parents. 

There are no pictures of me of the last 6 years of my life. I lost a lot of confidence in myself. As a 32 year old female, I starting balding. I can see my scalp more and more each day. Even taking my showers makes me depressed. As I run my fingers through my hair, it just doesnâ€™t stop falling out. I donâ€™t want to go out anymore. I donâ€™t want to be in the sun without a hat. My hair loss has definitely wrecked my confidence. 

Iâ€™m trying to take my depression into my own hands. I exercise about 4-5 days a week. I can see a positive change in my body (even friends who havenâ€™t see me in awhile can tell). But at the end of the day, I just donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. I feel like I donâ€™t have anything to offer. I recklessly put myself in debt. Which has hindered my ability to buy a home of my own. I watch my friends buy their first homes and share their lives with their significant others. 

I have put up such a wall around myself. I havenâ€™t dated or had sex with anyone in over 5 years. I tell myself Iâ€™m okay with being by myself. But there is always going to be a emptiness. 

This may sound weird, but Iâ€™m oddly okay with wanting to end my life. Itâ€™s just how it will affect my family and friends that is keeping here. They will heal over time... but I canâ€™t put the fast forward button on that. 

Iâ€™m just tired of feeling this way. Tired of crying. Tired of being me. 

I am not religious. But Iâ€™m have tried looking for some sort of guidance through God. It has not been what I thought it would be. Would God speak to me? Would the tightness in my chest be lifted once I accepted God into my life?

What else can I do?
