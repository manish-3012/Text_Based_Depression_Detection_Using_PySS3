Why does nobody like meI've been pretty lonely my entire life, but after starting high school and my only friend going to a different school it's gotten really bad. I've had depression for like 6 years now, and I'm sure someday I'll finally end it all. Once I had already planned my suicide but then the world seemed to turn a bit in my favor so I didn't do it.

I'm very punctual and always do what I'm asked. But other people don't seem to do the same for me, which just ends up in me being disappointed, but I always pretend that everything is ok. Just like right now I hadn't seen my friend for over a week, and usually we meet on Fridays but she hung out with one of her other friends (she has a lot of friends and gets along with people which generally just makes me feel like I'm not good enough). And we had planned to spend the day together today, but now she says she doesn't feel like it. I get it, and I understand her and very much appreciate her honesty, since I was best friends with a fucking hateful liar for 8 years it feels nice to hear the truth.

But still, even on days when I feel like shit and don't feel like seeing anybody else, I always do what's planned because I'm afraid of disappointing other people. So what I'm saying is her cancelling our plans today made me have a mental breakdown and pretty much planned my suicide once again. 

And I just keep asking myself why people don't like me and obviously blame myself for it. I also have very strong social anxiety and basically stress every single day when someone even looks in my direction, since I am also overweight I feel like everyone is judging me and I will never find happiness, love or new friendships.

I just basically hate myself and blame myself for everything bad in my life and it never seems to go away. So, what's the point of living if I'm going to feel like shit most of the time?
