I took 60 pills again....HELPI hate. It. 

I donâ€™t want to hurt my brother by my death but I donâ€™t know how to find the light. 

Iâ€™m lost. 

Iâ€™m so ducking nauseous, my heart is beating erratically, I keep forgetting to breathe, and I keep on blacking out/getting very confused. 

Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll die from taking too many pills.
