Losing the fightAll I wanted was a friend. I'm 24 That's what's been running thru my mind for the last 8 years of my life.  All I wanted was a friend. That's all I asked for I try to talk to others yet I'm still stuck alone since June I've be completely alone living in my car abandoned by the rest of humanity. I drive around with the noose in the passenger seat waiting for the moment when I just don't wanna fight the good fight anymore I'm scar ridden all across my left side from years of watching the pain bleed out I've been abandoned people don't wanna deal with me just shows I'm nobody's favorite I want to die. The thought runs thru my head constantly since middle school been the the target of all the jokes the people who've tortured me for years are living successful lives while degrading mine. The ones who I thought I could trust destroyed me. Just this morning I was struck with another deadly blow. Over The last 3 months I've lost the 4 people closest to me from car accidents to overdoses. I've tried to die I've overdosed and been found a few times been in and out of psych wards. I want it to be my time.  I think its about time that I leave this world behind and enter the nothingness where ill see peace and tranquility for the first time in my existance
