Living for themFor majority of my life I have been dealing with mental health issues and it has taken a huge toll on me. Iâ€™ve gotten lots of help however I still do not want to be alive. I live for my family because it would devastate them if they lost me. Itâ€™s very frustrating to be in pain everyday just to keep others happy. I donâ€™t want to continue doing this.
