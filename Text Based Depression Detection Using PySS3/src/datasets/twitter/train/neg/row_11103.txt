stay tender // i want to diei am an alien on earth. sometimes flowers bloom in my throat and i can't find the words that will slip out under petals and tongue to cross the synaptic gap between me and the rest of the universe and  i feel trapped trapped in my own skin and i want to hurt, want to feel something real there is nothing you can do for me i need help and no one can provide it.

im dying im slowly rotting stuck in this passive state of death and i just want it to end i want everything to end
