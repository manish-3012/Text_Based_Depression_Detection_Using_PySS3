Need Advice On How to Help A FriendA friend of mine is going through some really hard times in the last few months. I just met her a few weeks ago, but she told me today about how her son O.D'd in January after spending all her and husband's savings on drugs. Apparently the shock of it caused her husband to have a stroke, and just in the last few days, they've discovered that he has a clot and a tumor in his brain. He's in his 70s, she's in her 60s, and she's very, very sweet, but as she was telling me about this whole situation, she said a lot of things that set off alarm bells for me, mostly about how she doesn't understand why this happened to her, how her husband is all she has left, things like that. Having contemplated suicide in the past, it makes me very worried.

I've contacted our supervisor in regards to maybe setitng up a fundraiser to see if we can get her a gift card to Dillions or Wal\-Mart or something to that effect, to help her make ends meet right now, but I was wondering if anyone else had any ideas about how I can help her.
