I'm tired of hearing stuff like "it gets better"I've felt this way for a long time.  Dear of after is what's kept me from doing anything.  I'm tired.  I'm tired of pretending to be ok, I'm tired of putting on a smile on my face to make everyone else feel like I'm alright so that they don't feel bad for me, I'm tired of lying to myself, I'm tired of constantly being let down by people.  No one actually cares.  Me not being here affects no one.  I go to sleep hoping I don't wake up.  I walk to work very early in the morning before the sun comes up and I've walked on the street hoping a car doesn't notice.  If I'm not sad I'm angry.  Angry at myself and angry at the world.  I'm so sick of all of this.  I can't be depressed or angry or miss anyone if I'm just not here anymore.  I want to die.  I want this to be over.  I'm done.
