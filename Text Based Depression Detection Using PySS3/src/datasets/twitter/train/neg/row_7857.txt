Everything is just a wreckEverything just sucks. My life is a disaster. I can't help but feel horrible about everything that is my life. It's just so bad. I want to end it right now. Skip the cutting bullshit and just go straight to ending my life. I don't want to be here anymore. I just wish I had the guts to actually go through with it and not chicken out of it
