I suffered through college majoring in a field I don't care about. Now I can't find a job in my field or any other field, and I might just end it all.So I majored in linguistics. Suffered intractable, horrific depression through my entire undergrad and managed to do really well (in exchange for intense sufferingâ€”hospitalization, all nighters, energy drinks, ruined health and relationships) until last year, where I took independent study classes that crushed me (turns out I don't really care about linguistics) and the coronavirus made things really fucking difficult for me. Not that doing really well in linguistics FUCKING MATTERS because no one gives a SHIT about linguistics. 

I managed to pull off magna and Phi Beta Kappa but guess who cares? NO ONE. I have four years of research experience and co-authored a paper and presented at a conference. NO ONE CARES. I have a minor in computer science. Great. NO ONE GIVES A SHIT. No one needs linguistics researchers, and no one wants minors in computer science when there's majors spilling out the wazoo, and I don't want to go to grad school in linguistics or whatever other field I don't care about. So much entitlement, right? I worked hard, but I worked hard at the wrong fucking thing, and now it's all worth nothing. 

I was about to kill myself earlier this summer so I took acid to see if it could sort me out. I realized that I was morbidly depressed because I had been overworking myself to death because I was trying to prove to myself that I could force myself to love linguistics and succeed in the field because I didn't major in biology like I wanted to, deep down, because I fucking hate my parents and I didn't ever want them to push me to medical school. Now I know that I should have studied insects like I always wanted to. But I've been talking to people and it's looking increasingly unlikely that I can get into entomology programs at all. 

All that overachieving for nothing. My friend, who did the bare minimum all four years and is headed to a PhD program in school counseling, had the right idea. I thought she was an idiot, but she was actually leagues smarter than me. Summers off, never out of demand, enough money to live a nice, average life. She knew what she wanted, and she did exactly enough work to get it. She spent the rest of her time enjoying life, and I was a cranky, mean, miserable asshole through college.

So here I am, can't find a job, can't earn money, can't take more classes for grad school, can't do ANYTHING, after six fucking years of wanting to kill myself EVERY FUCKING DAY. I can't even get a job at fucking Target. I'm feeling stuck, that's all. And I think I should get it over with. I've been staring death in the face for such a long time and I feel complete at peace with it. I've practiced dying over and over and I'm more than ready.

If you're majoring in linguistics, get a second major, you fucking idiot. No one knows what linguistics is except other linguists. At least make sure you actually like linguistics unlike me.
