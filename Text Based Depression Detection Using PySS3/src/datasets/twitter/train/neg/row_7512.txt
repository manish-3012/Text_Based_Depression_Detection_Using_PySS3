Iâ€™m giving up. Unfinished but hereâ€™s where Iâ€™m atI canâ€™t do anything right.
Iâ€™m just a sad sack of shit. 
Anytime I let my walls down and care for someone, they leave. Itâ€™s happened countless times and Iâ€™ve just come to realize that Iâ€™m completely worthless.
Nobody will ever care, Iâ€™m a burden to my family, and I really donâ€™t seem to have any friends. I wonâ€™t be missed and Iâ€™ve accepted that. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to go about it, all I know is that for the last ten years Iâ€™ve been hoping for death. I need to take the initiative and get what I want. Because nobody cares, not really, not past the surface level that I show. Deep down, Iâ€™m nothing. Deep down, I donâ€™t deserve to be happy. Obviously, since any time I think Iâ€™m happy, everything starts crashing down around me. I hope someone notices me missing, if only so my pets will have someone to care for them. 
I make others feel like a burden, when, at the end of the day, itâ€™s me. Iâ€™m the burden in everyoneâ€™s lives, even if they donâ€™t really realize it. 
I just want this guilt to end. I feel so heavy, I feel so helpless. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold on and keep fighting. Is there even a point anymore? I donâ€™t think there is.
I have absolutely nothing to live for at this point. I canâ€™t do anything, I donâ€™t know if I want to do anything. I just want it all to end. I just. I canâ€™t. The supposed fight isnâ€™t worth it. Iâ€™ve already checked out. I just need to figure out how to fix this. How to end it all. Iâ€™m scared, yeah. But in the end, itâ€™s better off for everyone Iâ€™ve ever come into contact with if I just were to stop existing. 
If this hurts anyone, Iâ€™m sorry. Itâ€™ll pass quickly, because youâ€™ll realize that all Iâ€™ve said is true. I am a burden. I am useless. I am hopeless. I am helpless. I am worthless. This is whatâ€™s best for everyone. Itâ€™s not my intention to hurt anyone, but I guess I have a history of doing just that without even trying, so I guess in death Iâ€™ll be no different. 
I have nothing left to lose. 
I had happiness, or at least a glimpse of it. But as always, I somehow managed to sabotage it. I thought I had found someone who would love me and understand me. But of course I drove them away. I didnâ€™t mean to, I never meant to push you away. I loved you with all of my heart and all of my being. I never ever wanted to hurt you, and even in trying my best not to, I always did. And for that, for hurting someone so amazing, I deserve this. I deserve to be miserable. 
But I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m strong enough to live with being this miserable. I love you, and in death, I know I will always love you. Youâ€™ll always be â€˜the one,â€™ as cliche as that is. I knew I would spend the rest of my life with you, and I suppose I did. Or I at least came close. Iâ€™m sorry for making you feel like you werenâ€™t enough, you were never the problem. Itâ€™s always been inside of me, somehow projecting itself onto you.
