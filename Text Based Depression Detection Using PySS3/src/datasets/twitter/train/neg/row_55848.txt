TiredI'm so tired. Everything has become exhausting. I don't even necessarily want to kill myself. But I don't want to be alive anymore. And then everything compounds and I feel shittier because I'm 20 years old with so many great opportunities and an amazing family yet I want to die? How much of a selfish asshole can I be. I feel like I'm going to crack in half. All I want is to wake up one morning and not have the best part of the day be that moment when I'm awake but before the weight of everything smashes back down on my chest.
