TorschlusspanikThe whole last week was plastered with parties and events to get to know the people studying with you and get infos. 

And the information that these things were planned was deep down in the uni sites. 

I didnâ€™t see them. 

I missed all of them, and by how full the groups still are, it looks like most went. 

Now uni started and I didnâ€™t get to celebrate that nor meet and get to know anyone. 

Why does this shit even happen. How can I miss something this simple.
I hate my life, I just want to reset these things or donâ€™t live at all. It never seems like I can fix having such problems, whenever I do fix anything, another just one pops up.
