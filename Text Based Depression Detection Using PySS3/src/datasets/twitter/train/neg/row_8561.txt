Barely able to post thisI'm sick of myself, today, my friend told me he'd start a fight with my other friend because of some outrageous complications, i didn't think he was serious until after school, in a pick up area, he attacked my other friend. I could have stopped it, I could have spread peace and ended it, but instead i cowered behind my best friend and made comical commentary about it, i felt sick to my stomach immediately, i thought of how much a hero i could have been, at that one second, but i let my friends down, i let all i love down, this, mixed with other personal problems caused some suicidal thoughts in my mind, i am seriously debating whether i should end it or not, i just can't believe i didn't stop that fight, that hurts me badly. My thoughts are strong, and I'm barely holding on, i don't know who to go to or who to talk to about my thoughts because i'm ashamed about it and about the fight. I just got home and while debating to do it or not, i looked into my mom's eyes and almost immediately started crying. i could have been a hero at school, now i'm a coward. Why am i so troubled?
