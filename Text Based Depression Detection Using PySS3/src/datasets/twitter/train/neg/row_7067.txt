Suicide hotlineI have posted about commuting suicide on this subreddit but I have a question to ask. Valentines day is coming up and I always get really depressed around there because few people in my family care for me so today I was thinking of calling the suicide hotline because I have been feeling depressed today. Problem is I'm really nervous and not sure what to expect. Could anyone please give me advice.
