i dont know what to do anymoreim always getting bullied by my sisters and my parents wont do anything about it. i try to get by and be quiet but theyre always picking on me. i try to have a good day and be happy but theyre always making me cry and making fun of me online. i dont know what to do They make me cry all the time. my birthday, the day my boyfriend asked me out, 4th of july, so many other days. They wont stop. i dont know what to do anymore Its everyday i feel like im going crazy i have no adults to talk to about this and i feel stupid for even saying that because I AM an adult. nobody understands what im goingnthrough and im sure im going to drive my friends away because i am always in stress and crying all the time. i cant escape home either (i dont drive) i just dont know what to do anymore. I cant take it. Im crying everyday because of the constant bullying maybe i just need to vent but theres no way out i feel so hopeless and i just want to die because i dont think this will get better for me,
