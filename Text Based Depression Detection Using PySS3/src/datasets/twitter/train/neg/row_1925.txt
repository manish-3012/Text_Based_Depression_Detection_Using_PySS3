To everyone on this subreddit:Hi,
Iâ€™ve been struggling with suicide myself lately.
A couple weeks ago I tried to overdose on alcohol and Benadryl, but only ended up puking my brains out and being unable to walk for a little while. The aftermath of it was disastrous. I was stuck missing people that had left me, feeling like a disappointment because my parents were all over me because I had been smoking weed and Iâ€™m still a high school student. My friend group dropped me and continues to threaten to jump me and make fun of me via any means possible, even though I blocked all contact with them. I had ongoing OCD and Depression. I could go on and on, but obviously my situation is bad, and I know that the majority of people on here probably have it worse. However, seeing the grief in my parents eyes, in the eyes of the few friends I still have, and how mortified they were; it really brought to fruition how suicide truly does just give the pain to someone else. Donâ€™t blame yourself for being suicidal, life nowadays is confusing and hard. Weâ€™re the most advanced weâ€™ve ever been, and yet suicide is more of an epidemic now than ever. Even if you think youâ€™re alone, youâ€™re not. Even if your mind is telling you that thereâ€™s no way someone cares, there is. And even if you truly have no one, that still doesnâ€™t justify it. Patience when feeling these kind of deep emotions can be very hard, when people say it will get better, thereâ€™s no telling how long it will take. It could be years, but any amount of pain you feel now is bound to be surmounted by the pleasures and joys and satisfactions that life will give you once youâ€™ve made it over the hill. Everyone has their own mountains to climb, and unfortunately not everyoneâ€™s gets to be small. But I promise you matter, and while this is going to sound generic I want to list a few things that may make now not seem so bad. When you feel these lows try:
- Exercise
- Reading
- Napping for a short period of time
- Hot showers
- Swimming
- Chamomile Tea
- Video Games
- Knitting
- Coloring
- Contacting the Suicide Hotline
- Watching self love and motivational videos on YouTube
- Masturbation
- Cooking
- Doing something to train your brain, like a crossword puzzle
- Taking a drive
- Exploring nature
- Listening to music
And there is more to all of that that you can do to manage or alleviate the pain. It will get better, it always does for everyone. Life will not be constantly low, and in the meantime, try to savor and appreciate even the littlest things that bring you joy, whether it be the cool side of the pillow or a cute gif. Stay strong. I love you.
