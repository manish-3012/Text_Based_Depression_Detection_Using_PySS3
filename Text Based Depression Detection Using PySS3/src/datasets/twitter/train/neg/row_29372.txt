Advice on overcoming fear of taking final step?This is a sincere request for help to gather the courage to finally end my journey. The longer I am around, the more debts I rack up, the more pain I cause to those around me, and the longer I prolong the inevitable. The people in my life know I will end my life at some point, as do I, and I wish us all to experience the relief of having it over and done with.

All I need is to get my dog to the shelter when it opens in 4 hours (they will call my next of kin when I don't return to pick her up), and then get myself to the location I've chosen which is a 5 hour drive from here. What would you tell someone to get them to stop postponing and get on with it? How do you get over that foolish fear when you know this is the right decision?

I'm not asking for hatemongers to haze me into hating myself enough to kill myself, I'm asking for respectful feedback on how to help me achieve the only goal I have in my life and to follow through on my sincere desire to be done. I don't know why I can't seem to take this last step and I know how much pain I am keeping everyone, myself included, in purgatory.

Thank you in advance to those who wish me well and will want to encourage me to stay alive to keep fighting. I appreciate those sentiments so much and am sorry not to be able to follow your advice, though I hope others will. I know my solution to my problems is imperfect, but it is the only one that is viable for me, and I thank you also in advance for respecting that.
