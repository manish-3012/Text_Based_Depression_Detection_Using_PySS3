I really need helpI don't know if this is allowed. I just need someone to talk to. I've posted here before on this account. I just, I don't want to sound like the girl who cried wolf. I just don't want to be here. It's gotten so bad lately. I think about dying every day. And I know the more and more I think about it, the closer I get to actually doing it. I'm just a coward. I just need help, and I don't know how to ask for it.
