I wanna die and I'm planning itI don't deserve to live. I hurt too many people on the way and I'm done breaking relationships. The world is definitely a better place without me... I lost my best friend because I was too much for her, now I'm losing my roommate as well.... it's all because of me. So before I lose anyone else, I'm going to take my life because I'm not worth living. At least when I'm dead people won't hate me as much :)

I want to die of CO or Nitrogen poisoning, these are known painless ways to die. I've also thought of overdosing by cough syrup or ibuprofen. Jumping off a building will be the least considerated method cuz there's a high chance that I won't die and I might be immobile the rest of my life. I don't know... I'll figure a way to do it. Holidays are almost over and I'll be seeing my roommate soon, and she'll probably ignore me or cut our friendship off at that point. If that's how it is.... I'm pretty sure I'll just commit suicide.

People will probably be traumatized or hurt... but I'd rather they feel that way. Perhaps that's how I'll live- in their hearts. This sounds selfish I know, but I'll just be another person on the news and nothing else. I'll stop hurting people in the future.
