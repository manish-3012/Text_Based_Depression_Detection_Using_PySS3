I want to die, due to being a failure all my life.I feel like everything I do ends in failure, so why I should I even bother to live?

I have a master's degree in cybersecurity, which turned out to be a waste of $30,000, since I was trying to better myself. But it was a failure, it turns out that degrees don't amount to anything in the modern era. Why didn't anyone tell me that college was going to be useless.

Also, I am a late bloomer. Most of my peers are doing well, except for ME! I was always the runt of the litter. I hate it so much.

I really want to die. I hate being a failure. I am unemployed. I took a gigantic risk of a three-month cybersecurity contract, which I had to quit my job for. Fast forward to now and I am unemployed.

I really want to work in technology, but no one is hiring, not even with a master's in cyber security. What should I do? Should I just die due to being a failure who's wasted his youth?
