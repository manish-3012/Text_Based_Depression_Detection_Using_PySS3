Lost my happyI've been thinking about taking my life or just disappearing. 

Over the past few years I've made choices that I regret.  Choices that I have had trouble dealing with.  I've lived in denial and can't take it anymore and can't make things right. 

I've done damage to people I've cared and loved the most and tossed relationships away that I should've hung onto. 

I hate my job,  hate my life, and don't know what to do anymore. 

The other night I was looking at the cleanest ways to kill myself on my phone  and my girlfriend (who was in bed beside me) wanted to know what I was reading so intently.  I didn't disclose to her what I was reading. 

I'm so depressed,  taking anti depression and anxiety meds,  and have gone to counselling,  but I'm afraid nothing is working and don't know what to do.  

I've got a lot to be grateful for and I know I am surrounded by people that love me but they can't help me. I'm flailing uncontrollably and feel utterly alone.  

I wanted to come here to let this out because it's anonymous and I can't confess or confide my feelings with anyone that knows me. 

Take care,
