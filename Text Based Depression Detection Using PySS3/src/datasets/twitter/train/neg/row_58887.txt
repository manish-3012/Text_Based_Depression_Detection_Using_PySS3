The one thing I had that anchored me is goneThe one thing that kept me anchored to this earth told me last night how disappointed they were with me and how I hadn't defended them when they had been attacked. I was torn in two different directions. I can feel the love dying between us and that is killing me. I truly have no hope for my future without her. Just like everything else I have screwed this up too. I think that I will be taking that walk to the bridge soon.
