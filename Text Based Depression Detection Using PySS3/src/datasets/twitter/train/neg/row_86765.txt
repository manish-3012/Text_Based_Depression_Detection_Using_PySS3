I wish (some thoughts I quickly wrote down)I wish I had a friend, someone who genuinely listened to my pain and my reasons for not wanting to remain here.
Who wouldnâ€™t try to convince me to change my mind.
Who loved me enough to see all my failed attempts at taking my own life and take it for me.
Why does no one love me enough?


Sending love out to you all, I know you need it.
