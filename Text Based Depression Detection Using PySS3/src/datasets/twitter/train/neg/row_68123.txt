A long distance mess.I started talking to this amazing girl who helped me through a rough time I was having. We kind of hit it off despite the distance and it wasn't long before both of us were in love. We stayed together for 5 months and I even moved countries just to be closer to her and have a higher chance of meeting her (still not the same country but much much closer). And now.. I've found out that I was lied to for most of our relationship... the last 3 months she was lying about loving me and wanting to meet me yet she still let me spend money to move countries to somewhere I have no friends or support. It turns out she kept talking to her ex the entire time and she was cheating on me for most of the relationship. Despite everything and all the lies I still love her and want to be with her because I truly appreciate what she did for me when I needed someone.. but now.. she told me she didn't wanna talk to me anymore and wanted to just be with her ex.. 


I'm sorry if the post is a little messy and things seem out of place or don't make sense, I already took all the medication I had left ( I've been diagnosed with autism and borderline personality disorder, so I take diazepam, sertraline and respiradone for it). Here's to hoping 6 months worth of medication fixes me in one day. Cheers.
