Waiting for the last reason to goI keep having moments alone where I think to myself why am I still doing it all. I go sleep emptier and emptier each time. I can feel the day closing in on me when there will literally be no point to carry on. At some point going through the motions won't be necessary, because they will be completely detached from me. When that last thing whom is hiding lets me go, I'm afraid that'll be my sign to no longer feel obligated to go on. Like there will be nothing left for me to do anymore and so no need to stay. It's just scary anticipating it, like getting butterflies in your stomach before a speech you've prepared for, for a long time. I guess it's human nature to try and survive. 

I'm all good tho so just typing this out is all I need
