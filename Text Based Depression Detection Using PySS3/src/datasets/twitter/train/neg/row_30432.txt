I don't feel like it will end for me, and I'm scared.I'm an early twenties woman, and I'm so afraid all of the time.

I have no job despite having a small diploma, I can't find one in any line of work except commission pay which I cannot take. I have anxiety which causes me a lot of fear and grief every day. I ruined my mother's life being born, because she could have been so much more if she didn't have me at a young age. I am currently being tested to see if I have lymphoma, and I know if I do I won't be able to survive chemo, I watched a family member go through it and I am not strong enough. 

I'm just so scared all the time. I don't want to be afraid and feel worthless like this. I just wish I didn't have to be here. I don't want to unload this on my mother or my few friends, I have done that enough as it is. My father doesn't love me, he never has. He victim shamed me for my rape when I was a young teen recently and it has opened a wound that, on top of everything else,  I don't feel like I can handle. I just really wanted to talk in some way, because holding all of this inside is making me hurt so much.
