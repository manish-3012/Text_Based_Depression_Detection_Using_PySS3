Whatever happens after death, it still will be progress over thisI feel disgusted with human race. I feel disgusted with my family of fake christians. I don't want to be part of this sewer party. 

I can't stand 'unicorns and rainbows' people. I can't stand wealthy sociopaths, who take advantage of others and call it having "enterprenuer mindset"...

I can't stand being attacked by sexualized materials, spam and mainstream music videos with lambos and half naked arses... 

I can't stop thinking, my life has been ruined right at the beginning, by those who were supposed to take care of me. 

I don't want to be their child anymore. I feel dirty. I don't want to have their disgusting genes.

I just want to be a fucking space dust... far away from this bullshit nightmare...
