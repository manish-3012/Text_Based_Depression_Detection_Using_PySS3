I have no money, no valuable possessions, no diploma or GED, no job, and I need to get out of my mother's house before I hurt myself.I am never going to live the life I want and be the person I want to be under my mom's fucking thumb. I just want her to leave me alone. I am tired of being reliant on her, because she doesn't have a job, and is reliant on her ex-boyfriend and basically anyone within her proximity who has their shit together. I need out of here ASAP. But I don't know what to do. 

Added context: I am 20 years old, and I live in the state of California
