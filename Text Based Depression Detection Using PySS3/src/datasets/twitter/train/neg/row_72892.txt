Itâ€™s like an insult when they assume itâ€™s self pityMy family thinks I wallow in self pity. Everyday I try to concentrate so my thoughts wonâ€™t wander and go there so I can actually be productive and stop focusing on why I hate myself.

All the things I do, I feel like itâ€™s never enough. Iâ€™m sick of this, some days ago I tried to drown in the bath, but they were calling for me so I didnâ€™t do it as it would have been suspicious. 

I feel like Iâ€™m a nuisance ( for my parents) because i donâ€™t longer want anything so Iâ€™m just a plastic bag that you fill up with money and then throw out.
