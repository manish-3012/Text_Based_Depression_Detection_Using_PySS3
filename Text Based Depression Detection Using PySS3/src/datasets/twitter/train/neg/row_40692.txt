Why do I matter? When there are others who deserve more help than me?...Why should I even matter?.....In a world where I see what others get......physical comfort,....friends who actually care.....family that care......I guess....going through countless years of hearing one thing but seeing a different result has always made me skeptic......Foster parents would beat me for constantly forgetting to do something, or I got in trouble cause I didn't listen when told not to do something........Am...I exhilarating what happened in my past?.........In my world,.....there is not stopping self hate because no matter what I do, i was always reminded of what I did. Or what I'm not good at....Even when I do, do something good, its met with," Well you should have done this the first time instead of flunking all the time."....or  just....something that would always overpower the good.....That's all I remember.....and...maybe the reason why I was always getting hit and yelled at and punished was because I was actually that fucking stupid and really did lack common sense......If I wasn't forgetting something important to do, it's not doing it at all.........maybe....I really am just stupid and lazy......all I know is that I wish I was never given a chance at life......because I have failed to take care of myself, I have failed to be successful in school, I have failed to know how to keep friends......all I do is fail......even when I try my hardest,........I will always fail...........why do I keep reaching out to anyone when I know....it won't happen.....maybe.....it's time....to go quiet once again.........because my words won't matter to anyone in the physical world........it may help someone over online....but.....I'm done trying to figure out words and if they are actually genuine............I'd...prefer actions.....over words.....and actions never come.....when I ask.
