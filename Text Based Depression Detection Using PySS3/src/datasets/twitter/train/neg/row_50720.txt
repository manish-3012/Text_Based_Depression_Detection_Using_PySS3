Give Me One Reason To Not Commit SuicideI get no joy out of this shit anymore. I am in constant pain. None, NONE, of the help I've been offered has helped me in any way, shape or form.

I'm 15 (16 in two months) and transgender (was gay before I figured out I wanted to live as a woman). My classmates are homophobic as shit, the waiting times to receive any kind of gender affirming healthcare in this country are soooooo long. I have to wait for up to 4 years to receive any medication that'd help me, and even if it wasn't, I won't get it anyway. The dysphoria clinics here can cancel the investigation at any time and for any reason - they've told me time and time again that I won't get on hormones if I'm this depressed.

I want to be forgotten forever, I want no funeral to be held. I want to perish and to never be thought of again. I wish nothing but to die. Killing myself would be so liberating. Not having to deal with this awful place would be so so amazing.

I've a plan, and I will carry it out. I've heard survivors speak of instant regret, but I don't care. I know I'll still have suicidal thoughts if I still survive. I just want to get this over with. I've no reason to stay. Take care.
