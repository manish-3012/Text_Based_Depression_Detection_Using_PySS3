Diagnosed with herpes. Might end it. I can't come to terms with itThis has hit me so hard. Mid 20s male. Just found out w few weeks ago and I can't deal with it. Either got it from my cheatin ex or the one girl I was with after her. Only two partners in several years. I am so depressed. I will never have someone accept me over this. I feel dirty. I am fit athletic with a decent job but I feel like all my good qualities are overlooked because of this. I've always been paranoid of stis too. To make matters worse. Anyone please help me. I don't think I can do this. I really like a girl and things have been amazing these last few weeks talking and kissing. But she won't want me with this. No one will. 
I can't stop thinking about how different my life could be without herpes.
