Planning to go on my birthdayMy birthday is in another 3 weeks (26/9) and Iâ€™m planning to either hang myself or OD. Iâ€™ve never celebrated my birthday, and I was supposed to celebrate my 19th with my ex. But yeah heâ€™s my ex now. Iâ€™ve just had enough of feeling alone. I just thought for once I wanted happiness that doesnâ€™t taste of blood. 

No one cares about me enough to actually want me in their life. Iâ€™m not very close to my parents and my siblings donâ€™t live with us anymore. My friends are simply people I spend time with, we donâ€™t really have an emotional connection. Iâ€™m just so alone. 

Anyway, my semester GPA is going to be released around the same time too and I know thatâ€™s just going to add to the list of triggers I have to lead me to ending it all as petty as it sounds. I have never had a future. Iâ€™m not smart. I have nothing to live for. And Iâ€™ve always known Iâ€™d end my life sooner or later. 

Just really needed a space to rant. Thanks if youâ€™ve read this.
