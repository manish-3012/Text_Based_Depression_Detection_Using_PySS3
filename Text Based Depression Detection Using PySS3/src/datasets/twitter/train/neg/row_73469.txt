LonelyWhat's the point in living when I will always be alone. I've never had a friend. Not one. I'm 20. My loneliness has had me depressed since I was 11. All I crave is love and friendship. My family doesn't even know me. No one cares to ask about me. Everyone just seems to want to talk about themselves so I just stopped talking about myself completely for years. For example I play a few instruments and they don't even know I'm into music at all. The thought of having someone else beside me or just to hang out, just seems so good to be true. No one will ever come to see me because they actually like me and care to see me. I even changed my looks dramatically to try and attract more people. Lost a ton of weight, got fit, got teeth straightened and whitened, started wearing makeup, made myself "good looking". No one cares. I try my best to smile most of the time and make eye contact with people (which was very hard for me because I have severe social anxiety). No one cares. My dog is the only one who seems genuinely happy to see me every single day. He's my best friend. My only friend. No one will ever show me the unconditional love he's shown me. But it isn't enough. I am always alone. No one to share my thoughts with but myself. I feel like I'm a prisoner in solitary confinement. I have a very strong urge to kill my self. Like tonight. I know it's an impulsive decision but it's very strong. I will never feel that love or connection with anyone. There is no point in living life alone.
