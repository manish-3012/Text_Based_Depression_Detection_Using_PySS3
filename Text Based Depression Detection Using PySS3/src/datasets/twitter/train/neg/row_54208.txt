Snorted two ambien, some klonopin and drank some booze, took a razor to my thighsI'm a 32 year old married male. My mom is dying from cancer and I cannot deal with it. There is infighting between my wife and my sister due to the added stress. I'm stuck in the middle, incapacitated, incapable of coping with whatever is going on. I can't stand seeing my mother and father cry. The world is just so sad.
