Iâ€™m just so lost and it feels like suicide is the only answerEver since I graduated high school I havenâ€™t done jack shit. I havenâ€™t even thought about what I was going to do once I graduated, just had it dead-set in my mind that I was going to kill myself eventually so it doesnâ€™t really matter what I do.

But Iâ€™m just feeling myself become worse as a person, from doing nothing for a year. Iâ€™m becoming dumber. Becoming afraid of people, socially awkward and withdrawn. Iâ€™m not even enjoying video games anymore lol..

This plan isnâ€™t working out. I might have to kill myself sooner to avoid this embarrassment Iâ€™m making out of my life. I donâ€™t even have the motivation to start anew, get a job and a driverâ€™s license. I just want to be dead and erase my pointless existence from this earth, itâ€™s gone on long enough. I mean, I would like to give life one last try. But Iâ€™m too dumb for college, too socially awkward to work a job, too weak to go into the military. Iâ€™m becoming such a lazy, dim-witted sack of shit. I donâ€™t like seeing myself this way. I used to be better than this. I just want it all to end. Iâ€™m not good enough for anything or anyone, never was, never will be.
