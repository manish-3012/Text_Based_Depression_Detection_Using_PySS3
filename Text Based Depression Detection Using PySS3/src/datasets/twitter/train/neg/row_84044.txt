Thinking of shooting myself in the head really soonSo I'm not sure how to say it or how much I want to share cause I'm kinda tired, I'm actually not looking nor asking for help of any kind, I've done many attempts in the past years, hanging myself, cutting myself self and even trying to jump from a building but nothing worked, especially cause I don't have the strength of fully conclude it, unfortunately I don't have a car, inhaling co2 would be way easier and less painful, and the same thing happened with the gun that I don't own any, but resently I heard my mother saying that my uncle gave her a gun for protection because she has another house in a kinda dangerous zone, until now I had always thought that shooting myself wasn't an option, but now, is like looking a window opening for a new possibility, I'm even a little excited for it, I haven't tell to anyone, and I'm not planning to, I've been going to several psychiatrist for more than 4 years and I've been locked down in a psychiatric hospital at least 3 times, I don't have almost any friends, and I've been alone most part of my life, and specially I ruined my entire carear, I was in medical school, I've could have been a doctor but my depression and suicide attempts made me dropout everything, I no longer feel anything besides regret anger and loneliness, and I already up in life long ago, even if I don't do it cause I don't have the courage to finally end it, I will continue to fantasize with it, cause it is my deepest desire, to finally rest, to finally be able to die
