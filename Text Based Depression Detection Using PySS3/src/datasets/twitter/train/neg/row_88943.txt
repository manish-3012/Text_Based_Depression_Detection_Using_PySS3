Life is fucking hardI'm not an active member of /r/suicidewatch, but I have been a reddit lurker for about 2 years. Anyways.  

Maybe it's just me, but I've wanted to kill myself since I was 15. Call me hormone imbalanced, but life is pretty bad. (You say it's bad, but just wait). My parents have physically and emotionally abused me from the moment I can remember. when I was 8, my mom threw my on the floor and kicked my in my stomach until I passed out. When I was 12, my mom punched me in the face and I wouldn't stop bleeding. When I was 16 I was kicked out of the house for the night and I ended up sleeping outside in the rain under a tree. These are just a few select examples of bad things, but I've been hit about every day of my life. I want to end everything, but I can't. I'm always so caught on the idea that perhaps I'll be able to do something with my life and that I'll be a successful doctor and save people and actually do something with my life. I don't need a response and I don't need a follow through. I just needed to get this off my chest.
