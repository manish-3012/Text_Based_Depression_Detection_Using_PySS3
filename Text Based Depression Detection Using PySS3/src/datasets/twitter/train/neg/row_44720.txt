I want to end this pain but I don't wanna dieI fucked up my life. I failed in every tests, math, physic. The school year is about to end and I'm gonna have the final tests in a week. If I cannot make it, I'm gonna kill myself. It cannot be salvaged anymore. I know that this dark time will go away one day but its result won't. I can predict that I will get a B this school year while everybody get an A. I wanna study abroad, I wanna get a scholarship because there is no way my parents can have enough money for me to do so. But who wanna give a B person scholarship? I used to cry a lot and I thought about dying everytime but now it is no longer there. I'm just waiting for the tests to end so that I can finish my life. I don't wanna die yet because I still wanna spend the summer vacation with my sister and my mom but I feel like a burden to my mom. She has to work hard to send us to school.
