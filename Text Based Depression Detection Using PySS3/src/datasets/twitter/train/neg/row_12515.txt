I see life as a pointless sequence of actions, and it bothers me.So, basically, Why do we live at all? If we cut off all religious things, we will be left with "live to be happy and make others happy" or "live to reproduce and make sure next generation lives in a good world" ~~bullshit~~.

Why do I so sceptic? Because science has found the meaning of life in it's purest form: **to reproduce**. We live to reproduce. We suffer to reproduce, so new ones could suffer for the same thing. And all happy things we have in life is either something we found or created just to justify our lives and distract ourselves from the painful truth. 

The world itself is meaningless and exists just to exist and die, like everything does.

Yes, I do enjoy life sometimes and everything, but it's just a chemical reaction and kind of stopgap.

And at the end of the day. Life still bothers me, my life situation bothers me, my future bothers me. Despite the fact that I know it's pointless, worthless and meaningless.

&gt;Why do we still here? Just to suffer?

&gt;...You feel it too, don't you?
