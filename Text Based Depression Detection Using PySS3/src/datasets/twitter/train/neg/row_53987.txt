It never gets betterStudent loans. SO hid credit card debt.  IRS wants more money. Medical bills.  Need to move.  Again. Dr. won't prescribe medication needed. Car needs to be fixed. No one cares.  I can't dig out of this hole.  As soon as I do the right thing and work hard to fix things I get knocked down again.  Why even try?  It is a constant struggle, and since I am technically holding my head above water no one will help.  I am not homeless, or jobless yet.  So no one cares.  What if I don't want to live in a constant struggle to just make it?  I have tried to do the right thing my whole life and it doesn't fucking matter.  I am so done.
