I've never posted beforeSo yea as the title says I have never posted before but today is a really rough day, this whole year has been really fucking rough. I've moved 5 times in a year, been homeless for three months in the finnish winter, my ocd and paranoia landed me in a psychward and they just shoved me meds in one hand and a paper in the other. I just feel so tired, my whole life is a fucking mess of beatings by peers, yelling by family and boxes that get smaller and smaller with each move. Life just doesn't feel like a thing for me and idk I guess I just wanted to try and reach out one last time, because maybe there is someone who cares and wants to help? Idk... I'm sorry for bothering you guys.
