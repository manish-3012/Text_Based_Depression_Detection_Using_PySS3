I feel so alone all the timeIve been thinking about ending things for years now but it hit me hard recently. I have no motivation to do school work and the amount of work is just piling up making it harder to be able to complete assignments and I cant do this. My parents yells at me for not doing anything and that doesnt help anything. The only thing keeping me going at this rate is my s/o but my mind keeps telling me theyre better off without me. If my parents found out about her I wouldnt be able to talk to her. I know I need to stay here to look out for them and help them through what theyre going through but sometimes I just cant take this.
