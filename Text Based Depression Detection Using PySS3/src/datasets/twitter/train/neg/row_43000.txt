SoonI'm back in school while close to 30 and I don't see the point. I thought I'd made some friends this year since I lost a few due to them moving away like adults and onto bigger things. My siblings and parents has moved on as well. My roommate just left for a halloween party he told me he didn't want me going to and another friend who i was doing a group thing with has been ignoring me all week since her boyrfriend moved in. a girl i had been dating called things off this week so i have 1 friend who works third shift and doesn't drive and has a 2 year old daughter. 

I dont' have any friends and those that i thought were friends really aren't. I'm tired of trying and I dont' think my future will be any better or brighter. 

depending on how my midterms went I plan on shooting myself in the chest with a shotgun through the heart. they're $160 at wal-mart and i'm old enough they won't bat an eye, especially with deer season around the corner. 

i'm so tired of having to constantly fight for nothing.
