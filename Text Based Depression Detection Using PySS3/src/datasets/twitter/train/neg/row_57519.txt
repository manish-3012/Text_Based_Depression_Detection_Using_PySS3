I Want To Die But Don't Have The CourageI want to die. I've come to that conclusion now. I see no point in living here. I love my mom and dad and I don't want to hurt them but I need to. I am socially awkward. I hate my brother. I have no friends even though I want some. I want someone to talk too instead of bottling my emotions up. I cry randomly because sometimes it's just too much. I never do anything but stay inside playing videogames. I dislike school. I'm overweight and want to change that but I have no support. My parents are divorced. I am always so angry and cold in public but so sad in private. I want to live and get married and have kids but there's nothing here right now for me. I loved my dog but passed away a few months ago. That was the last straw. I'm not well mentally. I feel nothing but anger, stress, anxiety and sadness. I want to live but is there to live for? Please someone I need help. I'm slowly building up the courage to finally and it. I hate who I am.
