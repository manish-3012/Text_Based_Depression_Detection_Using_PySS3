They say bullies peak in school.
I was 12 years old, this dude who was 15 randomly beat the shit out of me. He was always popular in school while I was ostracised. Now he is 21 with a beautiful girlfriend who loves him, he has a good social circle, happy in life. 

The other people who mainly bullied me are also in relationships and are living a good life. 

Iâ€™m now 18, bullied throughout my life, havenâ€™t had a friend in 5 years, had to move highschool twice, thought about suicide for ages. 

People say â€œit gets better in life, bullies peak in highschoolâ€. I was diagnosed with aspergers at 4, never wanted to harm anyone in my entire life, yet here I am living this pathetic existence. 

Even my parents donâ€™t understand. They keep thinking it will get better. It wonâ€™t, Iâ€™m just done. No one gets it.
