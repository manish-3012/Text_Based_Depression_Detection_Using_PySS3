I want to end my life, but I am scared.I have been dealing with tooth pain for a long while now, and I am just done. Done with being in pain every single moment of the day, tired of feeling ashamed. Tired of feeling like there's nothing that can be done about it. I am so tired of everything, I want it all to just end. I am so scared though. I don't want my brother and sister thinking lowly of me, but I just cant handle this anymore. I love them, but I hardly see them as is. I don't get along with my mother, she is ashamed to have me. I look like the first man she was with, and she hates him. She treats me like him now, since I look like him. Barely talks to me, and when she does, it's about everything I've done wrong. I should have my life in order she says. I am only 22. I barely can handle anything right now, I got laid off recently, and I am at a loss. I am tired of it all, tired of feeling like I am shit. Tired of BEING shit. I just want it all to end. Ugh I can't stop crying as I write this, but it hurts. It all hurts so much, ugh. Sorry, I know this is a useless post, and most won't even bother reading it, probably writing it for myself honestly. Sorry for whoever is unfortunate enough to read this.
