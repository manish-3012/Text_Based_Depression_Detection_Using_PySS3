Living is a choice and i choose to stop sufferingim just so tired

iv been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 13, things just got worse and worse as time went on, i tried to overdose just over a year ago and for some reason thought things would get better but of course theyâ€™ve only gotten worse lol

then at the start of this year i got put in a ward for wanting to off myself, then a month or 2 after that i got diagnosed with body dysmorphia, which is just really fucking me over every single day

Iâ€™m 18 and have no life and no friends and i canâ€™t make any, iâ€™m a monster. it takes so so so much effort to leave the house and be seen by people and no matter how many times i do it. I always feel like breaking down, running home and cutting my wrists open. and the worst part is nobody understands how i feel, everyone just spouts the same generic stuff about oh just hold on things will get better!! but it doesnâ€™t iâ€™ve been holding on and it just gets worse. 

i donâ€™t want sympathy from anyone irl, i donâ€™t even mention anything about whats going on in my head to anyone other than my therapist. idk what i want i just want people 2 understand why i want to go instead of guilt tripping me into staying 

every day is fucking pain i vomit over the tiniest things, i canâ€™t do anything, iâ€™ve wasted my life up until adulthood and i just want to kill myself and start fresh in a new life, anythings better than this

i just cant take it anymore my family despises me, nobody knows i exist iâ€™m so lonely and pathetic and disgusting and iâ€™m going to live alone and die alone in this world if i stick around
