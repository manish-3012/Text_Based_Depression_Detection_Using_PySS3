When does it get betterMy life has been on a downward spiral for the last several years and I donâ€™t think I can take it much longer. When does the sadness end? When can I go to sleep without thinking about ending my life for 30 minutes before Iâ€™m able to sleep. Iâ€™m tired of it. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I honestly donâ€™t have the strength.
