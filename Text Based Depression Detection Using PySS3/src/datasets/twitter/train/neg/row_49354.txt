Feeling TrappedI just feel so trapped in my life. I don't know what to do but I do know that if I killed myself, I wouldn't have to do with this anymore. I wrote a suicide note today. I don't know when or if I'll ever send it. But I just want life to stop. I don't know what's on the other side but it has to be better than this.
