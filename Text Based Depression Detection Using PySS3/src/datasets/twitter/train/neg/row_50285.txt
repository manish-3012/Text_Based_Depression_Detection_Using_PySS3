Iâ€™ve given up and Iâ€™m doneRather not disclose age but Iâ€™m a male and under 16. Iâ€™ve tried talking to people about it but Iâ€™ve been ignored and in some cases Iâ€™ve been told depression/suicidal feelings arenâ€™t real. 

I generally donâ€™t want to live anymore. I broke up with my girlfriend around a month ago so no one too close to me would be effected by what was a suicide attempt. This attempt failed btw. I also got rid of toxic friends which may be a positive.

Anyways Iâ€™m done with life. Iâ€™ve seen people happier without me around and I know deep down no one will care if I die. I havenâ€™t tried again recently bc I donâ€™t want to ruin the holidays for my family if it works.

School sucks bc everyone there picks on me and I have no say in anything and none of the staff members do nothing to help. In social situations I often get left out and donâ€™t really get to say anything. I have 2 friends I see on weekends bc all the others donâ€™t like hanging out outside of school 

At home I also get ignored a lot and I get the blame for everything. Iâ€™m not really close to any of my family as they hardly know who I actually am. 

I canâ€™t be bothered to do anything anymore and Iâ€™ve just given up on trying everything bc whenever I get my hopes up about something, it comes down even worse than before

Iâ€™m just done and want it all to end
