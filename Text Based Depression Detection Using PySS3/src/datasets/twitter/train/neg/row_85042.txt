One of my friends dumped a lot of heavy stuff on me and I'm scared for her.I'm really worried that she's going to hurt herself. Not in an immediate risk kind of way... I just think she really needs help but she has no money and no resources. She needs help and I don't know what to do for her and it scares me. I don't think she has anyone else... and I don't really have anyone but her either.

She has a long list of family problems all crushing down on her and I don't know if I'm enough to hold it back.
