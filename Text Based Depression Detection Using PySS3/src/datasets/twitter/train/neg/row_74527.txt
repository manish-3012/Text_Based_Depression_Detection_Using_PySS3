I want to die, and for no good reason.When I was 24 I was actively trying to kill myself. My husband put me in inpatient care during the day, dropping me off every day before work, picking me up every evening. I met a lot of people that had real reasons to be depressed, and told him I was over it. I got pregnant, we had a kid, I got a job, we've been fine for years.

Honestly, if I had a tank of NO2, I would kill myself right now. I don't even know why. I am 33, I have a 7-year-old son, a husband that loves me, a comfortable life, great life skills, and I still want to die. I don't even know why. I just call it L'appel du vide, The Call of the Void. I think about it every day. I don't even think I'm depressed. I never cry, I never feel pain, I just want to die. To end it all, and never feel anything ever again.

I guess the reason I don't is because I have a son. But each and every day I think about it. I don't know what to do. I do lots of cardio, weights, I eat right, take a multi-vitamin. My body's in great shape. But my mind- not so much.
