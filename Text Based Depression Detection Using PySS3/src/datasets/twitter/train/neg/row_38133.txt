There's something wrong with me... and it's scary not knowing what.There is no fulfillment in life anymore. Many things that used to provide me with such amazing entertainment have now all become dull and grey. I feel like day by day I'm going through the motions, doing everything possible to not show this side of myself... to anyone. 
I used to go out - I used to have friends. Now after trudging through the day job I sit at home in silence, watching the clock, waiting for the night to chime in so it can all happen again the next day.
Is this all life is? Go to work to do a job you don't like to pay bills for things I no longer enjoy. People drifting in an out with so rhyme or reason, or pattern. These people don't matter, and neither do the things around me to me. Not anymore. 
I honestly don't even know of this is the right place to post this, because I'm not looking for any sort of *help*. What am I after? Release. Freedom. The will to live. I don't have it anymore.
