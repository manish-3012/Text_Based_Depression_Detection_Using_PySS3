I know this is dumb, but university is killing me(Sorry for my bad english)
i'm new here, sorry, but i wanted to... i don't know, write how im feeling and... Ah


Im a guy, 21 years old, and im supossed to be in the last semester of my carreer in the university, and right now im "finishing" my grade project, but... I cant,

I dont know why but... i can barely wake up every morning, the classes, the friends, the family... Al the stress, The expectations, i dont know why right now all of this is over me, i have problems sleeping, and eating, i have nightmares, and i cant work in the class projects, or in the grade project without feeling tired and.....

I have been an excellent student all my life....and I know is dumb, i mean, its only a grade... But if i fail, i will need to pay and study other semester... What means money of my parents, time, etc... But i cant, i don't even know what i will do if i Graduate... Im scared, and i dont know what to do....

And... for several months I have had certain ideas... Plans... I just dont want to continue... And its not only the university, its the life, the society, everything... I cant... And nobody hears me, or even want to talk with me... I just want to jump from a window... Or hang myself in the stairs... I dont know what to do....

And i know this is not a real problem, and other people have more seriously problems... Sorry... Im sorry... Im useless i know... I cant face any problem....

Sorry.
