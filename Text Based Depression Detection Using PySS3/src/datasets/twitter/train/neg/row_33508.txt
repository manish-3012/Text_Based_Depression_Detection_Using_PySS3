How I am going to kill myselfFentanyl overdose. Iâ€™m genuinely so happy right now. Before my only options were hanging or slicing myself up to bleed out. Both of these made me shudder at the thought.

A boy in my city recently died from fent laced percocet. I know the exact person he got them from. So boom. Problem solved. Iâ€™m so thankful to live in a city where these things are so accessible. Iâ€™m thinking of committing sometime before Newyears or maybe on Newyears idk.

Thatâ€™s all. Iâ€™m just really happy and feel at peace now. Love you guys and I wish you guys the best! :)
