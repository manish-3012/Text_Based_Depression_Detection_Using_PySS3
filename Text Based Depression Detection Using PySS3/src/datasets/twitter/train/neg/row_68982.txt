I can't take it anymore, quite honestly.I genuinely can't stand being alive anymore. I cannot take this pain anymore. Waking up every day is a fucking chore and I don't even sleep much anymore. I just stay up all night so I don't sleep through my classes. I want it all to end. I don't give a shit what anyone says anymore. No one wants to talk to me about it, and I just feel like the world would be better off if I weren't in it. Each day, having to open my eyes in the morning and knowing that a new day of pain and torment is ahead of me, this is too much. No one gives a shit anymore, and when I'm dead, I'll be another faceless, nameless dead body in the bunch. I'm done with it all. I'm going.
