I just attempted suicide for the first timeThis will probably be an very unorganized story and ill probably forget some things too but oh well.

I'm a m/15 and I live in the Netherlands, I've had depressive/suicidal thoughts for about 3 months.
I  cutt myself and I don't care for anything.
I'm also a very selfish person, which is also a reason why the world would be better without me.
Also my parents have been divorced since a very long time. 

It's in the middle of the night and it's usual that my father and my brother go earlier to bed than me. So I'm the only one awake in the house and I dedide to make my thought more real so I go to my mother's house (no one is there because she's on vacation) and I grab some rope and go to my room to make a noose, I found out that the rope was really bad and hard to make a noose from so I just made a sort of loop and tied that up.
I attached it to something and put it around my neck, I wasn't certain if I was going to acctualy do it because I didn't really want my mother to find me in my own room dead.
But I still had the rope around my neck and pushed myself downwards until I ran out of breath, then a sort of instinct took over and I got out of there as quickly as possible.
Now I'm here and I just feel like I'm going to fully commit one day.
