Too long have I considered just ending it.I'm 24. Transgender. I live with my boyfriend who moved me from Florida to New Jersey. I'm pretty sure he loves me. He takes care of me. Puts a roof over my head, internet, food. I help out on the side with web-development income.

Sounds great, right? I mean hey, play games, get high...alone most all the day every day for the past 2 years. I'm a complete failure. I have no job, no car, no friends what-so-ever. Every day of the week for the past 2 years I have sat inside this apartment in north Jersey looking out the window at the birds and thinking "I'm in a prison of my own making".

Yes, I'm transgender MTF 6 years of hormone therapy by injections. I was born in the wrong body with an unstable mind. 

I know this sounds pathetic but I've felt for months and months a months that my life is pointless. 

This universe existed 13.7 billion years before it fucked up and made me. I have no memory of anything prior to my birth. Perhaps that's the way it will be when I kill myself? 

Maybe it's just nothingness. No space...no time....no depression...no despair...no hopelessness...no loneliness...no inability to please my boyfriend sexually. I have nothing other than basic human needs.

Sorry if I sound pretentious. I just wanna fucking park somebody's car in a garage and put on music while I drift into nothingness.

Nothingness....all I want is nothingness. It's been on my mind every day for so long.

How do I do it?
