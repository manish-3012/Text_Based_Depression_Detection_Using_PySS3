A Popular YouTuber committed suicide, and I'm really just thinking about myself.I've posted here before.  Lots of times.  I've gone on about why I feel suicidal and how I don't believe suicide is the wrong choice for some people.  So don't think I'm only posting here because his death made me want to talk about things.

Anyways, I admire his courage.  I am far too afraid to kill myself, even though I know I should.

I'm bitter that this person is getting so much attention on social media, so much *affection* on social media.  I'm jealous.  I want a modicum of that affection.

And yet I know that if I got it, it wouldn't matter because I'll only accept it if it comes from certain people, the ones I seemingly arbitrarily decided to declare "important".

I deserve to die and yet I live.  When I'm gone I know no one will mourn the same way for me.

P.S. I want to warn everyone on social media sharing the suicide hotlines and all that about how those hotlines are terrible for helping those in need as most of us have found out. But I don't want to deal with all that.
