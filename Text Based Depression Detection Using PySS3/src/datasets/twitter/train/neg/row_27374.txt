I think I have a problem.I can't tell you the last time that I've been happy. Like, 100% happy. No matter who I'm with or what I'm doing there's always this lingering sadness in the back of my mind.

I think part of it comes from the fact that to most of my "friends", conversation is a one way street. I can't talk to them because they're too preoccupied with their own lives to even ask about mine. On top of that, there is no sense of trust. To them I'm just there to give feedback on their problems.

Everything in my life is just changing way too fast. My best friend of 14 years recently just decided to leave town and I've only heard from him once in the last month. I basically live two separate lives, neither of which feels right, and I have nowhere to turn. My grandpa has been having heart problems, which I'm pretty sure are more serious than anyone is letting on. On top of everything else I just can't succeed in making myself feel okay.

I'm angry, I'm sad, I've lost hope that things will change, and I've been convinced by too many people that I'm the problem and there's something wrong with me. I don't want to believe it, but what else can I do?

I'm sick of putting on a smile and pretending I'm fine. I feel like no one really even *knows* me.
