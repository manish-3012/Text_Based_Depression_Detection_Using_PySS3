planning on ending my lifeBought a nitrogen beer tank 20 ft3 (149 gallons / 566 litres), planning on getting CPAP tubing and i think i can make an exit bag at  home. Hopefully if done correctly i should be able to die in peace. I have too many issues at home and i don't have anyone to confide in, I fear that if i do, I might be forced to do therapy for the rest of my life and be on pills, yeah no, i'd rather fucking die.
