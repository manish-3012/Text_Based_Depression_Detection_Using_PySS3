I don't deserve sleepMy friend was dating this girl she eventually fell for me and she said she was going to end it with him. This was over the course of a month. Today I was done waiting and I talked it out with him. He wanted to beat the ever living shit out of me until I finished and we realized she was lying to both of us. She hasn't really lied to me a lot just something that kinda hurt me she didn't tell me. The thing is I really like her but if I go out with her I'm going to get shit for it because of what she did. She made a stupid mistake and I'm willing to look past it and give her a second chance. She says she learned from it and feels terrible. My friend is devastated but says he doesn't care if I date her or not. I feel like shit. She feels terrible about lying to him and he feels terrible for what he did. I feel like I could have prevented this. Literally if I hadn't talked to her this wouldn't have happened. I felt so bad I would have let him beat the shit out of me. I don't deserve to sleep tonight. I put them through so much pain and I'm sitting here hardly affected. The least I can do is suffer with them. I have two tests tomorrow so I'm not going to study and stay awake all night. I'm going to go outside and just run. When my legs ache from running I'm going to do push-ups. After my arms are dead I'm going to stand up and slowly shadow box preserving any strength I have left to keep myself awake. This is the only alternative other than sleeping and or ending it. This is just another thing to stack onto my problems
