This will be my last weekThis will be my last week. I just can't take it anymore. I'll use this week to get everything in order, make sure people will know it won't be their fault, etc. But my depression has finally won over my life. I'm so tired of fighting it. 

I feel like a total shitbag since my sister is starting her first semester of college that following Monday, and I already scared my family bc my friend thought I attempted, (I convinced them it was a false alarm and that she misunderstoo) but either way I just can't handle living anymore. It hurts too bad. I have no one to go to, and I'm completely hopeless. Countless meds, 10 years of therapy, etc. 

Might as well do it. Hardly anyone will notice I'm gone, and the ones who do will get over it soon enough.
