I donâ€™t want to kill myself, but I just seem to want to dieI donâ€™t know how to explain it anymore, I know in my head I wonâ€™t kill myself, but I keep embracing death. I have almost no fear of death, I imagine it being warm like a blanket that closes over a person. I donâ€™t want to die i donâ€™t think, I just feel empty, I feel alone, and so I fantasize about killing myself or death. At this point at least several times a day I think about it, or pretend to try it. I donâ€™t know what it means or what it is, Iâ€™m not depressed or lonely, itâ€™s just that emptiness.
