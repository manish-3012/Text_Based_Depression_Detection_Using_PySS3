Debts?If I declare bankruptcy, then kill myself, will any debts fall on my family?

I'm 22, and no assets, so it's  not like they can repo anything right?

Also, would it be best to let my bunny go in the wild,  or take her to be euthanized?
I really love her and I want what is best for her.

I've already packed up my room for easy donation, just need this little bit of information, I can't  seem to find online.

Trying to leave as little mess as possible.

Please don't  lecture me about how sad my family will be, I don't  have the luxury of people who care.
