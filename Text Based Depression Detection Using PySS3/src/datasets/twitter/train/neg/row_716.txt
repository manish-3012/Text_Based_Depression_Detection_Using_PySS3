[Question] I am not suicidal, however, i dont mind dying.I feel that life just goes on, nothing really interesting matters and if i were to die tomorrow it wouldnt really matter. Is this normal? It is an easy method for me to cope with stress or tackling failure, if it happens i could always just off myself. I dont know if this is healthy, sorry if this isnt the right place to ask.
