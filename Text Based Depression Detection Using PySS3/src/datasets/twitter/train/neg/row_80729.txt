I'm calm that I want to kill myselfBefore I had these intense feelings that made me feel like I wanted to die right at that moment. Now it's just constant feelings where it's like "cool, if I want to die, then I'll do it this Friday or whatever". Like don't get me wrong, I think about suicide everyday but now I can like actually do stuff and not be totally consumed by the emotions.
