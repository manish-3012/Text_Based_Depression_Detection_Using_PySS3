I am going to die aloneThat is a fact.

I'm not saying it to victimize myself, or to get pity... That is just a fact.

The only reason 70% of the people I know talk to me is because:

â€” College stuff, favors (like lending pencils, markers, or stuff like that). 

â€” They pity me, treat me like a kid, they're nice in the moment but then I'm forgotten.

I'm not going to live the rest of my life labeled as a disabled person... When I'm not like that.

That's why I want to die, because of that label, no one will take me seriously, and I'll probably end up unable to find a job, getting older and dying alone at 80-90... That's the only thing I want to avoid.
