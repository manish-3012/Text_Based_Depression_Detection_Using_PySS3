Should I tell someone before I kmsI have a good deal of friends that I am relatively close to but I just am completely unable to share the deepest parts of me. However they mean a lot to me, Iâ€™m not sure if it goes both ways. Anyways should I tell at least one so they can let the others know? I donâ€™t want to be some attention whore which is my biggest problem with telling one person. But I also feel like my friends will just think I abandoned them for no reason. Idk what to do.
