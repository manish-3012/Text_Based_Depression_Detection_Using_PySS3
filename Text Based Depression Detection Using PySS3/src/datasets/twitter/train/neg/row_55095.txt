Getting a gun in the UK to commit suicide withDoes anyone here in the UK (England specifically) have a plan or at least thought seriously about this? I'm not British by citizenship or even commonwealth, so the most obvious route by military service isn't open to me. But is there any other way of getting a gun LEGALLY?

I was actually thinking if I should join a hunting club, get a hunting license and so have a legitimate reason to purchase a firearm. Is there any Brit here who know if this is feasible and if so how long this procedure takes?
