Why should I care about the people that I might hurt by committing suicide?Iâ€™m dead so I donâ€™t have to deal with feeling guilty or bad. I donâ€™t have to deal with anything so why should I care about them being sad?

Iâ€™ll be dead and I donâ€™t have to care about others problems if I donâ€™t exist anymore.
