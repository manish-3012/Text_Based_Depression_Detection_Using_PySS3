Is there actually a reason not to kill my self?I've heard it all 
Family and friends 
Unreleased music 
Love 
Moving up in the world 
Things getting better you're only 16 

Well it ain't getting better and none of that shit matters. 

Ultimately I'll be dead. A minuscule amount of people will be affected and they will be temporarily upset but does it really matter? I was going to die anyways. 

Sunsets don't matter 
Love doesn't matter 
Money doesn't matter
Jobs don't matter
School doesn't matter 
How I feel doesn't matter and the effect of me going away does not matter.  

Wether I'm burning away, rotting in the dirt, wherever the fuck our energy goes I don't care
I just am done 

It's like someone makes you go out and buy a video game you hate and has shitty storytelling and you have to play it Every. Fucking. Day. All day long.
Fuck that 
I'm a person and I can quit if I want to
