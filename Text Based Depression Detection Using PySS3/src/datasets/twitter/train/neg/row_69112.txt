I can't take care of myselfI'm in my teen years (16) and I suffer from depression and anxiety. I've had depression since my aunt passed away and my grandfather did a lot of bad things. Me and my parents haven't always had a very good relationship. Needless to say it's not the best. I don't eat very much, I just never feel hungry. My girlfriend has helped me through a lot. even when I haven't been the most fair to her, I always make it up to her though. She's always been there for me and I love her so much for that. But my depression has been getting worse and I often have the big thought, 'would anyone care if I died?' I've resorted to self harm and I don't want to, but I just have moods where I just do. I don't just know how to stop and I can't go to the doctors because they'll tell my parents and they'll do the same thing they've always done and say "no, you don't have depression." And yell at me, that won't help my condition and I don't know what to do. Any advice?
