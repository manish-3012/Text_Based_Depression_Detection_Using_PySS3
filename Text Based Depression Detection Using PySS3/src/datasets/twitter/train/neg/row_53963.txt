I'm tired of feeling worthless all the timeToday my mil screamed in my face and my fiance did nothing. She bragged about how she beat his four year old today while she was watching him. He still hasn't said anything about it. I'm tired of everyone around me reminding me how worthless I am.

He wants me to do free work for him and he wants to start a business with me then tells me that he's leaving everything for his job at his crackhead dad's house and that it's none of my business. 

He wants me to watch his son for him and act like a mom but if I actually try to act like a mom he either ignores me or gets so angry that he starts shaking and makes a fist like he's about to punch me. 

I hate being alive. I wish I could just die already
