Crisis Hotline is so unhelpful and I feel like it is my only outlet.I call the suicide hotline at least once a week. It never helps and I am consistently told that I am not trying to fix myself. I'm in a crisis when I call. I am actively self-harming, crying hysterically, or planning suicide when I call. I am a wreck despite having a great job that I love, eating well, exercising, focusing on school, volunteering regularly, drinking very little, and maintaining a decent social life. I AM JUST DEPRESSED. I HATE MY LIFE AND EVERYTHING IN IT AND WANT TO END IT ALL. I am told that I need to improve my attitude and fix my habits but I try soooo hard and attempt to be positive constantly. 

When I call I am often super angry and I am met with "Hi, this is blahblahblah why are you calling?" in a dead monotone and they are always eager to get off the phone with me. Yet that's the only person that I can share with. I never feel better. I wish I was dead and that's the end of it. I am lonely, I am angry, I cannot see a future, I am in pain. Every little thing sets me off, but I maintain composure well enough in public before I go to my room at night and spend hours screaming and crying because of my anger. 


Thanks for listening.
