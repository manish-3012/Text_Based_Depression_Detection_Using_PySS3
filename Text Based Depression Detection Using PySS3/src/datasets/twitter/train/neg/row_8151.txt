Why shouldnâ€™t I end it?So Iâ€™m a 21 year old female from Australia. I was diagnosed with autism when I was 3, anxiety and depression when I was 8, and BPD when I was 19. I went through the over-dramatic â€œIâ€™m so depressedâ€ phase in high school where I was dramatic suicidal like those emo girls you see on instagram. Now Iâ€™m just done. Iâ€™m thinking about it rationally, there may be no reason why I should stay alive...Iâ€™m a registered nurse, graduated last year but instead of finding a job I applied to do a secondary education degree so Iâ€™m back as a first year undergrad. But Iâ€™m ugly, I hate waking up, I hate eating, I sleep around 4 hours a night and when I take sleeping pills they work but they work for days after and Iâ€™m exhausted so I donâ€™t take them. 

Iâ€™m ugly, I have zero social skills (literally, I canâ€™t talk to people, when people talk to me off guard I just mumble and mutter random noises and I canâ€™t say anything of meaning and Iâ€™ve never been able to have a conversation that didnâ€™t include a million misunderstandings. I live  with my parents and younger siblings, I canâ€™t stand them, they seemingly canâ€™t stand me. I have no future, Iâ€™ll never get married bc I have no social skills I have absolutely no friends, I donâ€™t know anybody and I canâ€™t commit to anything. All that â€œit getâ€™s betterâ€ crap doesnâ€™t apply to me because itâ€™s only getting worse. I have the WORST luck with psychiatrists and psychologists, they cancel on me, they always go off topic, they simply tell me they canâ€™t help me. Iâ€™ve been on a million psych meds, they didnâ€™t make me worse, but they didnâ€™t make me better either, itâ€™s like I wasnâ€™t even taking them. 

All I want is at least one good friend, marry a Christian man, have a few kids. But nobody will ever be attracted to me. Some people think Iâ€™m a boy even but I donâ€™t want to change my appearance and Iâ€™m worried that if a man was ever attracted to me that heâ€™d actually be gay and he could only stand me bc I look like a boy but really heâ€™s just using me as his closet doors......the only reason I can think of to not do it is that MAYBE iâ€™ll get the life I dream of one day, but â€œmaybeâ€ doesnâ€™t seem worth it, because more than likely Iâ€™ll keep living my life like this and die and lonely old hag in my bed and be found a week later when the mail starts piling up outside. I donâ€™t know how to help myself at this point. Iâ€™ve tried so hard. Iâ€™m done.
