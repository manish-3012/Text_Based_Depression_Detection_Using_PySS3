i dont know anymore18, f, first year uni - -


i dont have a reason to be depressed or anxious.
i dont like how depression is affecting my family and school habits.
i used to be so carefree. super bubbly. so optimistic.
nothing bothered me. 
i thought i was immune to depression. all i would think about was being stable emotionally.
but it just came onto me.
i have so many friends who support me.
but my suicidal thinking likes to talk to me.
i dont intend to kill myself.
it would leave a big scar to those i leave behind.
and if i were to kill myself, my mom would follow me and i wouldnt want that.
i start zoloft 25mg tonight.
prozac 20mg didnt work for me.
i dont get it.
i dont want to be depressed.
showering is so hard.
getting outta bed is so hard.
everything that i never put effort to now seems so hard.
i miss high school.
not necessarily because of the experience.
but because i never fell into the monster of depression.
i want to drop out of uni lol...

the me before depression would laugh at the me with depression... and i want to be the me without depression again.

i dunno lol.
i want to crank back time but it is fucking impossible.
but that would make me happy.
