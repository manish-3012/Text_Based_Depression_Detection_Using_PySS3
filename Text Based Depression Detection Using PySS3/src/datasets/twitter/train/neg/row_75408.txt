I'll be forever tired.Consistently exhausted and just overall done. I'm here for my family, and trying to fake it till I make it, because honestly they're amazing and theres no reason for me to feel this way right now.

But all my past haunts me and in just tired. I dont want that baggage anymore I just want to leave. Its unjustified but it's not stopping me from struggling through every hour.
