I was born inferior. I don't want to put myself through the wringer anymore.I'm convinced that I was born inferior. 

I'm gay. I was bullied throughout secondary school because people suspected I was gay and no one gave a shit. My classmates would just watch as the drama unfolded and my teachers would blame me for acting that way. That, and my entire family is homophobic. They believe that homosexuality is unnatural and deserves to be punished by death. It seems as if homosexuals are under intense scrutiny all the time. I've come to envy straight people and it's taking its toll on me. I feel like I'm missing out on something. It's almost as if you're being left out. I'm not privy to the lifestyle so exalted by society, and I'll never be. It's all but a pipe dream.

I'm also an ethnic minority. Probably one of the most hated and undesirable ethnic groups out there. I'm Russian-Jewish. My classmates would crack Holocaust jokes about me and my family. I was spat at for wearing a Jewish necklace in public the other day. 

No, I don't believe in acceptance. If people were verily accepting, someone would've at least stood up for me when I was being bullied. My erstwhile bullies are now the ones that profess their unalloyed support for the LGBT community on social media. I don't believe a single word of theirs. The hypocrisy is utterly confounding. I'm sick and tired of their contrived empathy.

I'm about to leave for a nearby train station so I can jump in front of a train and die in an instant as my body won't withstand the impact. I don't care anymore. I have no one to talk to anyway.

I was born inferior. I will do everyone a favour by wiping myself off the face of the earth.

I hope this is goodbye.
