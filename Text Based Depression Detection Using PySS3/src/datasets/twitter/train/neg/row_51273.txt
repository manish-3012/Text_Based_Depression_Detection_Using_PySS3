Rope burnApparently I suck so much at life, I  fail horribly even at killing myself...

I've tried to die, truly tried, 3 times in my life...none have worked.  I'm apparently the least lucky person ever, because when I was 15 I failed at shooting myself in the head with a revolver  (hammer went down, faint click, dud fucking bullet, panic set in and couldn't continue). I failed at overdosing on amphetamines a few months later...felt like shit for a while, but as I  missed lethal dose by a factor of 10 (couldn't find the information then, but I know now), I  lived.

Last night (23 now, btw), i tried to hang myself - only resulting in the knot failing and some rope burn from how it dropped me, and banging my knee on the way down.

I hate living, I hate myself, I failed in my attempt to find one reason to stay alive...so why the fuck am apparently  I  too incompetent to die? Hopefully I get it right next time.
