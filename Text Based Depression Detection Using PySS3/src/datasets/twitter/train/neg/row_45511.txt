A decision I have to make may result in someone else's deathThis person does browse Reddit and I'm pretty sure here, so I'll have to keep it brief (PM me for more if you think you can help).

There have been some plans in place for a while involving a friend that I now realize I have no interest in and would likely be a problem for me (not talking about a pact or anything, sorry to have to be so vague).  However, I don't know how to explain to this person that I no longer want to continue with these plans as this person has been very unstable and depressed lately and I fear that, regardless of if they understand, calling things off may push this person over the edge.

I'm completely stuck and I'm running out of time, but I really can't stick with the plans because I feel that it may be problematic towards my life and might even wind up putting me over the edge.

**Edit:** Again, sorry to be so vague, I just really need help and can't risk posting in the open.  Also, didn't realize how tired I am, so I'm going to sleep now and I'll get back to anyone who PMs me tomorrow.
