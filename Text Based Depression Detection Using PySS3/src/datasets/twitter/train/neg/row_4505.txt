decided to stand up to a "friend" that's been picking on me and hitting me for years and got beat up. i hate myselfi already cut him off before but earlier today he was just pissing me off too much so i told him to come to my backyard and fight, he came in and fucked me up, i'm home alone in my house right now i want to do it, the only thing stopping me are my parents and how i imagine they would feel, especially my dad

when i'm at my moms house it's constant nagging at me from my sister and my mom who both have mental disorders, i know it's not their fault but when you've been on the receiving end of constant outbursts for years it really gets to you.

my dad is the only person i feel i can ask advice from since he's so wise and has a lot of life experiences, but i don't know about telling him this because he thinks i'm tough and a good fighter like he was but i'm really not, even if he says he won't be i think if i told him i got my ass kicked he would be disappointed deep down. all i've ever wanted to do is to make him proud
