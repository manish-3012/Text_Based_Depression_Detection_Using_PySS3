No desire to really continue. I have no energy leftI just really have no desire to crawl through life any more. I'm in community college, never been in a relationship in my life, takes every fiber of my being to get myself to go to class, live with my parents, and barely have any friends. It is so utterly pathetic when I look in at myself, that it makes me even more empty and dark inside. I really have no desire to even struggle through all this anymore. I'm an utter loser, and no matter what uplifting self-encouragement I can muster the self-doubt shoots it down like it's World War 3.

I've attempted before, and ended up being dragged to a hospital because of it. Looking back on that, I realize how it truly seems like the answer and that I just didn't have enough balls to complete the objective last time. I don't know what to do. I'm sick of being alone and empty, having nothing to attribute success to in my life in my early 20s. I haven't even lived yet, and people I see that are my age are just living it up. 

No matter what I can tell myself, I come back to the fact that there is not a single thing I can do that another person/guy can't do better. Which adds on to the internalized bullet points of why I hate myself. I don't know what to do, and I'm scared I'll turn down an even darker path if this storm brews anymore. :(
