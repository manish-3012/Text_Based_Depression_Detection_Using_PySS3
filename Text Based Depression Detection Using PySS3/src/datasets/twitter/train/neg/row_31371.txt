Why not?I'm unable to connect with those around me in any sort of meaningful way. While a good part of it is that I'm a dislikable individual, the more significant part is that I don't like anybody. I don't enjoy the company of anyone. I don't enjoy time when I'm alone. I've tried to find motivation in anger and hate, but those didn't work either. I'm simply unable to hold emotion directed at anyone or anything except for a vague disgust. I might be able to reach out and make a future, but it seems empty. There is nothing worth pursuing. Everything is a blanket of meritocracy stretching out to death anyways, why wait?
