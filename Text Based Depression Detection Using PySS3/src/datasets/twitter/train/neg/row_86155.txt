I think about and visualize killing myself multiple times a day. Iâ€™m confused. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d actually do it. Is this bad?Iâ€™m wondering how much of a problem this is? My moods seems to go from fine to sad pretty easily often throughout the day. I have a history of depression. There was a period of time a little over a year ago i would say i was actually suicidal. Iâ€™m confused because right now, sometimes i feel great and can easily become very sad. Iâ€™ll sit and read a book and not feel overly depressed and just drift off, thinking about killing myself. I find it hard to talk about these things and have attempted therapists in the past but never could open up to them. Havenâ€™t been in years. Thanks for the help.
