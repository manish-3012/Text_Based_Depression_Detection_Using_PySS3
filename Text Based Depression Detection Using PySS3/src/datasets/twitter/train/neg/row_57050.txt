I need a gunDouble post but I do. I cannot live with myself any longer nor can I get assisted suicide nor am I going to have a failed attempt that leaves me suffering even more. There is no other choice, I just need to get it over with. Anyone in the UK got one and is willing to help out of compassion and not murderous intent pm me before this gets removed. None of this is on you at all, this is my doing and my choosing so I don't want you feeling guilty
