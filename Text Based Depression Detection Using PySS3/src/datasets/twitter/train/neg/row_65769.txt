Fuck a hotlineI tried the suicide prevention online chat because fuck hotlines (if youâ€™ve ever actually called one you would understand my frustration) and apparently they only have online chat Monday-Friday 4pm-10pm..... what the fuck is the point of that? I get it maybe statistically thatâ€™s when they receive the most calls but what about the other people? I guess we can just go kill ourselves and nobody would care or notice. I donâ€™t even know why I tried honesty because none of those people ever help anyways.. they just tell you the same shit every time.

I think about suicide every day at least 5-10 times a day.. I made a serious attempt almost ten years ago but after being institutionalized I just pretended like I was fine to get out of there. I have tried to tell people (friends and therapists) but I donâ€™t think they believe Iâ€™m actually thinking about it as much as I am. I donâ€™t have insurance or money to see a therapist anymore and I moved across the country and have zero friends where I currently live. The longer Iâ€™ve been here the more I lose contact with â€œfriendsâ€ back home. I live with my partner but he doesnâ€™t understand, Iâ€™ve tried to talk with him about it but mostly I can tell it just makes him uncomfortable so I keep it to myself.  I constantly think about it though.. when I wake up, all day long, when I attempt to sleep, when Iâ€™m having a good or bad day. I think about how many different ways I could do it and how the world wouldnâ€™t notice if I was gone. 

Please donâ€™t tell me to go for a walk or things get better, Iâ€™m fucking depressed I have no motivation to even get out of bed and itâ€™s been a shitty 26 years thus far donâ€™t see much changing anytime soon.
