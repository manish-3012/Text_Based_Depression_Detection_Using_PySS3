Started to write letters to be found if I'm gone, where do I go from here?I always thought that there was stop much to live for but the monotony and the feeling of being out of control of my own life is just not enough any more. Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I wish I could talk to my gf of many years about it but I just can't broach the subject with her. Knowing my nephew would grow up while my brother would have to explain where one of his uncles was used to be enough but now it's just not doing the job.

Everyone around me knows something's wrong. I'm stressed, short with people, quick to anger, generally not a nice person to be around. None of them know why.

I started to think of what I would say in letters today and it struck me as a turning point in my attitude to suicide. I don't know what to do.

Can anybody help or give some insight?
