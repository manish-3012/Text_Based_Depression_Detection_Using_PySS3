I now know what I have to do. im not getting any better. i will never get better. im tired of people telling me that i will. it won't happen. the truth is, 10% of people with my diagnosis do, in fact, end up dead. I will be one of those. My kids told me today, again, to go away and never come back. they are 7 and 8 years old. I am 35 years old. don't tell me that kids say these things. I know that. i works iwth kids. but this isn't the first time. i cant take this anymore. they hate me. my husband hates me. i cant take their hateful words anymore, from him, or them. one of my kids hits me. its too much. i have no support in real life. none. no family supports me. they all have left me. i have no friends. this is just all too much. and, before you ask...yes to all the therapy and meds questions. :)  I have tried and tried and tried. I am tired. very, very tired. Why am i writing this? to get it off my chest. that's all. just needed to get it out. thank you, if you have read it.  ~L~
