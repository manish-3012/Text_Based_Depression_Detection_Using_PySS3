At this point I'm not even trying anymoreI really hate how reddit is the only place i can vent. I don't have anyone i know that cares to check on me. I use to be the friend that is ok with everyone. At this point i can't even talkto anyone. I can't even convey my thoughts online. I always feel that I'm being judged. It has been days since i last ate anything. I don't think i deserve to even be here. I just want to dissappear somewhere else. The voices in my head are getting louder. I would shut myself in my room for days. I hate that most people i know are saying that sad = depressed. I know this might seems like im invalidating other people feelings but knowing them it really make me feels like crap. I've tried to open up about my feelings to other people but no one wants me anymore. Everyone is better off without me. I hate how my heart just beat faster whenever I'm in a crowd, how my hands are always sweaty, how my lips are always dry and how i am worthless in other people eyes. I also hate that i can't sleep or how many time i would wake up in the middle of the night for no reason. I hate how short, fat and ugly i am whenever I'm with everyone else. I hate every moment of me breathing. I'm just a waste of space.
