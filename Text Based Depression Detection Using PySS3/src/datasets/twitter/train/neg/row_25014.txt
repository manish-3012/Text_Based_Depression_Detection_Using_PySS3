Its me? Or the the whole world want to die because of Covid-19 pandemic.Its been four months being stuck inside. Reading subreddit post. Some people want to do it. Because of hardship and pandemic panic. 
I do too. But, at sametime i don't want to. Because of my family and little things i appreciate.
