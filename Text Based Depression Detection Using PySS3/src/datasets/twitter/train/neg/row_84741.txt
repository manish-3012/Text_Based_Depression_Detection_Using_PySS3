Shit, should I do it?We don't know what's out there.
I'm tired as fuck because of all of this
But in the end we're all gonna die alone
I keep bouncing between the (everyone will be hurt because of it) to the (fuck it I'm miserable, no one matters, existence doesn't matter we're just like animals but with extra steps) ideology and it's killing me.
Animals die everyday 
I'm an animal, can I die today? Where will I go, what will become of me, will anything in the afterlife be affected by this, do any of these people, relationship or not matter? I've been told dozens of times that if it came down to it, and it was me or them, they'd save themself, so fuck it? Right??
Fuck the hotlines, fuck the medicine, fuck school, fuck these sociopathic and self destructive tendencies I got from my mom and dad, I'm ready to off myself, but i mean.. shit man I can't help but feel bad about it.
