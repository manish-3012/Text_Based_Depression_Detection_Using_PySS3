Goodnight everyoneI don't know honestly, I'm trying my best and I've tried my best, but I've been felling empty for so long. 

I don't know what's happened to me, but I can't go on like this. gosh I don't mean to sound so dramatic. I'm lost not because i don't know what to do, but because despite doing everything I could nothing has changed.
