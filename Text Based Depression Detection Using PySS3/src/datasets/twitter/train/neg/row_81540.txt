Happy new year friendsJust wanted to say happy new year to everybody who wakes up half heartedly trying to pull through the day and debating the point of their existence.  
Just wanted to say I'm sorry you're feeling this way, it isn't our fault.  
Just wanted to say congrats for pulling thru that chaotic year, and wanted to say I love you even though I don't know you.
Happy new year
