A poor bastard's final postBeen a bit since I posted here. I can't believe I made it this long. I have been trying to beat the odds my whole life but I can't be saved. I've posted my story before but the basics are chronic illness. I have a condition called pudendal neuralgia which causes intense pain while sitting, urinary and bowel issues and pain that shoots down your leg and in your pelvis. As a 20 year old college student this is one of the worst things that can happen. since I can't work, the life I'm living is just not sustainable. The depression this causes is severe and I've been dead for so long. Knowing how much this will hurt my family and friends is what has kept me here thusfar. However, I know if anyone was in my shoes they would do the same. 

It's really a shame since I'm actually a great guy but I have been wishing to go in my sleep for years now. I've never done more than kissed a girl since my health robbed that from me. To my family/friends is reading this, I tried I really did. I fought tooth and nail every minute but the payoff is just not there. I already saw the best doctor in the country and I'm still in pain. I just cried for an hour or so and have been crying lately for the people that care about me. They're going to miss me but it was over before it started. Chronic pain is something you don't get unless you have it, this is not a post pleading for help. Just a soulless kid letting you know it could be worse. I hope everyone on this sub finds happiness someday, the world is full of opportunity if you're physically able. Much love everybody my time's up.
