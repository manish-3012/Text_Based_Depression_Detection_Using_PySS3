I feel so incompetentIâ€™ve always had this feeling of being unable to do things and figure things out. Itâ€™s like my mind has no clue on how or what to do in the moment so I end up looking stupid. Itâ€™s worse when thereâ€™s people around me and my social anxiety makes me mess up my task. If it werenâ€™t for my parents I would most likely be homeless by now. I hate feeling like such a incompetent loser. Is there hope for me to make it on my own and prove to myself that Iâ€™m capable of surviving on my own or am I going to always be like this?
