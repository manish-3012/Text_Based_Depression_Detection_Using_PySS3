Thinking of ending it this FridayI have a few days now to think, but right now I think I'll end it on Friday. I've no idea if I should reach out to my friends or family beforehand or if I should just leave a note. I need to explain that it was nothing to do with them just a mental illness that I've been fighting a failing battle for years.
