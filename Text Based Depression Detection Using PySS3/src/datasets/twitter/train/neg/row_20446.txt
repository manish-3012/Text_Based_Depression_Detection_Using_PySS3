Not sure what to do anymore... In the past year my life has changed a lot. My birthday last year took everything I had not to kill myself I told myself it would get better but it didn't, it never really does. Sometimes I feel completely invisible to my family a fuck up at best. My parents have always been nicer to me then my siblings untill I came out. Suddenly they couldn't talk to me my unsupportive brother introduced me to my obsession of drugs and altered states of mind that i find to be addicting. My ex boyfriend who fueled my tendencys and I had a horrible deal of you can use my body if you give me what I want. But suddenly even when I didn't want anything he'd use me. Even when I said I didn't want it. But I stayed through cheating and lying and being used for my body. He eventually left and I found another but I worry he might be just as bad as the last one with all the lies. I have no friends and frankly no will to live. What's the point of living if everywhere you go everyone hates you? I have anxiety don't get me wrong but humans are social and because of my identity so many people just turn me away which is why leaving toxic relationships is impossible for me. I can't be alone or else I will have nothing holding me back. The only things I can truly trust is drugs but one day that will hurt me too. I never asked to be different. I never asked to be me but now I'm trapped and I don't know how to live anymore. All I can think about is how easy it would be to end it. The more time goes by the better option it becomes. I just have no idea what to do...
