Just want to get it off my chestI am 28. Today is my wifes 27th birthday and 
I have nothing for her....not even a card. We have 2 children 3 (autistic) and 4 months. There is no food in the house, their barely ever is. No gas in our 1 POS vehicle. According to the state I make too much to qualify for any form of assistance, even though we literally do not even make it paycheck to paycheck and we literally only buy the essentials. Living off cheap bread and cheap peanut butter and knock off drinks. I'm not gonna kill myself as that would put my family in,somehow,an even worse position. I bust my ass at work every single fucking day but its not enough. I can not keep up with my autistic daughter's therapy costs.......I'm so sick of living like this.On top of this my wife recently found out she has Cancer and we cant even afford the fucking $20 copays.... I hate the horrible husband and father that I have become.
