Iâ€™m TiredIâ€™m so fucking tired. I blew a chance to change my life and the life of my family and I couldnâ€™t fucking do it. They donâ€™t know and I donâ€™t know if I have the heart to tell them. Iâ€™m wasted potential and thereâ€™s no feasible way in my mind to change it. 

I had a full ride to an amazing engineering university and I flunked out. I canâ€™t get a job. All I ever do is drink and pop pills and party until my entire body hurts. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m tired of being tired. These nights are getting longer and longer and Iâ€™m ready for the night that never ends. I donâ€™t want to wake up anymore. 

I know that I should be grateful for what I have but Iâ€™d trade with anyone in a heartbeat. They can have it, they can have the opportunities I had. I donâ€™t deserve them. I deserve nothing but to OD and die in a corner. I deserve nothing but eternal sleep. I want this ride to end.
