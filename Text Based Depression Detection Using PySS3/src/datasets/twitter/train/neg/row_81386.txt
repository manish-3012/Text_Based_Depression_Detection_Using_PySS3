actually thought about it today, scaring myself lately.I posted in MMFB a while ago- for reference (http://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/14zby8/i_cant_make_friends_or_have_any_kind_of/) and I actually sat around thinking about what the point of it all is. I don't feel like living anymore if I am going to feel nothing but anxiety and feel like no one really cares. I know there isn't any place for me to go except up, but I have been stuck in the same place for so long that I don't know if that will ever happen. I just want friends and people that care about me, and every time I try to find them it gets harder and harder and hurts more and more, and I don't know if I can take anymore rejection.
