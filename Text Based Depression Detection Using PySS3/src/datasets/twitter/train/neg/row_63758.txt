just found out that my â€œfriendsâ€ have been making fun of me behind my back for 2+ years.This may sound like shit since im only thirteen but i dont want to live anymore. I have known for the majority of my life that i am horrendously ugly. I have a bowl cut, no muscle, very unathletic and a horrible since of fasion. Last year i decided to home-school in hopes that i would get better grades because i passed like 2 classes in 6th grade. I have horrible ADD and that made homeschooling a nightmare. I decided to go back to school (a small school with like 200 ppl in it) and they just arenâ€™t the people i used to know. They poked fun at me and when i tried to defend myself they told the teacher and i contue to get detention when they â€˜tattle taleâ€™ on me. I have tried to tell the teachers but, they always tell me to just tell me to get over it. Their most recent thing was calling me the kazoo kid from that shitty vine. Some if the other things is calling me the know it all from polar express, the â€˜saintâ€™ when i tried to tell a teacher and they invited me to a party where we watched home alone. They kept comparing me to that kid in it and it was just so bad. When i told them to quit calling me kazoo kid they told me that they were â€˜laughing with meâ€™ and that â€˜i should be glad to be called kazoo kidâ€™. I cant fucking stand my life. Im going to kill myself. I have some rope and a forest behind my house. If any of my classmates are reading this, this is your fucking fault and you should go to hell. Goodbye.
