I'm about to disappoint my partnerMy partner is the first person who openly told me "don't die, I'll miss you, don't hurt yourself, I'm worried about you"

This lockdown has destroyed my mental health, I am forced to live with my parents who are very unsupportive of my livestyle and continue to push me down. University work is incredibly stressful since my parents don't believe me when I tell them I have to study and mock me for trying to work.

I'm currently looking for clinics that offer assisted suicide because I'm convinced this is going to be easier than facing all the challenges in my life right now. 

I want to talk to my partner but I can't since she has her own problems to deal with. 

I don't know where I can find the strength to go on anymore.

sorry if this post is unreadable or anything, I don't have the mental capacity to find the right words right now.
