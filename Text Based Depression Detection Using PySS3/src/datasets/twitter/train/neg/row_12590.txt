I'm so sick of this shit.Let me make a few things clear. I'm 18, and attending community college (and will go to a four year college after) at the moment. I see all of these signs of any possible efforts I make being useless in the end. I fear that I'll just live on the streets, unable to do anything with myself but catch a bullet with my brain. 

I keep getting up in the morning, but it's really difficult to do so sometimes. I don't think I can stand much longer.

...and I can talk about so much more that convinces me that life will not be worth living.
