Goodbye everyone.This is it, this is really it. I'm going to chug down 3 gallons of bleach, pine-sol, and laundry detergent. I have them all right next to me with the caps off. I should slowly die off after I drink them. I appreciated all of the support I've got in this subreddit. But I just can't continue living like this anymore. There is no other way out of this rather than killing myself. I hope you all live a much better life than I did! And I'm so sorry everyone, but this is goodbye. 


Goodbye everyone!
