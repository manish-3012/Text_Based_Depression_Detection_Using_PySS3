I posted on here 19 days ago....and very little has changed. Things have slowly gone downhill, despite all that's happened in the past 19 days, I'd say two weeks within those 19 days were fairly unforgettable.. but I genuinely miss the circumstances in which those two (really three and a half weeks) were spent. The only person I have really any true feelings for is quite hard to get through. Despite what I (vaguely) know, I don't even know how they truly feel about me. Part of me says "why bother?", but I know I can't. Regardless.. the past four/five days have been almost a blur. I've gone out for walks everyday for five, six hours at a time.. I still feel manage to feel worse. I keep coming to the same conclusion, I'm not sure why I even bother waking up. There's a quote by Vladimir Lenin I read that's stuck with me. It seems very relevant, but I still.. don't know. No matter what I do or try.. what's the point? Just offing myself seems the best option.. there's very little for me to do other wise. Suicide, amongst a few important things, is the only thing on my mind.. it's very tempting at this point
