Killing myself in a few hoursI sneaked a bottle of bleach into my room. I'll wait until deep night, maybe 1 or 2 AM, and then I'll drink, knowing that since my family's asleep they're less likely to intervene if I start making noises.

I'm posting because I feel obligated. I can't be happy without improving myself, and I can't improve myself because I'm lazy. I fucked up in PMs with the person I loved most in the world (user miss - something because I don't want to make your account public) and now she hates me, though I can't blame her. I have no redeemable traits in any way, shape, or form, and I can't be happy because I'm too lazy to do the very little work I need to put in in order to be happy.
