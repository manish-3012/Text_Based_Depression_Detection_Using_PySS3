Iâ€™m really tiredIâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts for the pasts six years but for the past one year its become worse. I tried killing myself a month back but i failed at that. I cant even properly kill myself. 
I attempted today as well but before doing anything, i called my friends to say goodbye. 
They came right over and now I wish I hadnâ€™t. 
I donâ€™t know how else to escape. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m frustrated. 
I want to stop existing.
