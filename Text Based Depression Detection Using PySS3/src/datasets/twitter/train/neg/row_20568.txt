I want to liveI feel heavy, burdened. I feel lonely. No, I am not hurting, I am not, I feel anxious. Nobody cares; as if they are around me only because they are courteous towards me. I am irritating, I am frustrating. I drain life out of people. I feel like an old woman trapped in a young body. I fear how I would grow old. I want them to abandon me, only so that I can take the last one step. I know I don't deserve life. I am too selfish to live. I am too cruel for life. I hate how noise brings me peace. Silence kills me. I love the noise of heavy industrial machines, that subdues their voices. I want them to abandon me, I can't take it anymore. They don't care. Why would they when nobody wants to care. Sometimes I wake up feeling as if I have been tied with heavy chains or go back to sleep feeling the same. Sometimes, I wake up and go back to sleep feeling the same. I wish I could die in my sleep. But, I don't want to die right now. I have a little sister, I don't want to bother her with my death. She loves me more than I love her. I want two daughters, I don't want to pass on me in them. I don't want them to feel what I feel almost everyday. I want them to be happy. I want to live.
