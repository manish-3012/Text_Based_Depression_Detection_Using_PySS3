I think I'm finally done.I posted last night and I got some really sweet replies I screenshot them and read them when I woke up and again about an hour ago (thanks to who commented, I appreciate it) but now I'm lying here I feel so emotionally and mentally drained I feel like this is finally it. Today could be the day.... I'm ready.
