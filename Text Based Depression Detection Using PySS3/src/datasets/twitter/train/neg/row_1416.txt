Something's broken in my headI'm going to end it all tonight

I don't know what was wrong with me as a child but I would stress myself out about absolutely everything, to the point where I couldn't breathe, and I still do to this day. It eventually drove me to the point where I accepted death as a possible way out in situations, of which I would think about daily... It was at that moment that I felt something broke, because since I was around 13 (I'm currently 18) this urge to just end it all, to avoid all future stress, has grown to the point where I'm becoming dangerously close.
It's evolved past the point of being linked to depression, or stress, or anxiety. This urge to end everything is becoming completely independent from my emotional state, and I feel it constantly now. 
I've already tried to hang myself a few times, then cry myself to sleep when it didn't work. I used to do it as a way to scare myself back into shape, but the more I do it, the more I realize that in all honesty I just don't want to be alive anymore, and each time I do it I get a little closer to completely losing consciousness and becoming brain dead in that tight, embracing rope.

I guess this is a cry for help. I used to talk to friends about this, but I told everyone that I'm fine now, deep down I know it'd be easier to kill myself if they weren't worried about me... I don't know what to do, I'm dangerously close to trying again tonight which is why I'm posting this.
