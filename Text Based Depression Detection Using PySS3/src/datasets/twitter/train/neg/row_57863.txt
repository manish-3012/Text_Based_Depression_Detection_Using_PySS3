:/Middle school was the last time I felt genuinely happy, I had stuff I was going through then too but I knew how to still enjoy and appreciate the little things. I didnâ€™t let depression, anxiety or my ed completely like ruin life for me. I also held onto the idea that things would get better. Then in highschool I realized it wonâ€™t get better lol. I wasnâ€™t happy anymore but I at least had friends to talk to and do a bunch of dumb things with and thatâ€™s what kept me distracted. Now Iâ€™m in college and all my ex friends and I chose different paths. At my college people only talk to each other in class and then never again so I donâ€™t have any real connections with people anymore. Basically the only thing I have left to hold on to is finishing school (just to prove to myself that I can do it and make my family proud). Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s giving me purpose rn and keeping me â€œbusyâ€. Iâ€™m a junior atm and Iâ€™m really scared to finish. After college Iâ€™ll have nothing. The idea of working until I die isnâ€™t promising either. This is probably just how growing up goes for everyone but I honestly rather kill myself
