I want nothingness. I feel my instinctual fear of death is the only thing keeping me here.I have this drive within me that I know will never be fulfilled. Every time I get close to the light it gets snuffed out by either myself or the infinite barrage of obstacles that is "life". 


Fuck money. Fuck what it does to your self worth and perception of purpose. Oh yeah sure, I can just think of all the people who love me and the beauty of the world while I starve to death on the streets. 

I feel alone even with my closest friends. I feel like a closet of 10 different interchangeable masks to put on when being social. I have these moments where a night with friends is ending, we all wave bye or say a couple jokes and laugh as we walk to our separate cars; my smile instantly falls away the second I'm alone in the car. The world closes in on me and I bawl my eyes out for reasons unknown to me.

  I feel I'm holding on to a lover who has grown tired of my endless struggle with reality. I've betrayed her trust too many times. she has now voiced her doubts in me being able to mend what has been done, every moment I spend with her that feels like I'm not making any progress feels like a failure. A missed chance to save the one beautiful thing I have in my life and I allowed it to slip away because I couldn't stop myself from feeding my own ego in the past through casual flirting. I failed.

The art I once found myself lost in feels directionless and insignificant in a world full of such chaos and pain. Tell me all you want that art is the single most important thing in the world, but at the end of the day what did I really do? What did I change? Nothing.

I just want nothing. I want darkness. 
Fear of death is such a burden when you truly are not cut out for the 21st century world we live in.
