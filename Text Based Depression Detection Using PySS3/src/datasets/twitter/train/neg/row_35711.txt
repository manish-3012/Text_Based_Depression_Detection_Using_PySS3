idekeverything is so hard and i have no idea how much longer i can hold on. the idea of life after death used to scare me but now i embrace it. i empathize with how my mom will feel when iâ€™m dead (i hurt her enough already just by feeling this way) and i think thatâ€™s the only thing preventing me from jumping off the roof of my schoolâ€™s parking garage.

things have only been getting worse for months. digression after digression. yet iâ€™m trying every day of my life to get involved in my community, go to my classes, work, and be with friendsâ€”because logically filling up my schedule with activities and ppl who support me should help at least a little, right?

of course they do, but not always. and i donâ€™t blame anyone who tries to help me (not many people tbh, i have few friends and none of them really care about me enough to want to help, my family thinks itâ€™s a lot easier to control my mood than it is, and my boyfriend [definitely my greatest source of joy before things got so bad] recently left me bc the depression was too much to handle)â€”iâ€™m really grateful for everyone and everything thatâ€™s helped... i just donâ€™t know why i canâ€™t hold onto the good feelings. i donâ€™t know why i canâ€™t feel good. and it suckss dicklkkmmkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
