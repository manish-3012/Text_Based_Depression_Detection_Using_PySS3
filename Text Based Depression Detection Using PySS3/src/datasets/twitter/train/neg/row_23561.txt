I'm not sad. I'm not even depressed.I often get suicidal when I'm depressed. It happens pretty often. I ride it out and it passes. I have PTSD mainly. Over a month ago the place I was going to for therapy couldn't see me anymore because my case was too advanced. I haven't found another therapist yet. I've kind of been neutral these last few weeks. Just going through the motions.

I'm planning on killing myself. I can objectively look at my life and see there is no reason to go on. I can't work. I can barely walk. There's never enough money to get through the month. I have 2 cats that I love dearly but I know someone else could probably give them a better home. I just don't want to live anymore.
