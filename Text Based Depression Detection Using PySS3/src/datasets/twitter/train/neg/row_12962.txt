zero reason to lifeI can't even vent to no one in particular anymore i guess i just posted dpression stuff on my snapchat story and was accused of a ll kinds of shit and called a freak, probably ccus they knew i;m trans?? i'm drunk and I don't even care anymore. i've been trying to just *exist* near someone like not even take their time but be neart them while they study at home or work on their cospaly or whatever but I can't even do that??? I don't even open up about how i am to peop;e o actiial;y know this is so bullshit. And everyone I have potential to date ignores me as soon as i come out as trans. I'm gonna die alone and unloved and with a body i hate, why should ieven bother with life, why do people even call the cops. last time i checked myslef in two friends even stopped tapling to me. Like, why get help if people abandon me for getting help? there's literally zero reason toe ven try at this point
