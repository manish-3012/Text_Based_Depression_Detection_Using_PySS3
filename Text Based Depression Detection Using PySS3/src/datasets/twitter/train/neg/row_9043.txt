My boyfriend wants me to live. I donâ€™t.Venting. I recently got off suicide watch at a facility after my boyfriend found me hurting myself in the bath tub. Every night since then he has cried, held me and told me he loves me and wants me to live and have a long life. But I donâ€™t want it. Iâ€™m really tired. Iâ€™m exhausted. I am not happy. He is probably the only steady and positive thing in my life, has been for a few years, but itâ€™s not enough to make me want to live. I donâ€™t want to be selfish and hurt him so much, but iâ€™m sure he will get over it. He deserves so much better anyway. It doesnâ€™t make me feel better that every day he asks how iâ€™m feeling and asks me to tell him my dark thoughts. It makes me feel like a burden. The only person I really have and iâ€™m straining him mentally. I hate myself.
