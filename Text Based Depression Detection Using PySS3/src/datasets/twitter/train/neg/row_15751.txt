Iâ€™m tired of guilt being the only reason I donâ€™t go through with it.Every day I get closer to it not being enough. I just feel like thereâ€™s no way anyone else will hurt as much as Iâ€™m hurting. I feel like I can explain it enough so that hopefully theyâ€™ll understand and make peace with it. That they can know that thereâ€™s no helping me and that it isnâ€™t anyoneâ€™s fault. I just wasnâ€™t cut out for this life.
