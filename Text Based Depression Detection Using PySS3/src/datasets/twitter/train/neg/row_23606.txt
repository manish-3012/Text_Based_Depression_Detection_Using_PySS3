I just canâ€™t take thisI feel so much pressure to stay alive for the sake of my family. I love them dearly and I know they love me. They love me but I absolutely hate myself. A very close friend helped me deal with my depression, she made everything okay. About a month we stopped talking and I am in pieces. Sheâ€™s doing great, and Iâ€™m happy for that, because she deserves to be happy. But here I am, alone, afraid, and forgotten.

I wish my family hated me so I could just vanish and not be missed
