Trying to hold on.Keep your head.up.

That's what I hear alot.

It will be okay.  

That's what I say alot.

I'm running out of steam, though.  Minor things are going wrong, but it's like watching the first stones if an avalanche fall.

I don't know whether to let it fall and try to rebuild or let the avalanche consume me or just end it because I see it coming.

I'm starting to prewrite messages for those I will leave behind.  I know they care, but caring doesn't pay bills or buy food or make things better.

I know it's selfish, but it's getting to be harder than it appears to be worth to keep going, keep trying.

I have a few things that must be done before I give up.  I have one of my kids for visitation right now, so I have to get him home Thursday. I have to make it until then and reevaluate. 

Not today.  Soon, unless something changes.
