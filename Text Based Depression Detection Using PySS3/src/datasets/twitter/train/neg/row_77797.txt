My will to live is gone because my relationship is of 9 years is over and I don't know what to do, please help meI posted to relationship advice, depression, offmychest and got nothing. I feel like nobody in the world cares and the only answers I got were callous and unfeeling.

My girlfriend of 9 years told me she doesn't love me romantically anymore. She said she loves me as a friend and I'm trying to be okay with this but the idea of losing that future I wanted so much is killing me.

I wanted to get a house with her, I wanted to live with her forever and I felt like everything would be simple. With her by my side I felt like I could get through anything and be myself, live happily.

It's gone and I'm fucking screaming and crying inside, she's sleeping next to me and I want to hold onto her so bad. We always had it good, I want so badly for her to feel love for me again and that these circumstances are temporary. She doesn't want to leave, cut ties, she thinks of me as family.

God I'm so confused please help. And leaving her side is not an option, I don't care what happens I always want to be here.

I don't want to die but I don't know what else to live for
