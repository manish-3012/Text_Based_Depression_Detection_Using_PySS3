Losing hopeI've never posted anything on reddit before but I don't really know where to turn.  

I've sunk into complete darkness again.  This happened last year around the same time and lasted for 6 months.  On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst, my depression is at a 9.5 today.  It started at a 7 or 8 last week and is getting worse.  The only reason I haven't self injured  is because that requires energy.  The only reasons I haven't gone through with my plan is because of my 3 year old and my girlfriend.  

I go to therapy once a week.  IOP 3 days a week and see my psychiatrist monthly.  She has already increased my Latuda and I haven't noticed any changes.  I just keep sinking lower.  I had a major attempt that was almost successful 10 years ago and I don't remember ever feeling this bad.  

I don't want to be a mother anymore.  I love my girlfriend but I feel like this darkness is going to ruin everything.  I'm in so much pain.  I just want it to end.  It just feels like this blanket of darkness that is being pushed on top of me, suffocating me, stealing all joy out of my life.  I'm doing everything I'm supposed to be doing to take care of my mental health and at the end of the day I still want to die.  

I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for here, but I needed to get this out.
