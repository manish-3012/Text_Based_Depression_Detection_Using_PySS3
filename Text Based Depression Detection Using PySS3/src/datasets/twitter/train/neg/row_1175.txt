Iâ€™ve become nothing but the physical embodiment of depression, self-hate, and rage for others. I want to die.How do cisgender men and cisgender women enjoy intercourse simultaneously? If so, how?

Men want pressure and the vagina to be â€œtightâ€ so that it will close up and/or push them out. If the vaginal muscles are tight, it means that the woman is tense and/or scared. For men to enjoy intercourse, the woman would need to be scared during.

But for the woman to enjoy intercourse, sheâ€™d need to be lubricated, aroused, and experience vaginal tenting (the elongation and widening and loosening of the vagina.)

But that would ruin it for the man because the vagina wouldnâ€™t be closing up and tight and pushing them out anymore.

How do people enjoy life? How do they have sex? How do they get an ounce of pleasure from anything? I want my pain to go away. I want it to be over. 

Is it good for the vagina to close up during Does an extremely narrow vagina feel better to the man? Does it feel like the vagina is squeezing to the man or closing up? 5. Can a vagina be too narrow? What does tight mean and is tighter better? What are men referring to? What makes men orgasm from stimulation from their penis (pressure, movement, tightness)? How do cisgender women manage to enjoy penetration?

I feel like I have a lot of fear surrounding men because they just want to force vaginas open.
