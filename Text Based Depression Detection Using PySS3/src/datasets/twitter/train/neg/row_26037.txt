I want to kill myself but I don't have the courage.Honestly the more I think about it I just want to be noticed. I wish I could turn into a little ghost and float above my body, wait for it to be found and see the reactions of people. I like (I guess) being alive. I like doing fun things. But I feel like a ghost already. People never call me, text me, want to hang out with me. Every time I reach out to people they either ignore or keep things short. I want to be successful, I want to be married, I honestly want to be like everyone else but no one cares. no one gives me a shot. When I bring it up they always tell me just to be thankful. I am, but I don't see what's wrong with wanting to be at the level other people are.

If I die maybe they would care then. but I wont be around to sense it. so what's the point.
