I tried I can't deal with it anymoreI'm tired of being the voice of reason, to being the glue that keeps them together and of those 3.... I can't stand them anymore, they make me feel miserable, and shitty about myself...   killing myself seems the only way to escape the lies, abuse, manipulation  and  irresponsibly of them
I try to make them happy, but they never are. I told them I have depression they just told I was attention seeking. None of them take me seriously and I feel empty in the inside and out but deep down I know I just want to vent it out to someone plz on the kindness of ur heart ccan u  talk to me
