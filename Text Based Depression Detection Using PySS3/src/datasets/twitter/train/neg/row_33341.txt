ExhaustedIâ€™m such a terrible person. Some things have happened lately that have brought my life and the way I think about it to a head. I thought I had it all figured out, I thought it was everyone elseâ€™s fault but my own, I thought I knew everything.

I put my own feelings before everyone elseâ€™s on a constant basis. I was selfish and self absorbed. If I didnâ€™t get my way then fuck everything, everyone is going to hurt with me. I simply could not take responsibility for my own actions.

And now everything is gone. Friendships, relationships, everything that made life worth living. I realize now that itâ€™s my fault and I donâ€™t know how to cope with it. My childhood made it so that I donâ€™t know how to cope with anything.

Iâ€™ve got outpatient treatment lined up to start this week and Iâ€™ve felt good about that the last few days but some things have hit me today that make it impossible to see the future I COULD have.

I feel like Iâ€™ve fucked up so badly that I donâ€™t deserve any future. I took a pill yesterday that made me sleep for almost 24 hours because I canâ€™t stand to be alone with my thoughts. I just want to keep sleeping. I need the pain to stop. I donâ€™t know what to do.

Iâ€™m so tired.
