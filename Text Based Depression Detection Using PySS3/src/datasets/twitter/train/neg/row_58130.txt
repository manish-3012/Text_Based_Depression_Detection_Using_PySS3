I wish I lived aloneI think of suicide a lot. My home life probably depresses me more than anything. It's not her fault but there is something about my partners negative energy that makes it really hard want to go on. We recently bought a house together and I support her so I can't leave or take a break very easily. A part of me thinks if Iived alone maybe I wouldn't feel like this. Another part of me feels like I desperately need her. If I had money maybe I could distract myself with pleasures like traveling and nice meals. At the moment I don't even have health insurance. I have a $1400 mortgage, $1000 per month in child care, around $30k in credit card debt, no health insirance. She has a hyperactive son who I can't relate to and don't mesh well with. I have no direction in my career despite some talent. A few weeks ago after work I went to the top story of a 7 story parking garage and allowed myself tue opportunity to do it but I couldn't. Yet I think of it all the time and wish I had. I'm thinking of trying again. 

I'm also recovering from severe opiate addiction so my brain is all scrambled. Nothing makes sense and I just want to sit around in my off time and let myself go but, understandably, my partner gets mad when I'm in that state.

I have seen a couple therapists who were good and who I really liked but it didn't actually help.

I haven't tried anti-depressants but I don't really want to go down that route.
