byeI try to give my love to everyone and nobody ever cares about trying to understand why I might shut down and how I am going through a lot. When I die if anyone even pretends they care about me, they can all go to hell. I beg for understanding I beg for someone to just understand what itâ€™s like to live a life where you feel like a dead body walking, but everyone seems to take my pain and trivialize it. So Iâ€™m done trying to explain or show anyone how I truly feel inside. Goodbye.
