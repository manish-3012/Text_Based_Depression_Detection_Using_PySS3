Surviving Tonight.So the result of last night was that I took some pills with the intention of taking pills until I lost consciousness (and that's all that happened basically- I also stopped before losing unconscious ie: didn't pass out in my bed) as a way of dealing with pain and vacuousness  (on my phone sorry for misspellings or formatting issues).  When I say vacuousness, what I essentially mean is boredom accompanying long term emotional paralysis and fear. 

I have a trauma history and PTSD diagnosis in addition to depression.

I'm not paralyzed emotionally in every moment of every day, but I am inevitably in that state soon after I start trying to look for a job. I don't get very far because of an experience of terror. My living situation is bad and untenable. I have to get a job.

Fiilled out application for state funded program that helps adults with psychiatric disabilities get jobs. It's a long process.
