I wanted to call the suicide hotline today.Found the numbers for my country on suicide.org a short while ago. Today was the day I decided to finally call it and seek guidance on the matter.

Took a bit of courage and walking back and forth but about 1-2 hours ago I dialed the number...

Nothing happened.

I'm guessing the numbers don't fucking exist anymore or something. None of the 3 worked.

Search on google concerning a suicide hotline only shows news dating back to Feb 2018 and may 2017 about opening said hotline. None of the psychlogical aid numbers I'm finding work either.

Is this a subtle hint from life that not even government would want shits like me to continue existing?
