You donâ€™t do anythingHey there. Im losing faith in myself in doing anything good anymore. My mom said the same thing to me before. She also so said she cant go a day without yelling at me. I try to be good but I end up doing something wrong and it is always the same shit I do wrong unlike my older brother. He always works super hard. He would stay up till 1am to study and still would wake up earlier than me. Heâ€™s crazy smart and when he does nothing wrong, not get yelled at, does almost all the chores in the house and what do I do? I turn on the Nintendo switch and play smash for 2 hours while he does everything. I feel stupid compared to him. Heâ€™s also athletic and a very fast learner. And always know the right thing to do unlike me. Everyone in my family is either a doctor or wants to be a doctor and I just want to be what, a gamer? Its stupid how I am unlike my family because they want to be or plan to be a doctor, something like a job that benefits life. I just want to be a professional gamer because I love playing games competitively but its not like it benefits life or anyone in any way. I envy everyone. If im good at something, theres obviously millions or billions people better than me at it. I feel so weak and someone who wont do anything good for the world. Im lost and dont know what to do. I thought about stabbing myself but I cant not because it  would end my life but im just scared of the pain If I had a gun or any painless way to kill myself, I wouldnâ€™t hesitate and pull the trigger. I tried being something to my family but I gave up 2 years ago since I went nowhere trying to make my family happy. What do I do?
