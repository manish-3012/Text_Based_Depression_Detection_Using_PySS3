I am not going to commit suicide.If I go to jail, if I end up homeless, then so be it.

I am not afraid anymore. 

Thank you all for the help I got  here. Maybe I can return the favor when things turn around.
I just hope I can get a hold of some good books to read.
Merry Christmas, happy holidays and I hope you have a good 2016.
