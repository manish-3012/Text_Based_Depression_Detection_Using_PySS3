I canâ€™t.I was having a panic attack and I asked my mom to sit with me in my room because I hate being alone when Iâ€™m super anxious, but we got in to an argument because my mom said that the way I was acting was making HER anxious. She always does this and I finally snapped and told her itâ€™s not about her. We got into a huge argument and that was the breaking point for me. If not even my mother loves me then Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™ve been wanting to do it for so long but this was he breaking point. When I work up the courage Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I lost the battle. I canâ€™t fight anymore.
