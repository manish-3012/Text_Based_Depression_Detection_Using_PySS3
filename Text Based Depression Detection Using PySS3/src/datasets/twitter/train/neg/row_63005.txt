I'm so lost.I have no friends, no hobbies, and I have no life experience outside of my family. I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to interact with people, my anxiety is so bad that most days I don't even leave my apartment unless I have to work. When my ex left me she said that I don't know "how to be a person." I just need some help I guess. I don't know what to do at this point. Not a day goes by that I don't fantasize about jumping off the bridge I have to cross to get to work. This is a last ditch effort.
