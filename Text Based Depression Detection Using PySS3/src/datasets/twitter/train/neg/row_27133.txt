My second attemptSilly me. I forgot to fix where I post this message. 

This marks my second attempt at my own life. As stated in my two previous misposts, I've taken 300 pills in total, 2,3g altarax, 700mg escitalopram and 190mg Vallergan. 

I'm done with life and everything in it. I'm actually not very scared atm, more excited and at peace. But I would wish that someone kept me company while I wait. Won't someone please talk to me?
