has yours ever stopped then came back?used to be pretty depressed as a child/teenager. Went away a few years ago. Life has been A LOT better.

Well, the problem is the thoughts came back, but in a more serious way. It feels like I could actually go through with it. Although, I don't get sad and emotional, I don't get the thoughts of "fuck everything" this time. It just feels more real when I have the thoughts now.

Like, I could just go in the cabinet and down the bottle and wait outside by the pool and wait for it to be done so life can just end already.

Anyone ever go through a similar experience? 

A bit weird

Edit: I've also been getting pretty irritable and angry lately as well...
