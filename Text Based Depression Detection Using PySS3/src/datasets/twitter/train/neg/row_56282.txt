No one cared.I am a twenty two year old male. I live with three roommates, two of which are dating while the third roommate and myself have our own separate relationships. Myself and my fiancÃ© are planning our wedding, two months ago my work began to slow down on assignments for myself and my coworkers. This is where it all began. Once this slow down happened I was able to focus more on my fiancÃ© and the roommates and I had more available time to become closer as friends, yet as this went on my mental stability began to takes its course. I now spend most of my nights in my room while my available time during the day is spent job hunting or simply helping with more wedding plans. Last night my fiancÃ© and I had a disagreement and caused me to have several nightmares sleeping for about fifteen hours straight. I woke up today ( 05/31/19 ) to only â€œ kiss and make up â€œ see one more venue take my fiancÃ© to work and come home to lie down on my bed. For the past several hours Iâ€™ve heard people come and go in the house only to want to remain absolutely still and silent. The thoughts of shooting myself have occasionally raced through my mind. Iâ€™m currently just lying on my bed staring at the ceiling breathing and debating.
