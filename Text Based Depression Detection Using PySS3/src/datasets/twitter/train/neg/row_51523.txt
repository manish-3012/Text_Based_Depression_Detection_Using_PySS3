I hid the knives tonight.I'm currently sitting in my bed, with one ear open, to make sure I can hear my boyfriend breathing. Snoring. Anything. He was triggered about 4 and a half hours ago by a bad day at work, and a demon he's been battling with himself for years. He started screaming. He is unhappy. He was verbally attacking me and threatening to hurt me. I chased him outside to his car. He told me I needed to get out. He didn't want to live anymore. He said I wouldn't want to be in the car right now. It's 27Â° and icy. All the roads and surfaces are black ice. I thought I was going to have to call someone to get him. I thought I would have to commit him. I talked him down. For now. I hope. I called out of work in the morning. He came inside. He screamed some more. He hates himself. He hates that he is unhappy. He doesnt want to live. He didn't blame me. He blamed himself. Always. He calmed down. He wants to be alone. I have his car keys. I hid the knives. He laid down on the couch. turned off the lights. I think he's sleeping now. I'm so tired. I'm afraid to fall asleep. I'm afraid to leave him alone. I don't want him to die. Even if we aren't together, at least he will be alive.  I'm so so tired. This is all so complicated. I still don't know what to do. I want to save him. 
Today is his birthday.
I don't know what to do. I dont know where to turn. I don't know what I need. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do
