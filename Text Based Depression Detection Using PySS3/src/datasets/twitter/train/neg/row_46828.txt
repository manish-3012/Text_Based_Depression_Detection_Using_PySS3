Just a ramble, no threat (TW for SI)I guess I don't really know what to say. I don't feel like I can trust myself not to hurt myself tonight. Earlier I cut a big gash in my thigh but managed to steri strip it closed. At the time, I felt slightly sick at myself for doing it but glad I resisted doing it on my arm. Now that I know I can close it OK, I feel like I'm more attracted to the idea of cutting open my wrist. I don't know if it's synonymous with wanting to kill myself, even though I've been having some pretty bleak suicidal thoughts. I said goodbye to some friends today without them realizing. At the very least, I want to cut myself open and dig deep until I find something that doesn't repulse me. Or just bleed out all the bad things in me. That obviously isn't sensible. I don't even think I want to talk to anyone because I get so tired talking about what's wrong, because there just is no way to fix any of it. I guess I just wanted someone to know. Sorry, r/SW.

**ETA:** Actually, if you happen to read this, it'd be great to at least hear from someone. As the night progresses, I seem to be feeling worse.
