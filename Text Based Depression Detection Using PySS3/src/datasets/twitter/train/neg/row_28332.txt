No-one can relate.I have been really suicidal, after a heartbreak I had more than eighteen months ago. We weren't even together, she was a crush, but I have hardly even looked at a girl since.

I have been watching a lot of videos about suicide. People who are against suicide say that you should think about the people who love you. People who ARE suicidal say they will never do it, because of the ones they love.

I have even seen goodbye videos, where people thank their loved ones.. even when people have no strength left, they have love.

The fact that everyone can just take that for granted makes my isolation even worse.. who else can say they have no-one?
