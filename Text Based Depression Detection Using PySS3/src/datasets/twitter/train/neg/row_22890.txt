My birthday is upcoming, and it feels like an obligationMy birthday is in a few days away, and I really donâ€™t like celebrating it since it feels like an obligation. I just want to lay in bed, relax, and do nothing. But my girlfriend pushes us to go out of the country for my birthday, and she is getting mad why I donâ€™t like to. I mean, bruh how are we getting out of the country if all flights are banned here due to covid. Then she gets mad telling me that I just donâ€™t want to spend time with her. Itâ€™s my birthday, but why am I the one making her day special. I donâ€™t know if it is just me that Iâ€™m selfish or what. I really donâ€™t know what to say. 


Thank you for reading this.
