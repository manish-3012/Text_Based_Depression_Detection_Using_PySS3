I miss my friends so much.I miss my friends so much. They were the only family I'd ever known and they're the reason I made it this far with everyone else in my life being against me. They were the only way I had to cope with my psychologically abusive family and with living in a place I simply don't feel like I belong in. I don't think I'll ever find a group of people so compatible or ever bond with someone the same way ever again. we shared so many external and internal issues and being able to commiserate with them was what kept me sane all these years. but then I had to go and ruin it all for myself. Been five months since then and everything is so much harder to deal with now. Im no longer able to ignore my family's constant abuse and the things others say to and about me are starting to get to me. I just can't do it alone. I don't know what to do.
