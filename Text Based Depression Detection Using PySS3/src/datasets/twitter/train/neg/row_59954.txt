I googledI googled, "I see no way out". The first link is to a reddit suicide watch from 2015. So I figured I ought to post. I honestly don't see a way out. My life has been reactionary based. I have never been one to have life goals. I was told everything would fall into place. It hasn't. The shrinks later on told my a bit why. Childhood brain damage left me inept at future planning and a bunch of other things. 

Well... that isn't quite true in some senses. Some things did but they were reactionary. I didn't seek the job I have now nor did I ever want it. I remember being in 2nd grade telling myself I never ever want to work in what I do as it would be a living hell. It worked out in that I made a couple million but I don't have a clue how to spend it. It is just a number on a statement. 

I wanted to share my life with someone. To have a family, be a dad, a grandpa. Only ended up being the kooky uncle. I had to let go of the woman I was with. Her world was nothing but lies. I know now why she lied but all the same there was no need to lie to me. With the brain damage I have I see how things are and adjust/react to them. If I am fed lies I shut down because there is no way to react to untruths.

Now with my waning life as it is, old, covid-19 era, reclusive, I do not see a way to see a way out. I go try to sleep. I tell myself it is ok. But there in a sense I am lying to myself and I shut down.
