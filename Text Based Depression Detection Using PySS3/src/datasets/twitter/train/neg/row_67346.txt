I just put a bag over my headNever done it. Didn't know what to expect. Was hopeful I could just pass out with it on my head and not wake up tomorrow. I don't know why I thought it would be easier to breath.. it's not easy though. I hit a point where I was gasping and tore it off.. I guess I'm not drunk enough. I just need to be drunker and then I won't have the energy to fight back. I need to make my body limp. So I just succumb to it. 
I just need to let go and let it do it's thing I guess
 It's still on my head.. like an ugly hat. And stupid yellow giant tiger bag. If only it could solve all my issues and take me tonight.
Where is courage when you need it.
