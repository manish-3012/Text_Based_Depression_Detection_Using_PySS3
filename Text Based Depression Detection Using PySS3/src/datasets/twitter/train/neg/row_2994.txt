Can't continueI don't even know where to begin. I don't want to live anymore. All I know how to feel anymore is anger and depression. Numerous family members and friends tried to talk me through it, but none of this has helped at all. The emotional intensity of living has proven too much to bear. Yesterday I screamed out in anger by myself until my voice couldn't keep up anymore. The day before, I didn't do anything besides cry in bed. When I'm angry, I'm homicidal. Depressed, suicidal. Nothing I do or try works for very long, if it works at all. I'm done with this. I don't even know why I'm posting here. Nothing can help me
