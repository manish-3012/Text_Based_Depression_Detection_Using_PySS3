I canâ€™t cope foreveriâ€™m so lonely. i donâ€™t know how itâ€™s possible that no one wants me. what is wrong with me that makes me so repulsive to people. people will just leave me alone and abandoned out of habit. why canâ€™t i be good enough for someone. i know i have to kill myself soon but i think 16 is too young right now. i guess i will live through a little more pain
