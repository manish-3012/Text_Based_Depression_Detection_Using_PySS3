I've never felt more aloneI want to jump. I don't want to have to feel this way anymore. I don't have any friends, my family doesn't care about me, I lost my childhood to neglect and madness. Even my online friends are all gone. I want to be drunk 24/7 but I'm about out of money now and it'll dry up.. All I've ever wanted was to be close to others and be normal. I hate this world. I'll try again to end things
