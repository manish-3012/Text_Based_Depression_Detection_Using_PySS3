I really don't want to die. But I have no idea how I can keep going on like this.I just have no motivation for anything, because why would I, it's all pointless. I used to be able to imagine having a fulfilling life one day but now I literally can't. My therapist is abroad and only coming back next week and the suicide hotlines suck ass. And it seems everyone in this sub and others are all fucking teenagers well guess what I'm almost 30 and it only gets worse and worse.
