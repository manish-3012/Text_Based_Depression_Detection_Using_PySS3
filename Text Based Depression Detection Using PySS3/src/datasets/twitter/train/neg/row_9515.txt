Live until 30 years oldSo tired, every morning when I woke up, another meaningless and horrified day in my life, my eyes are glazed, no emotions in it. Sit up to look around, there is no meaning of life exist in this room and neither in this world, there is no one waiting for me in the path in front of me and no one will grate me warmly when I want to go home, there isn't one.

But I don't know where should I land my bare foot to rest, where shall I to find a place that do not inflict pains on me.

I hate the people around me, I hate people that have better life, I hate the people that are suffering, why can't they been in good life? 

"There is nothing wrong with the world, the one who is wrong is you!" I shout back:" Then why you give birth to me?" I shouted so loud, the echo woke me up, but it was just a dream. 

I wish to die at age 30, not even one second delay, set up the reminder, count down days. 

Hope you all find your peace.
