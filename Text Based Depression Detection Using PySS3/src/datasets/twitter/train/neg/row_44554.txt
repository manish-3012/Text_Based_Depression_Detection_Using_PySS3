WinterMy depression and overall downward spiral started in the winter, and that's probably where it'll end as well.

It seems like each winter brings me one step closer to the edge. This last one really fucked up my mental state, and that still hasn't gone away, only gotten worse.

It's the grey I cant stand. That awful, stark gloom that you cant escape. It's suffocating.

I'm already dreading this one, and cant help but feel as though it might be my last. There's just so much pain that it brings with it, I dont know how many more I'll be able to endure 

In a way, it feels like fate. I was born in the middle of winter, and that's almost certainly when I'll die.

It's kinda funny, if I had the money, I could escape it entirely, but that would be too easy.
