HelpBeen depressed for as long as I can remember I just feel empty and weak. I feel like life is pointless and is just suffering and serving the wealthy. I was driving today and I just got this thought of driving into a wall as fast as I could to end it all and it honestly started to sound nice. Idk I just feel alone and want someone to know something I guess
