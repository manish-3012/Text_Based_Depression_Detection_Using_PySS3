Since christmas I have broken contact with my family and socially isolated myself completely, since I have long lost all my friendsTo not show up for christmas was a rather spontaneous decision, although it was always my plan to make my family resent and forget me, before killing myself, in order to make it easier for them.

After christmas I told them repeatedly via email and texts that I don't want nothing to do with them anymore, before shutting down every path of communication.

Since some time I have plenty of leaves and seeds of the highly toxic yew tree in my closet waiting for the right moment. My plan is to eat them and if it hurts to much to jump out of the window, as I live in a skyscraper with at least 17 stories.

Sorry for my english.
