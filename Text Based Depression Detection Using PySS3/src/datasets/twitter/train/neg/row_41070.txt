HopelessI know that no one will care, or even read this. I'm just so sad. I just feel so hopeless. Someone betrayed me really badly. My girlfriend hacked into my social media. Now everyone hates me, because she is making them think I said things that I didn't say. There is nothing I can do, because no one will believe that it wasn't me. There is just no choice anymore, other than suicide.
