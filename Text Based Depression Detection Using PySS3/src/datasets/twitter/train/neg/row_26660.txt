Why I should die?So I came with some of my own reasons: I've been depressed for three years, mostly just laying in bed doing nothing. I've been in a mental hospital 4 times, I haven't even finished high school, all I did was leech of my parents. I'm a pedophille, i have aspergers syndrome(diagnosed i didn't make it up), psychosis and depression. Everyday I take 6 kinds of medication and none of them help. I've though about cannibalism(eating people), I've hit my mother couple of times, I tortured a girl who had a history of depression, every body pretty much hates me, i'm the lowest form of a human being. I cannot concetrate enough to even read a book, my memory is completely shot and all connections lost. I m also a necrophille and have a bunch of other pariphillias, i'm all horrible traits combined in one human being. There is not a single redeeming quality that I have, I've stolen money from my mom and other people, i've leeched of of governemnt programs in my country and I have one failed suicide attempt. Also I like Adolph Hitler, I think he's really inspiring, I watch his speeches and read his autobiography, so i'm practically a neo nazi.Good luck everyone. Or save me, say I can change
