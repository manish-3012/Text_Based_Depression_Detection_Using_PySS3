I'm breathlessBy the fact that there feels like there's nothing left to live for. The one person that I felt anything for doesn't care about me at all and just used me. I only feel like a shell of myself ans I felt like this even before I met them. I was somehow holding things together but I feel like I'm cracking? Like shattered glass,sort of. I just want it all to stop. I never did anything in my life anyway,good or bad. I feel hollow.
