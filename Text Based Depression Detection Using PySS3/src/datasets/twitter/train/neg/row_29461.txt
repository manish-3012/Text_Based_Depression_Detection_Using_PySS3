My girlfriend is the only reason why I don't punch outSet upon the path to triple major with a BA in economics, political science, and philosophy. My current path would have me graduating at the normal time (a summer session past it at most) if I do 4 classes during the summers. 

I can't make it past calculus I. I got my midterm back as a D, first time I've done that bad on a test since before high school. The class just keeps pushing on ahead with the material and I don't have a firm grasp of half of it. I did all the college credit classes in high school and a GPA of 3.7-3.9 in my final 2 years. Got a 3.29 and 3.45 in my first 2 semesters of college with only one introductory stem course in each (took them to fulfill my requirements and got an A in each). 

Always walked around thinking I had a decent head on my shoulders. Always wanted to grow up to be a learned and intelligent man that people listen to when I speak (and I have the credentials so they should). But nope, I'm a dipshit. If it is an uncertainty if I will even pass what is still rather basic math then I am an imbecile that should've been smashed against the wall at birth to spare my parents the indignity. They each were born poor and climbed their way to the top 1% and I'm about to make the opposite journey. 

If I were in an Indian, Chinese, etc family I'd have been disowned or at least reprimanded until I broke or bent to proper form. Yet because I live in a "everyone gets a trophy!" suburban culture thats gradually eroding America's status as the dominant power I get to live comfy for now. 

If I didn't have a beautiful girl that loved me I'd just end it, probably will whenever she inevitably leaves
