Why should I stay?I can't figure one reason. Not one. I have no friends becaus they all left me and I'm not important to them because they have other better people. I can't make friends either because I hate people and I'm too socially awkward. I have no one to hang out with or do anything with, so nothing is enjoyable. I'm forever alone, I've never had a girlfriend and I *know* I never will. You can't convince me otherwise I know how my life is going to be. I'm a lesbian and everyday that one single reason is enough for me to tip me over the edge and kill myself. I don't find anything interesting, I'm bored 24/7 all I do I stay on my phone all day browsing reddit. I'm brain dead. I hate uni because of the people there and the stupid presentations I have to do which send my anxiety through the roof. I'm not capable of anything remotely good or smart, I'm just a fucking loser. 

Fuck this shit. I don't know what I have done to get this bad. I have nothing or no one in my life.
