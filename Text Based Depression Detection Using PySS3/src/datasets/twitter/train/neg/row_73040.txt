I'm readyI feel so done with everything. Happiness is fleeting. I don't want to be around to see the world move forward while I lay in bed. I see people constantly post about the cool shit they get to do and the people they have in their life but I have nothing and no one. I've never had anyone. I'm ready so ready.
