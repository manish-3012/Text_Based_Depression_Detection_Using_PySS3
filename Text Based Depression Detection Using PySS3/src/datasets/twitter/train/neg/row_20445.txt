I fail at everythingI think I'm about to drop out of Uni for the third time. THIRD TIME.
I'm 22 year old female. And I have never had a serious job. I worked as a janitor for a while, and even that was too much for me.
I have taken 5 different antidepressants, been hospitalized, changed 4 different therapists, 2 psychiatrists, tried different hobbies, living with parents, living with friends, living alone, meditating, writing gratitude journal, cleaning my room, going to church. It doesn't get better. I've been depressed for 5 years at least.
Right now I have missed so many deadlines in the Uni, that I think I am going to drop out. I should study nonstop to get my shit together as soon as possible. But I just can't. I sleep in my bed and I can't move. I can't bring myself to do anything. I wish there was someone to support me, a boyfriend, but I'm single. I have had 9 boyfriends. My first boyfriend was abusive, third raped me, others have been mean to me except maybe two of them. They all left me. People say there are plenty of fish in the sea, i don't think so. I have tried again so many times, they all leave me after 3 months. I have tried telling about my problems and hiding them, giving them space and giving attention, cooking for them, looking pretty, being kind. It never works. There must be something wrong with me. I wish I could get better but I don't think I can, I have lost hope. This world is so full of pain and suffering.
So here I am. No job, no education, no relationship and can't even bring myself to brush my teeth. A disgusting failure. I tried hanging myself in November but stopped, I thought maybe it will get better. I didn't tell my boyfriend about my attempt. He left me two days later anyway. That's how it gets better. And now University. I want it to stop
