I Can't do this anymoreMe and my wife have had turbulent times, I have battled drug/alcohol addiction  for a number of years. I have finally got my shit together (great job,paying of house etc etc) after ten years and still it isn't good enough. We have 2 beautiful children but tonight she admitted to me that the only reason she is here is because it is less complicated  then being a separated couple. I was on the edge and I walked away because I thought that my efforts meant something to her but it seems that they don't. Sick of being a piece of shit to be spat on (my 5 yr old daughter follows mums behavours) and am about to finish it all. Meant to be a new year but was told I am shit and sick of living.
