I can't seem to find happiness anymore...I always feel like such a failure, and right now everything is going incredibly wrong. I'm about to fail two of my college courses and I feel like I've wasted this entire semester. Last year I didn't graduate with my class, and I thought I was finally moving on and I was going to be doing well again. I had a 3.5 GPA my first semester of college, and now I'm struggling to pass this semester. Every time I feel like I'm finally doing something right, I go and screw it all up... I'm fighting with my best friend because we don't fit together anymore. He's everything I need in my life, he makes me feel happy. But we keep arguing and stupid things keep getting in the way and we need space from each other, and I need him so much right now...
My future is just... doomed. I can't seem to do anything right. I try so hard, but it's never enough...

During the day, I think about taking a gun and sending a single bullet through my temple and making all the pain go away. It's so vivid. It feels like such a relief... I know I'd do it if we had a gun here, but we don't...  I can't seem to make the pain go away. I can't seem to see any light at the end of the tunnel. And the temporary happiness just isn't enough for me. I need happiness that will last... I can't find happiness here. I can't find it anywhere.

I just want to feel okay again. But I don't believe I ever actually will...
