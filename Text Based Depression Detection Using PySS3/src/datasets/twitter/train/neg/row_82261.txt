I'm running on empty.Where to start?

I've gone through 5 packs of cigarettes jn the past 4 days, a far cry from my usual pack every 2 days. 

I brought out this girl for a second date to comic con, only to fuck it up even more by putting her on a pedistal, making her feel inferior, since i think paying for everything equates to being a gentleman.

My mom continues to terrorize me, along with my stepdad in the nursing home clinging on for his life at times. She calls me an animal and a whole slew of names, when I just want her to stop her gambling and manipulative habits that have taken 3 years of my life away.

Friends and I talked, and their seriously afraid that I may harm myself. I'm losing a large part of my family and have had moments where I begin staring into blank space, thinking of the most effective method of putting myself down. I can barely shed a tear anymore, and I'm close to clearing away all my possessions so I can just leave this world and spend my time in hell. It's the worst pain of its kind, not because of the situations, but because no one understands you anymore, and doesn't want to.
