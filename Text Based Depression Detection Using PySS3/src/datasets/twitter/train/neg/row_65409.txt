Yeah my attempt to not suicide today - But I don't think i'll succeed HELP ME PLEASEI have been suicidal for a while now, it comes and goes. Although the first time I tried was back in 2012, I swallowed shitload of medicines, paracetamols, 2 fist full of them, but I didn't have long lasting effects (that I know of), i was okay in 2 days. I cut myself a lot back then, did it this year too but a lot less because it doesn't help anymore.. Long story short, I have had a very rough year, ranging from insecurities, being bullied, harassed, pushed around like a puppet, picked on and have had my family turn against me, heck I've even had my heart shattered into a million pieces..by that I literally mean shattered. Still recovering though, all these events that folded made me insecure and made it hard for me to trust any one, some days I feel like I can trust my best friend the most and some days I feel like I can't. Imagine trusting someone so much and having stomped on..the effect lasts long. I have had argument with another of my friend who was a really good friend..he became a jerk when I told him I couldn't lend him the money when he asked me for it.. He used to be so fucking nice..and I can't even imagine he would be so abusive. After all the times we've helped each other out. People don't realize the long last effects their actions can have on others. I have written 2 suicidal notes on my laptop throughout the past few weeks, no one knows about it - just me. I won't go into the details about just how all the events folded this year, but know that I am normally a very soft and caring person, I blame myself for being born this way, I abso-fucking-lutely loathe myself, I've failed in 2 businesses I started. Working on 3rd one now.. Heck I didn't even manage to graduate my high school and the regret lingers on, it sometimes makes me wonder if my girlfriend sees me as a failure too? Because my parents sure do. Of course I am not here for any sympathy from any one. I am simply not worth it. Of course people feel sad sometimes, but they have people to talk to, and they can. I can't I physically can't, I feel lonely and I go into solitude just because I don't want to hurt anyone with my ill mouth. I feel like a burden on everyone close to me with constant problems.

Today I had this gush of feeling that sent me spiraling down this lane. It's not one of "those" days where I feel like I'm ok and the next moment I feel suicidal. Those days are still controllable but today if different, I feel so much rage especially with everything that's going on around the world. There is no sign of humanity and love left. Know this that I am not that person who takes suicide lightly, so know this I am not fucking OK. The insecurity from past months still lingers on, the bullying from my past still lingers on, some days quiet, some days intense. I don't want to hurt my girl , she is the best anyone could ever have. I don't want to hurt my parents, they are the best anyone could ever have, but I am fucking suicidal right now, I have cried so much today that I'm feeling numb to the pain. I feel so much hurt that it makes me tremble.. I feel like a mess explaining myself on the internet.. I guess its my last resort to not hurt the people I love the most. I feel like nobody takes me seriously ever, I feel that no one cares enough and I am tired of trying to be OK, I am just tired. I am heading to the beach once again... Please don't tell me to be thankful for life. I didn't ask for it, I want to be unborn right this instant because no one wants to understand me.. I was told that we will get through this together no matter how long it takes but I don't think that is in effect anymore.. I have been and am a victim of depression but i try to cope with it. People don't realize that for people like me it only takes one word to give that "nudge" towards killing oneself.
