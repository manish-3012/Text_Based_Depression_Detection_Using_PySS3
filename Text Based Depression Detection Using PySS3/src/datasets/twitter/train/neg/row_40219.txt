I got through itFirst of all I'm a very smart person, thinking outside of the box and about things none of my friends do.But I want to throw my life away, my life was incredibly hard and it threw me into a spiral of emotions where I could get nothing done, nothing at all.I locked myself away from the outside world only playing video games all day, not seeing anyone.The only thing that kept me was that I thought I might make a living out of it, but then I realized it was impossible and I got depressed even more.I did get some proffesional help, but they gave me stuff that made me not feel negative emotions and cleared my mind (just to some extent since I also got something that made me think a lot less).Now without any emotions I'm thinking about suicide just for no reason.I think about the value of life and I start to ask myself why do people even think suicide is bad ? I certainly could get out of this state, I know it, but it's so late I don't want to. It would be way too hard, and then again so would be the life after that.I don't want to live, becasue I got bored of living. I tend to ignore positive things or even avoid them and seek for the negative ones, because in my childhood those were the only emotions I felt and those are the only emotions I'm used to.
Life must be something that I achieved by an accident, and I'll be glad to throw it away... I don't even know why I'm posting this, maybe I just want to read your reactions or want to know what do you think about it. . . . . . . :)
