I donâ€™t really have any hope leftIâ€™ve made too many posts here but Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ve been forgotten so I suppose I should preface this by saying that Iâ€™m a trans woman and I suffer from depression, anxiety and dysphoria. Iâ€™m on meds for depression and anxiety and Iâ€™ve been on hormone replacement therapy for about five months and I see a therapist. 

Iâ€™ve been under a lot of stress lately because of all of that and money issues too. My family is stressed out as well so they canâ€™t really support me at all. I guess that wouldnâ€™t be a problem for a normal 26-year-old, but Iâ€™m not very independent and I struggle to take care of my responsibilities. I use to be kinda hopeful about my future but during the past week I feel like Iâ€™ve hit rock bottom again. Iâ€™ve been drinking a lot and I started taking drugs again, although unfortunately theyâ€™re relatively harmless. Iâ€™ve been really stressed out because Iâ€™m always broke. Iâ€™ve been so upset by my voice being so masculine, despite the effort Iâ€™ve made to change it, that I actively avoid talking to anyone.

I used to be kinda hopeful when confronting some of these problems. I tried to kill myself a couple times during the past few years and I thought that that was a thing of the past. But Iâ€™ve got some drugs that Iâ€™m pretty sure would be fatal because of the antidepressants I take. I want to take them, maybe today or tomorrow. I donâ€™t have any hope. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m in control of my own life. Iâ€™m alone, but Iâ€™m too afraid to meet people. Iâ€™m too afraid to seek any more help. Iâ€™m afraid of death but I feel like living the rest of my life is the worse option. And I hate myself so much.
