I don't want to do anymore.These late eight months have been a struggle. I moved cities, couldn't make any friends and I was just not coping. I got sleep paralysis and would cry myself to sleep. I was so outgoing last year and now I'm that weird girl who listen to music in the bathrooms at lunch and cries. I'm also bisexual but my family is homophobic and don't really care about me generally. Everyday, I wake up just feeling shit. Everyone thinks I'm fine. i just plaster on a smile and it's all okay. Sometimes, I open up but no one really cares at all. The only thing that really comforts me is the moon. I just feel like it's always there, watching over me. I just lost the only person who "cared" about me because she randomly blocked me and said "she didn't owe me an explanation". I self harm, not that much but just sometimes thing can get too much that I can't bear it. I just know that there's something wrong with me. People always leave me, no matter how hard I can try to be the best I can be. Idk why I'm opening up on here but I just saw this page and just thought maybe someone here m\\might actually care. I don't know anymore. I just can't do this anymore.
