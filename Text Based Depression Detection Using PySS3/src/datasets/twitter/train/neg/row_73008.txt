Someone please help, Iâ€™m so fucking close to suicideIâ€™ve been depressed for a couple years now, no one ever helps me, counselors, therapy, even family, I feel useless, worthless. Iâ€™ve tried hanging myself multiple times, I even have wrist scars. I cry myself to bed every single night. I had a girlfriend, but she only used me for money, then fat shamed me in front of everyone. Iâ€™ve been in the hospital multiple times, landing there on purpose, catching fights, and doing dangerous activities just to see if I come close to dying. Iâ€™m only 18, I know I have my whole life ahead of me, but itâ€™s already terrible, I donâ€™t want to k ow what the rest of it will be like. If anyone has advice for me, please comment, I need help, I could post on here in just a few days saying my final goodbyes. I have a gun ready, I have another rope, I even sharpened all my knives
