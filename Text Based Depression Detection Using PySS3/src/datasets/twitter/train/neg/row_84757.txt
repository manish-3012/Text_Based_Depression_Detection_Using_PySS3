DAE feel that they're as depressed as someone who is suicidal, but know that they would never kill themselves?I know with as much certainty as anyone can predict their future actions that I will never try to commit suicide. Parts of me still believe that things will get better, and even if I didn't have that, I am so absolutely terrified of death that I know I would never kill myself, no matter how bad things got. But sometimes I feel that I'm at such a low point that if death didn't scare me, I'd try it. I want to reiterate so that no one worries: *I am not going to try to kill myself.* But how do I deal with life when I feel as low as someone who would try it might? Does anyone else feel this way?
