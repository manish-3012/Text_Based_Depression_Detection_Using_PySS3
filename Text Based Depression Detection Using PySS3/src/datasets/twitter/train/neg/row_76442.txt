I'm shining a light on the shitty voice in my head, hoping it will lose some of its power that wayI'm sick to death of these negative messages I give myself. I'm going to write them out here to shine a light on them, otherwise I'm just overwhelmed with the shame they create in me.  
**What the little voices are hissing in my ear:**  
Youâ€™re WEIRD  
Youâ€™ll never have friends  
Youâ€™re a failure in life  
Youâ€™re wasting your time  
No one likes you  
Youâ€™re unhappy because youâ€™re a miserable person, not because of depression  
Youâ€™re just like _______ (my nasty relative)  
Killing yourself is the only way to end this pain  
Youâ€™re going to hurt like this forever  
_____ can see that youâ€™re a weird loser so he wonâ€™t write back  
Youâ€™re a bad person for not liking ____ (family members)
