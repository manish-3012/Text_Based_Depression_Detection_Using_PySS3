Parents showing once again they don't give a single shitBecause of my mother keeping more than $2000 in a shared bank account with my name on it, that I had no way of accessing any of the money, SSI has cut me off, and is now saying I owe $1300. I have maybe $200 in savings. I'm disabled and cannot work at all. I have no way of raising so much money, I have bills, my dad isn't answering a single fucking email, I begged my grandma (who is the only person in my family I'm still in contact with) to tell my father to answer my fucking emails.

He's not even answering. I should've known. They never gave a shit about a fucking crippled retarded tranny like me. I want so badly to fucking end it all, not just to stop the constant physical and emotional pain but also as a last fuck you to him. Him, who kept pretending to care, who kept acting like he could help, who kept saying "I'm on your side" and fooling me and making me trust him and then every single fucking time taking my trust and love and fucking stepping on it.

I should've let myself die when I was 12. 12! I tried to fucking kill myself at *12* because of him and I still believed he loved me.

I just wanna stop hurting. I just want the pain to stop. I don't wanna hurt anymore.
