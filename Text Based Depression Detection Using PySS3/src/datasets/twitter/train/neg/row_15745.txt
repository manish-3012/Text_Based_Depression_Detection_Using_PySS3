Found this girl, can somebody check this?I don't know if this is the right place, but here it go. I was browsing forever alone's [imgur folder](http://imgur.com/r/foreveralone) and noticed that [this girl](http://www.reddit.com/user/kommentieren) have lots of self pics there. I got a bit curious, so I went on her user page and saw her [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/18fbl1/considering_just_killing_myself_before_valentines). If you check her history, you're gonna see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/15r5wy/im_almost_at_a_breaking_point) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/zyihc/i_have_no_one_left_i_cant_take_much_more) among other real sad stuff. I don't know if it's just a cry for attention or if it's legit, but I got worried about it. I don't know if anyone can do anything about it, but i though it was worth pointing out. Sorry about my english, it isn't my main language and sorry if i broke any rule.
