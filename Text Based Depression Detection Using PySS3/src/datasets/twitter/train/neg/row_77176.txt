My girlfriend wants to die, help !I have been dating her for more than 3 years (i'm 21 and she is 26) and she always told me how bad she felt. She tried taking her life several times before we dated and still scarify herself sometimes. 6 months ago she told me she wanted to be euthanised. We talked a lot and she decided to give herself a year, but know she's back to it and there's no changing her mind.

She is trans and finishing her transition as been her goal for several years now, but now she feels that it's no use, that she'll never see herself as a woman and that she'll never be okay with her condition. I don't think that's the only reason she is depressed but it's an important one. 

She also said that she's never been happy and never will be, that happiness and life are not made for her and that she is tired of trying to get better. 

She as seen a lot of psychiatrists in her life but they never managed to heal her. She as also taken several antidepressant but they gave no conclusive result either. She refuses to see a new psychiatrist or to try antidepressant again. 


Her mom as not taken the euthanasia talk really well and they won't talk to each other. She as a friend but i'm the only person who's close to her now.


She has an appointement with her doctor tomorrow so he can lead her to the persons who decides who gets to be euthanised or not, but even is they refuse, she says she'll kill herself another way. 

I don't know if it matters but she is not maniac or anything. She always talk about this very calmly. 


Anyway, i don't know how to help her or even if i can help her but i love her and i'm desperate so if you know anything you think can help her i'll be glad to hear it. Thanks !
