Planning to ODI'm ready to die, sure I may affect a few people but I'm sure they'll be able to move on in less then a week. I hate my life so much, I hate everything. I just want to die and honestly I'm excited to die. It makes me happy knowing that my suffering is going to end soon. I'm planning on doing it tonight after my dad goes to sleep. I hope you all have a better life than me.
