Everyday I just get up and keep thinking about suicide.I am almost 25 years old and I've never been loved by my parents and never had any GF or anything. People I thought were my friends are just selfish bastards who knew exactly how to use me. When I was six or seven ( can't remember exactly) I was thrown into boarding school so there goes my childhood. Never received proper nutrition when I needed it the most. Now I've almost everything the society and my parents expect me to have i.e a fancy engineering degree and a job but I am hollow inside. So broken. I haven't even kissed a girl in my 25 years of life and looks like it will remain the same for me. I know that I am not the unluckiest person on earth but I can't help thinking about how my life would have turned out if I've grown like a normal child. Seeing everyone around me having a life just adds to the pain. My life's just pointless. I don't have anything or anyone to live for. I fear if I lived upto 40 years I would be a real life 40 year old virgin (how sad is that),nobody deserve that kind of life.
