I encourage EVERYONE here to listen to the album Circles at least once.To make it relevant. It is the story of a suicidal, broken and defeated man. And him coming to peace with his situation. 

Thereâ€™s maybe 2 actual rap songs on there so for non hip hop fans. I promise, promise, promise. Itâ€™s worth your ears. 

I find it helps me get through these rough days and times even if itâ€™s just a moment to hear someone with similar thoughts as myself. 

Iâ€™ll leave you with my favorite line from the entire album- 

 â€œDonâ€™t keep it all in your head, a place that you know nobody ever can see. Youâ€™re running low on regret, no tears thatâ€™s keeping you wet. I think youâ€™re getting it now...â€ - Once A Day by Mac Miller
