I'm finally free.Over the last two years I've been battling depression and severe bulimia. I haven't felt alive in so long, not even the cuts or cigarette burns help me feel. I know that I won't wake up tomorrow, and that I can finally sleep. It's freeing, I don't cry or feel sad when I think about death now. I can't wait. I feel giddy, even. My brother and sister will be alright now, my mom's gotten better and is leaving her boyfriend, and I know everyone will be okay. I don't have to pretend anymore, and the sky finally looks blue. It's peaceful. I'm finally going to enjoy a long beautiful sleep.



EDIT: I woke up this morning. You guys gave me a lot to consider and think about. I guess I'll try opening up more to my therapist and not be selfish and force a smile everyday because that's apparently what you're supposed to do. I'll live and pretend I'm okay and not die for everyone else.
