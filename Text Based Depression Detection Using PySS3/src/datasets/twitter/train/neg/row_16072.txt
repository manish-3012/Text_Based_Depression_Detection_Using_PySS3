I dont know how to feel.This seems like the right place, every morning I wake up all I can think about is suicide, I'm 17 and in the process of completing year 12 and everything just feels so I hard. The walk to school is the hardest because I get like half an hour to my thoughts and it's just a consistent loop of "do it you worthless cunt" and "what is the point of putting up with all of this just to die anyway". I've written my suicide note mentally and it wouldn't be difficult to get a lethal dose of sleeping pills, the only thing stopping me is my mum, I couldn't ruin her life like that, but she's only got so much life left. I'm terrified for the day she dies, I know I'm probably just being an immature teenager but I would just love to hear anyone's opinion.
