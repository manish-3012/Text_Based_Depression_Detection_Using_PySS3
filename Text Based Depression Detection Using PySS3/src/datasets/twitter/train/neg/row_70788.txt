I'm just doneI'm so sick of the continual bullshit, the life that never improves, the doctors appointments and medications that don't help me. I'm just done. I have a bunch of pill bottles in my closest and I plan on taking every single pill. At this point I don't even care if it doesn't kill me and leaves me mentally retarded or something. Things are so bad that being mentally retarded sounds like an improvement. Don't really have anyone to talk to so I guess this is why I'm posting here...
