Opening up about my life to the whole worldiâ€™m not feeling good at all. i want to die. but for some reason i felt like opening up. iâ€™m sorry for taking your time. donâ€™t feel the need to read, iâ€™m just wasting your precious time ðŸ™ðŸ»

people have too high expectations of me. iâ€™m not allowed to make any mistakes or iâ€™m seen as a worthless, a good for nothing child. i try my best, i really do. but itâ€™s not easy. i just wish i could just be myself without any pressure. 

i am abused physically and mentally. i donâ€™t really care if i get hurt by hitting or anything anymore, i feel like i deserve it. i donâ€™t really mind the verbal abuse either, but it tends to make me think why i have to be so useless. imagine this. 4 is the worst grade you can get and 10 is the best. you get 9 1/2 from it and barely missed the 10 because of a little mistake you made. â€you are so fucking worthless.â€ â€you have to study.â€ â€why do you have to be like your big brother?â€ itâ€™s not the greatest feeling you get from it. i donâ€™t really mind myself being dissed, but the fact that my people even dare to mention my perfect, best and most caring brother like that, i get so angry. i canâ€™t even say anything back or theyâ€™ll hurt me. 

iâ€™m scared of people. i start panicking when iâ€™m around people and my chest just starts to hurt. i feel like i canâ€™t breathe well. i think my fear of people might have started when i was picked up by a random man as a younger kid. 

iâ€™m scared of doctors. i know that theyâ€™re supposed to help you and all, but i canâ€™t help it. maybe itâ€™s because my grandpa almost died in their hands only because of their little mistake, i donâ€™t know. but my grandpa has been the closest person to me for as long as i can remember. 

i lost my close friend to cancer a few years back. at that time, i tried to kill myself for the first time. i felt so done with everything. guess who didnâ€™t accomplish her goal? i still hate myself to this day for not doing it.

i had to put one of my animals down a few months later. i was NOT feeling any better and my thoughts were still there with me. the loss of my animal made me feel even worse because i kept blaming myself for something i could have never helped with. there went my 2nd attempt. still here.

the last two years after that have just been me constantly fighting back for no reason at all. i donâ€™t know what keeps holding me back even though i donâ€™t really have anything left. countless attempts and iâ€™m still here.

i just want to go, really. why must i be somewhere where i donâ€™t want to be? i canâ€™t freely be myself or without pain. i just wish i could die peacefully and not live with the pain just increasing. itâ€™s getting harder and harder. at the same time, the urge and the need to go is growing rapidly. just let me go, please.
