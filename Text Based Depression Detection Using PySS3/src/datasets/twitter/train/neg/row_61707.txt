I just took a shite ton of sleeping pillsIâ€™ve failed at this before. But this time Iâ€™ve taken lots, lots more. The main person Iâ€™d want to say bye too, Iâ€™m not going to because I donâ€™t feel like he would care. We were/are close and in love. But recently Iâ€™ve been feeling pushed away, he has other girls anyway Iâ€™m sure, Iâ€™m nothing to anyone and this is why Iâ€™m praying I donâ€™t wake up.
