I just need someone to talk toI wouldnâ€™t say I want to to kill my self, I love my friends and my family, but recently Iâ€™ve been pretty upset. When I was 7 my dad died and recently that has really been making me sad because also my mom has a thiriod (I think thatâ€™s how itâ€™s spelled) issue where it makes her mad at me sometimes more then usual over small things. I recently wanted to build a computer, and she says she doesnâ€™t think I know how even though I can litterly show her if she gave me a chance. Right now I feel no one likes me and I will be a failure.
