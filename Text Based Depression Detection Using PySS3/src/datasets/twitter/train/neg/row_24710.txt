I don't see the fucking point anymore.I wrote tons here on why i'm suicidal. My anger. My sadness. Just generally a lot of self pitying. Somehow expecting my ramble to end with me picking out something that'll make me want to stay. It didn't work. I've had Depression and Anxiety for about seven years now.

Back in January of this year, i attempted to take my own life via overdose. However an online friend of mine convinced me to go to the hospital and i can honestly say it's been the worst decision i have ever made in my life. 

I suffer from so much self-hatred. There is nothing i like about myself and there will never be. Even from when i was a kid, there wouldn't be one thing i could say i'm proud of. And over the years, there's just been more and more flaws that take over. I try and sit myself down and say "No, Calm down, This is just the depression talking. You're not a terrible person", but at this point i just don't give a fuck anymore. 

I haven't got any hobbies - or hobbies that actually make me happy. I used to feel as if i could get somewhere with my art and animation career, but now i literally couldn't care less if i tried. Whenever somebody says "Why don't you try do something that makes you happy?", i smile and nod but what the fuck is there for me to do? I've tried quite a few new things, but i just get more and more depressed and frustrated, leaving it better if i just do nothing. Which i know is wrong. 

I think the main thing affecting my mood at the moment is my friends. I'm a really compassionate person, and i go above and beyond to try and prove to people how much i care and am willing to try my hardest to make somebody smile. I don't usually get the same kind of response - which i usually say is okay. But i think it's really affecting me mentally.

I have one real life friend, Who is only really friends with me because they haven't got anybody else to hang about with in the day. In freetime, they aren't very interested to talk and hang out. 

Online, i have (or had.) quite a few friends. But there's been a cycle that always happens to me, without fail. Six times. The 'cycle' goes as follows;

* I meet a person/people and become friends with them. 
* I become especially good friends with 1/2 people involved.
* The other person shows me the same kind of effort that i put in.
* The other person meets a few other people, i try to get involved however am not usually as welcomed.
* the small things the other person used to do to show me that they cared no longer happens. 
* the other person tends not to enjoy conversation/respond much/excessive anger/disinterest
* The other person only really speaks to me out of pity. 

I know this sounds selfish and stupid. But i can literally give you six examples of this happening. Pretty much to the exact same formula. 

I fight to try and keep people in my life, of course, but i'm not the type of person who gets aggressive about it. I try desperately to prove how much i care and that i'm good enough, though it usually falls under deaf ears. Until I eventually give in and just say "Well, they're happier and better off without me. It's okay i'll meet new people."

The thing is. Everybody is better off without me. And after the sixth time for this heartbreak and genuine emotional turmoil, i don't want to try again. I don't want to be lulled into another false sense of security only to be shot in the heart again and again. 

I wish i had somebody who would go the extra mile. Who'd tell me "hey, it's going to be okay" rather than ignoring me until they can be like "are you better now?"

I think i'm going to end my life before the summer. I've been staying for my friends and stuff, but it's really clear to me that i'm just going to hurt myself more and more watching them fade. I'm going to wait until i know for certain that they'll be okay - i'm sort of at that point now but. Idk. 

I'm sorry for this post. I just needed to talk. It sounds so selfish in reptrospect, and i understand that. But i don't ever get to say. I just want to talk about why i'm done with my life and why the only thing i'm looking forward to is ending it.
