The internet gave me the final pushI've recently begun browsing subs like the red pill, etc. I can't go on anymore. The ideas and posts I read there are burned into my mind. I don't see any way for me to get a girlfriend as I'm just another "beta" male, I'm not tall, I'm not masculine I hate everything about myself. 

Obviously I always had my insecurities, because I'm in a way always alone and because I've never had a girlfriend either. Which is why I also begun browsing the sub. And since then. well 

I've lost the will to talk to women anymore because the idea of the girl I like and wanted to ask out just dropping and leaving me for some better looking guy hurts like hell. The idea that women hate men like me, resent them is something I can't stand. 

I can't do this anymore. I will kill myself by shooting myself in the head in one week, as I have to first bring my dog to my parents so that at least he can have a happy life. I don't see why I shouldn't kill myself, I can't live being such a beta male and I know it sounds pathetic but I can't live being forever alone either. 

I'll just be another beta male who killed himself. Goodbye.
