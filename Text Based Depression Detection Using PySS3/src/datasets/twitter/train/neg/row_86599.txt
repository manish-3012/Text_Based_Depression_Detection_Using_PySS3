How have you found help?My little brother took his own life last Friday. He was 24. My life has been torn to pieces and I doubt I'll ever recover. 

I want to raise money for a charity that supports suicidal people but I want to choose one that actually helps people. Have you had any contact with charities or organisations that really made a difference to you when you were feeling really low?
