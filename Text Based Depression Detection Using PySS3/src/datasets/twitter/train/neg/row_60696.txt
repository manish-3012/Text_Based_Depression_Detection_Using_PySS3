I have lost. I have been defeated.I'm currently listening to my hero by foo fighters (great song by the way), just having deep revelations of the dark path I'm currently headed on. Tomorrow, I will die. I'm not for sure on that, but I may try. I will drink as much alcohol as I can force myself to consume, and it will kill me, I have no tolerance to alcohol. I hate this. Have I damned myself? Or was I born damned? Why me? What have I done? I don't know. My name is Dylan. I'm 15 years of age. 16 in 5 days. I either die tomorrow, or I continue to suffer.
