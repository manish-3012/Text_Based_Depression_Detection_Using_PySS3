This quote helps distract me, putting it out there in case it helps someone else"I am at the crossroads between waking and dream. One path leads back to the world I left behind. The other path â€¦ the other path leads to a place of shadows. Between the familiar and the unknown, between certainty and doubt, my choice would seem obvious. Any sane man would turn around, return to the world he knows, forget what he has learned, and live his life in blissful ignorance. But in truth, it is too late. My choice was made many years ago, when I first embarked on this journey. I cannot turn back. I am at a crossroads, but for me there is only one path. I leave behind these words in the hope that, someday, they will serve as a map for someone else. To whomever reads this, Godspeed on your journey." -Dreamfall Chapters

This quote helps ground me, for no reason at all really, but putting it out there in case it helps someone else. It helps if you look it up on YouTube and listen to the character's voice.
