Does anyone else feel suicide is simply inevitable?I always struggle with depression and anxiety, and, while I don't want to kill myself now, I feel as thought it's inevitable. I can't keep living my life like this. I'm miserable all of the time and I'm not sure why. I stopped taking my zoloft about a year ago and when I tried to go back on it, I had the darkest few days of my entire life. I just wish I could be happy.
