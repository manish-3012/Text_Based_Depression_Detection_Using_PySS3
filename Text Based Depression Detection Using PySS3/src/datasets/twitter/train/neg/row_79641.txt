I dont want to be here but i doI've written and rewritten my letter to everyone so many times. The only thing holding me back is the fear of missing out, missing my big epiphany about life and what I need to do to provide meaning for it. I don't want to be here, all i feel is pain day in and day out, but I can't get over the hump because i want something to happen to change my mind but I know its not coming and its making me go crazy
