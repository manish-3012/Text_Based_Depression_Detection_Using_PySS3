Feeling Really Weak LatelyI've just been feeling really weak lately. A sudden breakup of a two year relationship happening really screwed me up as well as my father having surgeries for a botched hernia operation just leaves me feeling hopeless. I have always been the person who people come to for support with issues, and I feel guilty about turning them away while I'm depressed. There is a lot of guild about the relationship as well. She left because we had been having a lot of problems that were caused, for the most part, by me. But we also decided to try and work on it after talking it over (a really bad decision, I guess), but it seemed that all of the problems that were surfacing were my fault. I felt/feel guilty about not trusting her right off, not being able to allow her to comfort me/allow myself to comfort her. It really seems that she believed I was taking too long to try and heal from her leaving. I'm just not sure what to do anymore. My confidence, which was borderline arrogance, is gone. I've just been in a constant state of depression since she left. The thing with da is putting a lot of stress on the family. He's the steriotypical patriarch and this is the first time I've really seen him as human instead of this god-like figure. Today has been difficult seeing him lying around, having things brought to him and all the rest when he was so active and... Dad. I don't know...
