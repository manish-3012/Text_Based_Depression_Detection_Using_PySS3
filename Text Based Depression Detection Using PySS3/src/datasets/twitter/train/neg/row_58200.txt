I am an abject failure and a barreling catastrophe. A bull in the china shop of my family.I hemorrhage money. I am incapable of functioning. I can't be a responsible father when I can't even motivate myself to wake up. I am going to financially ruin my family with student loans, and my shame and guilt is unbearable
