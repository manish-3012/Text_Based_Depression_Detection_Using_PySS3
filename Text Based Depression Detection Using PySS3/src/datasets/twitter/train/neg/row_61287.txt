A no good, lonely wednesdayHey. I'm having one of the worst days in a long time and my usual network of support is unavailable. Usually id text my brother and he'd reply with something interesting or funny, but we've had a fight and he left me in my existential dread. Now I can't stop drinking, smoking and imagining  ... My therapist is on vacation and I can't even bear the thought of looking for a new one. Would you kindly post something interesting/funny/kind to help me get through this shitty wednesday?
