When ur poor and struggling its not worth itI can't work due to disabilities, I have no money right now, until next month. This is how it usually goes. I'm getting so sick and tired of this. Im ready to just end my life, its not fair on people who have to live like this, I wish I just had 1 million of jeff bezos centuries and centuries amount of money :/
