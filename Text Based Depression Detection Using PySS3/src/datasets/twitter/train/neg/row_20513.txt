my life is overi'm a sophmore in high school and i hate myself: I have an F in chem, i'm in retard (intro) math classes and i got recommended for intro physics, i'm going to get ridiculed to hell and back for that and i know it.  i'm too depressed to even try anymore, no one talks to me and swear i'm always alone, the only time i actually feel like i have friends is when i'm talking with people online, but that even then is a stretch.   I'm not good at anything. i would do well in school if i didn't have to deal with social interactions b/c i'm not sociable. I don't have any real friends, I've gone to zero parties, done zero extracurriculars. i have no motivation at all to do anything anymore and the thing that hurts me the most is that i don't even think i'll go to college w/ these grades. my parents yell at me if i cry about it, and consistently call me lazy. i just can't deal with it anymore, and i honestly just want to leave forever.
