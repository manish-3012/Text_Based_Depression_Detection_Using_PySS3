I don't have the ballsI tried to hang myself in the closet last night with a scarf and a tie like L'Wren Scott but I don't have the balls to go through with it and kept sitting up and that, ironically, makes me hate myself more. I called the suicide hotline last night and got voicemail, of all things. I don't know what I wanted them to say, but that was sort of funny to me. 
I need to get out of my relationship but I'm afraid that if I do I'll be even sadder. So this is like shooting myself before the tsunami hits, I guess. 

I am going to try again tonight I think but I'm sure the result will be the same. I tried all night last night. Sitting in there with the scarf around my neck feeling my carotid artery throb was the only thing that made me feel...better.
