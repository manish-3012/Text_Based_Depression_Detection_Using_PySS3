I need to talk to someone please, i feel as if my life is a trainwreckI'm 16 years old (boy) and i feel so worthless all the time, i don't like my body and i have tried doing exercise and eating healthy but with no results... my friends haven't talked to me in almost three weeks and when i go out with them i feel empty and i just want to go home, i just sleep all the time and i don't even know how i'm going to face my life as an adult. I need to talk to someone who's had the same experience to tell me how they face these problems please.
