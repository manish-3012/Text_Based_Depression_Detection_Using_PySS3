I feel hated because of this diagnosisSo after years and years of suffering with bouts of depression, I was diagnosed last year with Borderline Personslity Disorder (or Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder). At first I thought "great, now at least I know what it is that's wrong" and I got into treatment for it last year (a full year of DBT which I'm still doing).

I have stopped cutting and drinking, I have stopped taking pills and smoking weed to numb my emotions. So I have made progress but the emotions are still there. Still unstable. And I still don't think I can live with them. My family pretend I'm fine. I'm sure I drive my boyfriend crazy every day. Everyone on reddit seems to hate borderliners. And deep down I know I deserve to be hated. Being told I should never procreate, no one should ever stay with me. I'm crying my eyes out while I write this. I feel like they're telling me I'm worthless, that I should just die. Because I'll never be completely normal even though I'm trying so hard to be.

I never wanted to be like this. I'm sorry to everyone in my life that has ever had to meet me. I'm just sorry.
