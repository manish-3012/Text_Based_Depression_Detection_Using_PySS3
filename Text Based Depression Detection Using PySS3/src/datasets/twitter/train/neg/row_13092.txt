In serious need of help right now SWA girl-friend of mine has just broken down over skype. She's started cutting herself and has opened up to me about her schizophrenia. She's telling me she wants to end it tonight and will not listen to anything I have to say. 

I understand that this is just her way of reaching out, but I need some advice on how to talk to her. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post, I'm kind of in a rush.
