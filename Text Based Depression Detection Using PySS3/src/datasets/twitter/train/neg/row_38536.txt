My body drains my hapinessMy body is my worst enemy. its driven me to near suicide attempts, self harm and hate. i cant even wear a tank top and in some cases reg t shirts because i feel too self conscious. i hate myself. i hate myself for not being a 6ft guy with washboard abs and visible veins running down my arms. i hate my self and i have no where to turn to my only friend told me as i was crying to her about my self hatred "you should take others into consideration when your like this", i never felt so stupid and useless, she always says stuff like that to shut me up. i have no one to turn to so i decided to try reddit. never been here before. hoping for help.
