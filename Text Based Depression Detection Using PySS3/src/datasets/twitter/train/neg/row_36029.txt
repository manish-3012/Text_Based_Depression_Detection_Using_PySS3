Well I guess this is it.These are my last few days here. My life has been a constant failure to this point, and it won't get better. I have a disease that will kill me by the time i'm 40, in which time i will never accomplish anything. I can't let anyone come close because i don't want them to feel pain when i go so early. My life is nearly half over and my only goal has been to help as much as I can, yet I fail at that every time. Luckily I have next to nobody, so i'll be forgotten easily. I just wanted somebody to hear my final thoughts. Thanks for everything, guys. That's the end of the show.
