How do you even tell someone that you are ready to kill yourselfBeen feeling it the last 6 or 7 years, Ive drank every day I can remember for the last 3 or 4.

I'm thinking liver failure will take me out eventually

Tried to hang myself once on the lighting fixtures, broke out the ceiling had to make up some bullshit about breaking it while drunk

I've been waiting 5 weeks for my new meds now and it's been the longest fucking month of my life. 

I know they say it's temporary but tbh 7 years is starting to feel pretty fucking non-temporary
