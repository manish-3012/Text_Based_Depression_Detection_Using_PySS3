I'm slipping.I can feel my mind slipping again.
I'm slowly detaching from reality
I don't know
I don't know
What do I know
Nothing is real
I'm trapped 
Why do I bother
I'm such a bother
I'm screaming so loudly 
Why can't anyone hear me
What's the use
I'm no use
I'm no good
Don't use me
I'm useless
I'm scared of everything and everyone
My mind is a cage and I'm a prisoner
I can't escape 
I don't think I'm good at anything
I could be a better mother
I wish I could give my children a dream life 
I don't deserve them
My mind my mind my mind
Please God, release me from these demons
Give me strength
Give me purpose 
Don't let me go astray 
I'm going astray
I'm going crazy

Why am I so strange
So awkward
So unfamiliar in my own skin
So unfamiliar with life
I don't know what to say to you
I don't know what you want me to say
I'm sorry 
I'm useless
I don't want to disappoint anyone
I don't want to disappoint my kids
I'm in a state of constant self disappointment 
Because I'm useless
I'm tired
I'm tried 
I'm sleepy
I'm grasping for someone, anyone
I wish I could ball myself up and hug myself
I just need some reassurance
I can get through this
Can I get through this
I'm not sure what I can do
I'm not sure I can 
I wish I could just get some rest 
But these babies need me
Who will feed them in the middle of the night
Someone better than me
I don't deserve them
They're so perfect
I'm not worthy
I'm worthless 
They're so perfect
I'm so worthless
