I'm a useless waste of resources.I'm 20 going on 21 I failed community college before my second ever semester and don't think college is right for me. I can't drive, have no regular source of income for public transit, there are no good vocational schools in my area, I'm unbelievably weak so manual labor and blue collar work is out of the question. I can't get anything requiring a secondary education. I have no skills, talent, experience, or competence. No one wants to hire me. I'm autistic, have ADHD and opposition defiance disorder. I'm pretty much predestined to be nothing but a lowly parasite on human society.
