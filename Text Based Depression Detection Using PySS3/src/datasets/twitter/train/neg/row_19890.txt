game overIt's funny how I only ever get on reddit to post a suicide note. I think this time is really it unfortunately. I blocked everyone I know so I can't get in touch with them. And those that still do have contact with me I'm simply ignoring. This is it. This is my time to go. I have a surplus of benadryl and alcohol. My breathing will be stopped.

I will no longer have to worry about my future. I will no longer have to worry about keeping myself hidden. I will no longer have to worry period. 

I will no longer have to pretend to convince myself that I am more than the kid who was raped. The kid who was molested. The kid who burdened their family so much that being dependent on a medication that helped me function scared them to death. No more. No more. No more.

I wasn't made for this. This is the end for me.

To Michael: I noticed you even when you thought you were invisible. You deserve help. I promise you people will listen even if your voice is a whisper.

To Luke: You are more than you realize. You were my real family.

To Constance: I don't know if you will ever see this. I hope not. I'm not doing this because of our fights or anything like that. I'm doing this because I am a burden to everyone here. Because Halloween. You know how hard this month is for me. I don't want you to kill yourself because I did. &lt;em&gt;Please&lt;/em&gt;, don't kill yourself because I did. I regret not being able to live long enough to kiss you for the first time. You believed in me when I didn't even believe in myself. I don't think you know how much that meant to me. You'll find the right person eventually. You'll make it. I love you. 

May we meet in the next life, and the one after.
