I'm only 15 and I'm doneI know some of you may think I don't have enough life experience to make these decisions but I'm really sick of how my life has turned out, it seems to be going down hill very quickly. I'm not able to keep friends because of my toxic personality, the only reason I haven't done it yet is because it would be devastating to the few that are still close to me.
