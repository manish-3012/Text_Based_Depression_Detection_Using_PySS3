I am not the son, they think i amI have been the good one, and the stable one in my family riddled with problems. At least they think I am. 
I have been fed up of being meek and looked down by my peers, I told myself screw it and risked more than I have, in something I don't know
The past two years have been really tough on me, emotionally because a girl cheated me emotionally, my sister only makes my life miserable, and then topping on all are my financial troubles that kick started my suicide thoughts.
I am a failure waiting to be revealed to everyone as such. I am lonely, and everyday it feels like I am dying a little bit. The only thing on my mind is depression, suicide.
