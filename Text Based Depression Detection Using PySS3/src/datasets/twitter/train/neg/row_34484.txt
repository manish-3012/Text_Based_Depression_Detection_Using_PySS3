What do they wantWhy do people not want me to die? Do they not see that Iâ€™m suffering here. Thereâ€™s nothing for me here no future nothing I got in not a soulmate not friends no life Iâ€™m so tired about my life.I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to I canâ€™t tell my therapist or sheâ€™ll hospitalize me again I truly feel like thereâ€™s no way out of this Iâ€™m getting desperate and ready to do something. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like this of seeing the shit I see or hearing the shit I hear of feeling this fucking way of not having support I canâ€™t do anything I have no everything for anything I canâ€™t even watch a show bc I get this feeling and anxiety and during mania everything is just crazy Iâ€™m sorry I know that everything Iâ€™ve said so far doesnâ€™t make sense but Iâ€™m just tired man I wanna die and I wanna die now Iâ€™m so tempted to cut and just fucking slit my wrist but Iâ€™m pussy I just want everything to stop.
