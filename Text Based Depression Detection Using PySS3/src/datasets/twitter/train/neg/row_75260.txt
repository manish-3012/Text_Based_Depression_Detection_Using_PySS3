to what capacity can your depression be as valid as mine?depression, like every other emotion is caused by chemicals in the brain that are released proportional to your tolerance and the lack of. but who are you? beyond the whammy burgers and french cries? what credence have you got to be so unhappy? 

if your mother abandoned you as a baby leaving you to be raised by some guy then that's a good start. 

if you were raised solely by said guy and moved from school to school every 3 months since subscribing then you're at my level so far. 

if your diet consisted of fast food and you became morbidly obese at 12 then you're still here. 

if you can official say that you've been to 20+ different schools and lived in 20+ different homes before you were 13 and your stepfather hid in the closet from debt collectors and police several times telling you to send them away then you're still here.

if your stepfather went to prison at 14 and you were pretty much destitute then you can relate.

 if you got several debilitating medical conditions and had nobody to even take you to the doctor, if you had a severe spinal condition that's now fully matured, a horrible skin disorder then you can relate. 

if you were undertaken again by said stepfather after being released from jail only to abandon all hopes of an education and work with him then you're still with me.

 now at this point it's pretty much an avalanche of misery. you can already anticipate what happens. it's pretty much where I am now expect I've lost the weight. I've tried to change. I have many more horrifying elements of my life to divulge but I'm trying to keep it as short as I can. 

you have no semblance of neglect.

if your girlfriend of 2 weeks broke up with you. or you have student loans. you are just a child. grow up. I had to grow up when I was 10.
