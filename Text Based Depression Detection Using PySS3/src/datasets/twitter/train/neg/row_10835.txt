I've got all the pills I needI'm crawling in bed with my comfy clothes and favorite blanket with my pills 

I don't want to die but I want to see mum again 

I've had 3 deaths in the past 2 years and there's another one coming, and maybe mine too

So how cruel to add me to the list, how will the others cope? 

I just want to see my mum again please 

I have much to do, much to prepare, the goodbyes
