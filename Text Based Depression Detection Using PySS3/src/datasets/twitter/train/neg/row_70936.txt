Girlfriend is pregnant, I've only been thinking about ways to end myself.Little backstory, my girlfiend and I have been togheter for 2 years. It's been going great lately, I've been studying the subject I always wanted and it was just great overall. I've always told her I did't have a childwish. My girlfriend  was on the pill our entire relationship, she quit 2 months ago because she wanted to get a different form of anticonception, but decided on none.   


A few days ago she send me a picture of a positive pregnancy test and since then my world has fallen apart. I've told her I did't want children, atleast not at this moment. She just told me she's keeping the child.

Since then it's all been spiraling down for me, I can't pay attention to a lot of stuff, am constantly in a sort of panic and just sad overall. I've told her this and she keeps telling me it's just shock and it'll wear off. Which I am convinved it won't. I've also told her I've been thinking about suicide, which she just told she is lucky I would't have the balls for it. I fear I might have to quit school and move across the country because we're long distance. My world is just upside down right now.
