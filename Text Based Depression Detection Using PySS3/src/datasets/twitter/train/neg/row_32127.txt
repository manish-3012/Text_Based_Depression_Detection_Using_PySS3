my first attempt was at age 8, I'm 20 now. i can't even kill myself right.i tried to suffocate myself underneath my bedsheets, i remember they were the ones with the glow in the dark fairy pictures on the comforter. 

i didn't eat for a week at age 10, didn't work. 

i spent so many teenage nights during beside the highway, so many days shoplifting pills and blades (I'm the reason my small town supermarket keeps the blades locked now lol). 

got an ambulance called on me at age 18 when i was living away from home. was in the ER for the day but not overnight. i went to my uni class the next day as if nothing had happened. i was still wearing the clothes i planned to kill myself in. someone from the hospital was meant to call me back about long-term mental health care but they never called me.
