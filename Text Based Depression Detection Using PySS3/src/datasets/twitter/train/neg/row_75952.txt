Rising fever, shivering and suicidal.Is at 40Â°C right now and about to pass out because of pain all over.

Fuck this. I hate how I am getting more and more frail over the years. I have depression, have possibly BPD and have panic attacks in every few days. I fucking struggled to not hug my chest and collaspe in the streets, I fucking tried to get myself together and finish any art projects/charity projects I'm entitled to, any duties I could finish. But it is just too tiring, and I felt like as I'm typing this, fever is getting the life source out of me. I wish the fever gets untreatable and die in my sleep so no one can question that I'm have mental disorders and suicidal all these years, especially my homophobic negligent father. I'm sorry mom for raising an ungrateful daughter who wants to die every single day, who could have done you better but couldn't. I'm sorry grandma for being childfree. I'm sorry brother that I can't give you more memes to laugh at and tickle you. I'm sorry boyfriend for disrespecting you, that I shouldn't die, I need to keep going till our first anniversary. 

I'm sorry society for being a weakling. 

I love you all, lads.
