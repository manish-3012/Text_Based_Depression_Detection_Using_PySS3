My feelings are worrying meThese past few months have been really tough for me for many reasons, one being the fact I lost nearly all of my friends. It first started with things like them constantly rejecting my invitations to do stuff and then going out anyway, and eventually resulted in total loss of contact due to no effort being made by them to plan things with me, and now I speak to absolutely no one. I wish I had the answer to why this happened but I donâ€™t. I find myself getting more sad and hopeless everyday, Iâ€™ve been worried lately because Iâ€™ve been feeling more suicidal than iâ€™ve ever have before in my life, I feel like my life will be full of pain, misery and suffering and I donâ€™t know if I want to carry on with it, I know people say things get better with time but I have an overwhelming feeling that it wonâ€™t, but these feelings arenâ€™t just the result of my loss of friends. If any of you guys' have had similar experiences then Iâ€™d be grateful to hear how you coped with it and any advice you can give me would be much appreciated.
