I am going to kill myself tomorrow evening.I unfortunately put all of my eggs in to one basket over the past year. My business has failed and I'm left without a job, governmental support or the means to pay for my rent at the end of the week. I won't live a life of homelessness or thievery and that leaves me with few options.

I've put my affairs in order with regards to the few distant friends and family I have, tidied my bedroom, ironed my clothes and put them away and now I'm going to sleep for the final time.

When I wake up tomorrow, I'm going to cook my favourite meal and then take a train to where I grew up. The house I grew up in was demolished a long time ago and replaced with an industrial estate, but there is a beautiful bridge by the park I used to play in which overlooks a train line. I'm going to jump off the bridge after the trains finish for the night, it's more than high enough to kill me, but i'll avoid the train lines, I don't want to put any one else at risk of danger. The railing is low and I'll have a drink to make it look like a drunk accident, a tragedy and a loss, but not a callous action.

I'm not writing this for any sort of comfort or solace, I'm not angry, sad or depressed, I'm just realistic about my situation. I'm calm.

There are a few things I'm going to miss, the sound of rain on my window, the warmth of my log fire, the first breath of cold air when I leave the house, music.
