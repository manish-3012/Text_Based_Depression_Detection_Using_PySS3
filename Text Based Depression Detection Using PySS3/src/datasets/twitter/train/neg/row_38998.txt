Will my mother and father forgive me?I do not want to hurt anybody. In fact, that's why I need to go now. I know there are people who love me and care about me, but I also know that those people suffer because of me and my emotional problems. I can't bear to inflict any more pain on anyone else. I am confident that everyone else (amazing S.O., siblings, grandma, and a few close friends) will all move on and probably lead better lives without me, but will my mother and father understand and forgive my actions? They were incredible parents (of course, they made their share of mistakes, but they always tried to do the best they could), and I really want them to understand that my actions are NOT in any way due to anything  they did/did not do. I love them more than I can ever express. But now I just don't want to feel or inflict pain on anyone anymore. I just want to sleep. Quietly. Be forgotten.
That is all.
I just need to know they will forgive me, move on, and continue being the happy, amazing people they are.
