I feel like Iâ€™m buried under pressure and I just want it to stopReason 1
Iâ€™m in a relationship with someone with extreme mental illness who just told me she only lives cause Iâ€™m there

Reason 2 
I rushed into uni and I canâ€™t leave unless I wanna pay a lot of money back I canâ€™t afford 

Reason 3 
my parents are the most black and white non understanding people in the world

Iâ€™m only 18, I want to live my life, explore my self, find out who I am, but Iâ€™m constantly promising Iâ€™ll start a family with my girlfriend cause I canâ€™t bare to see her upset, Iâ€™m constantly just through stress Iâ€™m ready to end it. I wanna fall asleep behind the wheel and crash into a tree, I wanna sit on the train tracks and blast my favourite music while I wait. Iâ€™m just stuck and I donâ€™t know how to get out
