I feel so hopelessI'm 18 next month and I can't remember a time before I was depressed, my grades are low because I skip school when my suicidal thoughts make it too hard to get up. I don't think I'll get good enough grades to get into university next year and I feel like I've wasted all the opportunities I've had. I'm autistic and no one around me puts in any effort to understand me; when I was younger I genuinely thought I was an alien because nothing made sense. Everything feels so so much harder than it should be but apparently because I'm academically clever I should be able to cope. I've tried therapy and various antidepressants but it's so easy to just spiral back into being suicidal. I have a plan for how to do it and I've researched everything, I think everyone around me would be happier in the long term if I wasn't there.
