â€œYou have so many people that love youâ€I donâ€™t know. Something like this coming from people that I love should lift me up. But it just makes me sink even lower than I already am. I donâ€™t deserve their love and support. They want to help but they donâ€™t know how. All they say is that theyâ€™re there for me. What the fuck is that supposed to do.
