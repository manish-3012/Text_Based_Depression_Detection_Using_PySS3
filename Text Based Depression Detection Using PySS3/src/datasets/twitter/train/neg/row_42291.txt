Here goes nothing.To start things off, I'm not quite suicidal yet, but I feel like I can't really talk to anybody about this and I can feel my mental health deteriorating week after week. I'm 24 and just recently graduated from college, and I'm in one of the darkest periods of my life. Ever since the beginning of high school I've had crippling self esteem issues, partly because of some bad friends. That translated to me starting my battle with depression. Once i college started, I discovered I had ocd and major anxiety issues that in retrospect had plagued me ever since I was a kid. Like I said earlier, I graduated college recently, and during those first few months I faced rejection after rejection while trying to find a job that was worth a shit. I recently found something, only to realize that 12 hour days and occasional days off in a position that is so far removed from who I am as a person isn't worth a decent paycheck. I'm still there but every day gets harder for me to go in as I feel like it is just killing me. I feel stuck though because it was hard enough to find something, and I have no idea what I even WANT to do with my life. All of the years of feeling lost and worthless are coming to a head as I feel trapped in a life I'm hating. Thoughts of just ending it all are becoming more frequent, and honestly I'm scared that I'm actually going to act out on it if I let myself get worse. I know that this is a wall of text and I could definitely have it worse, but these thoughts are still real to me and it hurts. I'm not sure what I'm really hoping to get out of posting this, but it feels cathartic writing this out and knowing that somebody now knows what goes through my head every day now. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
