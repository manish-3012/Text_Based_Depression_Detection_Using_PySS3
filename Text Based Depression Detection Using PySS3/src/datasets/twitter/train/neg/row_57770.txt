Im currently in the EDmy life is one fuck up after another, I'm in the ED because of a failed suicide attempt.  Today I wanted to throw my self off a multi storey car park.  

I'm in the ED with a ltr of antifreeze and a pack of blades, I will kill myself now.

On Friday I drunk antifreeze and the police dragged me to the ED I ran away but now I've been taken back because of this pain.  I hurt so much.  

Im going to wait till I'm not being watched and drink the antifreeze that's in my bag.

I'm feed up with trying to fix myself.  I don't need fixed, I'm fine, I'm fixed, I'm fine, I'm fixed, I don't need anymore help, I'm fixed.
