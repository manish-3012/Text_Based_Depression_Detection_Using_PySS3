Feel like being gone is the only way to winIâ€™ve never posted here before and I donâ€™t know why I feel like I should today, because Iâ€™m really not at my absolute lowest point. 

Iâ€™m just struggling a lot with some past traumatic things I experienced last year and canâ€™t seem to outrun them, or to really outrun anything honestly. 

Iâ€™m depressed, Iâ€™ve gained so much weight the past few months, Iâ€™m not adapting to anything well, I cringe endlessly at everything I do and say because Iâ€™m so grossed out at myself and who I am, and Iâ€™m just fucking tired of being here. 

I have a constant dialogue running in my head that says â€œyou could just kill yourself,â€ or â€œyou wonâ€™t be here long enough for ____ to matter.â€ It can be as simple as fucking up a gift Iâ€™m wrapping. 

The really overwhelming thing is that I canâ€™t shake the thought that dying would mean people would finally believe everything Iâ€™ve needed them to believe. Mainly about the traumatic event that seemed to be a joke to the police, like I relish the mental image I have of writing a letter to them and mailing it before I die so they know what they did and what others did ruined a person. 

But even just in a larger sense, everyone would realize I was always struggling and this isnâ€™t just some phase or something I want for myself. I want out of the pain but I donâ€™t feel ready. 

Iâ€™m just tired of fighting with myself. Even though Iâ€™m better than I was a year ago, Iâ€™m still fighting daily and I donâ€™t understand how thatâ€™s sustainable.
