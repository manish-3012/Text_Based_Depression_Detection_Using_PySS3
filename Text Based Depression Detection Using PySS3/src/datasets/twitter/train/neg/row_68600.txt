Unloved, meaningless, broken, worthless.I feel like, in just a few short months, I've gone from "struggling twenty-something hanging on and trying to make it" to "poor lower class broken cog." I have zero sense of self-worth or pride in myself. I can't carry a conversation with people I used to be good friends with because all I can think is that I can't say too much or they'll see that I'm defective. I spend at least half the time I'm awake thinking about killing myself. Statistically, I don't matter. I can already hear myself starting to sound like a "crazy person," the sort of person I would have mocked six months ago or more. I just feel so broken and I don't want to live this farce anymore. I exist only as a cog in the machine of wage slavery. My youth is gone and the last door of opportunity are closing. I'd rather die than keep suffering indignity.
