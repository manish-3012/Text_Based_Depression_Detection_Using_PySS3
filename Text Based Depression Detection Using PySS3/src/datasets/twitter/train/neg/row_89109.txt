It didnt get better.I was 12 when I had my first panic attack. I didnt know then, that it would be 10 years of painful, debilitating chest pains and continued sickness.

My health continues to deteriorate. I develop new symptoms of anxiety, physical and mental, and the barriers to changing my reality are immense; financial, social. I am constantly sick, and my immune system is garbage. I can barely eat for health and anxiety reasons.

I just cant take this anymore. I don't want to be sick anymore. Objectively, I dont think a life like this is worth it. I havent been suicidal in years. It's like it was so far at the back of my head, I never considered it.

But this past semester at school has completely shattered me. And I dont want to be around for the next. All I can think about these past few weeks, almost manically, is killing myself.

...

I needed to get that out.
