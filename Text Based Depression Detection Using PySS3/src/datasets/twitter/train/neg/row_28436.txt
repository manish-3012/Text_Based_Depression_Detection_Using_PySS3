I am going to kill myself tonightI plan on killing myself tonight after everyone is asleep. I am about to go eat dinner with my family, watch one last episode of Impractical Jokers, and then when everybody goes to sleep I am going to get a knife from downstairs and stab myself in the heart.

I was originally diagnosed as bipolar but then rediagnosed as bpd and some traits of npd as well as generalized anxiety. My meds are working well but I my parents are divorced and I often forget to bring the meds between the two houses and I become unstable quickly. Whenever I go off the meds I feel alive. Livfe feels shitty and all hell breaks loose, but I feel alive and I never want to go back on them even though they help. I cannot see my therapist anymore because I just do not have time in my schedule. I knew him for over a year and we were extremely close. We were even about to start DBT.

I always said I would go out on my own terms. The pain of living is too much for me to handle. The erratic mood swings, shitty friends, shitty school where I don't fit in, all of it. I'm a fucking brilliant person but my mental illness is debilitating. If there was a god, he would never wish this on anybody. I cannot get any work done and I get scolded by parents and teachers because they know I am more than what I produce for them. I have trouble getting close to others because I have big trust issues after spectacular crashes of relationships. I have no enjoyable things in my life and the small amounts of dopamine I get from youtube or reddit become regret. All enjoyment has been sucked from my life and living is just too painful. I honestly believe that life is better for some if they are just dead. I am sorry for anyone reading this if you have a mental illness. Life is hell but you will find your place eventually. I just don't think mine is here.
