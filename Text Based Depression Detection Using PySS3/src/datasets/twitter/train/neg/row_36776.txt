i think iâ€™m going to die sooni hope i will. i have a feeling tonightâ€™s the night. my boyfriend cheated on me, i got expelled, i have nothing anymore, i feel worthless. i want to be good enough, why am i not good enough? it doesnâ€™t matter anyway. i love you all, i hope all of you live through this. i believe in you.
