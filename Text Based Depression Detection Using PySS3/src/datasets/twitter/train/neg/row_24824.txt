How to deal with the aftermath of an attempt?After I ended up in the ER, everyone has been breathing down my neck. I can't go anywhere or do anything. Everyone expects me to suddenly be happy and normal. But I feel much of the same. I can't show any signs of sadness or they basically threaten me to the hospital. The reality? I really don't care what happens to me. I'm going through the motions to keep everyone happy, while simultaneously planning my own death one day.
