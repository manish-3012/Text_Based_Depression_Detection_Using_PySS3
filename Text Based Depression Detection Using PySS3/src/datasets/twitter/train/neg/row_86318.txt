i canâ€™t be here. i donâ€™t deserve the world we live in.the world is a terrible place. i donâ€™t want to be here. i hate being a woman in society. i hated having to break myself further by arguing when my male friend told be to â€œget overâ€ my sexual assault. i hate the world so much and i deserve so much better than this. i donâ€™t want to be alive at all. iâ€™m tired of being tired. nothing gives me peace anymore. no one understands the depth of my mind. i know itâ€™s not true deep down, but i just feel like a glitch. i feel like iâ€™m not human. i feel more advanced than this world and it canâ€™t provide what i need to be satisfied. i hate that we have to live in bodies. it limits us all at different rates. iâ€™m just so tired. iâ€™ve been hurt so much by the world that thereâ€™s no point in trying to stay to make a difference.
