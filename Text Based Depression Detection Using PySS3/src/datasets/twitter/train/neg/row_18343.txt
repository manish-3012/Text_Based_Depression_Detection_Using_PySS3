I just donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m feelingI donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s simple the last 6 months have been the most insane in my life between long term relationships ending. People moving out. Being fired. Being broke being scared about the future. And if the few people who are still around even care beyond me reaching out.    I donâ€™t feel as if Iâ€™m suicidal however I do constantly have thoughts in which I off my self and that scares me more than anything.    I donâ€™t want to put these thoughts aside and dismiss them as they are obviously somthing.   I have also been of my medication for anxiety for a few months due to loosing coverage. However should note that things were like this even while on them.   So Iâ€™m short idk what Iâ€™m thinking  all I know is Iâ€™m scared
