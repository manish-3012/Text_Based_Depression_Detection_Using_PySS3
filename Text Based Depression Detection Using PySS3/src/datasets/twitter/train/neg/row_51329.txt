I worry about my sister every day.My sister's in a bad place. She's struggled with suicidality for a long time. I've also dealt with it, so I know a lot of what she's going through, and I see the place she's in. What worries me is that she refuses to take suicide off the table like I did. When I talk to her, I can tell she still secretly romanticizes death. She longs for the dark, the quiet, to disappear, and it worries me. Every time I don't hear from her, I think she's done something.

I want her to get help, to make a concerted effort to get better, but I can't want it for her. I worry she doesn't really want to get better, that she wants to languish until she's "forced" into suicide by the circumstances of her life. She wants the decision to be made for her.

Any attempts at encouraging her to seek help just overwhelms her. She crumbles because it's too hard for her, and unless we micromanage her, she misses appointments and doesn't take her medication.

How do you save someone who doesn't want to be saved? Am I doomed to watch my sister's descent? My mom told me today that she's starting to resent her for what she's doing. How do you deal with this shit?
