What did I do wrongI cannot believe how this past month has gone. I just don't know where to start. I will say it's not all been bad but something horrible and unspeakable happened this morning and I don't know if I'll recover. I feel too scared to be left alone and I can't sleep. I'm just tired. I just want to sleep forever.
