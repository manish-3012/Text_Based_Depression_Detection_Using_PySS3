Can Tylenol help me calm down?I'm feeling extremely anxious and scared right now. I have back to back exams tmr and one them is going to be held right after my scheduled drive test. Ive already failed the drive test 3 times and im not confident I can pass this time and im worried I'll experience a streak of failure for the whole week. I already feel like I've failed my math midterm that I took yesterday. Im scared that my dad will yell and berate me again. I dont know what to do. I just want everything to slow down. Ive already had intense overwhelming feelings that I cant really describe rn but ive tried to hang myself on the first occasion and suffocate myself on the second. I failed both times. Ive been having thoughts about standing on the train tracks near the dmv im gonna be taking my test at and hoping a train will pass by around the same time im taking my test. My heart is beating fast, im trembling, and I've been trying non stop to hold in my tears because im afraid my dad will yell at me. I feel like just taking the whole bottle at this point but I dont want to fail and suffer permanent damage but maybe if I harm myself super badly they'll take me seriously for once but then they'll see me as weak and pathetic and I cant decide which is worse.
