ThingsThings have been in a downward spiral for the last three years. Last night I found myself looking up exes so that I might ask one of them to take me out. I didn't follow through, but this is becoming an everyday occurrence of trying to convince myself that I should live although I feel like a burden to my mother who has to support me because I don't have a job. I don't know what to do anymore.
