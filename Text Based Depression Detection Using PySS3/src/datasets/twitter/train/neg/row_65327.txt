Pills for suicide?My friend is saying she's gonna take all of her pills today (oxycodone and Xanax) and never wake up. This is very strange and out of character for her, so is there anything I can say or do?

The joke's on her because I straight jacked all her good pills a couple weeks ago. I ate them. They were excellent.
