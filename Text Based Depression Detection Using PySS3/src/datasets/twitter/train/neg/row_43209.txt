I dont know if there are anymore steps I can takei don't know what to say. i don't really have a reason to be upset. but i just really want someone to talk to, who can actually help me. i really feel like no one can. i don't even want to start. but i can't deal with being like this anymore. I'm losing this war. i don't think I'm suicidal. but then i keep contemplating maybe... 

im sorry i don't even want to say anything. I just need to make it through the next few days, because each day feels so hard to get through right now.
