Overworked, underappreciatedTitle. I'm working way too much, and my SO isn't pulling his/her weight (I'm trying not to be too identifiable here). My work usually consists of one day off a week, lots of doubles, and lots of morning shifts directly after night shifts. The job itself is miserable as hell too. I have no free time, and no time to get enough sleep. My employer won't budge on the schedule

On top of that, my SO won't put in the effort to get a driver's license and is constantly needing rides to work (especially on my day off), which further cuts into my limited time off. They know what I'm going through and still won't put in the effort to lighten the load. Instead, they leave me to pay all the bills and spend everything they make on stuff they want, not that I'd have time to enjoy my money anyways.

The obvious answer is to get a new job and end the relationship, maybe find someone else who actually tries, but I don't have the energy left to do either. All I can ever think about anymore is how much I want to die. It doesn't help that I've been with my SO for 4 years now, and that there's a bit of a lost cost fallacy at play, which still works somehow even when I'm aware of it. I don't want those 4 years to be for nothing. I guess they still will be if I kill myself. Nothing makes sense.

I don't want to do this anymore. I'm getting worked like a dog, I'm tired **all the time**, and all the while someone I'm kind of starting to hate benefits from my suffering like a fucking parasite that's about to kill their host.
