"I'm fine"I'm so sick of saying this over and over again. I sit in bed writing Suicide notes while messaging my best friend and saying that stupid phrase "I'm fine". She sees my self harm scars. She knows that that must mean that there are times when I say I'm fine when I'm not. I'm so sick of people believing that just because they don't want to have to deal with the idea that someone isn't fine. I wish someone would just say to me. I know your not fine or tell me I'm lying. I know the answer to this question is not to say I'm fine but if I start saying how rubbish I'm feeling all the time then I'm being dramatic and making it up because "no one is miserable all the time". So I'm either fine or faking it. This world is so screwed up and I can't wait to leave
