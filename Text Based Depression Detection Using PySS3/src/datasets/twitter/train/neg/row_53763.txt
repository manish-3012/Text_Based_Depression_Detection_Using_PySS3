donâ€™t know who I really am anymoreThere are so many people in my head, they are trying to take control over me like they are fighting. Itâ€™s hard when the bad one controls me, like I will be suicidal, depressed, violent, empty, numb and lifeless. But when the GOOD one comes, I am energised, happy, lovely, kind and cheerful (people who say they like me, i think they just like the GOOD me) so when people appreciate me, i just feel like they only like SOME PARTS of me. Itâ€™s weird and confusing. I donâ€™t feel like to live anymore, why do i have to live my life which i canâ€™t even control it? Ok then the good parts of me are screaming and begging for help but the bad ones are super stubborn so i just ignore the help :((
