My spirit feels broken.The last year has been really shitty to me. The past couple weeks especially. My girlfriend of one year broke up with me last week right before finals, saying I wasn't at fault or anything but that she felt she was just stressing me out. But anyway we had previously made plans to skip prom today and have a couple's dinner instead. But I found out that she instead just went to prom with another guy. Imagine coming home from having some of the shittiest past couple weeks of your life (a lot of other things happened too) and the first thing you say after logging onto Facebook is your brand new ex (who expressed the sentiment of perhaps getting back together soon) in big fat album of high resolution photos in a prom dress, in front of her house, with another guy. I just feel so crushed right now that words fail to describe how horrible I feel. I really feel like dying. I feel so alone. I don't have many friends to talk to, and none I can talk to right now. I don't know what I thought posting this would accomplish, but idk, I'm pretty desperate for anything kind of comfort right now. I don't even have any family I can go.

Sorry for the wall of text. I'm pretty distraught right now and am basically just rambling.
