I just want this off my chestI keep on thinking that I want to die, that I do not want to wake up someday. My parents and sister do not know about this but I sometimes tell my brothers, cousins, and friends in a satirical manner so as that they dont worry about me too much. Everyday I think and utter to myself the words "I want to die" when I am alone, and I dont even know why. I cant find purpose to continue on living but Im too scared about the fact that if I dont continue on living, how would my family and friends react to it.
Sorry for posting about this, I just really wanted it off my chest and thank you for your time. :)
