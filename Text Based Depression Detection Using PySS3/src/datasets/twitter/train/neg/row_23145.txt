Contemplating taking all of the pills I haveI don't want to live. I never wanted to. I have the pills with me and I'm just playing with the pill bottles, opening and closing them. Trying to mentally prepare myself for what I'm going to do. 

Now, you may ask me, "why?" Or "what has brought you to this point?" And my answer to that would probably go something like this.

I've thought about this for a while. The only thing preventing me from doing it before was thoughts that I'd become a vegetable and screw the attempt up somehow and end up in a coma. But recently I've just stopped caring about the possibility of becoming a vegetable. The thought of me suffering seems like a delight. I've always had a vendetta against myself, maybe I'll succeed in taking down my nemesis soon. Either that or my nemesis will suffer for the rest of his days in a hospital bed. Now before you say anything like "think about your family", yes, of course I've thought about them. I've seen horror stories from people who have lost someone from suicide. I saw this one person who's brother shot himself in the head and ended up surviving but was pretty much braindead and gone. So they had to say goodbye to him right then and there before they pulled the plug. Very scary stuff, these past couple months I've been thinking very carefully about the consequences my suicide would make for other people, especially my parents, and my brothers. This is true, however I don't know if any of that really matters anyway, because I won't be there to witness it, I'd already be dead, I won't have to feel anything, good nor bad. So minor circumstances like what my suicide would do to people wont really matter.
