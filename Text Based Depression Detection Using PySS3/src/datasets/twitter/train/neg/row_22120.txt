I seem to be discovering more ways to die.I've been on medications for almost a year now. They say it gets better but why do I end up looking for easier things I can hang myself onto. I really want to admit myself to the hospital because I can feel it getting worse and worse. I've been attempting so many times now and I'm just waiting for that right triggering moment. I'm in a constant feeling of being lost but at the same time frustrated because I always seem to pussy out. I don't know anymore. Right now I just really want to hang myself.
