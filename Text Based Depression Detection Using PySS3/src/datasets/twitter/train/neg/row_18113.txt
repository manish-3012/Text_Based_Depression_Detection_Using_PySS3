Idk if Iâ€™ll be Sad TodayYesterday was hard. I was suicidal for no reason. I let my bf know and he just was tense for the evening and kind of mean. I get that itâ€™s out of stress but Iâ€™m stressed too. This morning he asks if Iâ€™m going to be sad again today and I donâ€™t know what to say. I think thereâ€™s something wrong with me and Iâ€™m worried about it, but I canâ€™t tell you when Iâ€™ll be okay again.
