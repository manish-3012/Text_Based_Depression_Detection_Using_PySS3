Life is so miserable, why bother...23 still single, went to Ivy League school , worked hard, got a good job, still miserable because of how I look, sometimes it isn't even about not having a gf anymore, sometimes j just feel like second race just for being ugly. Seeing good looking guys and girls being all happy and enjoying being themselves while I lie to myself that I don't need anyone, that I'm happy to be who I am and I'm content with a great career when im really not.


I am ashamed to say it but sometimes i feel like a murderer who is good looking have more worth than me, people don't say it but deep down they believe that, remember how many were going crazy about that handsome looking Boston bomber? A fucking terrorist gets that kind of love just because he's good looking.....

I don't wanna live in this world anymore, tired of it, I am no saint either so I supposed no one will moan over my death. For so long I work hard and volunteer and always thinking of ways to help contribute to improve people's life, but I am at the end of my patience,  done contributing, it's time I do something for myself for once, and end my life.

maybe I will do it somewhere far, in the woods, so no one will know, or be affected by it...
