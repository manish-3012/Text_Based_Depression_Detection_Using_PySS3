Love hurts.My wife wants a divorce... told me today that she doesn't love me anymore. We've had our problems, this is all my fault anyway, but I never thought she'd stop loving me. I always hoped we'd work through it, but after today, I don't know. I teach suicide Intervention, but right now all I can think of is killing myself. I don't know why I'm here.
