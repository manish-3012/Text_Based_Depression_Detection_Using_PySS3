How do people go on knowing that the world is absolutely fucked and that nothing will ever change?Nothing ever gets better, it's just small victories on an overall decline. I'm always told to think positive, as if the positives outweigh the fact that the world is dying and everybody either denies that simple fact or does nothing to actually address it.
