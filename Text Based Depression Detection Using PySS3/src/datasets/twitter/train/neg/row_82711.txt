Game addictionI don't know how active this sub is but I'm gonna post anyway. I just really feel very low right now. In the past few months I've become addicted to this game and spent over Â£400 on it. I don't have the money for it, but I seem to not be able to help myself. I don't have a job, I'm in uni full-time. I've been very depressed. 

I don't have a lot of friends, which is probably why I've managed to become addicted like this to a game. I'm so stressed about money with probably Â£1000 overdrawn and yet here I am spending money on this game. I've made friends with people through it so I can't just uninstall it and I've spent so much that it would be a waste to just leave it now. I need to get a job somewhere. 

Covid means everything in my life is shit. I don't know how to explain it other than I haven't had sex in months, I'm behind on all my work and this game just takes up all my time. I'm overweight, I'm lonely, I'm poor, I'm stupid. This all seems to be leading to only one place. A place where I've been before. When I was 17 I attempted suicide during my college exams by jumping into traffic. It didn't work obviously. In fact I barely got injured at all. Now I'm at my parent's house for Christmas and I couldn't kill myself here because I wouldn't want to hurt them. My plan is to kill myself after my 21st birthday which is coming up soon while I'm away at my flat by jumping off this bridge I have in mind. I don't want to but I feel like I have to. Otherwise everyone will find out how much I've fucked up. 

I've got so many problems that I seem incapable of dealing with. This is the only thing I can think of. 

I hate myself so much it's unbearable
