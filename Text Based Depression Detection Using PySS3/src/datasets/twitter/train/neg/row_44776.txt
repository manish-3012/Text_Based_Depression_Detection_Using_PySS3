I need to dieI want to die so bad. I have tried suicide numerous times, and one was almost succesful. I hate these suicidal thoughts, because they make me feel like a bad person. I was just drinking with my aunt (long story) and all she constantly told me to not to die. Everyone around me are so afraid of me dying, and tells me that I don't have premission to die.
It makes me feel so bad.
Please. Let me die...
