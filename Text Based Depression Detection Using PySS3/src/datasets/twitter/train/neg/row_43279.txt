I feel living in this system is living my life in vain.US citizen. You know how it is. Poor health coverage. Debt based education. Pitiful social security. Horrid politicians digging the middle and lower class our early graves.  

I've really been struggling lately with the fact that I have dreams and passions, but the 9-5 (or in my case 7 - 5:30) grind is stealing my will and my energy to do what I actually want to do. 

I've been seeking therapy for a year now. I had grief over a recent tragedy to cope with. I struggled for a bit to find some direction and bend my life into shape. 

I did that, but-

Now that I'm starting my path on a job I always thought I'd want - I realized that this isn't giving me pride or passion. I don't feel fulfilled doing this. I don't want to be at work right now as I type this. 

I'm so tired of waking up and forfeiting days of my life that I'll never get back, just to fill someone else's pockets. 

Time away from who I love and what I love to do - I'm sick of it. 

But that's the reality, and I feel such a desperate need to escape. I don't want to die. But I have the sinking suspicion that there's no other way to live in this era; live to work an ultimately meaningless job just for money. 

You get two, maybe three days to be yourself and live **your** life. Fulfill ***your*** needs, possibly leaving room for others. 

But then you get four to five days out of the week that you just want to get over with. That you don't want to live through at all. 

And then you get what? 2 weeks off *maybe*, depending on the job? 
2 weeks of your life in exchange for an entire year wasted.

It's like I'm doomed to die an unfulfilled drone in the corporate machine. 

I feel the need to end it before I truly die inside. If all that's left is the grind, then I don't want it. I don't want to be here, if I cannot be allowed to truly live.
