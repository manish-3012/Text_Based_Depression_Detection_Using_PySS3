I think someone I know is going to kill them self. What do I do?I have a family member with a history of suicidal thoughts, currently living alone a few hours from me. They recently purchased a gun.

Got a phone call from another family member (they DO NOT get along, haven't spoken in years) saying they received an ominous phone message. No response to return calls.

What do I do? I'm afraid to just accuse a family member of planning to kill another one, but I'm honestly afraid...
