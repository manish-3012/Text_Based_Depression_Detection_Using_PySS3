Iâ€™m really struggling to keep goingi havenâ€™t had a super traumatic life. i havenâ€™t had anything horrible happen. iâ€™m someone youâ€™d expect to live a happy and normal life. instead all i can think about is suicide. i think i had my first suicidal thought around age 7 and now iâ€™m 17. itâ€™s progressively getting worse and hasnâ€™t gone away. i have two loving parents and amazing friends but iâ€™m pretty much at the point of giving in. i want to just take the remainder of my antidepressants and just end it. Iâ€™ve tried getting professional help but they barely take me seriously and iâ€™ve been through so many psychiatric nurses and enough psychiatrists to know that they wonâ€™t take me seriously for a while. would it be so wrong to give up and end it all?
