I have given upI sat at the corner of my room and realized that. I donâ€™t care about anything. The world has stripped me of my aspirations and personality. I can barely read and anything that is motivating for some just sounds like yelling to me. My mother had to pick me up the other day and she put me in her house with everything provided but I can only think about killing myself. â€œNew year. No me.â€ I used to try frantically to find a solution to my predicament but now I couldnâ€™t care less about living, about the beauty of the world when you â€œget your ass out of bed and go outside,â€ or people who care about me. Itâ€™s not their fault Iâ€™m this way then please stop taking it personally. Theyâ€™re grabbing at straws trying to keep me alive. My mother doesnâ€™t let me go out because sheâ€™s scared. Everything sucks. If only I could book a hotel room and take a trip around this damned town in my damned third world country before I died then Iâ€™d probably be a happy girl. Or go to New York, I loved New York...
