Not going to tell my life story on here, but I fuck everything up. Relationships, school (am about to drop out of engineering school), I like gaming but I'm not good enough to be a pro and don't have a good speaking voice or social skills to stream or make videos for a living, it seems like everything I touch ends up going to shit. About the only thing I haven't completely fucked up was my job, which coronavirus has for me. It didn't pay the best, but hey at it wasn't too bad ... while it existed.

Every day I wake up and just sleepwalk through the day thinking "Tonight I'm gonna do it" and I end up drinking myself to sleep ... or I get exhausted late at night (or early in the morning). Just, fuck I feel like I'm stuck with nowhere to go. I've been trying to make youtube videos again but I just, can't. My voice is shit, and everything I try to make without talking is so painfully boring.

tl;dr I live with parents, no job, about to not be in school, have no real close friends, no significant other, and no fucking idea what to do with my life. Being suicidal isn't new for me, but having nothing to do or look forward to is. In the past I've always had hope like "If this works out I'll be okay" but now I just have nothing to even look forward to.
