I don't have any sense of identity!I've never felt like I've had any sense of identity, everyday I feel like a bland human being who is just here to work for other people until I die. 

One of my best friends is a lesbian and she has a great sense of identity, I'm been thinking of going gay just for the sake of having an identity because right now, I just feel like bland white straight guy number 500,000. 

My life is nothing but boring and uninteresting. You have to be someone different in order to be happy. I've considered becoming a woman, or like I said before, turn gay! 

But I guess that can not happen. So I'll just kill myself instead.
