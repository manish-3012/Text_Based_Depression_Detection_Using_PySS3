i am incapable of being lovedmy entire life ive been lonely. my family has never cared about me. all of my relationships have failed. iâ€™ve never had a real friend. i just wanna kill myself. i donâ€™t see the point in being alive anymore. i just want love but no one is gonna give it to me. i want to be dead more than anything. committing suicide would be the kindest thing i could do for myself.
