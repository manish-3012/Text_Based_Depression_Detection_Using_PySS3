I've finally made up my mindI've been struggling for 4 years now. It just got harder and harder everyday. This friday was my prom and I realized that I wont have my close friends with me anymore. They will not be around anymore. I don't think I can live without them. In about a month or so my parents will go away for holiday. I will take around 15 painkillers and then some more. Any pill I can find. I've had enough.
