i just cant go onmy parents wont even look at me anymore. they never listen to me and blame me for my autism, depression, anxiety, dissociation, and ulcerative colitis. they threaten to fucking kick me out if i dont get over my mental illness even though im 17 and they know thats not how it works.

i just laid on my bed crying, cutting, and slamming my head into the wall for 15 minutes with a razor to my wrist. i just dont know what to do anymore. they refuse to even try and comfort me or look at me, and i just cant fucking live like this. they constantly attack my deepest fears and it almost seems like theyre trying to get me to kill myself

i just dont wanna live anymore

edit: my bed is covered in blood and there's a hole in the wall. my parents are gonna kick me out for sure when they see it.
