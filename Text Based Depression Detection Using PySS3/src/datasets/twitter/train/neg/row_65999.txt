OiItâ€™s so hard for me to do anything while contemplating suicide so much, as though in my mind â€œthereâ€™s no future, youâ€™re already as good as deadâ€. So why care? Why try? 

I grow closer and closer to actually reckoning my â€œfateâ€ but Iâ€™m still going for a couple of reasons and itâ€™s genuine agony to live my everyday life. 

My mother, my friends, my brother would all be affected, and I understand the impact it would have. But half of the reason I want to off myself is to anguish pain, into those same people for ignoring my feelings. Itâ€™s all so selfish or whatever, but each day I care less and less; something is bound to push me over the edge.
