At the end of my ropeI've been really struggling this year. I was inpatient at a hospital 4 months out of the year. I'm getting a divorce, got discharged from the military, had to move back in with my grandma all the way across the country and she just got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. I have no money, no job and no support network anymore. I feel like there's no purpose in being alive. All i feel like is a burden and I can't even take care of myself. I don't think living is worth it anymore.
