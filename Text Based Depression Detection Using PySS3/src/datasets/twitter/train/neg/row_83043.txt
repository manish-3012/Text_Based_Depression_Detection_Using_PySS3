no reasons to liveThere's no reason for to be here.. I don't want anyone to say it get's better because there is absolutely no guarantee that it will. All I've been dealt with in life is a bad hand and even when I get slightly good things I have to suffer for it... Not in a way that I am relieved to get but in a way that I am so emotionally drained that it doesn't even feel good anymore. In a utopia, I would love to be alive and enjoy life but I can't. I had two anxiety attacks today. I also did something good for someone then was robbed merely seconds later. Life sucks, people suck. Nothing good happens. There's no reason for me to be here, there are 7 billion people here, my existence even if you were to factor in all the people I interact with is negligible. Everyone leaves me or all my friends put distance between me and them, i don't like it... I cant control them but am I that awful a human being that no one wants to remain close to me? Don't tell me to seek help, I've tried.. I went to a therapist for some time... he's gone on a Sabbatical Leave now and wont be back for another 6 months.. I know its a coincidence but I mean,what are the odds even my therapist would "abandon" me too, right? Sigh.. I need to die, however no suicide method is foolproof and my anxious self envisions me fucking it up and living the rest of my days fucking paralyzed...something i dont want... Maybe, I'll overcome this anxiety and kill myself one day. I hope I do.
