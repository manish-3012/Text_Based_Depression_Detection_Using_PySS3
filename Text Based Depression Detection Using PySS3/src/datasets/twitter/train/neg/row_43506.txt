I'm just so tired.I'm tired. Tired of switching medications. Tired of the side effects and the mood swings. Tired of feeling better and hopeful and then suddenly crashing down again, wanting to die, wanting to give up.

I don't know what to do.

I'm so incredibly suicidal. I've been on the edge for so long, holding on, I don't know how long I can keep it up.
