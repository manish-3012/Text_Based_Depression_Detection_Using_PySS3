Friend tried to OD on pills today. Not sure what to do.I apologize if I leave out any details. There's a LOT of things that have happened and I just don't have the willpower to type in everything. If you need clarification, ask, and I'll edit my OP to give detail.

A friend of mine tried to kill herself today. What led her to decide to try to take her own life are the following:

* For several months, she hung out with a group that peer pressured her to take dangerous diet pills in order to lose weight. She has serious body image issues
* Said group stalked her after work and coerced her to take some pills which led her to black out. She woke up in the ER room.
* Someone broke into her grandparents' house (she and her mom and brother lives with her grandparents) and stole the car along with some other belongings. Her mom tried to blame her first and the cops interrogated her. Turns out (surprise) that she didn't steal the car
* She's struggling in school. She works full-time as well to support herself and she's failing one class.
* She and her mother got in a huge fight in which her mother said some very caustic words after discovering a pack of razors in her room.

More details on her mother: I have only what my friend said, but her mother (and the rest of her family) aren't very supportive at all. They're strict, religious people, and don't like the fact that she doesn't share the same religious beliefs as they do. When she told her mother about the drugs/blackout incident, she got mad and was mad the entire time she took her to the hospital to get a rape kit done. According to her, her own brother said that he wish he didn't have her as a sister.

Before she tried to take her own life, she called a local suicide prevention hotline. She said that the guy who answered the call wasn't very understanding so she hung up and gave up. 

Any advice would be appreciated. She tried going to the school mental health office, and didn't like the lead counselor. She said the counselor was way too touchy-feely and made her uncomfortable. 

I feel like this has become a dead end. The school counselor wasn't helpful. The suicide intervention counselor wasn't helpful. Her own fucking parent's blame the victim. I'm so tempted to just call her mom and tell her to buck the fuck up and be there for her daughter.

Suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I fear that she's going to try this again. I suggested that she drop out of her math class to reduce the stress.
