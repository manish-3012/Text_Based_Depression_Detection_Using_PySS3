I can never think of a titleI don't know what to do anymore about this. Ive felt the need to kill myself for some time now. I haven't yet cause I feel like at some point the feelings and thoughts have to go away and Ill feel better, but who knows when that will be, I cant wait that long really. I cut on a daily basis to get by. 

The other reason Im still here is because doing it might hurt my friends and family. Well lately I haven't seen my friends as much, barely ever, I cant help but think in my mind that they realize the same negative things I think about myself. Hangin with them is one of the few things I really enjoy anymore and its all going away. 

Ive written 11 letters to freinds and family over the past half month. I know my situation will not likely improve, and all the reasons I hate myself and the reasons I want to kill myself cant change. I dont want to be here in the future wondering when Ill feel better. the next time I get a whirl of emotions I know ill try something stupid. I really don't know what the hell to do anymore
