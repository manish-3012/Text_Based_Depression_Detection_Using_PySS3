I will never be happy and it will only get worse. I don't see any solutions, but I want to see one.Hello, thanks for reading, I appreciate it. I have been facing this issue for years and can't find a solution which begins to confirm my hopelessness, so I greatly appreciate advice. I am male, 19

**Hopelessness:** I feel completely hopeless because I want to be happy, but believe I never will be. For me to be happy, I mainly desire good relationships with others and also a feeling of success.

**Relationships:** To have a good relationship, you need to care about each other. I am very narcissistic and sociopathic because I love myself so much and don't care about others at all. I am so self centered and selfish and I offer nothing to no one else, so as a result I literally have no one to talk to. The most conversation I have in a typical day is usually at a drive thru window.

**Success:** I don't believe I will ever be successful because I am really stupid. My brain moves slower than others, others do less work and do better, I am unable to even read books now, I just get dumber and dumber. On top of it, I am low class, labourer, stupid. Somehow at the same time, I think I am smarter than everyone else, because I am a narcissist.

**How I feel:** I know it's just emotions but they actually physically burn all the time in my chest. Being alone all the time for over a full year, really drives me crazy. I feel dissociated from the world, and my brain goes crazy in trying to torture myself mentally and sometimes physically. Sometimes I have burned and hurt myself but that is really not as painful as when I have a bad night where my brain is really angry at me. I wish I was able to be human and have relationships. But I'm so evil and pathetic. I feel so hopeless. I want to have a lobotomy and forget this personality I have and be ANYONE else but me. I often fantasize about the ways I want to punish myself. I consider suicide. Every time I look in the mirror, I feel strong shame and anger at the same time, it is really almost like I have two personas in me.

**Getting professional help:** I have in the past, but I can't now due to affordability, proximity and quality. I am poor. I do want help, I even spent $600 on four visits to a therapist and she was fantastic. But I couldn't afford it anymore and as well, I moved for college and now I am in a very small town. It takes at least an hour drive to get to *any* somewhat therapeutic place, this costs lots of money for transport and time. I can't afford therapy. I don't have insurance, but my mom does, but it only covers certain therapists that only have like a diploma and are really not effective (Yes, I've tried a lot of them before). I know its recommended to try lots of them, but I don't enjoy/want to be opening up with lots of people who are ineffective. Same goes for free community or group therapy stuff. I know I sound like a snob. As well, it would be worse for me to open up with parents/family who I am not close enough for that and would make things worse for me. Without going into more detail, family is not an option.

Everything I said here is me trying to manipulate you into treating me with pity, even this sentence and even me acknowledging it. If you knew me inside, you'd want me to feel this pain and more as well.

But I really just want a REAL solution. I know "it will get better" and all the rest. But I provided this information because I seek suggestions on a course of action I can take. I feel I have no options.

Thank you
