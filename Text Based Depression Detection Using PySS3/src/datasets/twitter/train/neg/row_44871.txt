To those considering...I don't mean to take away face time from posts of those in need, but I do want to share something that may help:

When I was in eighth grade, I was visited pretty late in the night by one of my friends. She had walked down the street from where she lived to tell me she was going to run into the road and kill herself. 

At the time, I really had no grasp on the concept of suicide and was terrified that I was somehow responsible for her thoughts and potential actions. I felt almost as helpless as her.

I didn't know how to help and she left. To this day, I don't know why I let her leave. That night was sleepless and long. Her parents called around to all her friends asking where she was and I knew I was the last to have seen her. I told her parents where I thought she may have gone.

My mom stayed awake with me that night and told me only one thing: "You've done nothing wrong and neither has she. But if you ever feel like her, remember that today is a snapshot of your life and I'd like you to be around to see the big picture."

Eventually her parents called very late to say they had found her in the place I guessed she'd ran to.

In the morning, I wrote my mom's little Ghandi-esque quote on a notecard. I didn't expect to see my friend at school, but we passed each other in the hall. She wouldn't speak to me, angry that I'd revealed her location to her parents. I didn't say anything, but handed her the card.

The two of us didn't really talk throughout the rest of the year, but, when our class passed around yearbooks in the auditorium on the last day of school, she wrote "Thank you," in mine. Reading that gave me so much strength and continues to.

**TL;DR:** My friend came to me, suicidal. My mom told me something that I passed on (which prevented the suicide) and that I want to pass on to you: "Today is a snapshot of your life. And there's always someone who wants you to be around to see the big picture."
