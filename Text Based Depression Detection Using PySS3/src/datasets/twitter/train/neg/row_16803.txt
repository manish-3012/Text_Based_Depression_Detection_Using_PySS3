everything is just so stupid there is no point anymoreI'm a 17 year old girl , Iv'e never done anything with my teenage years other than sit in a mental hospital. Iv'e fallen in love with someone so much but we will never happen and it makes me really sad, I cant get through school and my dad ruined my chance of doing the GED program, iv'e sent in over 30 applications and nobody has gotten back, I cant drive anywhere on my own, I have to sit and be around my toxic parents all day, I've never ever  had friends or acquaintances to talk to and thats not an exaggeration, I am always depressed and it's so hard to make it through the day, and always so anxious to the point where its to much to handle and I keep having panic attacks, I'm really really ugly, I sit at a computer screen all day and do nothing and occasionally take breaks to stare at the ceiling and cry.

The person I love and me talk all the time, but I know one day they are going to most likely leave me and I am so so scared of that day to come, they've almost become my reason to live which I know is so so toxic but I cant even help it, when I think of offing myself I think of them and I dont want to do that to them, but I think they are starting to get annoyed with me, which makes things hard lol

Idk what to even do anymore nothing feels real and everything feels like a sad simulation and I'm not moving foward in life so i hope I can just do it and succeed in the next few weeks, I'm almost kind of excited, I wont be suffering, and I wont be making other people suffer either, its a win win for everyone, my death.
