I donâ€™t want to kill myselfI donâ€™t want to die this way, but i think i inevitably will, no one can save me from myself. Everyday takes so much effort to function mediocrely. I want to live but I donâ€™t think I can change. Itâ€™s just a waiting game. Iâ€™m not depressed enough to want to act on my thoughts, Iâ€™m too scared and I care too much about the people around me. I just want to die and take everyoneâ€™s suffering with me. I want everyone to be happy because they deserve that. I wish there was a way I could sacrifice myself and make everyone better. Iâ€™ve had enough of suffering, I canâ€™t bear to see it. I feel empathy so hard, because of the severe depressive episode I went through a few years ago. I canâ€™t bear to imagine anyone experiencing that. It breaks my heart. I convinced myself not to die but Iâ€™ve never truly felt at peace, life for me is just exhausting attempts at constantly distracting myself from the depressive thoughts that I just canâ€™t get rid off. Iâ€™ve learnt how to cope, but Iâ€™ve never been cured. One day when I feel the time is right, when Iâ€™ve distanced myself enough from my friends and when my parents have died, it would probably be the time I end my life.
