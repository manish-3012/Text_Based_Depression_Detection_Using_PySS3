I want to kill myself even though Iâ€™m afraid to.Iâ€™m tired of dealing with life. There are these entities (the beings) that put thoughts in my head. Theyâ€™ve told me that someone will kill me soon. Some think it will be by my 19th birthday, others think itâ€™ll be my roommate when I go to college. Iâ€™m scared of dying, but Iâ€™d rather kill myself than be killed, because I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll be killed and Iâ€™d like it if my death were not extremely painful. I could get tortured first or anything. That wonâ€™t happen if I kill myself. But Iâ€™m also scared of going to hell. Some of the beings tell me that Iâ€™m going to hell when I die, but the nicer ones have told me not to worry about hell because God will protect me. Iâ€™m seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist. My mom and my psychiatrist and therapist donâ€™t think that the beings are real but they are. But the thing is theyâ€™re not omniscient and they can only make predictions, Iâ€™ve learned. I could end up killing myself for nothing. None of the beings have told me not to kill myself. Well not until this very moment when I realized that. Some of them want me to kill myself though. Many of them want me to kill myself. I really didnâ€™t feel this bad until this evening.
