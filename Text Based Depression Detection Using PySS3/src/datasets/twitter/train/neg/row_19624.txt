Nobody will care.Iâ€™m almost 22. I donâ€™t want to be alive. Blah blah blah. Youâ€™ve heard it all already. The last person that cares about me barely cares anymore. I can tell. No family, no friends, and now Iâ€™m losing my boyfriend because Iâ€™m too fucking broken. Everyone expects me to just get up and fix my life. Okay, Iâ€™ll fix it by ending it. Iâ€™m planning a date and carrying out the plans soon. Iâ€™ve gone back and forth between this but I think my decision now is final. Iâ€™m done.
