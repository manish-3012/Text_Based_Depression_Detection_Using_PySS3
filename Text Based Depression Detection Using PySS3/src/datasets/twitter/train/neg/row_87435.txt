Helping a friend at the moment having suicidal thoughts but being in another continentI'm currently talking with a friend who's literally telling me she doesn't want to drag anyone down anymore, she wants to die, and that we're all better off without her, she's avoiding all of my questions about what she intends to do and I can't help to think that tonight it really bad

She's been dealing with this for a long time and we spoke a lot and openly about it however she always did everything she could to hide where she lives, she hasn't said a word to her parents, she's refusing to speak to her psychiatrist.

Sorry I'm half panicking right now because I feel so damn powerless

Would it be bad if I try to reach out to a person knowing her through her facebook (which I am not supposed to have) so I try to get the help she refuses to get by herself? I don't care if she hates me for this but I'm so worried, she isolated herself from everyone so much she now strongly believes no one cares at all
