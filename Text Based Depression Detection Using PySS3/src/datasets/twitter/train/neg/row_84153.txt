I just want to kill myselfI've been depressed for.. god knows how long, 2 years or more? And suicidal for 1+... my emotions are crazy, I take zoloft but makes just a slight difference, and I'm so suicidal lately, and I dont want it to go away. I read about suicide and think of a belt around my neck or today reading a message I felt as if I sliced a razor in my wrist, and I want it.

It's like I know I will do it eventually. Its like I want the danger. Its like I just want everything to be over. My life isn't even as bad as it was, but I kept my habits, my way of thinking, blah. I felt like doing it for the sake of it. Or because I have too many emotions; yet I am numb. I don't understand. I just want to kill myself. 

For those same reasons that typical suicide help doesn't work for me. Right now and in at least half of the 17 times I attempted, it doesn't help me. I am just going crazy, not exactly sad or feeling bad. 

I feel undesirable, I feel full of emotions I can't understand, I feel alone, I feel like crying, my face shows no emotion, I am rude to others, I just want the thrill, I just want to erase all the traumas, I feel I am in a dream, I feel I am falling into a void

 
I havent cut since 4 months ago and haven't tried suicide since january. I don't really feel like telling this to my therapist since I am underage and this will cause me a lot of shit.
