My depressing laundry listIâ€™ve been fighting this uphill battle for years now, and recently I havenâ€™t even been fighting anymore. Just holding my ground as the world crumbles down around me. The last family member who made the effort to stay in contact is slowly getting bored of our conversations. The only safe things I had were video games and music, but as I continue to lose myself to them all I see is a world I canâ€™t participate in on both sides of the screen. Iâ€™m keeping ideation at bay, but only barely. Every moment of existence is either grey or black and I donâ€™t know how long I can go without seeing the light. I donâ€™t eat well anymore to try and save the people I live with money, but costs keep adding up and I know Iâ€™m hurting them. The person I trusted most kept my autism from me for twenty years, and I had to tease it from her by asking about my fatherâ€™s side of the family. Iâ€™m tired, and I can see the end of the path Iâ€™m on. I used to be afraid of it, but the closer I get the more Iâ€™m standing my ground out of principle. I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll get there, but know I canâ€™t keep doing this. I just canâ€™t.
