My doctors suckWhen I was two, my mommy took me to the doctors because of my eyes. I was born with a blue and a green eye. I was color blind in my blue eye, also known as my right eye. So I see in two different colors. When I was six my mommy took me to the doctor for my anorexia only to find out that she didnâ€™t really care. When I was eight my daddy took me to the doctors for my diabetes and then he didnâ€™t want to pay to help me. At age ten my mommy took me to the doctors because she thought try gave her the wrong baby when she gave birth to me. She was so mad when she found out they didnâ€™t.
