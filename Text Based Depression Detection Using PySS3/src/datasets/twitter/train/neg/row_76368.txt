My friend wants to commit suicideHi, a friend i met on the internet who lives on the other side of the planet is really depressed. She's been thinking about killing herself since her father died. I don't know what to say to her. Can I say that her father would like her to live a good life or something like that? Would she get worse? I really want her to be happy.
