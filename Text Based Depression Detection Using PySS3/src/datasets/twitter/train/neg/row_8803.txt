12 and I really need some help.I am 12 years old, and even though I don't want to commit suicide, I can't find a way to make myself stay happy.

I have an abusive dad, but my mom is alright. I haven't talked to them about it yet.

Basically, I get really depressed (but not suicidal) when I don't see other kids for even a couple of days. This is bad because I just left school, and I don't have enough friends to constantly see them, and I don't have any siblings.

I cannot find any other way to make myself feel good. When I have fun playing video games, I miss out on the rest of life, and end up crying in my bed when I am done.

I really don't want to commit suicide, I just want to know what I should do.

Edit: going to bed, hope to see some cool things to try out!

Edit 2: Feel much better this morning :D
