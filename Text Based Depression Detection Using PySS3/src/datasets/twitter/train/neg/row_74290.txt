I just need to ventIâ€™d like to make it clear that Iâ€™m not going to do anything harmful but I need to get this off my chest as itâ€™s crushing me. 

Iâ€™ll be going to sleep after Iâ€™ve posted this. Being depressed and suicidal is *exhausting*. 

This year has been a shit show for me, not including Covid and Iâ€™m just so tired.  Whenever I feel like Iâ€™ve got back on my feet, somethings knocks me down and I donâ€™t have the mental strength to keep pushing forward. 

I sleep a lot to stop myself from having to deal with life but also as a coping mechanism to deal with the suicidal thoughts which can be so loud sometimes. 

My mental health issues come down to the fact I hate myself. Iâ€™ve never been good enough for anyone and I feel I am unworthy of any kind of love or kindness. I know itâ€™s wrong to feel like this but here I am. I can explain how much I hate myself. I canâ€™t look at myself in the mirror. 

Iâ€™m probably going to lose my job soon due to health issues and I canâ€™t see how anyone else will hire me given my history. No job, means no money and no way of supporting myself. I could lose everything. 

I feel trapped and donâ€™t know what else to do. 

I did speak to my doctor who has given me an antidepressant, which I picked up today but it could be weeks before I feel any benefit from them. 

Iâ€™m just so tired. 

Iâ€™ve been living like like for 25 years. Itâ€™s getting to be too much now.
