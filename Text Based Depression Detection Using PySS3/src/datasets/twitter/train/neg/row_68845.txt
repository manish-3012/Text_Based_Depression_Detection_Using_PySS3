ScaredI wish I wasn't so scared to kill myself. It's all I can think about but when I start making a plan or trying,to write a letter I start crying and shaking. I just want peace. I'm so tired. So alone. I feel like my mind is so slow and cloudy lately. Like I can't think. I used to be a really good writer but now every time I try to talk or write something the words feel so forced and I have to think really hard about what I'm trying to say. I'm really sorry.
