An Analogy of Depression and SuicideLife is like a long hike. You pack your backpack with essential things like religion, family, responsibility, goals, and these items change throughout your life based on your priorities and stages but it rides about 30 pounds. Struggles and trials in life are little .5 or 1 pound rocks added to your pack. 

Depression is an extra 10 pound brick weighing at the bottom of your pack. Every rock or small pebble added or shift in weight makes the load seem unbearable and it makes it hard to continue. 

Finally that final rock makes it too much to carry and you can't keep going. You have to take your backpack off. You're free.
