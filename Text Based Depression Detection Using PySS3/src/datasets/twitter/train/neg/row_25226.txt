I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy....I havenâ€™t felt this way since 2014. Recent circumstances ie) loss of job, health issues that have left me disabled (a word I canâ€™t accept get). I still take my meds, but I hurt so fucking bad....from the inside out. I just want it to end. I want the pain and feeling of worthlessness to go away. 

I donâ€™t know exactly whatâ€™s stopping me. I guess I just keep waiting for it to happen. I donâ€™t want my loved ones to find me. I wish I could just disappear. I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore.
