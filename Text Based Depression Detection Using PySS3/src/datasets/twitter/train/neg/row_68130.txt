$20,000 in debt, no job or work experience, I think its all pretty much overGot the letter 2 days before Christmas that I flunked out of college, its my fault, i'm an idiot, my whole families disappointed in me, I've never really done drugs except smoke weed but I bought some pcp tabs, i'm gonna take them and shoot myself today.

In the past 8 hours I've though a lot about life and how meaningless everything is. Its funny because I know in 5 years if I didn't kill myself I would laugh at myself now and thank god that I didn't, but its ironic because I'm not gonna make it 5 years. The pain right now is literally not worth it. My advice to any of you, give a shit, because that's what I haven't done for the past 6 months and here I am.
