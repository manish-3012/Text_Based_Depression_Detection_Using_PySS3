i'm really, really tired of thisi'm tired of feeling shitty all the time. i'm tired of isolating myself from my friends because they only make me feel worse about myself.

i'm going to do it soon. i don't know how, i don't know exactly when, but i'm doing it out of pure selfishness. i'm going to kill myself because i don't want to face my problems. 

i don't have the willpower to sort through all of my issues, and it's not like anybody gives a fuck about me.
