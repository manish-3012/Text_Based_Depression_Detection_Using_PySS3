Donâ€™t think Iâ€™m doing things rightIâ€™m 25, single &amp; living with my parents. Donâ€™t know what to go to school for, donâ€™t have a stable job (even if I wanted to) things never work out. 
I was in a relationship that lasted 2 years. I can honestly say that relationship made me the happiest Iâ€™ve ever been. Although it was a long distance relationship, i knew I wanted to be with her forever. But because of my legal situation I couldnâ€™t go see her. She got tired of being the only one able to come out here (and we had other problems) but ultimately we broke up &amp; now sheâ€™s happy with someone else. 
No matter what I do and how hard I fight it seems like my life always goes south. Everything goes wrong when I think I am doing alright. 
I was wondering if there was some sort of rehab or camp or something that is inexpensive to sort of rebuild myself?
