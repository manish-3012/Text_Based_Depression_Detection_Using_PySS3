hey again... i hope you understand my mess.I've been thinking a lot about suicide again, even though I was feeling so much better. Mainly cause i was ignoring all the shit that had happened lately. but a few days ago i snapped, some idiot in school made a cancerous bad joke and i was holding up so much shit and i just started crying, it was 10 minutes of straight crying and cursing the souls of my classmates, thankfully this was near the end of the last period so nobody cared that much, the fucking bus was about to leave me.(i did thank the bus driver)

The point is, i use humor  to shield myself from others, so this post might be funny in some way, but this is really hard for me. i also might  not pass this year because all the days I've missed class. I miss class because most days i have no motivation to even get out of bed. 

 i'm gonna keep going with my story, the girl i talked about last time was dumped by her boyfriend (she wanted that tho...) and i had green light but you know... I'm not a player so she's now with another dude who doesn't appreciate her and is a fucking douche, btw he's nose is like gru's from despicable me. she's kinda ignoring me now but i think and hope he ends up like the last one.

gee, i feel like Ross, except Rachel is not into me, ever. and Ross is about to jump from a very tall bridge
