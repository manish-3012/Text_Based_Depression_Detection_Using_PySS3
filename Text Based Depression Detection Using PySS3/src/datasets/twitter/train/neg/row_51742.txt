Suicidial ThoughtsRecently I've been cutting myself and I've been really down. I have nothing happy to look forward to and I can't think of a reason to keep myself alive. People I know say it's selfish but I don't understand that in any way. I've noticed that not many people care and it's really saddening. If anyone has anything to help me get in a better mood I would appreciate it.
