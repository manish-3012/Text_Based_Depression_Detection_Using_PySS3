I need helpI have a letter lying in my kitchen just now. If it says that things are fixable then things might be fine. If it says that I'm going to lose my apartment then I'll have no choice but to kill myself. Although I've been suicidal for years now, I've never seriously considered doing it and honestly, I don't want to but I won't have a choice if this letter is bad. I don't really know what I'm looking for from posting this. Maybe reassurance, maybe not, i don't know.
