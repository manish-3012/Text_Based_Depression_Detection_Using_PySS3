So, so tired. Am I a bad person?I've been really sick for a year now. At this point, I have neurological issue that causes agony nearly 24/7. Sometimes it feels like my brain is on fire. Other times I'm so wired or fogged I can't concentrate and it hurts to think. I'm so incredibly fatigued with getting up each day, even the days I do almost nothing. Because just going about my day is excruciating. Have I said I'm fucking exhausted?

As of now I don't plan on staying with college. It's gotten too hard. My cognition has actually deteriorated, so I'm not as mentally capable anyways.

I know suicide would crush my parents, and a few close friends. I want a future life where I'm happy and healthy. I've been living one day at a time for ages. And I still want to die. I don't want to die necessarily, but my capacity to endure this is really going. I'm starting to care less about the impact it will have on others.

I know how shitty it'd be to kill myself. But I'm so damn close. And it's not like my brain will suddenly be healed tomorrow, so I'm really losing it at this point. I want the pain to end so badly. I've been on psych hold before, and I'd honestly rather die it was that bad (no I'm not exaggerating about this). So I know, that if I do break, it's game over. 

I don't know how to live anymore.
