Can't deal with these downs anymoreI have to go to work soon, it's just a shitty part time job, so can't respond. But I've been in treatment for years and meds have no effect on me. I thought therapy helped at first but now I realize it boils down to minimizing my suffering and silver lining my problems. And my therapist, who I thought actually cared, like everyone else, gave me her phone number if I was ever in trouble to call but of course, just silence. Even though when I get home from work I'm probably going to do it this time. Same goes with the hotline. 

No one takes me seriously, plain and simple. I attempted suicide less than a month ago and not a soul said a word. Not even a, "Glad you're still here, bud!" I didn't expect anything but still feels bad. I'm 19 and start college next month and I don't want to inevitably fail there. No one takes my mother's abuse seriously, it makes me sick. I can't take it anymore. I feel suicide is my only option, and my only to communicate my suffering. I just fuck everything up. I know I'm not magnificent or shit, but isn't something for me? Anything?
