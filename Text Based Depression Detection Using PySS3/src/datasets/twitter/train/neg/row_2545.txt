Trying to clear my mindIâ€™ve never posted to Reddit, and Iâ€™ve never really shared these thoughts, but here it goes I guess. I found the love of my life, he is more than a dream, but after two years together I found out heâ€™d been cheating on me during the whole relationship on countless occasions in multiple different ways. Weâ€™re still together nearly 3 years after, and I still love him, he has a lot of struggles that Iâ€™ve been more than happy to help him with and he hasnâ€™t cheated as far as I know since I found out. Heâ€™s been dealing with these types of things for years, he had a traumatic experience at a very young age and has always had a skewed image of what a relationship should look like and love and sex in general.  And frankly Iâ€™m more than happy to help him work through his things and what happened sucked and hurts, but whatâ€™s hurt more is the other ways heâ€™s been treating me since.  Iâ€™ve been alone through most of this, he often has put my feelings aside and says heâ€™s not in the right place to help me in the moment.  We want this to be the year of change and healing, he just got the perfect job and is so much happier and has more energy and has finally starting saying the things Iâ€™ve been needing to hear and holding me the way Iâ€™ve been needing to be held, but Iâ€™m scared too much irreversible damage has been done. I spend most of my days laying in bed and crying, I feel completely broken and spent, I already deal with depression and anxiety but what heâ€™s done has amplified everything to an unbearable state. I canâ€™t hold a job, I dropped out of college, I canâ€™t even remember the last time I laughed with true happiness. Iâ€™ve completely lost who I am. He was supposed to be the one. I know most people would say to break up, and we probably should have taken a break a long time ago, but I know thereâ€™s no one else out there who would make me feel what heâ€™s made me feel. We have a pretty special relationship, we were each otherâ€™s firsts, weâ€™re high school sweethearts, I still get butterflies in my stomach when I see him even after all these years, weâ€™re the perfect relationship in every way for each other and weâ€™ve shared so many things you canâ€™t get again. I feel true love with him. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I donâ€™t know whether to keep trying in the hopes that I will heal and heâ€™ll get better, or to completely give up. Heâ€™s been doing better lately as far as helping me through the pain and healing, but thereâ€™s so much farther to go and I donâ€™t know if I can do it. I donâ€™t really have anything else in my life, my own familyâ€™s pretty broken and Iâ€™ve lost most of my friends. Heâ€™s been what Iâ€™ve been holding onto over the years, but Iâ€™m feeling that slip away, and Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m becoming less and less scared of dying and in a lot of ways Iâ€™ve already felt like I have.  Itâ€™s 4am and I canâ€™t sleep, I havenâ€™t slept much lately, but I thought Iâ€™d just give this a try.
