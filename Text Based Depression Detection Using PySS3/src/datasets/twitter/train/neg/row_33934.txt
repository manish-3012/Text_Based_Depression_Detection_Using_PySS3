There's nothing for me in LifeEvery day i get closer and closer to finally committing to this whole suicide thing. I'm a 34 year old loser with no friends, not really any family &amp; have never even been out with a girl once. Nobody is gonna miss me &amp; i'm sure everyone would be better off if i no longer existed. The only thing stopping me at this point is finding the best way to do it
