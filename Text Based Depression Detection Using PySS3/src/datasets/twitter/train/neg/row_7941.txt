I had the time of my life, I was at a summer place and sauna with my best friends and met new people, then I went to a giant family tradition with friends and had great food, that it was the most beautiful place to eat and all the ceilings were beautifully decorated, an orchestra made great musicThen I just now woke up in my messed up room, all the friends in the dream were made up and the traditions I made up that I have went to since I was a kid havenâ€™t existed at all, utopia can only exist in my mind, this world is a techno dictatorship we are all taught to be slaves to money and stimulation, wherever I look people walk with their eyes down at their phone, wherever I look brand names are marked in peopleâ€™s clothes, cars, we are slaves with extra steps, born into bondage to comply or be outcasted, to work or be homeless, this world is evil, Iâ€™m born another worker bee to the empire of evil
