I hate peopleI can't stand anyone. Having suicidal thoughts every day and not being able to get help or socialize because I hate everyone i see doesnt help either. It's like every human being is the same. Myself too am a useless disgusting thing. In the end everyone is selfish and noone actually cares about others. Noone tries to do empathy or just they try to seem doing so.
