Fuck everythingI am unlovable, I am worthless, I deserve to die. 
I can't take this. I have posted here before, under my main, but I don't currently want anyone to know I feel this. I post here frequently, as someone who helps. But I can't even help myself. 

I am going to cut tonight and cut a lot. I won't kill myself, I don't have the means to do that. I just want to be loved. And loved properly.
