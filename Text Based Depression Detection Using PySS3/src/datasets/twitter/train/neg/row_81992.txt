I have no reasons leftI hate myself and I want to just disappear. Every time I look in the mirror all I see is a fat, disgusting, mentally ill failure who will never achieve his dreams. And the worst part is, deep down, I don't want to get better. Because I'm addicted to my own depression. It seems that no matter how hard I try not too, I make decisions that ultimately just exacerbate my loneliness. For years the only thing that's consistently brought me happiness is playing this twisted game with myself of how much can I ruin my life. I'm so lonely it physically hurts, every night I just lay awake wishing someone was there to hold me. I know that if I could meet the right person I would get better, I just need someone to take care of. I'm seriously considering just ending it tonight, run a warm bath, down all my meds at once and just drift into the abyss. To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream. I guess if I do it this is my note. So goodbye, probably.
