Feels like I have no professional supportOn the 10th of september, the day after my 19th birthday I decided to end my life. Obviously this didn't work, I was found by the police, taken to hospital and was put on a drip for a couple days to save my liver. After 3 days in hospital I was medically well and was visited by the local crisis team, the same day I was admitted to an adult mental health unit. 

I stayed there for 6 days and in that time I had 2 meetings with a psychologist who basically just told me he doesn't believe in antidepressants (after asking to up my sertraline dose) and that I should meditate.  The staff couldn't give a shit about me, for the first 4 days I didn't eat or drink anything, I continued to stay in my room at meal times so my parents ended up bringing me in some food, the staff didn't know about this and yet still weren't concerned that to them I hadn't eaten in almost a week. So I was discharged 2 days ago, absolutely nothing has changed apart from now being under constant surveillance from my parents. They said they're going to refer me to a community therapy team but honestly I have no trust in professionals now, that was my first adult experience but the adolescent mental health services I received were the same. 

My parents said to tell them if I want to kill myself again and then they'll ring the crisis team but what's the point? I end back up on the unit for a night or two and they'll send me on my merry way with absolutely nothing changing.
