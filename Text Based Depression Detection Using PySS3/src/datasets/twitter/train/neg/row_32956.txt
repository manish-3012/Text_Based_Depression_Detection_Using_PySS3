depression is so tiringI'm scared. I've been suffering from depression for the past 4 years. I've just turned 18 last month and I never thought I'd live to see the day. Im failing school because I can't concentrate on my studies. I feel like an utter failure. Im living with my alcoholic mom who could die any day because of severe liver damage and my dad never gave a shit about her or me. I stopped taking my medication simply because it didn't help at all, Im ruining all of my relationships because of my antisocial behaviour and really, I'm so sick of life. I know I'm young, but I feel like I don't have anything left to live for. I'm trying so hard not to overdose again, but lately the thoughts have been coming back, I just want to die. I needed to get this off my chest, thanks for reading. I hope you have a nice day.
