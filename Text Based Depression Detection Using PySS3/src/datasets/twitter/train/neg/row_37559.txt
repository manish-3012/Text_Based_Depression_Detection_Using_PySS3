No scence to live anymoreSometimes I feel like I am not even existing, but when my grandfather died...
I was very sad for a long time, my friends were with me in that time. Now these changed, when I wave at them they do nothing but look at me like I am some kind of madman. They were the only reason I kept myself alive, now I lost them all... I wanna end it all
