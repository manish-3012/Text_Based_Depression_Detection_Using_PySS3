No Reasons To Livehave never posted on a forum before but I'm out of options for human connection. I am 19 years old, have no friends, got expelled from college for absurd reasons I won't go into (had nothing to do with grades or misdemeanors). Never had a significant other/been kissed/ felt like anyone appreciated me as a person. I'm attractive, smart, creative and well-read, just a bit shy. It seems like since my childhood I've been doomed to loneliness and sadness for no good reason. There's no reason why I should have no friends or a partner, or feel so lonely and unwanted. I'm not strange, unusual, etc. I am more lonely than most people could possibly imagine feeling. I had to make up to my parents that I have a boyfriend because I am so ashamed of my life and what a weird disappointment I am. I am very different from my parents and we don't have a close relationship. I live alone. I have crippling heartburn (which may sound like a petty problem, but it causes me to be in massive pain 80% of the time even when I'm on high doses of medication). So I'm in constant physical and emotional pain.
I have felt this way now (and been out of school) for two years, working hard, waiting for things to get better, really having hope that things will. I am at the end of the line now. Things are getting progressively worse. I am more lonely than ever. My attempts to get friends or a boyfriend always fail. The only thing that has kept me going is reading, playing the guitar, and movies but sometimes I can't even enjoy these simple pleasures because of my physical/digestive pain. I am so tired. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest because no one really knows how I feel. I think I would really love to end it quite soon. I've been considering it for some time. Thanks for listening.
