Is it bad that I don't want help anymore?I've come close to seeking help a few times, but always stopped myself, because I know getting help would probably reduce my freedom of choice, probably harder to buy a gun in Canada after being diagnosed as mentally ill, the only things holding me back are what it would do to my family, the fact that I feel like I should be grateful for not being born in some hellhole like Africa, and just pure resentment. But now I have a plan to get a gun, and I really don't want anything to do with anybody, I want to figure this out on my own, I want to decide if I want to live or die not a therapist or some fucking doctor or even my family but *me* I feel a lot closer to the abyss than I have in the past but want help less and less as time goes by...
