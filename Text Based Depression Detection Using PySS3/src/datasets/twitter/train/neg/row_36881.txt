[PLEASE HELP] Iâ€™m going to Prison under false suicide claims at my High School. Iâ€™ve been expelled and Iâ€™m under Immense pressureThe title isnâ€™t exactly as reads. Iâ€™m sorry for essentially click-baiting you, and I hope you donâ€™t think this is some desperate attempt for attention and pity. Iâ€™m living in hell right now. Please, take this time to help me out. This is the story I want to share with you.

It wasnâ€™t always this way. Iâ€™ve had an extensive experience with depression, first being affected when I was 9 years old due to me being raped and me witnessing my mother being beaten by her current boyfriend(s). Iâ€™ve always felt bad inside. I have a lot of overwhelming regrets that I may or may not discuss. But as of recent, I have been being targeted at school. Not by students, but by teachers. 
.
.
It all started when our teacher in 4th hour gave us bell work (work thatâ€™s done before class to help engage the students in the classroom environment) and the Question we were to answer was â€œWhy Do you dress like you do? Do you hope to get anything out of it or accomplish something?â€
.
.
In the box we were designated to fill out, wrote something like this: (it is summarized so chill.
.
.
â€œI dress like how I dress because I do not want to be noticed by 80% of my peers. I want to fade away slowly and be forgotten. That way if I were to pass away or die, no one would notice or care.â€ And under it I signed it â€œ3-4-18. Date of Terminationâ€.  
.
.
Iâ€™ll be the first to admit, it was a desperate cry for help at the moment. I wrote that on a Tuesday, but we turn it in at the end of the week, on a Friday. The school guidance counselor came and talked to me that Friday. He discussed his concern. The problem is, that on that Friday, I DID NOT want help. I was OVER it and I forgot I had written it. He asked me â€œOn a scale of 1-10, how depressed are you?â€ I gave him a 6. His face cringed up. Then he said â€œhow many days in a year do you feel like this?â€ And I just said â€œmaybe oneâ€. He tried to call CRISIS. And I immediately texted my grandmother while he sat me in an alternate room to do so. I was forced to leave the school before the end of the day. Little did I know that this same sheet of paper would be used against me to expel me. :(
.
.
One day, while in class, our 1st hour teacher wasnâ€™t at school. Our class was completely empty and devoid of a teacher. Then the Principal, Vice Principal, and Guidance Counselors all picked me up from the classroom and took me to the office in a room full of police officers and therapists. Everybody was writing everything I did down and and they kept a close eye on me. 
.
.
It was very uncomfortable. They said someone had threatened to kill themselves in front of my 3rd hour teacher in an â€œencrypted emailâ€. They called me up to see if I knew anything. Little did I know this was a setup to help get me expelled.
.
.
They kept me in the room, talking to everyone. Then I realized it. They think that I sent this email because of my prior history of depression. They pulled up an old email I sent the 3rd hour teacher where I said Iâ€™d kill myself over a grade. (REALLY BAD THING TO SAY, I KNOW). 
.
.
They saved every email I had sent to the teacher (all of which were asking for grades to be updated in the grade book) and they compared my email with the â€œencrypted emailâ€. They did not show me it, yet they implied I did it. I stayed up there for multiple hours. I was dismissed out of the room with all the officers into the main office and I was constantly supervised. I couldnâ€™t stand up or blink without them jumping at me. It was very uncomfortable. Then they confiscated my phone (in which they checked my recent email and browsing history whilst in the room btw). 
.
.
Then my ADHD began to kick in. I couldnâ€™t take these accusations and negative energy anymore. I became restless. I HAD To move. I NEEDED my fucking iPhone for the music on it or I was gonna lash out. I NEEDED TO MOVE AROUND before I fought someone. Iâ€™m not even violent, but it was THAT serious. Yeah. I confronted the officer who took it and he interviewed me and recorded me without telling me that I could have my parents in the room with me. 
.
.
I sat in there for 2 hours, extensively answering questions from 1 officer while the other just sat there. Then the other one stepped in. I can honestly say now I want to bash his fucking face in. Such an asshole for no reason.
.
.
â€œSo whyâ€™d you write the email man?â€ He asks as he slides me the whole email and letâ€™s me read it. I deny the entire thing. I curse him out a bit. I was so offended that they thought Iâ€™d do such a thing. 
.
.
Then I finally was done. My grandma was already there (thatâ€™s who I live with) and they gave her my phone. Then they said the principal would call her later that day. I knew the suspension was coming.
.
.
They said I was suspended for the first half of the school week. Then it went to the first 10 days. Today I was told I was banned until May, 2020. All for an allegation. 
.
.
My grandmother already has a lawyer and we met him and theyâ€™re trying to press charges. And they havenâ€™t even disencrypted the email. Looking at the charges, I could go to prison. 
.
.
I didnâ€™t even do this. Iâ€™ve been having relapses because of this stress. Someone please help. If youâ€™ve read this far, then thank you. PLEASE HELP ME. :(

EDIT : I WAS NOT TOLD WHAT ID BE CHARGED WITH, BUT IT IS A FELONY
