I get a sweet release when I think about dyingIt's sort of rejuvenating.  The top part of the buildings on my campus are so tempting. I always think about the time someone is in between the fall and the ground. They  are basically in mid air, letting go of everything and within the next second, they're dead. Its sounds like such a release but aligns with everything about my life. Every  enjoyment I've had, they've been there for  a second and then they go away but with  jumping from a building, second before you die, that's all you feel and then you're gone. There's not one thought about what happens next because they'll be nothing, just death. 

With overdoses, I know the heart slows, I've felt that but it's most all in my head. 

Thar euphoric feeling is unbeatable.
