I'm just so sad and so angry. I seem to have lost control of my happiness and I don't think I can last until it comes backI have everything I could ever want or need, and yet I'm still miserable. I feel guilty for even feeling these emotions again, but everything has just gone dark. The suicidal thoughts have begun to appear more and more frequently lately. I wonder if they'll ever go away.

Is anyone even there?
