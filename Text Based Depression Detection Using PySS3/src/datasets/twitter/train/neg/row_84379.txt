My Suicidal Sister(40) refusing help for treatable conditionMy sister was diagnosed with Lyme last spring after losing some sensation in her nerves or feeling some sort of nervous system discomfort in her limbs, and spent dozens of thousands of dollars treating her Lyme over the span of 2-3 months at expensive Lyme-specific centers here in the U.S. She returned home feeling worse. One doctor thought it could be CIDP and prescribed IV treatment for it. She discontinued it after the first few treatments, when her symptoms didnâ€™t immediately go away and insisted it was Lyme. A few months later, tests from Stanford showed that while she has Lyme in her system, itâ€™s inactive and not causing any ailment, and was still likely CIDP.

&amp;nbsp;


She refused all treatment until a few months ago and tried the IVIG infusions again for 4 of 5 infusions in the week before giving up on it again. The doctor prescribed medication to help alleviate the symptoms, but she refused to take them for more than a day because it didnâ€™t immediately help her. She would occasionally take one dose a day, instead of the three as prescribed, which obviously wasnâ€™t doing anything for her except enforce her beliefs that hope was lost. The doctor said that her severe depression over this is whatâ€™s causing the most harm to her and she needs to get that treated. She's beautiful, successful, and vain, and feels that her near perfect life is lost forever. She's refused any sort of therapy or psychiatrist/psychologist. Sheâ€™s been in bed for the majority of a year, and attributes her difficulty walking and weight loss, which seems to be normal for bed rest, to her illness.

&amp;nbsp;

  
She has attempted suicide by hanging herself, fortunately she was found soon after her attempt and admitted to the hospital, but not psych ward. She was admitted to a psych ward a few weeks later, only when she sent goodbye texts to her family, snuck into her car, and drove away. She came back home after about 10 minutes, but the police had to take her to the hospital to make sure she wasnâ€™t a danger to herself or others. I was told she wasnâ€™t forced to take medication or see a psychologist or get any real help from the psych ward. From what I understood, the best they can do is make sure people donâ€™t kill themselves. She occasionally threatens that sheâ€™ll try again, and last week she tried to starve herself but failed after a couple days. We donâ€™t know what to do. Sheâ€™s so negative and pessimistic and refuses to take medication as prescribed or try another treatment which might help her. Her daughter (22) has put her life on hold and been taking care of her for close to a year now. Iâ€™ve done the same, along with our mother, to support my niece for about 6 months now. My sister has had friends and family visit her and spend much of their time with her to try to get her to change her mentality to no avail.

&amp;nbsp;

  
I feel that she might attempt suicide again soon/eventually, and even be successful. She says she would rather have cancer or aids, because at least that would kill her quicker. Or that she wished she would have died when she hung herself. Is our only option to call the police to admit her to a hospital every time she threatens suicide? Sheâ€™s refusing any help for an illness that the doctor is optimistic about successfully treating. What can we do?
