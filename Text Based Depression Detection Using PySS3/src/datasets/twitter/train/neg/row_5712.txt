Does anyone else ever feel like they are too ugly to be alive?I thought i had gotten better at coping with body image issues and general lack of confidence by starting to understand reasons why im like this. However i seem to be more sad frequently, trust issues and anxiety have been going through the roof and cry almost on a daily basis.
I'm scared I'm gunna push away this guy i have been recently dating (who has so far been wonderful and supportive) and i can't comprehend why he is interested in me, how he can bare to look at me and i almost expect him to cheat on me/leave me for another girl coz why would you be with me when you could be with someone else?
I'm so tired of feeling like this, I'm so easily triggered now and I really don't know how much longer I can take this. I hate being so bothered by such superficial things, i feel totally useless as a human and wish i wasn't like this. I just want to be happy and pleasant to be around but i don't know how and i feel like my friends don't get how seeing a photo of myself or my reflection makes me feel like i deserve to be killed. If anyone can relate.. i would appreciate someone willing to listen or talk to or help in some way.
Tldr; i am really struggling with body image/dysmoprhia/confidence, am scared of being hurt again relationship wise and if anyone can relate or be of help i would appreciate someone to talk to :(
