What's the point?Yada yada title already used. Cliche. Good job etc. Successful from the outside, looking in, all that crap. 

 I just don't see the point of being alive, at all. What do we gain from this? What experience is worth this? It's all meaningless drivel, just to keep us conscious for 70-80 years. Why? There's no point to this stupid little ball of consciousness that thinks it's me. 


Fuuuck. I just need to ride this out, for the next hour or two, no doubt I'll be "ok" again when I wake up. 

Just why? Why do we bother?
