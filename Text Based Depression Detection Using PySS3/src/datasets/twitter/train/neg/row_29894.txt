I think my life as I know it is ending and I'm not sure how to deal with it I've always been a relatively successful person, but I have suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts for a long time.  My parents separated when I was young and it has clearly had a more profound impact on my life than I thought.  Tonight I found out my GF (recently fiance) of over 6 years doesn't want to be with me anymore (not that I blame her).  I have extreme trouble dealing with new people and I have no idea how I will ever be able to find someone else.  Everyone I have ever loved leaves me and I just don't know how much longer I can continue on with rejection and sadness at every turn.  Please, I know no one knows me, but just give me some encouragement to keep it going...just a little bit longer.
