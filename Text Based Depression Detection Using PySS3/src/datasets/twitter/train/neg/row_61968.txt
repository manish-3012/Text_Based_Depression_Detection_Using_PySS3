My noose snappedI hung myself today after reaching out to my family only to be told it's not their problem. I made sure i would be to high of the ground to save myself.  I was calm and just slipped away into unconsciousness. What I did not expect was to wake up...let alone wake up with a gash on my head and a broken noose. I don't know if this is punishment or what but I wish it had killed me. Now I'm sitting her with rope burn around my neck and no voice and a splitting headache. I called a help line and a woman named Ana talked with me for a while and that helped but I don't know how to go on. I have no support, no future and every day I lose more of my hearing. My world is going silent at 23 and I'm terrified.
