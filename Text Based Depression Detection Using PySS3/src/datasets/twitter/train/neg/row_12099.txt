I want to fucking hang myself because of my sexualityI think about this every fucking day. All aspects of my life are getting better and improving except this one. This will always destroy me and be my biggest insecurity. I hate it. I feel fucking trapped. I feel numb and dead inside. I hate being a fucking lesbian. It's a fucking mental illness. It's not fair that I get trapped into this shit and not being able to put myself down or cure it. All I hear is "it's not a bad thing!!!" That's not fucking true. Even if it was, I should be allowed to try get out of it through conversion therapy or suicide or euthanasia. 

I'm staying closeted forever. Every since I found out I have felt nothing but hatred and depression. My teens years have been ripped away. I'm different from every fucking person. I can't have a normal life. I can't be happy. 

I feel stuck. Live every aspect of my life, work, hobbies, friends and shit can improve except this. This is always going to fucking plague me. Its always going to be the same horrible shit forever. Not being able to date like a normal straight person. Not being able to fucking hold hands with a girl. Not being able be respected. Going to be seen as a fucking sex object for people and they'll sexualize me. Not being treated like a normal fucking person. 

I want to fucking suffocate myself. I want to be dead. I don't have a point in living if I'm going to be dragged down by a mental deformity every fucking day.
