Advice: Isolation, anger, clinginess, and feelings of confusion.   I feel really sick, and keep having panic attacks. I have few friends, the few I have Im really clingy to. Lately they don't even respond to me. Im lonely, I try to do right, I workout, I study, I'm shipping out for the military in  January. I can handle someone yelling down my neck, and PT all day long. But I can't handle being lonely. I love everything about military life, I know its intense, but I like being busy, I wanna explore, I wanna get stressed out, but being ignored is just too much. At this point I think im the toxic one in the group, at the same time they walk all over me. I ask them to hang out, they say they are working, next day I see them together on snapchat middle of the day. I try to be concise, honest, and not bother them, but even after leaving people alone for weeks or months they ignore me. I'm scared of making new friends, I have a history of suicide attempts, and the thoughts are starting to reemerge.  I just want to yell at my friends and demand to know why I get treated differently. I know its not an appropriate response, but its just how I feel. Part of the suicidal thoughts is getting back at them, to get attention if its just an attempt, and to end the pain. I'm ashamed, and I want to be better.
