I want to be free from my bodyTG warning sexual abuse , rape 

I am crashed. I donâ€™t want to live, but I have to keep moving. I am a single mom with four children with no family nearby . I was raped and abused for years. I want to be free from my body. I am trapped in my own body. I hate my body . I am ugly, I donâ€™t want to see anyone, I want to die. I donâ€™t want to get out of my bed. I canâ€™t do this.
