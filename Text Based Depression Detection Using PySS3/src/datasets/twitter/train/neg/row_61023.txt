Round 2!!!!!Last week I saw my ex who I still have feelings for, but he doesnâ€™t feel the same. 

So, after seeing him and crying at school, I got drunk, relapsed into narcotics I used to have an issue with, and was out until 4am with a crowd of shit people. I was in a car with them while they were drinking and driving and doing drugs, I was with them in dangerous neighborhoods where I was the only female. I walked home and kept almost getting hit by cars. I was genuinely trying to die.

Today, I saw him again. Again, Iâ€™m crying and Iâ€™ve just begun to drink. 

Today I fucking hope Iâ€™m found tomorrow dead on the outskirts of town. 

Fuck my shitty head, and fuck the world. But Iâ€™ll probably fail as Iâ€™ve done so many times before. 

I hate the world and I hate myself.
