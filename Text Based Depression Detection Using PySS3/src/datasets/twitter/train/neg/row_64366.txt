*TW* My paranoia is going out of control and I don't want to do this anymore. Feeling like ending it all right now.hello there. I posted this below before but unfortunately lost access to my account.

\&gt;\*I won't sugarcoat things. I'm a very broken individual who came from a very broken home. I have spent my entire adulthood trying to help others and doing anything I can to be a proper person in society.For a little context, I was molested when I was about 8 years old. My dad did things to me I can't fully remember, including rape. He yelled at me daily, physically abused me and made everyone's lives around him hell. My mother was very sick and absent, my sister once watched my dad punch me in the head repeatedly and her first instinct was to laugh.I think, because of this horrible environment, I had a very screwed up relationship with myself, confidence, and [sexuality.At](https://sexuality.At) 10 I had a short incestuous encounter with a cousin (mutual) where we teased each other and showed each other our private parts a few [times.At](https://times.At) 13, I made an awful error in judgement that I have lived with since and don't know if I'll ever forgive myself for. While sleeping over at another cousin's house, I took his hand and used it to rub myself for a little while. My brain did end up taking over and I stopped.We were best friends, so close, and I betrayed his trust like that. I sat awake for an hour or two, until the sun came up. He was still asleep, I even put multiple playing cards on his head to see if he was sleeping and he didn't wake up until later.For the longest I was relieved I hadn't subjected him to anything else.I recognized shortly after the gravity of what I did. I never did anything like this again. Later, I respected every partner I got with, and since then have tried to be as good a person as I can be. I had an awful childhood, and I never would have wanted to put that on someone [else.So](https://else.So) then today [happened.It](https://happened.It)'s worth noting I'm autistic, and my cousin has schizophrenia. My cousin is homosexual and wears very effeminate [clothing.My](https://clothing.My) family was sitting around talking crap about him and his dad, as usual when my dad asked, "What's wrong with Bryan anyway? You have any idea?" To which my uncle replied, "If I had to guess, he was molested". Based on his clothing and homosexuality...My mom chimes in, "I heard he was too!!"My cousin two years ago came out on Facebook saying he had been groped by his coworker, and was trying to get them fired from their position. That same week he told his dad he was sexually abused. My mom ran with this and said, "I bet it was when he was younger based on the way he dresses".This sent me into a spiral. I had a mental break down, the likes of which had me in bed for nearly 6 months. In and out of hospitals, not eating or drinking.I was so paranoid, so scared she was talking about what I had done, even though I know he wasn't awake, he was [sleeping.It](https://sleeping.It) took me awhile to come out of the entire thing. Him and I are still as close as ever, friends who get along just fine. We text every day, hung out on Halloween. He even sent me a letter coming out to me as gay and telling me about how he talks to his therapist about his schizophrenia. He told me he hopes to get married one day.I don't know if he knows, I don't know what to do, how to move on. I just want to be happy and help others be happy. I'm to the point where life is filled with so many ups and downs I almost want to give up.\*

The feelings have mostly resurfaced. My paranoia about having hurt my family member, this being brought up and the PTSD I have suffered is flaring up immensely.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in shock right now. My paranoia is already pretty bad, I already feel so alone in everything I do because I can't talk to anyone about these issues.

I overheard my mom talking to my sister about my cousin. I don't know the entirety of what they were talking about, but the only words I heard were, "he said..." and "good" and "I've learned to keep out of this stuff". My mind has been racing to try to fill in the blanks of what they talked about. Nobody was acting strangely, but they could have been pretending.

My guilt, my paranoia, my depression is killing me... I just want to be gone, I want it to all be over. I want to smile again. I want to breathe, to have a happy life..... I want to enjoy peace for 5 minutes. I am so tired.
