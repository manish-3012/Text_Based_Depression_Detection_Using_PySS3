I canâ€™t see a future in where I donâ€™t kill myselfJust a vent post, not looking for advice 

Iâ€™m nearly 25 and I still live with my parents because they are the only source of stability I have, if I move out I wonâ€™t have anybody to get up for. I wonâ€™t eat properly or go out or do anything really because I just donâ€™t want to disappoint them anymore than I probably already have. I promised them I wonâ€™t kill myself, but after theyâ€™re gone, then what? Iâ€™ll live on my own because nobody is ever going to want me and Iâ€™m just not strong enough to do it, I canâ€™t keep forcing myself to live if thereâ€™s nobody around for me to live for. I wonâ€™t have to worry about upsetting anybody or causing a big to do if I kill myself, so why the fuck shouldnâ€™t I? But Iâ€™m terrified of when I finally will be left alone, there wonâ€™t be anybody left to tell me not to do it who isnâ€™t paid by me, I will never feel the love of another person, so the only logical conclusion is to just die
