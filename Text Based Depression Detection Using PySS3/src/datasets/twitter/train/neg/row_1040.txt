I am so done.I was feeling better, like maybe I could get through this, but no, all in a fucking matter of hours, my parents get shitfaced and yell at each other, my friends all fucking hate me for having no motivation and ignoring them, my girlfriend leaves me for someone else. Everytime I build my self up I get struck down by everything at once. i've gotten help, see a therapist, on medacation, but I'm so tired of this shit.
I've had a plan for a while, just needed a motivation, and I'm feeling pretty motivated.
