I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m a female, 19 years old. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts since I was 13. My life is literally so unbearable. I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t take it anymore. Has anyone tried therapy, does it help? I feel like I have a chemical imbalance in my brain that makes me feel worse.
