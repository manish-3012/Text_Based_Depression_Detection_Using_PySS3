Is this really all i have to look forward to for the next 50 yearsCause it just doesnt seem worth it. Im already so tired of this shit. Everything feels unnatural and unrewarding, people are just things to deal with, work is a shitty dead end just to be able to perpetuate this misery Im just so fucking tired of being tired all the time
