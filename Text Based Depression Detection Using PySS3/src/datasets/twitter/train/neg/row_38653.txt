I'm ScaredThrowaway account for obvious reasons.

I've been depressed since March. The causes have been a revolving door of problems. I've been open with my school, church, family, roommates, and girlfriend about it. My school has tried to help, but there is only so much they can do for me. My roommate helped tremendously, as did my best friend and girlfriend, but I've now moved back home for the semester and am far away from all of them.

My depression has led me to struggle in my classes, to the point where I may be failing. If I fail, though, my parents will basically turn their back on me. Feelings of inadequacy and anxiety about the future have plagued my mind non-stop.

I've had semi-suicidal thoughts the whole time, but only my girlfriend knew about them. She, my roommate, and my best friend (as well as my religious convictions) had been enough to keep me from doing it until now. It seemed like the thoughts were going away, but the end of the semester drew closer and my parents freaked out on me because of my possibility of failing.

If I fail, I'll be $70,000 in debt, with no job and no degree, no family willing to help me. I'll have proven to be just as much of a failure as I've always thought I was. I honestly can't see any reason to keep going. I can't even see how I could if I wanted to. 

What scares me is that, for the first time in my life, I actually started researching ways to commit the act. I started developing preferences. I decided that if I were to do it, I would want it to be clean (so no one had to clean up a huge mess) and I wouldn't want my family to be the ones to find my body first. I'm terrified that these thoughts have even come to my mind. The only thing that is keeping me from doing it now is the thought of never seeing the love of my life one last time.
