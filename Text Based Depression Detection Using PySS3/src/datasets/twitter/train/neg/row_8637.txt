When I read posts of old people suffering, I lose the desire to reach that agePeople tell you that everything will get better and youâ€™ll forget what youâ€™re actually feeling, but what if not? There is a lot of fucking sad people here (and on YouTube) and it is really sad to see the quantity of people that just couldnâ€™t fulfill any reason to live. 

And, guess what? They are adults. They are 23 yo, they are 34 yo, people tell you that everything will get better, but there is people that just couldnâ€™t make it to be happy since they were teenagers. 

I feel like I always will be sad. My only good period of life was 2009-2013, and I never knew true happiness. I feel so empty, I feel so bad, Iâ€™m afraid of the future, Iâ€™m afraid of people. Iâ€™m really anxious of everything, and everyone tells me that Iâ€™m a weird girl. 

Iâ€™m afraid to think that things will never get better.
