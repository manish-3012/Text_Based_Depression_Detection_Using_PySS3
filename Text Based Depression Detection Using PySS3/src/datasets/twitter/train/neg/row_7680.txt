i've gone completely mental14, 4 attempts.

Struggling with major depressive, generalized anxiety, adhd, (gender+general) dysphoria, ptsd, and CRPS (chronic pain shit.)

I have no control over anything.

My only possible route to recovery is being rejected, but also only had a 50/50 chance of working.


I'm getting flashbacks again to the day my friend killed herself.

I'm a closeted pussy and have only come out being agender to two people. (parents scold lgbts)


the physical pain is no longer bearable. Soon I will not be able to get out of bed.

I've only got a few friends, whom only one I trust with knowing the true me.

There is nothing holding me back from killing myself. I'm a failure. My dad should have pulled out when he had the chance.

I'm rejected by my family. I'm rejected by most everyone.

Get. Out. Of. My. Head. 

Get. Out. Of. My. Head. 

Get. Out. Of. My. Head.  Everyone. Everything. Myself.


Soon I will no longer be the burden I am today. Everything is ready. This time I will succeed.


Why.. Why shouldn't I do it?

I'm open to talk, but i'm not sure how much I'll accept help.
