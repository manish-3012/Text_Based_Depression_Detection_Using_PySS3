Struggling With Emotions.I wrote this as a follow-up to my last post here, I will link it at the bottom.

One hard thing that always gets me depressed and weak in a mental state is having to cope with emotions. It probably happens to you too, we are after all sentient beings that have to deal with emotions and thoughts after all. I would like to write this to get this out of my chest and maybe help someone who read this who also experiences similar things.

As we grow older our feelings get more complex, and sometimes we are not mentally prepared for them and then we get to struggling with them. I usually struggle with my emotions and thoughts late at nigh, layed in bed; Left alone with only myself to sympathize with. I feel lost. But one thing to remember is that even if I am alone at that moment I am not the only one, someone else went through it and someone else will. I remember that everytime when I find myself all alone. And I invite you too that if you feel down or lost, remember that: better things await. If you feel you are not worth it, remember that you are worth it, if you feel desperate, look for calmness, if you feel that the world is gonna end for you, remember the world is not over and that a rainbow can only come after a storm, and it comes with sunshine alongside it.
