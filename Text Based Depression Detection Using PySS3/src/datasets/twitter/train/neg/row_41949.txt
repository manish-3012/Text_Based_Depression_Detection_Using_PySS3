Isolated HopelessnessMy name is Jan and I am 19 years old. I am about to order a lethal combination of illegal drugs which I will need to commit suicide.

I could go into so much detail but I don't want to bore you lovely people. I have severe social anxiety, PTSD and I am a poly drug addict. I haven't left the house in over a year. I am so very nostalgic; I dream of the people I used to know every night and wake up sad because I am alone.

When I tell my mum, she laughs it off.
Sorry everyone, I just don't want to continue.
