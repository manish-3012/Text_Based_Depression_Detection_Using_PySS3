Not suicidal but would rather just not be around/not be meSo my depression roots from an deeply rooted issue I have with my appearance.  I am genuinely convinced I am on of the ugliest/goofiest dudes out there.  I am very social though, like being around people, and am known as a really funny guy.  But behind this image I make for myself, I don't think my self esteem could be any lower in regards to my looks.  

I don't know how to get over this, but it is deeply affecting my happiness.  I know girls aren't interested in me before the convo starts.  I can see it in their eyes.  I know I'm really lanky, tall and goofy looking.  My head is way to big for my skinny body.  It drives me insane and is making me want to just be by myself all the time.  I enjoy life, but any time I see my reflection or a video/pic of myself it reminds me of what I look like and it leaves me with such a deep sadness.  Seeing a pic or reflection of myself can literally ruin my whole day.  Is that ridiculous?

Am I crazy for letting my appearance control me like this?  I don't want to kill myself but I just don't want to be me.  Like I enjoy life, but this has become such an overwhelming issue for myself I don't know how to get over it.  It impacts almost every area of my life.  I'm not comfortable in my own skin.  I spend hours taking pictures and videos of myself to see if I'm as ugly as I think I am.  Sometimes I'll think "Hey, not too bad!"  Then others, I am mortified about what I look like.  I don't even look human.  I am a tall stick figure with a massive goofy head.  I'll never get married or be happy.

I just want to find someone like myself to talk to, confide with.  It's tough.
