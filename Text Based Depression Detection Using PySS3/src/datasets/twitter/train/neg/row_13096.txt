Why Does No One Understand that I Just Donâ€™t Want to Be Here?Iâ€™m literally only here because people guilt me with â€œeveryone will miss you, Iâ€™LL miss youâ€, â€œyou just have to find the parts of life worth living forâ€, yadda yadda. 

Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t love you, people. Iâ€™m just not interested in life. It literally does not interest me. I find things to pass the time before I die. If I was told I had terminal cancer, Iâ€™d be relieved. 

It doesnâ€™t even feel like depression anymore because itâ€™s not sad to be, itâ€™s just disinterest. O am disinterested in life. Iâ€™ve been dragged to a party I never wanted to go to. Iâ€™ve seen whatâ€™s to offer and none of it interests me so Iâ€™d like to leave. 

â€œNo, no, stay. The party will get better, we promise.â€ 

Again, not interested! Itâ€™s just so...BORING. Itâ€™s dull. Itâ€™s more work than itâ€™s worth. Thereâ€™s bills, taxes, expenses. You have to work. Like it just sucks. I get that youâ€™ve found a way to make that enjoyable and you know what, good for you, Iâ€™m glad for you. But Iâ€™m not interested. No, I donâ€™t want to write for a living even though I like writing. I picked writing as a focus because it made me feel good and I was good at it. No, I donâ€™t want to help people for a living, it made me and others feel good and I had a talent for it. Thereâ€™s nothing inherently fulfilling about life itself. I have nothing to gain from it and your pithy statements about how I just have to find my thing or my passion only exhaust me more. 

Thatâ€™s the thing. Iâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m done. I feel like my grandmothers did when they passed away. How my mom felt when she passed away. Iâ€™m just done. Iâ€™m weak. Life took a lot out of me and it continues to do so everyday. Please, all I ask if that I find out Iâ€™m deathly ill so I can go to a hospital or something and die in peace. Thatâ€™s all I want at this point. I want to die and Iâ€™ve wanted to die since I was 10. It used to make me sad, but now the sweet release couldnâ€™t come any quicker. Thereâ€™d be no stress anymore. No more deciding what to do, no more deciding who I am or who I want to be, no more thinking, no more feeling. My brain could finally be uncluttered. Itâ€™s been cluttered my whole life with thoughts and ideas. I wake up every morning with it swirling, having to organize everything so I can be a functional member of society. 

Sometimes I think Iâ€™d like living if it didnâ€™t require so much work. What if I could just stare off into the distance all day? No decisions, no tasks, no lists, no responsibilities. Just sit and stare. To have a mind uncluttered. Thatâ€™d be nice. But it isnâ€™t like that. Just to live, to have a place to sleep and fill basic necessities requires planning and thought and care. Itâ€™s too much energy, to even get the thoughts to stop swirling. They just donâ€™t ever stop. Even to clear a space to write these words is a chore. Iâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m exhausted. I want to sleep. For a long time. For forever.
