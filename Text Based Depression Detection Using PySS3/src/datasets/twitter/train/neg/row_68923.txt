Iâ€™m lost and donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m a high schooler and recently got my grades back. 3 Fs, 2Ds, and 2bs this was the lowest Iâ€™ve ever had. I lost any chance of getting to any of the colleges I wanted to go to, and my back ups, and the emergency ones as well. I literally lost any chance at getting into a good college and that has ruined all my life plans. I wanted to be a inventor but I failed my engineering class, I wanted to be a movie director but I failed my English class, I wanted to be an entrepreneur but I failed my business class. Every plan I had is gone, I havenâ€™t told my parents because Iâ€™m afraid of their reaction. My school counselor pretty much just said â€œToo bad so sad, but hey itâ€™s not our fault itâ€™s yours, You dumba**â€. Iâ€™ve been struggling with thoughts of suicide for years and I usually flip a coin when Iâ€™m at the edge, three times itâ€™s landed heads and it landed heads again today. If it lands tails then I kill myself but whenever I flip the coin I hope it lands on both heads and tails. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep living like this, Iâ€™m just so tired all the time and honestly suicide sounds like my only escape. 

I have people I love and do things I enjoy but with quarantine I lost my rowing scholarship and was kicked off the team. My friends are all moving away and my dad can barely be considered because of cancer. I have nothing left now or for the future, please what do I do now? I donâ€™t live but Iâ€™m afraid to die. Iâ€™m a lazy fat sack of s*** who canâ€™t do anything right, what can I do, is there anything I can do? Iâ€™m going to call a suicide hotline later today and if that doesnâ€™t work Iâ€™m going to flip a coin again. If there is anything at all I can do please tell me, Iâ€™m desperate.
