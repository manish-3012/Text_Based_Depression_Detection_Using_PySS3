honestly, whatâ€™s the point?english is my 2nd language, and im typing this on mobile.

Iâ€™m 25f, not really employed (been freelancing since 2012, but not working on stable, fixed, long term gigs). However, Iâ€™m married. And also professionally diagnosed with MDD. 

I want to get a job. Iâ€™ve been looking for remote/working from home jobs since forever; which was why I decided to go freelancing right after graduation. My degree somehow donâ€™t mean shit i guess, since my field isnâ€™t that sought after and most remote jobs (the ones that literally give you monthly, stable income) demands most from what, computer science field? engineering? That sort of thing.

I really donâ€™t see the point of trying anymore. I know everyone is struggling especially with the current economy and the pandemic. Seriously, I shouldâ€™ve died earlier this month, or years before, so I donâ€™t have to deal with this bullshit. I really canâ€™t stand it any longer.

When things started looking up last May, suddenly at the end of July Iâ€™m told that my performance is really bad, so I might be at risk of getting fired from my current gig. Theyâ€™ve been saying theyâ€™re looking into it and will update me but each passing day feels like forever and Iâ€™m fucking anxious.

I just donâ€™t know what to do. Husband tells me to take it easy. Friends I confided to tell me to take it easy.

But I canâ€™t?? Iâ€™m worried and tbh Iâ€™d rather they just tell me straight away that Iâ€™m sacked so I can deal with that emotion and hopefully move on.

I hate myself. I donâ€™t want to be here. I really donâ€™t.
