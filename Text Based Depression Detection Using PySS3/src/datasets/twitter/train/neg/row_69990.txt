I'm killing myself very soon but I need to do one last thing before I go. And I'd appreciate some help/advice for it...There's a friend I really wanna say goodbye to. And I really want to leave something behind for her. I want her to know how special her presence was in the short time she was in my life. Thing is... She doesn't know that I'm suicidal. She knows I used to cut myself and...that's it. She doesn't even know that I still do, or that I'm suicidal and have tried to kill myself before.

She lives countries away from me, and I met her not too long ago. She is a fellow musician and I've learnt quite a bit from her. And its been nice having her in my miserable life.

I need to go away. But... I don't wanna leave her without a goodbye. But these kinds of things... Aren't easy to approach either.
