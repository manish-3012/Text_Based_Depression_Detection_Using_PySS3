I hit someone else's car todayI did it again. I fucked up. It seems like that's all I do. So what if I just graduataed? A degree doesn't mean shit if all I'm going to do is worry about doing anything remotely social, or if I'm just going to be anxious towards taking risks. All I do is fail. Why would that stop now? And now I've caused a fender bender. My dad is likely going to scream at me, ban me from driving (and effectively from seeing my friends, but most of all, he'll be disappointed agai. Yet again, I've disappointed my dad, the only person out there who seems to want to help me. I've already disappointed him by coming out as transgender and telling him I'm unsure if I want to go to college, and I'll disappoint him again when he finds out that while I graduated, I didn't get good grades for the past 2 quarters. 

Sorry for the wall of text. I don't even know why I'm posting this. Thanks for reading this, if you did. I probably won't kill myself because I'm too much of a coward, but I wish I could.
