I really want to kill myself...I hope I die in my sleep.I canâ€™t stand it anymore. Why exist?? We die anyway. Am I even real? I donâ€™t even care anymore. I am afraid of what happens when and after we die, but itâ€™s inevitable anyway and Iâ€™m so fucking miserable all the time. I hope I come back as a happier person whose dreams become reality. Iâ€™ve decided to stop trying to get control over my health and just let my illness take me away, hopefully in my sleep... But Iâ€™m sure it will be slow and miserable, but I deserve torment, and besides, I wonâ€™t even remember it once Iâ€™m dead... 

I really want to die so badly. I havenâ€™t cut myself in 3 years and I want to now so fucking badly. I hate my life. I have great things in it but Iâ€™m so sick all the time that none of that is enough to make living worth suffering. I want to kill myself!!! I wish I had fentanyl... That would be my ideal way to go, personally. Ugh I feel so sick right now. 

Please, take my life, God! I beg you! Cure me or kill me, PLEASE!!!! I donâ€™t want to keep going any longer ðŸ˜¢ 

I canâ€™t keep going any longer.... 

I wonâ€™t...
