I know where to go. I know what I'll do. But I don't know when. I can't do it.I'd go to the train tracks, simple really, throw myself at it.

I try think, whenever I have these thoughts.
What about my family - I lost my father 3 years ago, my Mother doesnt care anyway, my brother's care but I never see them

I try think about what I'd miss, such as the football, the new games. 
And then I pussy out, turn around and walk home.

What do I do? I cant bare it anymore but I can't bring myself to end it. I've got everything ahead of me, but the future only looks worse.

Thanks.
