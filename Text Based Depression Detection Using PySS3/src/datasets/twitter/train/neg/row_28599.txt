Just took a bunch of pillsLately my depression has gotten out of control. It has gotten to the point that it physically hurts. I get headaches, feel nauseous, and fatigued. And I see no reason to keep living, Iâ€™m stuck in an abusive relationship, my grades are shit, Iâ€™m stuck on medication that I donâ€™t want to be on, and my abusive and drug addicted family hate me. But thatâ€™s okay because I hate them too lol. Also struggling to come to terms with my sexuality. 

I feel cold and hopeless, but happy that it might be over.
