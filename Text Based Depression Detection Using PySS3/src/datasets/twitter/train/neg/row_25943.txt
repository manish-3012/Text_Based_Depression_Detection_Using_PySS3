Club penguin shutting downYou probably read the title and assumed on being dumb but I'm dead serious. This is just the nail in the coffin. My life is hardly enjoyable, my job literally makes me want to disappear. I hate my job more than anything. Club penguin is my "safe space". I go there anytime I'm feeling down and it helps me. It's going to be gone forever sooner than we know and I bawled for almost an hour today when I found out.

I'll read stories on reddit about how people were killed in terrorist attacks or whatever and I find myself envying them. That's when I realized its time to post on here again...
