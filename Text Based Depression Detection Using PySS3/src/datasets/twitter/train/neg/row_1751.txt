Every single day (4/14/2019, 16:15:58)Tears clenched within my eyes

Figuring out how to say my good-byes

Mute sobbing often occurs

Every other thing in life is a blur

Fingers intertwined in a knife

Debating whether to end my life

Gone with all the happy and smiles

Never to be found for miles

Now; a girl of hate and shame

Living a story full of accusations and blame

Every single day.
