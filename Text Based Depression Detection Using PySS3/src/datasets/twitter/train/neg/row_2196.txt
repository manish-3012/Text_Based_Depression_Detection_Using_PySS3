I can never be happy with my life at this point...I am a 41 year old male whose life is a pathetic disaster in every imaginable way. Too much irreversible damage has been done...to both my mental and physical health, my place in life, and so many more things. It's too late to make up for all I've lost. I cannot better my life because of how this society functions. It is impossible at this point. I am too buried, overwhelmed, and helpless. Every single day is unfulfilling. Medication and therapy do not help enough. I've tried everything available to me since I was 15. I need to die as soon as possible...
