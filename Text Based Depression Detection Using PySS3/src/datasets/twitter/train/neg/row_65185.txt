my birthday is thursday and i cant stop feeling awfulyeah, the 12th is my 18th birthday, which i was excited for but then i realised nothing really positive will happen or no one will remember. ive been crying on and off all day because it makes me feel like complete shit and empty. its a weird concept to me to have a birthday, let alone celebrate it. im gonna be a legal adult and i still dont have a license or a job

my girlfriend (we're ldr) is at her friends house. theyre two dudes and she just told me she smoked weed with them and i got completely pissed since she literally got hired today for a new job. shes blowing me off about how im upset shes probably gonna fuck up a drug test, and all day shes pretty much shrugged me off about how i feel like garbage. like yeah, i realise she cant be my moral support, but theres such a pit in ym stomach. although its completely bratty, i thought she'd ask me about my birthday or ask me what i want to do, but she hasnt at all, she hasnt even said anything about it being soon. neither have my friends. but it hurts me so badly even if i dont expect something because i want to be acknolwedged.

im shaking really bad and i just want to do something self destructive because i feel like my life is going to be stuck in a loop of repeating shit or mood swings
i feel like killing myself would be better because im too anxious and weak to achieve anything in life, and im cosntantly hurt over the smallest thing, ive felt this way in the back of my mind for as long as i can conciously remember.
