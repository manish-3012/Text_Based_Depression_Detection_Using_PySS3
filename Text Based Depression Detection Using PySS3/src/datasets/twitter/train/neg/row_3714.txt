I've gotten myself into such a mess I can't see any other way outI've burnt so many bridges because of political issues in the organizations I belong to in college, specifically racism occurring in the groups and other people defending it. I've faced a ton of social isolation and ostracism, and the past few days I've seemingly ended the last few supportive friendships I had in an attempt to retaliate against the people that have hurt me. 

On top of all that I was sexually assaulted a month ago. People I once loved HATE me, and all of this haunts me every day to a point that I just don't see any way out that's not killing myself. I can't fix any of this, I've been trying for weeks and I want to give up.
