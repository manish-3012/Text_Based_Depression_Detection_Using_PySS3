Online friend admitted he was going to kill himself.I met a group of people playing an online game a few years back. We've all remained friends, and would talk over Skype a lot. The last few months we've all kind of drifted apart. One of my friends just messaged me and told me he was going to kill himself today but didn't. I don't know his real name or exactly where he lives so I have no idea what to do to help him. He's such a wonderful loving person and I just wish there was something I could do for him.
