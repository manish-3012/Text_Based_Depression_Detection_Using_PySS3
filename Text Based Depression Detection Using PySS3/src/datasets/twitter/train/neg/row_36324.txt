January 10thThis is my new date. I had to make a new profile since I think my old was one was compromised. A couple of people tried to help but no one alive or dead can heal the heartache. Only I can and I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to. I donâ€™t want to live without her and in January 10th I should be able to buy a gun. I wish I could do it tonight but I canâ€™t get the gun until then. Iâ€™m actually excited for the first time since she left me. I donâ€™t know why I post on here. Maybe just so someone knows where Iâ€™m at. My parents know Iâ€™m suicidal I got stuck in psych ward but I canâ€™t tell them I have a date. Or that my notes been done for weeks. I donâ€™t want attention I just want death
