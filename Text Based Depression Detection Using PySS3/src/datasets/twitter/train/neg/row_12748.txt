Overdose on sleeping pillsMy friend texted me 14 hours ago that he took 30 sleeping pills to end his life. 

I was wondering what the effects of this would be and if heâ€™ll be okay. 

I donâ€™t know if he drank alcohol with them... but I have a hunch he didnâ€™t. His mom is with him and I notified her. But I havenâ€™t heard any word from either of them. 

Thereâ€™s not much I can do because he lives in a different country.
