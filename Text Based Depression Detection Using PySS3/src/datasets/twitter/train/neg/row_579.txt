I can't take it anymoreI really don't what to do with my life anymore. I'm 19 years old and so tired of being alone and having to be strong. My mom died when I was 11, at 17 my dad kicked me out. I literally get super drunk and high every night to cope, my family just sees a dumb drunk yet expects me to fulfill their expectations while never asking how I feel. It's the only coping mechanism I have, my ex dumped me after begging me to come back from Oregon cause she missed me.

Every other girl I talk just ghosts me, even my own friends left me behind I'm a complete loner and I can't take it anymore, I always masquerade as this super confident happy guy but inside I'm dying, this is probably it for me I'm out of options.
