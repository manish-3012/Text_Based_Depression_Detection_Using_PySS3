i took 50(0,5g) tablets of rivotril. i know it will not kill me... so i took another 80 pills, i feel i wan to die now[me](http://i.imgur.com/wBGP8vL.jpg)| hatreds towards myself and years of being depressed is just too much + i know no one will ever help me because, its just simply not possible. i know it sounds weird but i want to suffer even more... there is nothing going on in my life and never will. at least if i had single friend.

i felt alright for few years, but at the end, it hit me. i didn't talk to anyone for 4 years. no meaningful social contact and never ending loneliness.

how hard is to find friend? 

i think after few years i will kill myself definitely


there is just nothing,. sorry for grammar my brain is acting weirdm

eat another 90 pills to make sure i will die
