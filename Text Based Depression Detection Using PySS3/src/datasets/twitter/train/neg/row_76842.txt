Nothing worth living forIâ€™m 19 years old and Iâ€™ve had really bad depression since i was about 15. i also suffer from bipolar disorder. iâ€™m ruining whatâ€™s left of my life because iâ€™m fucked up. i want to kill myself so at least nobody else will have to deal with my problems and the way i act. i just donâ€™t want my mom to be sad, but i really donâ€™t have any other choices because nothing has worked and i just keep digging a bigger and bigger hole for myself
