I have a problem.I have set an impossible premise on myself of completely concealing my severe mental illness from all my friends and family. In the privacy of my room I feel depressed, anxious, angry, and sometimes crazy. I was abused and now I'm trapped in a never-ending cycle of drug abuse - nothin too hard, just weed, nic and alc - and I have come very close to suicide a number of times. 

I feel this distances and isolates me from other people. I struggle to relate to them, for I know what is inside me is poison waiting to lash out. Maybe its just the quarantine getting to me but I really am puzzled and concerned by this.

What in the fuck should I do to fix this guys? 

I go to therapy and it isn't helping. Its over the phone now. 

I hate this. I need to change but I don't know how. I don't even really want to die anymore. I just want it to stop.
