It's timeIt's time. I'm a sophomore at New Trier. Don't care if you call or try to stop me, go ahead. Was deciding on killing myself earlier. Only 1 person was holding me back and he was my 1 and only best friend who would listen to me. I told a joke to another friend that isn't as close as the other one a joke about him and now my bf won't talk to me. Now that I've lost my best friend I have nothing to live for. It all decides on my best friend if he still wants to be friends. I will wait till tomorrow afternoon after school to see if we are still friends. If we are not, I will hang myself without a second thought. Losing my best friend pains me so much. Hopefully we are still friends.

TL;DR Lost a best friend which is my last straw before I decide to kms and if we aren't friends tomorrow I am going on with the plan.
