I think about suicide every dayI' m not sure if I'll ever go through with it, but every day it crosses my mind. Like the little devil on my shoulder egging me on, telling me to crash my car or step in front of a train. It's exhausting. Truth be told, my life isn't bad, especially in comparison to so many others. My family and friends do care, I'm not broke, etc. But none of that stops me from feeling as horrible as I do every second of every day. I'm in constant pain between two blown out knees and degenerative disc disease (spine issues). Just pretending to be normal is incredibly draining. It's literally sapping the life out of me, just trying to be a person. To top it all off, my girlfriend of nearly 2 years left. We had talked about getting married, but she still walked away. A lot of our issues were fights that stemmed from me being difficult, but so many of those things had to do with how terrible i was feeling. It's ironic, since she was the one thing in my life that made me truly happy.

I made myself a deal, that if things didn't change by the time I was 30, I could do something about it (I'm 25 now). Truth be told, I don't think I can last that long. I'm so sick of being me and feeling what I feel. I honestly want to be done with everything. If I could have chosen not to be born, I would've. I just don't want to be here anymore. 

I don't think there's anything anyone can say that would change my mind about these things. I really just needed to let all this out somewhere where it can't come back to haunt me. The stark reality is I'm drowning in myself. At this point, it's just a question of how long I last.
