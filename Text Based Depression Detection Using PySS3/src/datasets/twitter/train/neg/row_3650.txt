I'm 41. My wife killed herself 2 years ago. My friends and most of my family have rejected me. Tonight (Christmas), I alienated the last 3 people who seemed to care. Hope has slipped away.There are only 3 people in the world who give a shit about me. My sister, dad and stepmother. Tonight I managed to piss off all 3 to the point that they didn't want to eat Christmas dinner with me. We had this big fight over whether "copers" is a word in banagrams. It sounds stupid, but it was a huge fight. I tried to squash it by just moving on, but my sister couldn't eat in the same room as me, so I just went in the other room while they ate together.

It all sounds so dumb, but literally everyone I ever come in contact with (family, friends, employers, women) rejects me. I try to be nice and do good things for people. I'm not resentful, but the pain of rejection from so many people over such a long time is getting unbearable. 

I've tried changing to be physically and emotionally more appealing. I've tried therapy and drugs. I try to just think of what I can give to other people. Since people seem to find me repulsive on a fundamental level, I think the best I can do is to not be a part of society.
