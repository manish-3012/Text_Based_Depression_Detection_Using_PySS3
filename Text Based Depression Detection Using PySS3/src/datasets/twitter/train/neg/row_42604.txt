A message to my mom (even tho sheâ€™ll never see this)Your so worried about me having to retake classes in college and paying a ton of money because you think I canâ€™t manage my time and Iâ€™m â€œlazyâ€, even though Iâ€™m trying really hard right now to stay alive, I can disappear so quickly you wonâ€™t even notice. I can stop burdening you with being the dumb child. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m never going to be as good as my older brother. You tell me to try harder, but Iâ€™m trying my best. Itâ€™s difficult for me to even get up in the morning. Iâ€™m getting good grades and Iâ€™m doing everything to please you, yet you always find something else to look down on. You tell me Iâ€™m so dependent on you, when in reality you have absolutely no idea what Iâ€™m dealing with. You donâ€™t even know anything about me. You didnâ€™t even think twice about the cuts on my arm. I know Iâ€™m not the daughter you wanted. If Iâ€™m the source of your problems, I can just disappear.
