I need someone to talk toThis is a second account, because I am too embarrassed to post this on my normal one. I really don't feel like typing out my Sob story out for everyone. It just I don't know who to talk to and I'm feeling really low right now, and would appreciate an ear. 

Basis of my story, is I lost some one important in my life. Now I really don't know what to do, I'v become numb. And for the first time in my life I rather be Dead then go through this pain. 

Thank you so much to anyone willing to help me out, and I apologize in advance for taking up your time with my useless problems. I just need some one right now.
