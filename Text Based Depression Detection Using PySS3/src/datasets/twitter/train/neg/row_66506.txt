I donâ€™t think people really careIf I were to tell people that I want to kill myself, theyâ€™d make an effort to be there for me (I think). If I donâ€™t tell them, then no one will talk to me. It feels like people donâ€™t really want to be there for me, but if I talk about wanting to kill myself, people feel obligated to â€œsave meâ€. Itâ€™s like people donâ€™t really care about me, they just donâ€™t want me to die either.
I donâ€™t know if what Iâ€™m saying is making any sense, but I guess it just seems fake because that effort doesnâ€™t come unconditionally. I donâ€™t tell anyone because I donâ€™t want their â€œlove and supportâ€ if it isnâ€™t real and if theyâ€™re not always there to offer it.

P.S. I just re-read that and I donâ€™t know if what I want is just asking too much from people? How can I work on expecting less?
