It's my birthday in less than an hour.I remember being 7 years old and thinking "in 20 years I'll have life figured out, and that's the year I will be able to settle down and get married because I'll have a career and a house"...

I'm turning 27 in less than an hour and I still live at home, I am unemployed, and I haven't had a serious relationship in over three years. 

I have so many people telling me that I'll find work soon, and that someone as smart and qualified as me should be able to get a job so easily, but I know different. I'm not as smart as they think I am. I'm not as employable as they think I am. I'm a fake, a loser, a woman who because she can't have (and doesn't want) kids is tainted and broken.

Fuck this life.
