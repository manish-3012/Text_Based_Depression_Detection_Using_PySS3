High expectations, a latchkey existence, paranoia and constant travel.I won't bore you with the details, but I've never lived in one place for more than five years, been traveling from country to country for fucking ever, am 20, unemployed, feeling unemployable and a waste on the world, single, haven't had a girlfriend since high school, virgin, hating life, knowing everything I am typing it traceable, and thinking suicide is my only way out of this hell we call life.

Help? Make me feel better? Something?
