i want to harm myself.maybe i should be lucky that i havenâ€™t harmed myself but i donâ€™t. i feel more and more compelled to give in and do it. cut myself. so many people suffering from mental issues do it. my mental pain wonâ€™t be valid if i donâ€™t do it i have to in some way because otherwise im not mentally messed up. otherwise iâ€™m not really suffering, right? because i havenâ€™t cut yet? i have to do it
