What's the point?I'm sick all the time; the doctors don't know what's wrong. I keep coughing up blood and mucus and the doctors keep doing test after test after test. 

I'm piling up the medical debt. I owe so much money, above what I already owe elsewhere.

I'm in a dead end job. People call me all day and are either idiotic or yell at me and claim I'm the reason their family is dying. I do well at it, but no one cares. Higher management only cares about handle times and don't give a damn about me.

I go home and cry myself to sleep in order to wake up and barely make it through the day.

I'm tired. There's no point. There's no fucking point.
