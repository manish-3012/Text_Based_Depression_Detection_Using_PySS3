How do I tell my mom I would rather be deadI'm pretty sure I feel this way. I have no motivation to do anything and when I'm faced with any kind of task I think about how much I would rather not be alive right now. The only thing stopping me from ending it all is the fear and pain of dying, along with whatever comes afterwards.
