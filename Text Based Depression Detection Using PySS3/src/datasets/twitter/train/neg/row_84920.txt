I'm so tiredI've got a plan. I fantasize about it constantly. Have for a long time. Can barely bring myself to get out of bed. If I could just get over my fear of death I'd have done it already but I'm too selfish and cowardly. Can't even cut myself anymore. Don't know where else to put these feelings but here. I can't tell anyone irl. I'm drowning in my own head.
