I want to be happyI want to die. Because I don't think I can live with this much pain anymore. I want to be happy but I've been depressed and anxious pretty much my whole life. I really want to be happy but I don't know how to approach it and I'd rather die than try to operate on autopilot the next 21 years of my life. It's really painful to feel helpless, especially considering the fact that I'm stuck in the house for the foreseeable future
