Iâ€™m done.Tonight might just be the night. I think Iâ€™m finally ready. I donâ€™t know if I want to die, but I know that I donâ€™t want to live. I have no reason to stay. No one cares about me, no one listens to me when I need it anymore, theyâ€™ve given up on me  so I suppose itâ€™s time I give up on my self. I might not do it now, but if I donâ€™t tonight it will likely be soon. Thx for reading I guess
