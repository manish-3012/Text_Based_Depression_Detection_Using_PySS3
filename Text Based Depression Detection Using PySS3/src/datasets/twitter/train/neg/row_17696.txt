Got cheated on. Want to end it.I just found out my now ex bf cheated on me, has another fucking gf and has had feelings for her all throughout our relationship. I feel like  a fucking garbage bag and ive never wanted to end my life like i do not. Im just crying and punching things because im also mad i trusted him. On top of this i have no friends, am a total loser and i was never as happy as when i met him.   I trusted him so much. Ive had bad feelings when we were together but I just ignored them thinking im paranoid. I dont know what to dom i want to end it. Help
