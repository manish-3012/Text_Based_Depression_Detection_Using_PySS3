IdkI am sooo lonely, and i never had any friends in my life, people treat me like shit all the time and i was bullied physically and verbally since elementary school because i was tiny. I am not attractive nor smart i have alot of mental health problems and serious medical illnesses.I have no time nor will to change myself nor i have enough money to be able to, i haven't accomplished nothing in my short life, i had to drop out of high school because of my depression adhd and ocd, nobody of my classmates ever asked about me nor did they look back when i left. I am afraid to go to my doctor to hear the bad news.. I never had no bf or a husband and nobody was ever interested in me, i have no one to talk to and people have given up on me, i have made many bad choices in my life and done things i fully regret every morning i get up from bed, i am full of sadness and emptiness and i am scared of dying, and tired of living, i don't know what to do anymore i feel like i am trapped in a small box with no light...
