A car almost hit me yesterdayI was riding a bike and my friend crossed the road and I didn't even think about it I just followed him. A car was 1 meter away from me and I got a weird feeling in my stomach. Everything was in slow motion and I really thought I was going to die. 


Im kinda sad that it didn't hit me. 
Im disappointing everyone. My family and friends hate me because im an asshole. I have no reasons to stay alive.


I am not living my life, I'm just existing. Im tired of everything.
I am going to visit a psychiatrist very soon and I hope that she'll help me.

Sorry about my english and this is kinda messy but i needed to write this.
