I just want to screamThe pressure of everything is just too much it actually feels physical at this point. I've completely fucked up my life and there is no help. Therapy and drugs dont fucking help. The only thing that would make this stop is to stop being alive. But no I'm never left alone and my bf overpowered me, called the ambos who then called the cops. Was given no choice about going to hospital only for the Dr to say it's the worst place for me to be (no shit, I already said that repeatedly). So now on top of everything else I am reliving this mortifying experience over and over and I just want to die even more. FuuuuuÃ¹uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!
