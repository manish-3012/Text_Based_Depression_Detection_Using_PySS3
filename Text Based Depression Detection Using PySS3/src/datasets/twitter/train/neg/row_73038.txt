To all you amazing peopleIt has almost a year since my elder sister OD on medication and everyday I have been thankful that is wasnâ€™t a successful attempt. She is now in college, alive and recovering, and I hope you all will one day be too.

To all you amazing and incredibly wonderful people, I am speaking from the perspective of those who want to help, please donâ€™t do it. Donâ€™t take those pills, donâ€™t pick up that box cutter, donâ€™t do anything that would harm you. There are people around you who need you and love you unconditionally. I hope you all have that something to live for, and if not, I want you to live for me. You are all unbelievably awesome and breathtakingly beautiful. 

If any of you need to talk to someone, please donâ€™t hesitate to message me.

Sincerely,
a friend.
