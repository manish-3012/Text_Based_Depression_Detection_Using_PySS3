Everything will be alrightYesterday I was telling my mom that I don't want to be buried when I die.  And I'll save up money so my family can have me cremated. I didn't say it in a way like I want to die. But inside my heart that was the feeling. I have to finish paying my credit card and save up to have that done. 
I'm sure everything will be fine in the end.
