I'm failing school and probably will never progress.Underachieving since 1st or 2nd grade, no idea how I got up to the 9th grade.
Currently failing multiple subjects (even Russian, which is my first language, failing math aswell, I can't add/subtract/divide/multiply at all and it hurts), and I have exams after this grade which I have to pass in order to get out of this hellhole.
But I'm sure I'll just downright fail both Russian and mathematics, if not all four (you have to pick two exams besides the main ones).
The only reasons I'm still alive is because I can't raise my hand on myself and because of my online friends, who are the only positive thing in my life, and I'll probably never even meet them even though they're probably the only reason to live.
Each day I'm closer to ending my suffering because nothing goes right and I'm stuck in this shitty country, without people who are dear to me. I constantly get streams of "It'll be fine" from my parents aswell, and it hurts.
And even if I do pass the exams, I will still have 4 more years to study somewhere else and then probably get a job that I'll never be happy with.
I just seek comfort by talking with people online and browse the internet in hope that I somehow at least pass exams.

Excuse me for my English, if it's any bad.
