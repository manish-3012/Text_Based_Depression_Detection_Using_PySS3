I'm killing myself soon. What should I do with the rest of my time?Hello Reddit (:

This is my first time here, so sorry if I've got some formatting stuff wrong. I only made this account so I could ask complete strangers from the internet what bucket list-type things I should do in the next 3 and a bit months.

At the latest, I have until May 4th, 2017, and approximately 8,000 AUD (before expenses such as rent, bills, groceries, social outings, etc.). I would rather not spend all my money as I would like to leave a reasonable amount to my parents so they don't have to cover the entirety of my student debt (because apparently that doesn't just go away if you die).

I am currently in the process of selling my clothes, furniture, books and plushies (within reason - my friends and family will notice if most of my stuff suddenly starts to go missing), as well as writing up a will, attempting to organise at least one funeral (the staff at the funeral homes get weird with me when I tell them the person it's for hasn't exactly died yet), finding new tenants for my apartment so my landlords aren't too inconvenienced and so on, so I don't exactly have oodles of free time and it's unlikely that I'll be able to travel anywhere outside Australia, possibly not even out of Victoria. On top of this, I plan to maintain my current obligations and responsibilities such as university and work. I will drop out and give my two weeks' notice closer to the date.

If you have any ideas, pop them in the comments below or inbox me. So far I've dyed my hair purple (something I've wanted to do for years) and have been on a 24-hour date (though I wouldn't mind redoing that with more activities).

I look forward to hearing from you, Reddit xx
