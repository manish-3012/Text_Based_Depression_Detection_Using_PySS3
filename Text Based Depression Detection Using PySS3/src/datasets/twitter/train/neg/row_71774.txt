(14M) Is it bad that I fantasize about death and what itâ€™ll be like when I die, and if I would become another person?The title says it all. Is it bad that I fantasize about dying and becoming a better person than I am now? I fantasize about me dying peacefully and becoming a whole different person. It brings me peace, in a weird way. Iâ€™ve accepted that Iâ€™m broken, and that Iâ€™m canâ€™t be fixed. If I do kill myself, I dont think my sister will remember me. Itâ€™ll only be little spots of memories. In the years to come, sheâ€™ll probably forget my face too, which sucks. But Iâ€™ve pushed the pain away for too long. For example, I am so fucking skinny. I donâ€™t understand why I donâ€™t gain weight, but I donâ€™t. I think when my mom was pregnant I didnâ€™t get enough nutrients or something (my mom did run away while she was pregnant with me, so it makes sense if I was underdeveloped in someway) god bless my mother. Sheâ€™s dealing with depression too. Sheâ€™s cut herself before, Iâ€™ve seen the scars on her arms. I feel like if I died it would break her. Of course I donâ€™t want that I love my family so much. But I just canâ€™t do it anymore, man. Death seems to bring peace to me for some reason. Like, can you remember anything before you were born? Nope. If I donâ€™t become someone else than Iâ€™ll probably will just be nothing. I guess thatâ€™s fine
