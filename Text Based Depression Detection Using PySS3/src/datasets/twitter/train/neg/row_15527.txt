Am I suicidal?I don't know if I am or not. I don't know what it means. I wouldn't kill myself because I am a mother. I could never do that to my kids. Five months ago I was severely injured by being wrongly prescribed mirvaso. It completely destroyed my face and life. I have severe,  chronic nerve pain in my face. And it's impacted every area of my life. My ability to eat. I fear food now. I have more health conditions because I lost too much weight and can't eat. Foods increase the nerve pain. Can't sleep. Lying down increases the pain. I was a dancer. Now I have lost it all. Everything I spent my life working for is destroyed. I can't go a single second without vivid imagery of killing myself. I have planned out the "perfect" way to do it, so no one would know it was suicide. I feel like my mind is going to snap and I will hurt myself. I am just having such a hard time coping with what has been done to me medically. I continually try not to cry because it makes it worse. I can't live in my mind anymore now. I don't know how to get better. I am too afraid to take meds because I don't want to be injured anymore. I don't see how going to a counselor would help. I just want my life back that I had five months ago. I wish I had never gone to doctors. I do have ptsd because I was severely abused as a child. I went through testifying against my former stepfather 3 years ago. The stress was so bad my hair was falling out in clumps. But, I was ok. I was happy and healthy. This injury has completely destroyed me.
