Is it worth dying at 13?Hi. I need to know if ending life is really worth it or not. I am currently 12, barely even 13 yet. I tried attempting suicide back in March, only to fail miserably. It got way worse from there. My family whispers behind closed doors about me, blatantly bash things like my suicide and the serious letter I left behind and the list goes on. They say things get better but god, it's only gotten worse. I do not think I'm strong enough to keep on going. I can't do it. Is there really a point for living? I don't think so.

Also, yeah, I did have a therapist but not anymore since "I waste money for problems that are only there for attention"
