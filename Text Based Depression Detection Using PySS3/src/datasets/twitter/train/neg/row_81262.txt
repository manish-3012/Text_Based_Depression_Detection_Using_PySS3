Is there an end?!?I just want out. Nothing seems worthwhile anymore. I have no want or care to continue my studies, the last of my friends have ditched me, I am stuck, isolated alone with the people who care the least about me in the world. Is it all just some big joke? My life? Everything I do just keeps tumbling down and down and down, with no end in sight. And where ever I ask, all I get are the same answers, "What's wrong?" "It gets better" "I understand" No you don't!! No one understands. No one ever has understood me, no one in my life has. From the moment I was born, life has sucked. I have cried myself to sleep most days now. My body barely even works anymore, constant weakness due to my autoimmune disease has crippled me physically to a point where I can't even walk too far and getting too emotional will leave me sick. Life is a living hell. I want out
