What's the most painless way out possible?I've been thinking about a quiet way out. I don't want to get others involved, or hurt people, as impossible as that may seem. ATM, I'm thinking carbon monoxide poisoning through my car's exhaust pipe. I'm hoping to take sleeping pills and not feel a thing through the ordeal. Are there any other easier methods?
