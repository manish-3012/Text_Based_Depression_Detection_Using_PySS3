Is it normal?I [21M] recently attempted suicide over fall break from University. I was put in a mental hospital where I got to talk to people about their situations. Is it normal to think about suicide every single day? I knew I had depression, but one day my friend mentioned he has depression and so does his friend, but she struggles with suicide ideation and he doesn't. It confused me so much. I just figured everyone with depression had suicide on their mind everyday. Is it not normal? Ive heard it called Chronic Suicide Ideation. Do alot of people think this?
