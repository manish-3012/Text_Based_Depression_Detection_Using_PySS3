Just a question.I was listening to the radio the other day and there were some people from some helping center for suicidal people and that kind of stuff. They said when a person talks about suicide one should talk to them and try to see if something is wrong.

Thing is, i've been thinking a lot about it, I don't feel like any kind of desire to commit suicide but suicide itself and how would I do it has become a recurring thought i have, mostly when i'm alone. As i said it the idea of actually doing it has never come to my mind since in all my thoughts about it even though I picture myself doing it I always think of everything that is wrong with it and how it wouldn't be an easy thing for my family and friends to deal with a thing such. Anyway, I'm kind of worried about this, it's not cool to imagine things such as that.

I would like to read what do you think and if perhaps anyone of you has some advice in how to get rid of this awful thoughts it would be very appreciated. 

Thanks.
