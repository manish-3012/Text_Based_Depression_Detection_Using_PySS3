Has anyone ever been down and out because of women?Really have been so close to ending my life for years. Yes to be blunt over women. There are plenty of things that I have a hard time with other than just women. Ofcourse. But it really seems like that's all I am living for. They are so shallow so cold hearted and just do you wrong no matter how good you are to them. It is getting to the point when I see other couples i get sad depressed and just out of it. I feel as if I'm to ugly. I'm not good enough maybe if i was a dead beat. Maybe if i abused women i could have one in my life. It seems like that's the only things they want and like put of men is the worst. And not the good. I have been planning on getting a gun and blowing my brains out to end this kind of thinking because their is no way that I will be able to have a woman in my life at all. Seriously.
