I wish people stopped treating me like I was delusional.I wish people stopped trying to convince me that the thoughts I want to kill myself over are wrong.

I wish people didn't feel the need to correct me or "help" me by saying things contrary to what I believe.

I wish people recognized that challenge thoughts and dismissing them are very different things.

I wish people could understand that support isn't telling someone they're wrong (even if by virtue of telling them what to do right), but being with them in their worst emotional state.

I wish people didn't try to convince me not to kill myself by saying that what I want to kill myself over is insufficient, or blame it all on me, saying that I'm just trying to air my dirty laundry but I "don't want help" just because I stated that I already tried whatever "help" that I did have.

I wish someone would just understand that... that going against me isn't helping me. That it's making me feel worse.

I wish someone would just try to not fight me over my thoughts, for I fight over them with myself every day.

I wish posting on this sub wasn't draining anymore. I wish that this place, the last place where I used to feel heard and understood, didn't dissolve right through my hands and join the cesspool of external validations of why I need to die.

...

I wish someone would feel sorry for me.

I wish I didn't have to fear judgement on places claiming to be supportive. That my posts on my experiences as a male rape victim weren't met by demonization of my decision to use the services of sex workers and invalidation of my belief that I will never get to experience sex outside of paying for it.

I guess people just like to pretend what it's like for male-rape-victims-turned-incels. I guess the model of broken people doesn't apply to... me...

I wish advice focused or based on the idea that contradicting me would help me wasn't so prevalent.

I never wanted to vilify fellow suicidal people.

And I can't. Because no matter how much they hurt me it's still not fair.

I'm just done being blamed.

I'm done breathing now.

I wish there was a community out there that would accept my suicide letter as something it took a lot out of my soul and mind, both things that are already immensely hurting, to express.

I wish I didn't have to delete it.
