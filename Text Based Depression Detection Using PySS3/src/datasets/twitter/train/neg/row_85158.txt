I don't know where to startI just think I cant get out of this mess. I just feel nothing whatever I do. I have 2 suicide attempts. After the second one I was hospitalized, but no help, it was just a waste of time. I was supposed to go there for just treatment-resistant PDD and sui.ideation 2 months later, but I missed school trip I was looking forward to all year. I wanted to test rope if it stands my weight, and me, dumbfuck, didn't realize, that unsoftened shoelaces can bruise my neck. I at least hopped before it that they will help me there, or just find some hope, but they don't. I'm trying meditating,and it helps just a little, but not enough. I also SH myself, just to escape numbness even for a little while. When I read my release paper(that I wasn't supposed to read),I found out that I'm pseudophyllosoph, or at least they suspect. I don't know if it was offensive, but I didn't like that. I have no history of substance abuse, but if I have money, I would most probably spend them on drugs, even though I have access to some, and I don't use them.I'm teen so my job options are very limited in my country, but because of not mentioned flu, there is no one job for me. Its pretty hard seeing my peers dream about their future jobs, but I'm just hopeless for my case. I every day tell myself not today, but I don't know how long I can endure. I hope at least you have a better day. Bye reader, have a nice day. Sending hugs
