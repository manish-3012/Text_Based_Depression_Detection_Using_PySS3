I've had a very painful life but all I wanted was to be loved by a girl. Creepy? Desperate? You decide.I always wanted to cook for a girl. Walk with her. Give her big hugs. Scratch her back and play with her hair. Make her smile. Make her feel joy.


I always wanted to kiss a girl. I've never kissed anyone outside of prostitutes. Let alone fucking anyone. I fucking hate this existence.


I see kids fucking 14 year olds in each other's arms. Why was that ripped away from me? Why was I meant to live like this? It's sickening and I fucking hate it. I hate everything about my miserable existence.


I want a girl who'll hear my darkest thoughts, and let me hear hers. I want a girl who'll genuinely be excited and proud of me and my achievements. I want to stare in her eyes and share moments of intimacy unparalleled by any paid experience.


All I wish was that I could be loved.


But on the other hand... She would be so sad if she was with me. Any girl would be. Her life would become miserable with me.

I know I'd end up hurting her badly. I'm sure I'll be like my dad and beat her, rape her, make her feel worthless and ugly. I don't ever want to put a girl through that. I don't ever want a girl to be sad and miserable, it breaks my heart. And if I love a girl, I want her to be happy. And no girl can be happy with me.

But that doesn't make my own suffering any less. I will always resent my existence for being so out of reach of love. I'm glad that no girls will suffer because of me, and that gives me an even better reason to die.


I know my life wouldn't be perfect with a girl. But can't I just have that much to live for?

Who am I fucking kidding, I can't. I'm just a lonely loser and I'm just overreacting. I tried to OD hoping I'll die in peace but it didn't work. I'll just take my grandpa's gun and shoot myself now.
