fuck vacationI am at the beach and more depressed than ever. I just had a psychotic depression episode today and cried the whole evening while riding a bike. My mother died 4 months ago. My brother hates me. I have no friends because I lost them all to depression. I have literally zero reasons to keep on living. I guess I will drown in the sea soon, so I wanted to say goodbye to reddit, it has always been a support for me. Thanks and have a good life.
