Very depressed and don't know where to go from here.I've been depressed before, but I don't think that it's ever been this bad. I think about killing myself every day and it actually brings me relief to consider it. I'm not being dramatic or crying for attention, I just don't really know what to do to feel better at this point. 

I graduated from college recently and have been unable to find a job or get into grad school. I've literally been rejected from everything that I've applied to. My SO also just broke up with me and continues to pour salt in the wound with hurtful facebook posts and a general lack of caring for me at all. I really don't have anyone to talk to about everything. I have some distant friends but I hate to bring them into my downward spiral. I've always had a friend or two to bring me out of difficult times, but I really can't find anything worthwhile about living at this point and I don't know what to do.
