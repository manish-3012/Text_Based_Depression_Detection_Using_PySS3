Am I almost finished?Hello again, 
     I have grown so very weary of my existence.  Why did my parents curse me with life? Could they not have had the courtesy to have an abortion? I am sick of waking up.  Each night before I close my eyes to sleep, I pray that whatever chooses who must continue and who may finally have eternal rest will finally let me go.  I am so tired.  I have done everything that society suggests I do to become less unhappy. I have a well paying job. I have hobbies. I have friends. I have a mother, father and sisters who care about me.  I am so sick of going on.  I continue for them. Something in me must be broken. I take my medications, I sit under my lamp for season affective disorder. I just want to be finished. It would be so easy to meander out to my car, close the garage door, start my vehicle and just rest. Or pull out the razor blade i keep for when I finally am so disgusted with everything I decide to end it. I am not going back to hospitals, I have seen councilors, psychiatrists, tried their coping methods. I have lived long enough. I have tried to do it well. Living with kindness in my heart. Giving all freely to others, asking nothing in return. What can I do? Most of the time I feel as if nothing truly matters. I feel little to no positive emotion, just rage, unhappiness, and when I am lucky just sadness. When a friend killed himself I felt jealous. How could he justify what I have longed to do for so long? I hope he is at peace. I know his wife struggles, and his son will. Why does everyone look on at him in disgust? I am done rambling. I just want to stop hurting.
