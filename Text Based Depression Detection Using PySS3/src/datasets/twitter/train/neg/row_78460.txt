last attempt to live, i'm losti am transgender(in closet) my mom is homophobic, so i'm scared to come out. i have more problems, but that's not important. i finally found a passion, but the struggles are overcoming it. if my mom accepted me that would actually save me. i don't know should i just go for it?
