I feel inferior(M15)I live with my parents, I don't leave the house, I used to have friends but I stopped talking to them. I do all my schoolwork online, and I'm months behind. I constantly forget things, can't concentrate, And bite my nails/finger skin. I can get good grades, but I find most school insanely boring. My life feels like hell, spending each day intentionally skipping my schoolwork to play video games and browse the internet. I know I need to do school, I want to, I try to, but I just can't. I barely even talk to my parents, I've been having suicidal thoughts recently, And I feel like something is deeply wrong with me. Please Help
