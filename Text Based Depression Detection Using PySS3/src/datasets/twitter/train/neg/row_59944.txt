Not sure how much more I can take.Life has been cruel. My parents have been split up for a while now and my mom lives 3 hours away and I donâ€™t get to see her much. With my dad I canâ€™t have a conversation without every flaw of mine being pointed out and how much better I could be but more like how much better he wishes I were. I donâ€™t drink or smoke yet Iâ€™m compared to a step sibling who constantly does. I donâ€™t know what I could do. Every conversation digs a deeper hole for me. I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can fight these thoughts. Itâ€™s taken quite the toll on me in the past couple weeks, I donâ€™t want to do anything because of the criticism always received. I really just canâ€™t take it anymore. The pressures of school, getting into college, grades, and athletics are too much for me. I just want someone to talk to because I canâ€™t find that where I am.
