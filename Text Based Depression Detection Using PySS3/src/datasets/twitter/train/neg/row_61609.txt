I'm so alone.I left my abusive relationship. 
Sure, that's a positive.
But now I'm all alone.
I don't have friends. Or any support system. 
I barely am able to leave the house. 
I just want to die.
And people wonder why the go back to their abusers. It is so hard to stand your ground and stay away when you have nothing and no one to turn to. When you've confided in old friends about your struggles and they stop talking to you all together, making you feel disgusting and damaged and unwanted.
I don't want to live anymore.
