Help meI need help. I have a wife and 3 kids. I was making really good money and then invested in a business that failed dramatically. Regardless, i was always a pathetic failure of a human. I faked it til i made it cause i never knew how to be. Now I'm struggling to find myself in a life that sits so far from normality. I can't fix my financial situation without burning out and i can't take time off to fix my mindset without jeopardizing my career. What do i do? Help me!
