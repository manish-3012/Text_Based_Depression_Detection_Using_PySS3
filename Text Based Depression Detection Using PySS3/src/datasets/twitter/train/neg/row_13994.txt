I'm sick of everything and I'm ending it tonightI'm sick of being a worthless disappointment to everyone I know. I'm sick of causing problems for everybody through my own stupidity, carelessness and selfishness. I hate myself for it more than I've ever hated anybody else. 

I've been taking citalopram 20mg antidepressants but they don't do anything. I've got a pack of 13 tablets, and there are about 8 paracetamols in the cabinet downstairs. That should be enough for an overdose right?
