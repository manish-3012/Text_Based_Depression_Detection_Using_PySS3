I wish I didn't matterI can't think or articulate myself clearly right now, all I know is I've been in a really awful place mentally and I hate what it's done to the people I care about. When I get this severely depressed/anxious, I become so self-absorbed and just a total fucking drain on everyone and it feels like my only options are 1) ruin everyone's lives by subjecting them to my existence, or 2) just going away and leaving them alone.

The worst part is these people truly love me and they assure me that I'm not too much, that they're not sick of me, that they're not going to leave me just because I'm suffering. Why can't I just take their word at face value? Why can't I just say to myself, "Listen, these people are not angry at you, they just want you to get better, that's it."?

I wish I didn't matter to anyone because it feels like the only way for me to stop ruining everyone's lives with my mental illness is to just fucking die, but I can't do that because for some reason these people think I'm important and would be devastated if I was gone or whatever. 

There's so much more on my mind but I don't know how to say it right now. I am suffering, and it's making the people I love suffer, just really truly feel like I need to go the fuck away, ideally forever. I feel like I've just manipulated everyone into thinking I'm someone worth caring about but the truth is I'm toxic and awful and everyone would be happier and better off without me.

I wish no one had ever known me or met me in the first place. I take away so much more than I give, and when I don't think I have words for how fucking guilty and ashamed I feel for being such a fucking leech. I need to remove myself. I need to go away.
