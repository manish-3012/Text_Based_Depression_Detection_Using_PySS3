I wish people would hate me so I can end it easier.I truly believe that life is meant to die. Nothing anyone does between life and death matters. We all trick ourselves into thinking that things we do matter, but they don't. If someone that cared about me said "I wish you were dead," what a relief it would be. I could finally let go of this stupid life. But, I am forced to live in a hell of degeneracy, ignorance and poverty. I haven't met a single virtuous person in a long time. I am completely alone so suicide is the next logical step.
