Do I really wanna kill myself?Like yeah my life is tough, I have depression and believe me itâ€™s bad but I care about people. Sadly I donâ€™t care about myself but there are people I care so much about and I really donâ€™t wanna hurt them. Yes it would end my suffering but I donâ€™t care about that, I care about them and I donâ€™t want them to suffer because of something I did. 

I just wish things were different.

I wish I was loved.

I wish I could be happy.

I wish I didnâ€™t have to deal with this.
