I wish..I wish I had the balls to end my life. I donâ€™t want to be here and I wish I had died at child birth. I wish that I didnâ€™t have to deal with the obligations and struggles that I deal with on a daily basic. I wish that everything was different for me. I wish that I was looked at in societies eyes as someone, a POC with value. I wish I didnâ€™t have to continuously see the brutal slaying of innocent POC, black people especially since I am a black man myself. I hate this planet. I hate how the world works. I hate how the government and the world measures our success. I hate it here, I hate me and I find it hard for me to love myself because of my past failures. If I can end it all painlessly, I would.
