Kinda wanna dieSurprise Iâ€™m suicidal like most of yall. When I look back at my life I think I always have wanted to die. Not kill myself but just not exist. No stress, no pain, no worry you know. Just nothing. Like I genuinely remember being like seven and wondering what would happen if I ran out in front of a car. Now Iâ€™m 18 going 19 and life just sucks. Iâ€™ve got adhd which held me back in school, but they refuse to give me a high enough dose so I can actually do anything to catch up and I have to be done by December but I canâ€™t focus and I hate it. My parents want to get a job but Iâ€™m terrified bc my feet always hurt so bad and I canâ€™t do anything about it and how can I work when I canâ€™t stand. My step mom wants me out of the house bc she wants her happy family and Iâ€™m not included in that and Iâ€™m pretty sure my dad secretly wants me out too but is to fucking weak to say it to my face. Iâ€™m stressed bc of all this. I know it will probably sort itself out and itâ€™s not like people wonâ€™t miss me. I live a good life. I have plans with friends in the coming weeks. Iâ€™m just so scared of living and I donâ€™t know what to do. It just sucks being scared all the time.
