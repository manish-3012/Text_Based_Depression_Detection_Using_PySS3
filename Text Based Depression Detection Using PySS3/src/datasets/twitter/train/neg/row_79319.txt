Iâ€™m nowhere near where I wanted to be. TRIGGER WARNING I THINK!I just want to have a early start on a family so I can run around with them and buy a house early and just live a happy life with my partner and children. 

Instead my ex broken up with me last night and now Iâ€™m living in our caravan on his mums front garden while his in the house because I have nowhere else and not really anyone else. This is the only person Iâ€™ve ever felt safest and comfortable with. Everything in my life is just turned to shit. I canâ€™t see a future and I donâ€™t know what to do with myself. My mental issues have been going up and down. Honestly I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to make it through this and it actually makes me scared because what if I try to kill myself and it fails and I end up crippled and having no way to deal with it.

The last time I loved someone it taken me nearly 4 years to get over them and even now if I see him I get this weird feeling inside me... I donâ€™t think I love or wanna be with that dude, he played me.but this guy... best person Iâ€™ve ever met, even with his flaws... itâ€™s so hard... on top of soo many other things... 

Yesterday I was going to buy a shit ton of drugs even ones Iâ€™ve never tried before and have a bunch of tablets, all my antidepressants and all the drugs around the same time and just hope I fall asleep into a coma and them not be able to wake me up and they end up just pulling the plug. Or maybe if I was high enough Iâ€™d cut deep enough and not feel it... not tonight Iâ€™m just feeling lost... not knowing what to do...
