Itâ€™s too late for me, Iâ€™m committed.Writing to you in the comfort of my own room with a gun on my nightstand after Iâ€™ve written my suicide note.

 Iâ€™ve been seeking help for more than 7 years and nothing has worked for me, talked to all my friends, family, therapists, and hotlines. 

None of them understand what am going through since I donâ€™t even understand it myself.

Guess growing up in the shitty part of the world and cursed with being gay and plagued by a destructive family really isnâ€™t helping, but none of which is the reason for my decision to take my own life. 

Itâ€™s an unforgiving world out there that donâ€™t give a fuck about a teenager REALLY seeking help and just think itâ€™s a phase (my community at least)

The point of this post is that there is really no point, and just wanted to get this off my chest so at least I die feeling Iâ€™ve said it all. 

Going out on my own terms, with my own hands. So FUCK YOU world for not listening to me when I most needed you and fuck you god for not answering my prayers to make me normal and creating a fucking mistake within me, FUCK. YOU. 

Goodbye world, I wonâ€™t miss you.
