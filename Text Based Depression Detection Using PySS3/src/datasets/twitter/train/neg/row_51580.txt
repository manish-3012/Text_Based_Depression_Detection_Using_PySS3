I don't see my life going anywhere.I'm 18, at college, doing really well. I've got loving parents and loving family back home. 

But I'm just not happy. Everything I do, I put on a fake smile and then when I come home I feel like shit all over again. I've been suicidal and depressed before, and tried to kill myself a few times. My parents talked to me about it and I was fine for about a year.

I know I wouldn't hang myself or anything like that, but sometimes I just wish I would get hit by a car or get cancer or something. I know that in the future I won't be happy either and I can't see myself ever being happy.
