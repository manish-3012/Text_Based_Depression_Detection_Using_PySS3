I donâ€™t know where else to put this....I am so tired....I donâ€™t find joy in really anything anymore.

Itâ€™s really dumb, I have an education, a great job,  o shouldnâ€™t feel this way....but I do.

I am broken, I broke myself and there is no way to fix this. 

Iâ€™ve known for a long time that I am gay, I grew up in a Mormon household and was depressed for so many years. When I finally escaped to college I was free, I came out, started dating, and I just felt like for the first time in my life that I wasnâ€™t drowning. I had friends, real friends who accepted me for me. 

One of my friends had a really, really hard upbringing, and we were there for each other. A lot happened and I decided to take care of her, and we got married and had kids. 

I didnâ€™t want this for my life, but I did it to myself. I am so angry all the time, and when you strip away the anger the only thing I have left is pain.

I canâ€™t leave my kids and my best friend to fend for themselves, I canâ€™t be me while I am here. 

I fucked up, I ruined my life and I just want it all to stop....I donâ€™t want to exist.
