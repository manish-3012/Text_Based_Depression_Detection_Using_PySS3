I'm killing myself next week. I want someone to keep me company before I go.Can anyone be my friend for a little while? I've never had a friend before and I'm tired of being alone. I hope you don't mind me not seeing your messages after next week.

Edit: reddit made it so my post will be seen by nobody. At least I tried.
