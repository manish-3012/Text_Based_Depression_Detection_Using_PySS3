I'm almost readyI just finished writing a suicide note.  Three poorly written pages in a futile attempt to explain and justify my decision.  I've had a simple noose ready in my closet for months; it just needs some padding and I think I'll finally be prepared to leave.  As soon as I have the house to myself and feel ready, all I need to do is go down to the basement and tie the noose to an exposed support beam.

Everything feels so surreal.  It's almost like I'm already dead.
