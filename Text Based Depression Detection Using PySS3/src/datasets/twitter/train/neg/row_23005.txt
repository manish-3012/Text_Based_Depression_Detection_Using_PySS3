I am not depressed, but always had suicidal thoughtsI'm 18 yrs old, since I can remember I'vee been thinking and trying to kill myself. First it was about small mistakes I made when I was a lil kid, when my mom told me I was useless because I couldnt do house chores the way she wanted or anything else. Then, things got complicated at home, my grandparents went broke and my mom (she never lived with me) had to come back hom (I lived w/ my grandpas). She remarried and left again, but the only times we could meet she'd complain about anything and make a trouble of it. Me and her used not to get a long very well until I had a surgery for which she was there every moment, but I feel I can not go over all the bad feelings towards her I have from childhood. Also, I am gay, which has made my life even worse, and given me reasons to kill myself everyday I wake up. My mom doesnt want me to be that way and I FEEL I DISSAPOINT HER with everything I do and am. I am a loner, I rather be alone than to spend time with family or the few friends I have. ( I dont have friends from HS, only some people I met in college last year) I don't know, but this year, since new year's eve suicidal thoughts are stronger in my mind. I'm not a sad person or someone who's crying always, but I'm afraid of myself. I'd honestly appreciate any advise on how to cope with those thoughts.
