No point in livingWell, long story short, i have no friends, no personal life, no dream or even a single wish except sitting in my chair and staring at the screen for day and night. Never loved anyone, not even family members, not to speak of girls. Had no good times in life for many years now and i don't think i will have any in future. Suffering from physical and mental illness. Have to hide all my anger and pain under a smile just for people to think im alright. And i was living like that for 5 years, and i was pretty fine with it, lone wolf life, need noone, noone needs me. But now im 18, and that means i have to do something with my life, and i have no lifeplan at all. I want to be noone like i was before, just rot in my room in peace, but thats not an option anymore. So killing myself is probably the best lifeplan i can get with. Not a poisoning or cutting myself and hope i die in like ages. I wish i had a gun, but nope, so i guss i'll just drop my body off the building on this weekend, just have to find a good spot with an access to the rooftop, which is kinda hard in Russia, since they're all locked up. And the reason im typing this is... I don't know, i just want to share my feelings and there's noone to listen to me. Guess being lonely fires back even for lone wolf, huh.
