My long distance boyfriend is attempting to kill himself right now. my boyfriend who lives in Wales had a tumultuous argument with me today and threatened to kill himself. He has paranoia, he feels depressed at times. He's tried before to kill himself, cut as a teenager, and nearly hung himselfonce. He hated me at first and took a walk and slept. then went back on his word and said that he loved me and cared for me. Something stacked on top of the argument, so he flipped. He tried slitting his wrist, called me and laughed like it was a joke, then said he was going to stab himself in the heart. 
It's been an hour. I've contacted his friend who could  contact his parents or emergency lines but he's busy (said don't worry) and I have asked his friend for this a few times before (the boy cried wolf) .. No way to call the police because they don't have numbers abroad. I've got his address, several social media accounts, phone number, etc. He's not online .
It's 5:05 am where he lives and his parents will wake up at around 6 or 7. Please is there any assurnace for me? Does this buy him time if he stabbed himself in the heart? I begged him to stop and he truly cares about me but I'm scared and I don't know how this will affect us.
