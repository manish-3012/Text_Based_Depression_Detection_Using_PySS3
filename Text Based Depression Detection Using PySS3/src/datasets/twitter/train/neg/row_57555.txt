I need some help Iâ€™m sorry for any typosI am 16 just lost my job and I feel nothing. I donâ€™t feel any emotion but ashamed. I know that I should be upset and whatever but I just feel numb. I have no one to talk to. I donâ€™t know if I want to kill my self but I just want everything to stop. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do. Iâ€™m obese and I canâ€™t seem to lose any of the weight. I play football and I am not very good. And I bad grades. I am a failure. I canâ€™t sleep sleep at night. When I told my family many years ago i was met with no support and I was made fun. Many years ago I saw a therapist and I gave her permission to talk my parents and that backfired and they didnâ€™t take me seriously. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I have no friends and no one I can trust. What do I do. Iâ€™m thinking about driving my car off a bridge near by
