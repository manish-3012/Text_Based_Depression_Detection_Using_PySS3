I want to die to kill the painâ€œI want to die to kill the pain
Silence the words inside my head
Sometimes I feel life has no gain
Feels like I am already deadâ€
........
I dont feel beautiful 
My husband left me and our daughters packed up and moved to Georgia leaving us stranded and broke. 
Every man Iâ€™ve ever loved has brutally hurt me emotionally or physically. 
I want to see the sun, and feel happy for another day. I want to be strong for my children. But Iâ€™m too busy side eyeing people around me. As if Iâ€™m in the twighlight Zone, non trusting, even my best friend looks as if she harbors resentment towards me.  The other day Two of her husbands friends were there. They both proceeded to hit on me as she looked on not at all happy. Sheâ€™s married why should it matter to her who Likes me anyway..... 
Meanwhile I was too dead inside to give a shit.  I didnâ€™t respond to the coworkers, Iâ€™ve turned down dates to the movies, dinner, what the hell wrong with me. Iâ€™m not stuck up. I give everything to anyone around me. Iâ€™m the wife that learns his muscles in order to rub them better, learns his favorite foods to cook them, Iâ€™m the friend that is on speed dial whenever/wherever, the photographer and video editor for every gathering, the decorator, the main chef, the shoulder to cry on, the battery if energy is needed, Iâ€™m the idiot holding up the neon sign at graduation 
The one who goes a little nuts just for the ones I love. 
Well,..none of that shit matters 
My husband left me in debt with bills and I may soon be homeless. I need to do something 
Iâ€™m drowning in this depression.  
I turn to music and writing my passions but they arenâ€™t helping.  Here I am sick with a some crazy flu, the one who cares for everyone and Iâ€™m sitting here so completely alone. Why do I bother to breathe another day.
