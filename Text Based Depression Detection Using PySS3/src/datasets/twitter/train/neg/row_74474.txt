I'm really upset.I just fucking relapsed from cutting. I was 1 and Â½ years going strong. Shit, everything's been so hard lately and I just wanna take a fucking knife to my throat. No one seems to give a shit and my counselors only make it worse. The stupid fucking pills don't work and no one in my life gives a fuck. I'm so fucking ready to down my Prozac, maybe that'll kill me. I'm sure my family would forget, they already forget I'm there as is. So what's the change? It doesn't matter what I fucking do I'm always a fucking mistake.
