I've lost hopeI'm an embarrassment to my parents I have failed time and time again my mom told me she doesn't even want her worst enemy to have a son like me,
 My life is a joke my depression is a joke I have been loveless and lonely my entire 21 years of life I'm gonna Kms soon, hopefully If I get a job I can become independent.
