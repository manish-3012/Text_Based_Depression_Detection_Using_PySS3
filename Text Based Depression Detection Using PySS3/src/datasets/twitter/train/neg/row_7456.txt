Can't do anything right, unemployed, broke, it's all down hill from hereI'm unemployed and on my last $30, my car insurance runs out in a few weeks and I've already asked my family for all the help they can give. I should just face that I'm a fuck up and there's really no way I can turn it around. I'm 25 and feel like the biggest fucking idiot that ever was. I just want to die. I can't do anything right, I don't know how to talk to people without sounding pathetic and stupid, I always have this feeling that everyone's laughing at me. Fuck living. I wanted to be more than a retail employee, now I'll be lucky to get a part-time at any place. The shitty part of that is, that even if I get employed, it won't be enough money to pay for all the things that need paying. One way or another I'm going to be fucked by a collection agency or insurance company or just the law. I'm fucked, but I'll be even more fucked if I'm just going to sit around and wait for it. 

I've struggled with absent or distant parents, no social life to speak of, depression, anxiety, and I'm just sick of it. It feels like the best I can hope for at this point is retiring as a Denny's shift manager. I'd rather die now instead of having a shitty life and dying even more disappointed than I am now. Surely living is the best proof that there is no God.
