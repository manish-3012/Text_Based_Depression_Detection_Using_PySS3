I don't know how to help my sister anymoreThe relationship between my sister and her boyfriend of 8 years ended last August. Ever since then she has been very depressed, and its been getting worse over time. Its not about him anymore though.

She has lost all faith in herself and her decisions. She doesn't trust herself anymore. She used to know exactly who she is and what she stood for. There is nothing of that person left. Nothing at all, and I donâ€™t know how to fix it. I donâ€™t know how to help her. 

She has lost faith in humanity and in the world, she seems to be worrying about the course the universe has taken and how awful people can be. She had some thoughts like that before, worrying about nature and the environment. She is a very earth bound person, but it has never been like this. 

She has always distrusted councellors and psychiatrists and wonâ€™t go to see one. I really really think she needs to though. She is falling apart, hear heart breaking more and more every day. Its not even about the boy anymore, its about her. She is a shell of the person she used to be filled with pain and doubt. 

I donâ€™t  think she will kill herself, but Iâ€™m so worried for her. She doesnâ€™t really have anyone to talk to, apart from me, and I live in a different country. We talk on the phone quite often, and most times she breaks down and cries. But its not just cries, they are sobs and I can hear her heart breaking more and more each time. They are sobs of complete and utter desperation. Desperation so bad that is actually manifests in physical pain. 

I donâ€™t know how to fix this, I donâ€™t know how to help her. Please, Reddit, I need advice.
