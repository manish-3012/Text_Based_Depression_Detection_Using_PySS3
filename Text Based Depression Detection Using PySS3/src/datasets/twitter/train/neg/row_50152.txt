I want to do somethingWhy do i still feel stuck in life? I really cant wrap my head around this. This goddamn world. It really feels like my "soul" is sucked out of me. Every time i've tried something within my reach to do about my situation, it really just feels like im getting nowhere. Money, relationships, fame, family, accomplishments or whatever doesnt matter at all, if your constant state of being is affected by something you dont know. Ive not yet confirmed if i have a mental disorder. But why does that even matter at all? I want to feel alive again. :(
