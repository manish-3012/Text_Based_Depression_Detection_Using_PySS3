I'm a trash person, a failure of human beingI did so many bad things theres no way to redeem it anymore. No matter how many good things I will do in future, there will be a blank feeling that Im inferior to others. Ive been a trash being ever since my birth. If I had sharp knifes I would self harm myself.
