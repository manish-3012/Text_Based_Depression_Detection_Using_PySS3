I fucked it this time boysTelling people close to you is supposed to make you feel better, apparently. 

Blatantly false. Anyone who tells you this is a liar. 

Admitted to my father the way I feel about everything. Now he has me by the bollocks and is demanding that I get treatment, and provide him with evidence of having made an appointment tomorrow. If I don't, he tells the rest of the family and then I'm really fucked. 

I am without a doubt the stupidest man alive. Kept the secret safe for eight years and for some reason decided to let it slip to THE ONE PERSON that was most dangerous to tell. What the fuck is wrong with me? 

Honestly want to just head out back, stab him to death, then do myself in too. Fucking had it.
