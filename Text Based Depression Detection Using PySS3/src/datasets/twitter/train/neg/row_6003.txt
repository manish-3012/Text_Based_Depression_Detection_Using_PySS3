just tireditâ€™s so tiring. all the time. every time i feel like iâ€™ve solved a problem a new one appears. i canâ€™t do this. i feel so pressured to work hard but whatâ€™s really the point? does anything even matter if iâ€™m just going to die? why can i not just give up? every day is the same shit over and over again and iâ€™m so tired.
