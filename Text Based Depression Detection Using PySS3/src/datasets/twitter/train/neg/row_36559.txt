I tried to kill myself last night. I'm still alive, I'm not sure how I feel.I went down the beach last night for several hours in the wind and rain, took a hip flask full of rum, got drunk and cut myself, not overly deep, just a lot of times, but it felt relaxing watching blood flow down my arm in the rain. Just standing shallowly in the waves felt really relaxing too. I was hoping it would just carry me away. I couldn't there though as people came along to nightfish.

I got home in the early hours feeling as if I was going to pass out as I'd lost quite a lot of blood at this point. Completely stained one of my only white tshirts. I did the arm above head thing that someone told me on Reddit last week to stop the bleeding. I sat there on my bed just feeling numb for about an hour. Then I drank some more and took a handful of xanax, hoping it would kill me. I sat there for about 15 minutes listening to 'Only' by Anthrax. Suddenly I threw up. I guess my stomach couldn't handle all the pills and alchohol. I don't know how I feel. I was really hoping that everything would just end last night. I still feel shit about everything.
