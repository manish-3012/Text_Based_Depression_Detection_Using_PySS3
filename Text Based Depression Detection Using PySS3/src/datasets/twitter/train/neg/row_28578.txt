Itâ€™s the day before Thanksgiving...And I feel like shit. I tried to take advantage of some early Black Friday deals and cure my sadness with retail therapy, but all I really want is to walk outside my house and get a bullet to the head. Or a streetlight falls on me, or something that very very quickly crushes me to death. Basically I want a death thatâ€™s not caused by me. And yes of course I feel like shit wishing for this when thereâ€™s other people who are dying and only want NOT to die.

Itâ€™s hard living every day and faking so many happy, content emotions when I know the world is gaining nothing from my presence. I could completely disappear and it would be fine and i would be fine with it too. Iâ€™m tired :/
