I can't get over self-pityHow do I get over my self-pity and regain my friendship (there wasn't a friendship to begin with)?

Yesterday, my only friend told that all I talk about is my self-pity. I don't think I can save this friendship. I don't know how many times I've cried in the last 24 hours. Please help

I don't want to feel this anymore. The only person I love in this world doesn't feel the same for me. I want to get better but I have no one here to help me. I have no one left in this world. She left me because I was too sad and negative and I wan't fun to be around. She is tired of hearing my problems. She is the only person I love and the only person I want. I'm so pathetic.

I wasted this personal day for nothing. Did nothing productive. There is no future for me and the present is shit. I want to get better but shes not there to help. I'm just too negative.
