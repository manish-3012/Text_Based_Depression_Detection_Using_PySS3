I'm not in a 'dark place'. I'm in a moment of clarity.I'm not mentally ill. This world is hopelessly backwards. I'm suicidal because I'm trying to be sane in an insane situation. I'm trying to love hateful people. I'm trying to find joy in sorrow. I'm trying to make unhappy people happy. I care too much about what naturally negative people think of me. Suicide is the most rational response I can think of to this life.
