So overwhelmedIâ€™m so overwhelmed. Work is nuts, chronic health issues, precancerous issues, money is tight, lonely, fat, people around me are sick, I just canâ€™t find a place I am happy. If it wasnâ€™t for my kids I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™d be here. Life is just so damn exhausting. I donâ€™t have anyone I can say this too and need a place to vent...
