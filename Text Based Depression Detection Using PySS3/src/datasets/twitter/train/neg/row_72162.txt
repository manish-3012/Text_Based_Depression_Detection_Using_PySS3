When you need someone but noone is thereI guess its ok and I accept that Im worthless but at least dont tell me or publicly announce that you care/want to hear/is there, especially if you work in psychology department. I became so different and alien that I can spot language scripts in life. People always say these symbolic sentences but their meaning is always different and never literal. I finally understand how aspergers must feel. I will rejoice with this new found knowledge and enjoy being even more miserable.

tbh I dont enjoy life, never had, never will. I wish I could disappear. Its just a matter of time until suicide. I just dont know when or where. Someone please sent me a gun as its illegal to even buy that here.
