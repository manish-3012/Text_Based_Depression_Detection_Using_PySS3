I donâ€™t want to live in this world.I know I have â€˜Covid fatigueâ€™ I work in healthcare and thatâ€™s not even what is making me fatigued.

Itâ€™s the way the world has changed. How people snitch on each other for not wearing a mask, how fights break out over it. The constant lining up and having to wear face coverings and the constant news stories that are baiting. It reminds me of The Handmaids Tale. 
The thing that set me off today and really really made me realize I canâ€™t go on in this world is that no one can have an opinion anymore. The minute you express your opinion that is different from the mainstream, you are â€˜cancelledâ€™ and end up losing your job and livelihood. Because of an opinion.
My marriage is a roommate situation where I listen to everything he says and he listens to exactly zero. I feel hopeless and alone. Iâ€™ve been letting all my feelings and frustration fester inside me, doing more and more drugs to try and damper the feelings, thinking it would just pass when this lockdown passed. But things are still the same and I canâ€™t push my feelings down anymore but I have no one to talk to who would actually listen. Im in love with another man who does listen but he is married too and we rarely see each other and Iâ€™m just over it. 
Tell me this is going to end one way or another
