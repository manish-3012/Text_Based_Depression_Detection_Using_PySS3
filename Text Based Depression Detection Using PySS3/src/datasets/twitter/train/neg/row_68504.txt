I feel so guilty, any perspective you can offer?I'm tired.

I've been battling a pretty gnarly illness for over a year now. Life savings spent, untold thousands of parents' money spent to no avail whatsoever. Quality of life destroyed, all my dreams gone, drifting friends, no hope. It's entirely plausible my illness would correct itself eventually, but seeing the severity of my case makes me doubt. More significantly, even if it does, I don't feel like waiting around for years based on how physically and mentally excruciating the past year has been.

I obviously feel guilty that I plan to leave behind my parents. I have a hunch that my mom will be destroyed by my death.

And yet I feel more guilt over my internal feelings of my situation. For the years prior I worked through depression, anorexia, and all sorts of other interpersonal and personal problems. I finally was about to reach the place where all my hard work would finally pay off. Not to mention I had been extremely successful in school, athletics, extracurriculars, activism - I finally made my life and took full advantage of it. But then illness stole it all. For a while I tried to live as best I could, but it didn't matter as I regressed continuously despite all sorts of treatments and my best efforts.

I feel fundamentally cheated. I'm so angry and sad. And I feel guilty for being so immature and unable to accept this new life. I don't want this life. I hate the near constant pain and other hardships. I hate that I worked so hard for years and it didn't mean anything. Other people have it worse after all. Why can't I just move on and live? I feel bad for wanting to die so much.
