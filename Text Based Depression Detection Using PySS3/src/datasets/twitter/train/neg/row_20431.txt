My pessimism keeps on getting worse.I'm just a kid in high school without friends and a lot of stress thanks to overlydemanding parents. Nothing is fun and exciting anymore and I can't feel things anymore. I'm also basically invisible in school. But the worst thing is i'm very pessimistic about my future. I want to think it will get better but i know it won't. I will end up being a worthless pile of shit living in the streets doing drugs.
