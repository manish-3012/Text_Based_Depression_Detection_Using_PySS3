Iâ€™m going blind and I want to be euthanised!Iâ€™m 25 and my life has been terrible, now Iâ€™m losing my sight and it seems the horror never ends. I want to die but the country I live in euthanasia isnâ€™t legal. I feel completely trapped, like nobody cares and nobody is willing to help me escape this pain and suffering. Why is life so cruel, why are people so dumb. Anyone in my position would want to die. I am so afraid and so petrified that Iâ€™ll have to live the rest of my life in darkness.
