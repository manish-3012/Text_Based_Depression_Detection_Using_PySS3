I don't know what to do.I'm in the process of trying to win my wife back after she left me for another guy. I know they're being intimate and being together while I just lay in my bed wanting it all to end. Ive gotten insomnia. Took a shower for the first time in 5 days. Don't eat anything all day because my stomach is in knots. I know people would be disappointed and sad if I ended my life or I even made it look like a non suicide they'd still miss me. But I don't know. The pain is getting so big. I wish I could die of heartbreak or something else. I just want to die or get into a car crash. I want to od or cut myself or stick a gun to my head. I'm losing hope for myself..
