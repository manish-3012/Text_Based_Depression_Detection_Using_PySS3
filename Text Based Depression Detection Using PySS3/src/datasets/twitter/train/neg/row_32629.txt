Haven't left the house in monthsI pretty much only leave my room for class and the occasional food item. 

I don't really have anywhere to go with my life, most likely will continue cascading into a series of failures until im finally deemed a useless hack by all those who know me if they don't already think of me as such. 

The only thing in my mind right now is looking for the right moment and method so my body gets found in somewhat of a decent state once im through with things.
