I just need to leave.Earlier this month my mom died, and my dad is just lonely.

I was expelled from school.

I just got out of jail for trying to buy a gun.

I have nothing to do but sit at home and smoke weed.

Im addicted to nicotene.

My aunt who was like my mother also died from cancer earlier this year.

I dont even have the motivation to make a sandwhich or a drink so i have my poor grandmother to do everything for me

&amp;#x200B;

I am diagnosed with anxiety, and panic disorder. Im on zolaft. Does zolaft cause suicidal thoughts and depression?

I dont know why im writing this but something told me to.

I feel like im a burden on my grandmother.

All she does is do good for me, and im thankful for that but for some reason  im disrespectful to her and it just happens and i feel horrible about it.

I need help before i do something stupid.

Please.
