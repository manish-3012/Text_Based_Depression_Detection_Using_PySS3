What am I looking for?I really don't know where else to turn.  I have had depression since I was in high school.  It all started about 11 years ago.  I tried "ending" things and was placed in a hospital for my own safety.

Fast forward 11 years later and I still feel the same.  I have a respectable job where I'm work my ass off daily and am not acknowledged for my 10 hour days.  A great majority of my friends have now moved away for either the military or work.  

My gf and I split about 4 months ago.  She kept the apartment and I was forced to move back in with my parents.  I will have to stay with my parents while I pay off the debt I allowed my ex to run up on my credit cards (about 2000).  So between paying that off and saving up for a new apartment I will be there about 4 more months.

If I knew it wouldn't devastate my father I would have ended everything months ago.  I don't want to continue on though.  This week has been extremely tough.  Each day being longer than the previous.  Ive tried numerous medications over the past 11 years and I haven't found anything that works.  I'm hoping SW will have some advice for me.  I know there isn't a miracle cure but I'm hoping something will help at least.
