Never say that killing yourself is â€œSelfishâ€I just saw a post of OP saying they were going to commit suicide. I saw a person reply that it was â€œSelfishâ€ that they were going to pass on their pain to others.

This is something that will make the suicidal person feel worse. Itâ€™s unethical to ever say or think this.
