I donâ€™t know how to feelIâ€™m back :/ Iâ€™ve been feeling O.K so far. But now I have no money for a new place - I wanna buy a car and maybe live in it for a while. Idk. Like I started packing my things but I have until the 20th to decide wether itâ€™s for moving it into a car or because Iâ€™ll jump. I just feel numb now. Like I donâ€™t have a job. I need to leave by the 20th. The car probably wonâ€™t be available unless I shit out 2k. Or sleep with old men for money. I canâ€™t leave my room. Itâ€™s a mess. Should I pack my clothes or throw them out? Iâ€™m just ranting but I just feel so lost. I thought I had control and I knew what I wanted but now I donâ€™t. I lost everything. And I hate it. I hate myself I canâ€™t do anything I just live for other people and now that Iâ€™m making a decision to have something I donâ€™t have anything for it. What the point then? Iâ€™m just waiting it out anyway. Iâ€™m too pussy to do it right now so Iâ€™m waiting until Iâ€™m pushed against a wall and have nothing. Which makes no difference honestly - living in a car would be shit . It wouldnâ€™t help me. Maybe keeping me under water.
