I just want to dieEver since January, I've been feeling depressed and suicidal because I'm being bullied for having Aspergers Syndrome, I've been told that I'm a worthless monster, and that I don't deserve to be with society, yet I've never hurt anyone. I don't know what to do any more, I think suicide is an option since I've been treated unequally very often, and I feel like it never ends, it's a downward spiral.
