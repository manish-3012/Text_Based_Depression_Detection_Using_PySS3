I'm convinced my life is worthlessI've decided my life isn't worth anything. I have nothing to live for. No goals, no dreams, no happiness, no love. I have no reason to wake up anymore. I'm just an empty shell of a person.

I'm out here 2100 miles from home and the fact that nobody misses me or even realizes I'm not there is really getting to me. The whole time I've been going through the mountains the last couple days I've been looking over the edge thinking that going over the edge would be less painful than continuing to live.

All I've ever wanted from life is to have someone to love, someone to always be there, someone to hold every night. Nothing else seems like a worthwhile reason to keep living, but that seems to be what's furthest from my reach. Even all my "friends" won't hang out with me. Every one of them says "I'll call you to hangout sometime" and then they never talk to me again. I'm just ignored and forgotten by everyone.

With each passing day I feel myself losing my grip on my last shred of sanity. With no end in sight, one of these days I'm just gonna break down and end it.
