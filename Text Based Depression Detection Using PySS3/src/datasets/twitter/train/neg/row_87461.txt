Reading through this I felt stupid.I don't even know if I should post here cause I'm a wimp so I'll probably not have the guts to go through with it, wish I was braver. But I feel like everyone will be better off without me. Everytime I think through the events of what would happen without me, everyone ends up happier. My partner told me an hour ago that he can't take this anymore, he dreads coming home everyday. Because of me, because of my pouting and whining and me constantly bringing up my vagina lol. Nothing returned to normal after giving birth and I feel like I'm not good enough anymore, like no one will ever like me again. And I fall apart everyday because I'm not ok, and I'll never be ok again. My baby deserves a life without a parent who breaksdown everyday for selfish reasons. And here I am stuck at home cause I gave up a job offer for keeping him when I fell pregnant, and I didn't manage to get a job while pregnant. So I'm here contributing nothing to the household, just being a burden to everyone, and everyone would end up happier without me. I can't get a job cause the baby isn't in daycare, and I can't afford daycare cause I dint have a job, and there is no help to get, I've tried. My partner is the one who wanted kids, I didn't, so he will still have his baby, my baby will grow up happier without a mom, then a mom who is depressed and breaksdown and would probably unintentionally bring him down too. I have no friends, and I'm not close to anyone. My family would probably mourn for a little while, but it would be like I never existed shortly after.
