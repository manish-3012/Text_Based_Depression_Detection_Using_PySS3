I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing anymoreI got married when I was 18. He was 31. He became physically abusive as well as mentally. Fast forward to age 22. I divorced him. But I wasnâ€™t okay. Iâ€™m bipolar type 1. I also have borderline, anxiety &amp; and eating disorder. I began drinking heavily and abusing pills. 5 months after the divorce, I remarried the SAME man. This time, things were different... for awhile. I got pregnant, gave birth to my pride and joy, my beautiful daughter who I adore more than anything, but now his mental abuse has started again. But what if heâ€™s right? Maybe I am a worthless piece of shit. Maybe I am a waste. I want to die. But Iâ€™m trying to hold it together. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can. I want to die so badly. I donâ€™t want to leave my baby with that monster, but I donâ€™t want to live either. Dear God, please help me. Please.
