I used to be depressed but then I got better but today I had a shit day.Hey guys. In mid January I was able to overcome my depression which helped me alot, but today I had a shit day and it seems like the depression is somewhat coming back. In school things have been better than what they were a few months ago. I was so depressed that I couldn't consentrate on my school work and was in danger of flunking. After talking to my parents and a few of my friends about it, I got some help. Later on I became better and more like myself. It's been great after I got better and acutally liked talking to people, but today just made my happines drop like a stone. I don't know what it was but it felt like everyone was my enemy (how I felt when I had depression). I started not feeling like a happy guy and felt more like the begining of August when the depression started. I was just wondering if this is normal for depression come back for a few days or if it has happend to anybody else. I'm actually pretty scared of it coming back since I'm doing great in school right now and I don't want to flunk. Thanks.
