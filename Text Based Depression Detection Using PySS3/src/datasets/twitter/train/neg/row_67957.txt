The "It Gets Better" FallacyOften times when one learns of a friend's depression or suicidal tendencies, the first thing to come out of his/her mouth is "it gets better," meaning that while life may appear difficult in the present, it will get easier as time goes on.  This phrase is often uttered before the individual speaking it has a complete understanding of the depressed/suicidal person's current situation or beliefs.  The truth is that in many cases, life doesn't get any easier, but this statement is used in a vain attempt to try and help the person without putting in any real effort.  The number of times I've heard the aforementioned phrase is immense, but in my personal experience, it is simply untrue.  I am not claiming that everyone who is depressed or suicidal will continue being so, but rather expressing that in my particular scenario, my life has not gotten any better in the past decade and does not appear to do so anytime in the foreseeable future.  Now, if my life is most likely not going to improve, why continue living it?  I go into further detail in my previous post on this subreddit in regards to my personal views on suicide here: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2zvlad/a_numerical_model_for_mood/ .  I see no reason to continue as I am if life itself is a net negative for me.  I would like to hear others' opinions on anything I have discussed above or in my previous posts.
