I just can't deal with lifeWhy do I have to be the most messed up child in my family? I can't *just* have depression, I can't *just* self-harm, I can't *just* have self-esteem issues, I can't *just* have an eating disorder, I can't *just* hate myself. No, I have to be so mentally fucked up to have those all - yet I have no reason to complain. I'm the poster child of my family, the "most gifted" of all the children... Yet I never perform well enough to impress anyone; I always feel average at best.

What is so wrong with me that I still feel guilt for breaking up with an abusive ex? I suppose the flip side is that he's probably having a better life now.

I don't even know if I'm suicidal; my inherent fear of failure makes me never want to try again considering I fucked up so royally the last attempt. I don't even know if I want any help... I just know that if I didn't try, it'd be even more pathetic than I currently am. I'm too selfish to cure myself, yet not selfish enough to cause the pain of suicide to my family. Not least of all my parents, as they deserve none of the guilt. It's not their fault I'm broken.

Why can't I just enjoy the life I've got? It's not even bad. I have a family with strong foundations, the best boyfriend in the world, a place at a good university studying a subject I love. Through this all, though, I wish I could just disappear into nothing. Somebody else deserves the kindness and love I've been so lucky to experience more than I do.
