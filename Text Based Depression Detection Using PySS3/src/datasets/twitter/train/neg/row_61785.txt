Moved away from my home town and I want to go back. I feel trapped and have urge to self harm.I moved away from my home town with my girlfriend. I want to move back but she doesn't. So now I am just so stressed, panicking. She's treating me badly because she's angry I want to move back because she likes where we live now. But my mental health is really bad. Every day I am fighting the urge to self harm or kill myself. I don't know what to do. I wish I could kill myself and not upset anyone.
