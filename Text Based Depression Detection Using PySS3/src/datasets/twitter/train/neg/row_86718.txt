A reddit friend is believed to have committed suicidehttps://www.reddit.com/r/PunGulag/comments/bzxgi0/a_man_wanders_through_the_corridors_of_an/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

Scroll to the bottom of the post, itâ€™s poorly worded but it makes me think he may have killed himself

This is Redditâ€™s law enforcement guidelines. 

All of this info is what reddit said I should put here in this scenario. I contacted him over reddit and there was no reply so Iâ€™m worried. Looking through his post history I found references to Liverpool and Brighton, hope that helps.

If you live in the UK please get this to law enforcement so they can find him
