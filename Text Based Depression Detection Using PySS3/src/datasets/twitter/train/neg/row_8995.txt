My parents would still feel fully justified even if they were to see my corpse lying before them.I don't want suicide to be this oh so sensational thing. I just want a backdoor. A quick way out. I don't want to find the commitment and the balls it would take.

Nobody fucking cares. I made it clear that I was upset with something my father had done, and broke down crying. Consolation from my mother, for what seemed to last no longer than a minute, was immediately followed by backing up what my father had already done. The consolation was fake, and I matter fuckall to them except as a product that society can praise them for, should it turn out well. Now I have two people constantly pestering me, people that care for nothing but the prospect of "having been good parents", and for society to appreciate them for the good job they will have done.

Life is currently a deadend. It's either this for at least the next two years, or a peaceful way out, forever. And the latter is getting more tempting by the minute. 

I have dreams for my future and a whole life ahead. I would have said the same even ten minutes ago.

I find peace and solace in writing to this sub, but I know nothing at all will be different the moment I close this app, and after.

Please respond for all that it's worth. It would mean the world to me.
