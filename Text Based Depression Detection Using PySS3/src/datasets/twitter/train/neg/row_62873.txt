University police paid me a surprise visit tonight after receiving a tip that I've been wanting to kill myself.Had the university police show up on my doorstep this night after receiving an anonymous tip that I've been wanting to kill myself.  Found out it was my roommate who we were talking about this a couple of days ago (he's known I've been feeling suicidal for months now).  

Scared the absolute shit out of me.  I was studying and heard a knock at the door.  Thought nothing of it (honestly thought my roommate had an armful of groceries or something and needed help opening the door).  When I answered, two police officers were standing outside and wanted to talk to me.  Cue the panic.  I began to wonder if I did anything wrong and when one of the officers asked me if I was thinking about harming myself, I froze.  How the hell was this happening!?  How the hell did these guys know about me!?  I originally said no I wasn't and that the entire thing must have been a mistake.  They left and then the shit hit the fan.  **Someone else knows about me...AND CALLED THE POLICE ABOUT IT**

I started trying to figure out who sent in the tip and immediately thought of my roommate, since we had discussed this stuff a couple of days ago.  Turns out it was him.  I don't blame him for what he did now - he was just looking out for me.  Had no idea how to handle what I was saying and did the best thing he could which was seek outside help (which I was reluctant to do so).  But I really thought we had a trust thing going.  My god I was so angry and upset.  I still kind of am.  How could he betray me that way.  This is sensitive information and I said I didn't want to involve anyone; this is my own problem to solve.  I said I didn't blame him or hate him which I don't.  I just do not want anyone else to know that I feel this way (my parents, my teachers at school, my friends, anyone I know).  I'm *so scared* of what will happen if anyone finds out.  That **CANNOT** happen as long as I can prevent it.  I have to keep this facade going.  Be a man and tough it out.

Thankfully when I found out it was him and we talked and talked about what to do, I eventually agreed to call back (well, he called them - I was hyperventilating) the officers who came to the door earlier in the night.  Deep down I felt it was the best decision (plus, I just lied to their faces).  Then I talked with the police officers and on-call university counselor and set up an appointment to go tomorrow and discuss what to do.  I feel so forced into this entire thing; I have no choice but to comply.  But honestly I think I've been dodging this bullet for far too long.  I'm not religious by any means, but maybe this is a sign saying that I'm of value and that it's time I try and do something about these feelings I've had.
