I'm so sick of this.I have OCD. All the time, constantly, I have a fear of not being normal. It cycles between having aspergers, being a pedophile, having schizophrenia, having done something truly awful in my past I've just forgotten about, being a rapist, murdering my family, incest and so much more. I can't live with the constant anxiety these thoughts give me. I think about the weird shit I've done in the past, and memories that confirm some of my thoughts have come up. I just want a normal life, and if I cannot have that, I don't want a life anymore.
