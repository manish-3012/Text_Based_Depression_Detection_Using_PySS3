Advice?Just looking for some advice on the best way to go about things. Not sure where else to ask. Iâ€™ve decided to go ahead with ending things but Iâ€™m not sure if I should tell anyone before I do it or just leave a note? My ideal situation would be a conversation where I can explain why Iâ€™m doing it rationally and without drama and for them to listen and understand my reasons. In reality I know that they would probably just try to talk me out of it or call the police. Iâ€™ve been very careful to never show any signs of suicidal thoughts to anyone and I know that I come across as a happy guy to everyone that knows me, so this will be a shock when it happens (and I want it to happen soon), I just donâ€™t want all of the aftermath, confusion and sadness etc for my friends and family. I used to say that Iâ€™d wait until I was older, maybe in my 40s or something and it wouldnâ€™t be that big of a deal (at this point, I canâ€™t wait that long) or maybe I could make it look non suicidal, like an accident or a fall? I dunno lol.

Any advice would be helpful, just please donâ€™t tell me to speak to someone or look for help etc etc, I really donâ€™t want to hear it, this isnâ€™t intended to be a cry for help or attention, I just want the advice. Cheers.
