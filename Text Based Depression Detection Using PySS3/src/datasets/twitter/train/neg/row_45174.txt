suicide attempt?recently i was feeling suicidal and i cut 12 horizontal lines on the underneath of my arm over a vein (idk what itâ€™s called or if itâ€™s something other than a vein but itâ€™s blue and very visible) deeper than i had ever cut on my wrist before. like they were all deepish styro and have left way darker scars than the other cuts on my wrist did. i cut along the vein hoping to hit something. wanting to hit something. but of course i didnâ€™t because iâ€™m a pussy and the tool i was using didnâ€™t work well. 

did that count as a suicide attempt? every time i look at those scars i think of it. i wish it was and i wish i did hit something important that night but at the same time i feel like it doesnâ€™t count as an attempt because if i really wanted to do damage then i would have tried harder. what do you guys think? 

iâ€™m asking as iâ€™m thinking about talking to someone about things and i want to know what to say if they ask.
