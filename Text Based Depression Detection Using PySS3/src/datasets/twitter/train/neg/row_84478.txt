13 reasons why...Second season came out today. Thoughts?

I'm not an expert, I only have experience being suicidal(cant put that on a resume).

The first season quite frankly made me more suicidal than before. I wanted revenge. Have people mourn their loss of my existence.

Second season comes around... I like it more for the most part. ((Spoiler)) I wanted Alex's attempt to be more graphic than Hannah's. The one thing that often keeps me going is the scare of failing an attempt, and how much it hurts other people. I wanted more of an emphasis on that.
