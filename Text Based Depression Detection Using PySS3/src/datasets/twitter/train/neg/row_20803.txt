Everymorning by noonEvery morning by noon I feel like killing myself.  I've been finding ways to not do it...

One was my dog, I bought a huge yard and tiny home on a bunch of land so she could roam free, her happiness became a reason to live.   On one of our walks a tick bit her.  She was the one in 200 that it Attacks kidneys first, and long story short and many thousands later I held her in my arms while we euthanized her at the vet.  

There is so so so much more but I'm shaking to hard to continue.  I'll be back I hope.
