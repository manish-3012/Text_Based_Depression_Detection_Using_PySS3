Want to die, but dont want my family to think its their faultHey everyone, for the past 2 years now, Ive been thinking and planning different ways to end it all, From a gun shot to painless sleep. Hell even one week when i was alone, I put a knife to my throat and pressed it hard enough for blood to come out a little but stopped due to my dog coming to me. 

Idk, i just feel tired of everything, im always there helping others, giving them an ear and place to vent, but every time i want to vent or need someone to talk to, they never care. Last time i talked to my parents about this, my dad told me to stop being a bitch and my mom made it all about herself.

Everyday i wake up and become sad knowing i didnt die in my sleep. Everything i once enjoyed stopped giving me pleasure, Nothing i do anymore means anything to me. Never went to college cause i didnt know what i wanted to do also no money for it. When i think i found out what i wanna do it life, i tell myself dont bother, ur gonna be shit at all and fail. whats worse is i have 0 IRL friends, Social anxiety is a bitch man, let me tell you. 

I talked to my doctor a while ago and hes been giving me pills, which are Zoloft at 150 and Wellbutrin at 150, i stopped taking them cause the they stopped working after a week so whats the point ay? maybe i should keep going up and up on my dosage but  they will fade away after a week the same as always. 

Anyways, To sum it all up, Ive been wanting to die for a while now, Ive come to the conclusion that i want to end it painlessly. If i didnt have a family i would've already ended everything. 

But yea, idk what else to do anymore. Maybe ill end it all once i move out far away and just disappear. Who knows.  Just wanted vent some stuff thats been going on in my head.
