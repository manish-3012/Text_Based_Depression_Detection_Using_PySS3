failed MEPSi failed the drug test for the army despite being clean for 2 months and smoked cbd once a month from my drug test date. i was pretty suicidal before enlisting. i was hoping enlisting would give me a sense of purpose. now that i have failed i see no other career that will be worth while. i really wanted my ticket out of my shitty life in hope of moving on and being with a team. a sense of real family. it's been a year and half. now i'm stuck in my parents house. typical hometown kid. i have been thinking about the outcome of me becoming a solider. knowing i will never be one makes me very suicidal. i smoke a lot of dope before talking to recruiters. and they told me to go cold and i did. smoking weed was the only way i could be "happy". so i stopped in hope of being happy with a purpose. i really want to die today there is nothing for me to do. i think i might do it on halloween. I'm stuck in a hole and there is no friends and no family. i'm worthless.I AM A USELESS PEICE OF SHIT. I AM GARBAGE. the worse thing is in high high school everyone thought i was going to go to the army. now when they see me and shit i feel embarrassed and disappointed in myself. i feel like a waste of space right now. there is literally nothing else i wanted be but in the army.
