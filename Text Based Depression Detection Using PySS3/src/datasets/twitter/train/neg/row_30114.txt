I'm backI thought i was done here but looks like im back. A while ago i used to post a lot here maybe once everyday cuz im an attention whore piece of trash. I started to feel a little better so i stopped but im feeling like shit again. I'm unsure about suicide, it would be so easy and i wouldn't ever have to feel like shit again and maybe someone would give a shit about me then, but i've been conditioned by therapy to not do it and i would feel bad about my family. Honestly i don't even know why im writing this.
