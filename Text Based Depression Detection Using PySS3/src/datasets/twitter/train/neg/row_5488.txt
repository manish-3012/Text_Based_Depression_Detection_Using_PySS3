Canâ€™t deal with it any moreI have personally had problems with depression and anxiety for about 4 years now and I thought I had got over them about a year ago. I recently started a 6 week field course in another country that I have to do for my university studies and throughout the problems have gotten progressively worse to the point where I am now very suicidal, after being given work that the uni didnâ€™t check the difficulty of and yet expected me to get on with. About a week ago I contacted the university to see if I could come home because the problems are so bad and they said I have to stay or else I fail my degree. I have stayed on around a week now and the depression and anxiety have progressed from terrible to unbearable and I canâ€™t go on. I have started making plans to end my life on my way home at a stop off between where I am and home at a hotel because I have failed to do anything and my family probably wonâ€™t support me, nor my uni, if I ask to repeat the year/ fieldwork. I have failed at everything I have ever set out to do and I canâ€™t deal with any more problems. Does anyone have any advice as to what I should do to stop feeling like this and making these plans.
