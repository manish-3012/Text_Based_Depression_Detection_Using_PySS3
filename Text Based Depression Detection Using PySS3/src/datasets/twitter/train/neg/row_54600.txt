It's all my fault.Everything horrible in my life is my fault.
Everything horrible in other peoples lifes is my fault.

I don't want to ruin things anymore, I don't want to suffer anymore.
I pushed away all my friends just so my death won't leave an impact on them, I made them hate me and yet I still couldn't kill myself.

Now that Summer Holiday is here, I'll do it.
This loneliness is crushing me, it feels horrible.
Now that I know that no one is gonna care about my passing I can do it, I can rid myself of this pain that I caused.

I should have pretended that I was okay, I shouldn't have made them hate me. But it's all out of my control now.
At least they won't get sad about it. And that's okay.
