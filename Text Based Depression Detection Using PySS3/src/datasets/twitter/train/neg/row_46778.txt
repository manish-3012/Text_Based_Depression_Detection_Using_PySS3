Thank you! Thank you for everythingHey its me again and I just want to say thanks to all the people who replied to my last post! Everyone who replied gave me so much strenght and I never thought that so much people would take their time to read my story. Just because of you I had the strenght to finally talk to my mom after all these years. We talked over 4 hours and I said her everything I wanted to said her for such a long time. The wish to die is still the biggest thing in my head but I decided that I really need help. But not only for me... My mom told me that she talked one more time to my dad ( about 4 years ago ) and that my dad has a little kid with another women. I don't know how I should think about it but the fact is I have a 4 year old brother. Even though I've never meet him and I don't think he knews that I exicst I want to be there for him. I know my dad and I dont want that my little brother needs to go through all the pain I had to go through. So now I'm packing my clothes ready to go to a locked psychiatric because I know that I won't have the strenght to do it alone. So again... Thank you... thank you so much. You saved my life!
