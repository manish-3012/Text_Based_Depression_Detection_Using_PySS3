I kind of beggining to feel like I should kill myselfI am a 30 year old virgin. The culture I was brought up in and my mom especially made sex and relationships heavily taboo. I actually don't even know how to act around people and especially women. 

I don't get any of the informal signals nothing. I just wing it, and come across as creepy and desperate. I used to think it was me being fat and ugly holding me back. I have lost over 40 pounds from 200 to 150s and have muscle and am in great shape. 

Also to mention I'm a brown dude in a white city but even the brown girls seem to spurn my looks and advances. I have no friends, the only person I talk to regularly apart from fake interactions with coworkers is my brother.

I am beggining to feel like the Rheseus monkeys that are socially dysfunctional from Harlow's experiments. I act on the wrong cues, based on the fact that I already have a stereotypical disadvantage to begin with being a different color, then add to that social ackwardness and its a recipe for disaster. Just like the monkeys I fight when I shouldn't, I approach when I should act indifferent, and these are picked up by people and I get socially excluded. Then begins a vicious cycle where this long term loneliness creates further stress and inconfidence and makes the small chance of getting somewhere seem all the more unlikely.

At this point the suffering that I feel is genuine and real. I feel a natural urge to connect with people and to try to meet women. However instead of a simple no or lack of interest, most people begin to dislike me as they take my social ackwardness as a sign of malice.

At this point in my life I feel these problems are too ingrained to change and I really want to look for some long term solution.
