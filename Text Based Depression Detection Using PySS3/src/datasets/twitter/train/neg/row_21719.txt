I feel like I'm at the end of my ropeI'm middle aged, no degree, working a dead-end contract job that ends in December. I'm freshly divorced, and living with my girlfriend, but I feel like I'm just pushing her away all the time. 

I'm anxious and depressed all the time. It seems like I don't have good days anymore, some just suck less than others. My girlfriend has been talking about buying a house, and I couldn't stop myself from saying that I didn't want to get stuck here. That I didn't want to raise a kid here, and I don't want to be 1500 miles away from my family for the rest of my life. Her family is here, and her kid is going to graduate high school in a couple years. She doesn't want to go anywhere. 

So all this starting making me think about how if I can't make this relationship work, the alternatives are too much for me to bare. That I'll be penniless and homeless, with no job prospects, and apparently incapable of being a good partner to anyone. 

I woke up this morning feeling numb. I drove to work crying, and had to will myself out of my car. All the while thinking about how best to kill myself quickly and accurately, what to say in my suicide note, etc.  

I spent the whole day numb, and came home. My girlfriend was, hot and cold about me all evening. I tried to talk about how I feel like a failure, and she kinda comforted me, but mostly seemed distant. 

I feel so alone here. Culturally I don't fit in, I don't have friends, I don't even know how to make any. The two people I'm close to other than my girlfriend and her daughter both live far away, one on another continent. I don't feel like I can talk about this with one of them, and the other's brother killed himself a year ago recently, so I can't burden her with that. 

I'm just lost.
