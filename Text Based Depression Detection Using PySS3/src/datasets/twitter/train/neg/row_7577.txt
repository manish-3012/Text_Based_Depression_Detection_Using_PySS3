This is the most depressed Iâ€™ve ever been. I want to end it all tonight.I sleep my days away. I despise waking up every morning. I fantasize about it every single night in bed. Only thing that kept from doing it is my mom. I opened up to her for the first time about 2 years ago, she was very supportive &amp; even cried with me. Sheâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m alive today.
