I don't see the point This is a huge cliche, but I don't see the point. I'm really young, and I just hate everything. I don't want to go through the same boring routine every single day for the next god knows how many years. I'm bored with everything, depressed, and really curious about what's on the other side. I'm kinda all over the place with this, but I also hate antidepressants. They make me hyper, and not me, which is even worse because people say they like more on the weeks and months I've been on it, but I'm aware of my hyper behavior. I hate me on drugs, and I hate me off of them. It seems from people that they like me when I'm drugged and that's not the real me. People like a fake me.  I don't even know if I should be posting this,and I don't really know what I'm asking. I've tried 3 different antidepressants and maybe I just think about it too hard. Like I said,  I'm very young, and I don't know what life's like after high school and whatever, but it just doesn't seem worth it to wait through thousands of identical, painful, boring days to find out.  Is it even wrong to end my life? I didn't ask to be born
