I want to kill myself, but I don't want other people to be upset about it.Hi. I have been considering suicide for a while now. I randomly ended up being a person who just so happens to have quite a few really fucked up, painful, chronic, cure-less ailments that really make most of my life pretty goddamn miserable. As a result of these diseases, I'm in desperate need of health insurance that I can't manage because I can't get a fucking job because of how much of the time I can't drive/feel too shitty to even get out of bad. I spend my life doing nothing, and the depressions I go through are pretty fucked up, or at least I think they are. I self-medicate with a lot of weed, used to go for heroin but being addicted to that shit is worse than the pain it makes go away.

I don't believe in God or any of that bullshit, and I think it's really my choice. But there's no way for me to kill myself without my family and friends having to go through shit. I could never explain to them that I want to do it even when I'm not feeling completely down and depressed, I just don't enjoy living, it's not for me. They would just never understand.

There are plenty of painless ways to go, and I'm unhappy with life and there's nothing I can do about it...why shouldn't I? I don't understand the stigma, but the guilt is enough to keep me from doing it, but that only makes me more depressed.

I just don't really know what to do, about anything.
