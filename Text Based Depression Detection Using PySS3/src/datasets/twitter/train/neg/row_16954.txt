Ready to fire sir.I've just downed a 5th of whisky so if my words seem odd then blame the whisky.
I've wanted to die for a while now. I can't go through with it though. ( just checked my writing, thank God for auto correct) people love to tell me "it's a faze" "life in the future isn't that baad" but they dont know me. My psychiatrist doesn't litsnen to me. Je doesn't care  my husband only cares because I do everything for h9m. I want my life to end. My husband and I are going cold.turky off of loperamide
Yeah,.it sounds stoopid I know but it had 2 be done. But, I can't take it anymore. I'm ready to take as many pills as I andy husband has. Jist want to say fuck America. My psychiatrist wouldn't even listen 2 me. I'm done being ignored. I hope my end is quick. I hate this life.
