Trying to talk for the first time with the girl I likeHello, IDK if it's really here where I should post this; thing is I'm very timid and depressive, was rejected by the last girl I've tried and she only said that I was too shy; now I'm trying to move forward but it's hard to me because I get stuck so much with every relationship, anyways I want my new crush to feel like I'm not that shy I've never talked to her and I only see her in the college; but don't have spaces in common, I'm planning just to approach and say to her "hello,  I see you often in the University and you seem very interesting to me, I would be glad to get to know you better; and my name is... So I always overthink the first approach and let way too much time before I do something and then only get depressed, so uhmm what do you guys think is it good enough?
Sorry for formats and English too.
