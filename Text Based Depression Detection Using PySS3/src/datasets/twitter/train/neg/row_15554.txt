Not sure if I should be hospitalizedI've been going through some issues with an ex this week that led me getting hurt a lot. There aren't many other times where I recall being in so much distress and where life seemed so unbearable. I've tried to kill myself multiple times over the last couple days as well as this morning. 

I felt like trying again most of my time at work and then towards the end of my shift it felt as if this burden was magically removed for no apparent reason. I don't know if this has ever happened to anyone else? It makes me feel happy obviously because I don't feel the pain I felt before but at the same time I know myself well enough that something could trigger those feelings again.

I want to start seeing a therapist but I feel like it wont help as much if they don't know the full scope of my issues. At the same time I feel like it would seem weird for me to go to the hospital now when I'm feeling perfectly calm. Not really sure what I should do?

Edit: I'm also really hesitant to be hospitalized because I just moved to a new city kind of far from home and started a new job and I'm afraid if I have to stay in the hospital for too long I'll lose my job. I also don't want my mom to find out because she's already been through all of my previous suicidal episodes and I can't imagine the anxiety it would cause her now with me being so far from her
