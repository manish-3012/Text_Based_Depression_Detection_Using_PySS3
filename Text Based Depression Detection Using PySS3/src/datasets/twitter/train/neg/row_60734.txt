I hate being the black sheepMy whole family is here. And they all are treating me like shit. They are defending my HIGHLY abusive mom. And straight up ignoring me. I hate it here. I want to go home but I dont even know where that is. I just- why. Why cant I fit in anywhere? Like I cant fit in my own fucking family. I dont belong here. I dont belong anywhere.


Happy holidays. 


See ya on the other side.
