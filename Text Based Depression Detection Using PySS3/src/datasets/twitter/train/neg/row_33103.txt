I've now spent half my life trying to follow my dreams. Nothing has worked out ever. I'm ready to die. I'll never accomplish anything not matter how I approach it. I've done nothing but wasted half my life and now I'm too sick and poor to advance any further. I hate being here and I hate everything about life itself. Everything I try doesn't work. I try to go back to school and there is a hundred and one reasons why I can't. I need some medical care well guess what the free clinic doesn't do that and the hospital won't because I owe them a fortune from the first time I went. All they do is just make you wait in a waiting room until you can't stand it. Then when you get upset they call some security guard over to kick you out. I've never had a job that would pay any kind of bill. I've never had my own place to live and I'm getting close to 40. Fuck this life and everyone that's in it. I watched my best friend go to Afghanistan as a contractor and come back in better shape than he's ever been in a fucking rich. I try for the same job and oh no you can't work here. You can't pass the god damn physical. There's always a god damn reason isn't there. 

Well fuck you world. I don't give a damn what anyone thinks anymore. I'm going to kill myself right here in this library in front of all these assholes. 

Fuck everybody and everything I didn't ask to exist.
