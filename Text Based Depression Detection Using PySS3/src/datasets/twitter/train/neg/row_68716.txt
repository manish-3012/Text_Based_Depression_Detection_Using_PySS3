It has to be my faultShe left me.  She was wonderful.  I donâ€™t know why.  She probably thought I was a sulky man child - depressed about my sinking career.  

I broke my ankle last year - it hurt so bad.  I think that helped sink my career.  

I have no one anymore.  I only cause pain.  

My friend told me she didnâ€™t come over for my birthday because Iâ€™m too depressing to hang out with.  

I need to be gone. To stop ruining everyone elseâ€™s life.
