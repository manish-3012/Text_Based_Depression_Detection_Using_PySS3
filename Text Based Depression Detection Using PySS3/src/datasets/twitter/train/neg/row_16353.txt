I really hate myself because I'm not capable of getting a girlfriend, and I just want to die nowI'm supposed to be in college right now, but I can't motivate myself to get out of the house cause all I can think about is how bad I want to die. I want to die because girls hate me, and it's been my dream to find my soulmate. I've tried and tried to get a girl to like me, but its all been in vein. After it became obvious that I just wasn't going to be able to get a girlfriend in my life, I tried to focus on just myself. However with that I just found that the empty feeling doesn't go away. I just really want to die, it really hurts not being good enough. It has driven me mad that a girl chose to give a guy that beats her a second chance over giving me a first chance. I'm so bad that girls would rather get beaten than date me. I've tried my hardest to find happiness in other things, but it just doesn't fill the hole. I just feel that if I keep living I'm never going to be able to accept that I'm lonely, hence why I'm better off just putting myself out of my misery.
