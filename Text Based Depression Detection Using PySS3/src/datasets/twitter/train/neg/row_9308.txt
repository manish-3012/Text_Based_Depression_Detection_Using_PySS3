Can't stop wanting to end my existenceI don't even know where to start. Basically, everything is just getting to much to handle and I have literally 0 support for it and as a result I feel like I'm so so close to killing myself.

I am a student studying medicine and the course in itself is really tough and needs me to be on top of my game - my mental health has held me back for the last 4 years and I need to pull through during my final year.

My family life is really tough. I come from a religious background (muslim) with parents who have been emotionally and physically abusive in the past and are incredibly controlling - they pay for my entire uni which means i'm not in debt but also means that they have regularly threatened to pull me out of uni over the tiniest whim.

I was diagnosed with depression when I was 15 after losing two brothers and two grandfathers within 4 years and my family were 'supportive' of treatment (only psychotherapy) for a year but were heavily involved and my mum would regularly yell at me for being miserable.

I've kind of rushed everything but it's just getting way too hard for me to cope and I literally have no-one i can turn to. I don't have anyone in my family I can talk to. My friends are either busy or useless (in that they have nothing to say) or both. I'm constantly feeling like i'm on the edge of doing something stupid.

I've tried counselling, medication, calling helplines, all sorts. But nothing seems to work. My problem is my situation which I can't realistically get out of for at least another year, which may not seem like a long time but right now I'm struggling to make it through the day.
