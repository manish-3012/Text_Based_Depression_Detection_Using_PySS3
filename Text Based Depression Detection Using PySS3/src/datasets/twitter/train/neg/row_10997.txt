People just don't like meFuck them. Nobody fucking likes me. It's all because I'm a socially awkward fuck who keeps to himself. I will never have what other people have because it's too hard to change. This just pisses me off. Everything about socializing pisses me off because I'm so bad at it, but it's too necessary, and I hate being alone. I hate being with people but then I feel like my life sucks because I have no friends or connections and I will NEVER have either of those things. I just don't give a fuck. This shit makes me so angry that I just wish the worst kinds of emotional pain on other people in general. I want my family to be hurt, even though they did nothing wrong besides not give a shit about me. I never felt loved by my fucking family and I don't give a fuck how much any of them actually do love me, they fucking suck at showing it, which I guess circle back to how I turned out this fucking way. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I'm completely enraged by my existence. They have plenty of fucking letters to read when I'm done. I don't care if any of this is my fault, I don't care if just being angry and petulant about it makes me an immature fuck who needs to grow up, I'm just done. I'm sick of life and I am pissed the fuck off. I'm going to end up homeless on the street and if my life gets that bad, I will probably do very horrible, awful things that will just make everyone hate me even more. I'm just sick and tired of everything and I want to be dead.
