Jumping off a buildingI want to jump off a building.  I know people love me.  Even those people donâ€™t want to be around me.  The reason I want to jump is cause of myself.  Every shitty feeling I have is not because of a lack of something, itâ€™s just that I hate myself so fucking much and the majority do too.  Only reason Iâ€™m even posting is because I donâ€™t have a plan in place to take care of my dog once Iâ€™m gone.  He deserves the best.  The plan was originally to wait for him to pass and then jump but I canâ€™t live with myself for another 12-15 years.
