Last time I got a 3/4 trigger pullIt's been about 3 weeks since the last failed attempt, and I'm back to trying to fall on my weapon again. I've lost interest in my reasons for living, and I'd rather finish pulling the trigger of a shotgun than drift through life without purpose again. When you can't even follow your own self-designated purpose, and you're too crippled by your own brain to function, what do you do? Why would you continue to exist? I can't come up with an answer to give myself.
