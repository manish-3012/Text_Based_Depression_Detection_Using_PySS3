Might be ending it in the next few monthsMy life is fucked, I fucked everything up. In my school I had a class, didn't like how it was organized so I sent a letter of complaint to the teacher and she didnt take it well. They told the principal that it was a threat letter and had me suspended. She started telling people that I was threatening kids and telling people I was gonna shoot up the school and that I called her names, which all of these are lies like I'm not a good person but I'm not a fucking nazi. Now I have kids telling me on a daily basis to go kill myself for being so mean to the teacher which I never was. My daily life at school is awful, I go to a school where I have a certain class with the same people all day long every other week and all though I'm technically sitting with others I feel so isolated, everyone is talking to each other having fun and there i am not really talking to people, i mean i have like two friends in the class but we sit far apart. And I'm having anxiety attacks in class. I just dont think I can do it anymore.
