My most debilitating symptoms makes me wonder if life is worth living anymore...I posted this already on r/advice but I'm hoping to get a different angle on this here.

For a start, I'm am diagnosed with the following:

- Bipolar Disorder II with Rapid-Cycling

- Generalized Anxiety Disorder

- Temporal Lobe Epilepsy

I suffer from these non-delusional hallucinations. I know they are not real and I'd say they're in between an earworm and the outside world. They are constantly ongoing, repetitive, I called it the broken record syndrome. They are primarily auditory but there are these brief flashes of visual ones sometimes. The volume is usually low. The content of the hallucinations are non-specific, just noises, no commands or derogatory statements.

The worst part is the volume goes up at random, but usually when I'm having a good time. They spoil the moment and sometimes trigger my seizures or depressive episodes. They can be triggered by the environment but I have trouble determining what. It can range from a word somebody said to an empty box in the hallway. The triggers make no sense. During these moments, it is as if someone turned up the volume and these experiences become very intrusive and annoying.

Out of all my symptoms, this is the most debilitating one.

I'm currently taking the following medication:

- Lithium, 1500mg

- Lamotrigine, 500mg

- Latuda, 120mg

- Modafinil, 200mg, as needed

- Clonazepam, 0.5-2mg as needed

Only two drugs have provided a tiny bit of relief. Clonazepam takes the edge of the hallucinations for about 4 hours. Modafinil keeps me focused while they happen.

I had a trial in the past with SSRIs and SNRIs and they did nothing, though I'm not sure if I was taking enough. 

- I tried Prozac up to 40 mg, planning to go to 80 mg. But apparently increasing my serotonin levels puts me to sleep.

- I tried Cypralex up to 20 mg, but it was an SSRI and did the same thing as Prozac

- I tried Cymbalta at 60 mg, with no improvement in my condition. It seemed that SNRIs didn't put me to sleep.

This satanic symptoms is always there to spoil my pleasure and the good moments of my life. Why should I live if I can't fully experience pleasure in my life. I've seen many psychiatrists with no full explanation and tried literally over 13 drugs. Most of my condition is under control, but not this part.

I don't want to harm myself but just end my suffering. I already attempted suicide months ago and I was not supposed to have survived. I ingested grams of a depressant that was supposed to prevent me from breathing and lithium which was a toxic drug. Knowing that you're going to die with no going back was the most terrifying thing I ever lived though.

Every night, the bottle of Lithium of sits on my bed stand. My dosage is so high that I need just a few extra pills to destroy my kidneys and send myself into a coma, if I survive.

What's the point of life if I can't enjoy it because my mind wants to send me to hell at it's best moments?
