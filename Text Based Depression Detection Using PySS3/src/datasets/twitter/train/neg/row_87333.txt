I don't want to kill myself.I'm sixteen male. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts a few years back and I found the initiative to talk to my family. I am now taking antidepressants to repress my suicidal thoughts.

I have a good life. I have great grades, great friends, and great opportunity in my life. I do not want to lose that to some self destruct button in my brain. I am happy and dont want to kill myself.

Lately I have been thinking about how easy it would be to end my life if I wanted to. I have been taking note of how many sharp items and prescription drugs I could use if I wanted to kill myself. I've been thinking about taking some precautions to limit the dangers of my household just in case I go suicidal.

What should I do? Should I talk to my family or counselor? What if they put me on more drugs? What if it's just a false alarm and I'm being paranoid? Has anyone else been in similar situation?
