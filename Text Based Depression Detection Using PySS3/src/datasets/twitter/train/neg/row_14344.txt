...i used all my energy to make sure the people i care for were ok now iâ€™m by myself sad i just want love a hug or someone to cuddle with i always made time for them and they wonâ€™t do the same i guess iâ€™m just a gullible idiot for thinking they really wouldnâ€™t leave. i wonder if they ever really cared it hurts i was gonna overdose on my meds and decided not to i tried not to think about killing my self for this girl and now sheâ€™s gone.
