I have Aspergers, I was rejected for college, I'm liked by no one, not even comfortable anywhere but in my room.(17)I was rejected from college today for a ten percent score on a numeracy aptitude test. I've always sucked at maths, I could never improve, and even though that had nothing to do with the subject I'm going for, its ruined my life.

People generally seem to try and avoid talking to me and I have no idea how to meet people with similar interests and start a decent conversation. I always get talked over, or ignored. It doesn't matter anyway. 

My aspergers diagnosis was a death sentence anyway, I just failed to see that fact. 

I have no signs of improving, hell, not even any idea how to improve anything, I dony even have the *most basic social skills of starting a conversation*. I failed an *entry level maths test*. I can't even discover new things to become new interests because I have no idea how to do that either.

Either I put a piece of trash, a waste of everyone's time including my own "where it belongs", or I find out how the improve, and I don't see the latter happening.

My therapist says I'm "improving". But she never has an answer to anything I ask her. I'm the problem.
