Feeling like a burdenHi, 

I can't shake this feeling that I have no right to live. I feel so incompetent at life. I struggle so much to do what comes naturally to others. Everyone in my life have to take care, scarifies for me and it's so pointless. I feel like I have no chances to actually become a capable human. It's like I'm prolonging everyone's suffering by living. 

I'm sure my parents would hurt if I died, I'm sure they would give everything to stop me form killing myself. But I am causing their suffering, no one is happy constantly sacrificing themselves. I'm so afraid that they resent me but can't express it. It's like I'm holding people in my life as emotional hostages. I feel so sorry that they love me.  They should have had someone better in their life, they deserve better. I feel soo trapped, no matter what I do I cause others pain.

I myself feel so much pain. I want things in life yet I feel I have no means to ever reach it. I have no energy left to even try. I want this to be over.

Sorry if this text is a mess, my mind is all over the place...
