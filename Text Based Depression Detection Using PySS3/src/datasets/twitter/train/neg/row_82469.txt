I don't think I'm strong enoughToday has probably been the worst in a long time for me. I don't know why but I'm seriously at the end of my rope. Usually the thoughts of my family keep me strong. But today I got nothing but so much self hate. I don't want to but I see no other way anymore I've tried talking tried meds I just don't know anymore.
