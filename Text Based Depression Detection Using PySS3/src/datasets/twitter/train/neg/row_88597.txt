Killing myself is not only liberating for me but also for others around meMy entire life is full of pain and agony.I look at my childhood photos and realize that i did not belong her.Sick of this anhedonic life.People always consider me to be a burden,they pretend that i exist.People will forget me after grieving for few weeks.I dream about being crucified to death where i would reach enlightenment. 
I just can't out of my bed,tired of putting up a facade.
