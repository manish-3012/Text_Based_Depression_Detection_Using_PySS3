To tell? Who to tell? How to tell?Things have gone off-rails to the point that my suicide feels like an inevitability. I've lost all hope that I can pull myself out of this hole (and there's hardly anyone left to help pull me out).

But still, this is where people say to ask for help. I've lost most of my friends, too much of my family lately, and there's hardly anyone left to ask. Those left know I haven't been the best and are getting increasingly frustrated at how I've fucked things up so badly.

My great fear now is coming out to one of the handful of people who still care for me, and not being able to hold it together anyway. And I know the guilt of that would be worse than not coming out.

I feel like screaming for help. But I don't think I can be helped.
