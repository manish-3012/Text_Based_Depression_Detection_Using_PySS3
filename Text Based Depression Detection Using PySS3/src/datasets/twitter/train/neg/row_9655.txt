Its getting harder to take this everydayI canâ€™t stand just always thinking about death and how Iâ€™m going to end it. I just canâ€™t stop the thoughts of hurting myself and convincing myself I deserve it. Every time I see anything sharp I think of stabbing myself, every time I see cars going fast I think of jumping in the way, every time I take a pill I feel urged to take so many more. When a train comes by I feel like I have to close my eyes and lock my legs and look the other way because I just donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be able to have the willpower to stay still if this keeps on going. I just constantly think about hurting myself and itâ€™s driving me crazy, I feel like I need to, like itâ€™s some type of itch. I think thereâ€™s two people inside of me, one that just is obsessed with hurting the other, and the other, a meek and cowardly personality that could be successful if it werenâ€™t for the relentless beat downs that the other me gives it. Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m willing to do it, but part of me ones to get rid of the other. But itâ€™s more of an intrusive thought than anything else, itâ€™s just something that doesnâ€™t let me sleep, itâ€™s just constantly on my back like a parasite. I donâ€™t know. Just really hope I can get some advice at stopping these thoughts. I really wish the best for all you guys.
