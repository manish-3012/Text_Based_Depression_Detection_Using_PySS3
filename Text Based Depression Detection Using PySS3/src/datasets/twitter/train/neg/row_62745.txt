Even if I wasn't such a big depressed loser, I would kill myself.Living a long life never really appealed to me. I understand why some people would want to, but the vast majority of people all around the world throughout history wanting to live a long life, regardless of their living conditions always baffled me. We see how awful this world is; none of us asked to be born and yet we just have to stay alive. Just because. ???
I never wanted to get married start a family, raise kids, retire. How is this still so common?

I truly believe that if I were rich good looking, successful, that I would still end my life. I would just live a bit more extravagantly, 

I'm tired of procrastinating. I'm going to quit my job, do some good in the world, travel, donate to organizations I believe in, say my goodbyes to everyone, and end try to end on a high note, cancel all subscriptions, and tie up as many loose ends as possible. Hang myself in another country (probably leave like $100 to the person that finds me lol.) Suicide makes so much more sense than dying from some disease, or car accident, murder, etc.

Even if I wasn't depressed, or a loser who has more than enough reasons to kill myself, I would feel the same way.

I think suicide should be socially acceptable after 30. We put an age requirement on so many things. I think people who lived past 30 has given life a 'decent' shot at life. I mean its most likely not going to get better. I don't think they should do it if they have kids, but if they are single, then I think they should draw up a plan and end it without hurting anyone else. 
People should live for as long as they want, but if they thought about it for a long enough time they should do it. I don't think people should suffer day in day out just for some good things to pop out every once in a while. Everyone will get over it sooner or later, and be better off.
