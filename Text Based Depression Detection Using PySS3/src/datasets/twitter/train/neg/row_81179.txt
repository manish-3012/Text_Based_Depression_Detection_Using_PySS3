hate my life and trying to be strongSometimes Iï¸ wonder why Iï¸ was bornâ€¦ it was such a terrible mistake. Iâ€™ve never done anyone any good and no one has ever benefited from knowing me. my whole life Iï¸ kinda hated my life. and the older Iï¸ got the worse it got. Growing up Iï¸ had a lot of friends but 99% of them were bad friends and Iï¸ put up with a lot of shit until Iï¸ got older. Even my own blood would make me feel like shit or make me feel like Iï¸ wasnâ€™t enough. Iï¸ honestly donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever felt important to anyone or even loved really. Iï¸ recently met my girlfriend of 6 months and for the first time Iï¸ feltâ€¦ something? It was so hard to believe someone could like me. Iï¸ was so used to being emotionless and feeling unwanted it caused me serious trust issues and terrible anxiety. But Iï¸ still slowly started to feel loved and it was amazing! Like a drug. Iï¸ was and still am madly in love and my whole life is about my gf. Iï¸ know they say you gotta love yourself before you love someone else but Iï¸ donâ€™t know if Iï¸ can ever love myself and Iâ€™m not sure if that meant Iï¸ didnâ€™t deserve to try love. Either way the only reason Iâ€™m still alive or even getting a second a second chance at life is because Iï¸ took a chance and tried love. But recently Iâ€™ve been in a terrible dark place and feel like Iâ€™m not good for anything. Iï¸ donâ€™t seem to be able to make my GF as happy anymore and it seems to me like Iï¸ make her life worse. And she will deny it all and say Iâ€™m great and all this nice stuff which Iï¸ love and appreciate more than anything but its hard to believe. i have a decent amount of mental illness and it makes me hate myself because it ruins my life. Its another reason Iï¸ donâ€™t feel like Iï¸ deserve life. My mental health effects my gf mental health and its not fair for her to feel this way. Iï¸ really want to be her everything and Iï¸ feel like Iâ€™m just her friend sometimes. A lot of how Iï¸ feel is my fault and Iï¸ know it but she still gets upset and blames herself which upsets her and breaks my heart because all Iï¸ want is for her to be happy and love me but Iâ€™m failing at the one thing Iï¸ wanted. Now Iï¸ feel like i shoulda just ended it and my gf would have never met me and Iï¸ would have never caused her any pain or sadness. Iï¸ shoulda just ended it and done everyone a favor. And the crazy part is even tho Iï¸ want to die so bad right now and free my gf from me Iï¸ love her so much Iï¸ want to try everything in my power to be someone she deserves but only if she wants it. there is nothing Iï¸ wouldnâ€™t do for her. Iï¸ would do everything Iï¸ can to be with her and maker her happy even if it kills me. Iï¸ do not care about my happiness at all and id rather never be happy with her than happy any other way. All Iï¸ know is Iï¸ hope Iï¸ can fix things fast because Iï¸ feel like Iâ€™m losing the only thing Iâ€™ve ever wanted and its killing me inside. Iï¸ love her so much and Iâ€™m going to being doing literally everything Iï¸ can for her
