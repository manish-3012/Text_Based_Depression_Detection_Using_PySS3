I just want to sleep and give life another go in maybe 10 years.Long story short, my girlfriend, my only motivation in life, left me. 4 months ago, she left me, for my best friend. I could type for hours how horrible our relationship was, and I can type for hours how great it was. It was abusive. At first, it was me who caused it. At the end, it was her. But now, after more than 7 years of being together, after her moving across country, being a part of our family, after she finally build up a new life, she left. Today marks the day she left, 4 months ago, and I just cannot deal with it anymore. I just don't care anymore. I used to be a hardcore gamer, sometimes game 30+ hours in a row just to forget about things and find some distraction, but I can't even be bothered to turn on that console anymore. I don't have anything else that I really care about. I have friends and family, sure, and I love them. They're why I'm still around. But I miss her, so bad. I just want her to come home. But she'd rather put her mask on again and go be pretend happy elsewhere.


I just don't know anymore. I just woke up and I want to sleep again. Like every other day.
