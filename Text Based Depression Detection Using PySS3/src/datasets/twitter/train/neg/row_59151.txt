Refused by yet another serviceso far I've attempted twice, every time I go to get psych help, I get rejected for being too suicidal... I get put on pills that don't help and told "it gets better".

 I'm pretty close to attempting again, and once more I got refused.

why does nobody want to help me? Is it me in particular?

Is it just the UK's NHS that sucks? Others have managed to get help on the first contact with mental health services, and here's me after 6 different services without a minute of help
