My time has come.I have lived for 16 years. And that's alright.

But i can't find peace with myself.

So I must go.

I'm glad I'm leaving.

This is a good thing.

To anyone that commented on my past post and gave me advice.

I'm sorry it didn't work.

I will end my life sometime next week or the week after.

Goodbye.
