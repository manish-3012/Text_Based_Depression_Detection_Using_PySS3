I don't even feel like I have it in me to write much, but I'll try...I've been in love with a girl for 4 years and I've tried everything to make it go away. she broke my heart before and now she's doing it again. I've never been in a successful relationship, and I'm starting to think that it's because I'm the crazy one. That I just cannot be happy without being sad. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired. I'm in an amazing amount of pain and I don't want to go on anymore. Maybe you guys can help. I figured I'd give this a shot.
