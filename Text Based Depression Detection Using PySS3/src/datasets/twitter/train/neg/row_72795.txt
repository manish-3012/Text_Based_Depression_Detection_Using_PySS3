I think about suicide a lotI wouldn't say I'm suicidal but I sure think about it a lot and how easy it seems. How sometimes it would be a lot easier to just kill yourself. I go through spurts of depression randomly but have never seriously considered hurting myself. Yet it's always in the back of my mind and it does seem to be something I think about a lot, just the act itself. Is this normal? I realize I'm not in any immediate danger to myself or anything but I'm slightly worried at times about this. If anyone has any insight that would be great.
