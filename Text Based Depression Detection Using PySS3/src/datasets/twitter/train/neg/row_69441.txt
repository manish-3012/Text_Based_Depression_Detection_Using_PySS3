Just. Please. End me.Being told how much I complain and how little I have to complain about today, somehow it makes me more suicidal. It's not a maybe - I know for a fact no one wants to deal with my complaints anymore, wants to deal w/ me. I don't know what im saying half the time. I told someone I don't know how people live like this. "We all do it and you have nothing to complain about. So and so works 10+ hours a day and doesn't complain or wanna die over it." Well fuck man, I don't care. I'm not built for this. I'm unstable af, it sounds emo but it's fucking true. There's millions of other qualified workers so who cares for me. I don't give a shit if there's an afterlife. I just can't figure out how to kms. I want it more than anything sometimes. I'm too scared to. But I'm still looking for something quick.
