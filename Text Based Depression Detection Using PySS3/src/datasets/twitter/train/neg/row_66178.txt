I may be going to prison for a long time. I would rather go out on my terms I want to live but I know this is just fucking up my life beyond repair. My daughter will never love me and I'll miss all of the milestones in her life. I'm losing friends and members of my family are against me as well. I don't see a way that I could ever.lead a normal life.
