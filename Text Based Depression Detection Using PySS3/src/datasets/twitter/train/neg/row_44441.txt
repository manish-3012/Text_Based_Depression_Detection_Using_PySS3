I just want to end it all.I always manage to drive people away from me, no matter how close they are to me or how well it was going. And no matter what i try, i can't manage to have a real friendship for longer than a year. 
It feels to me like i am just a failure and won't succeed at anything nor that i will ever be missed by anyone.

I started to feel lonely a long time ago and it just got to the point where i cant continue anymore, i just want to feel nothing. i don't want to continue and try anew because i will just destroy everything again. 

I had the thought to end all for a long time, but it was never as strong as it is now.
