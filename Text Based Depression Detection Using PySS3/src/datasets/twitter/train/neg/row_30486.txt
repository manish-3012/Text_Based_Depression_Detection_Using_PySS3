I can't do this.. I spend my days alone  I'm disabled via Mental illness. Depression and Avoidant Personality disorder.  I'm broken My  ego is so fragile that something innocuous to those around me sent me into a tail spin 2 weeks ago I haven't recovered from. I haven't  had a conversation longer than "how are you" with anyone since. My self esteem is so low I feel incompetent to dig a ditch. I want desperately to kill myself but I don't know what happens when I die and I'm afraid I'm going to hell. Funny thing is I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD. I Know I don't believe I Heaven but I think hell is plausible. It makes no sense. I wake up every morning pissed that I didn't die in my sleep.  Cry off and on all day. I'm 54 my father and grand father lived into their 90's all I think is HOW IN THE FUCK AM IS SUPPOSED TO DO THIS FOR 40 MORE YEARS? I quit getting high on top of everything else so my emotions are completely ON THE SURFACE NOW. And please don't say "you should get high" I have been high 95&amp;#37; of the time since I was 14. I am  true addict as much as many don't like to acknowledge weed is addictive. IT . IS.   I apologize every single day to a wife I haven't seen or spoke to in 10 years. All I say to myself all day long is "I'm a little piece of shit" I don't know if she said it once or a thousand times but it's my mother's voice.  I will NEVER tell my therapist that I've been on this site becasue there is NO WAY IN HELL I'm going to sit on a psych unit . I can't do it anyway and it's just fuel my feelings of worthlessness. I plead to a deity I don't believe in every day to let me trade places with someone terminal and let them live. Just let me DIE DAMMIT!!! I dunno why I came on here in the first place have a good day guys.
