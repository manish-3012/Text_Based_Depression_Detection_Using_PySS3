A question out of curiosity for those who do or have cut.I've struggled with social anxiety disorder and dysthymia for pretty much my whole life.  It got a lot worse in college.  But I've never cut myself.  I'm just curious why people do that.  No judgement or anything.

Do all people who feel really depressed cut themselves?  I've felt incredibly terrible before and I didn't cut myself, so I wonder if I would have to feel even worse to get to that point.

Thanks for your honesty.  My hope for our recovery is great!
