Informed of suicide attempt(Trigger warning(s))
Apparently it happened 18 months ago.  And theyâ€™ve kept it a secret between themselves save for their therapistsâ€”- and arent they mandatory reporters!? What. The actual fuck.

Fully. He Put a gunâ€”her gunâ€”to his head and fired. Idk how but by the grace of god he missed and the bullet only grazed his skull and went into the wall.
I guess he had been spiraling out of control with his meds for a while.  He made an attempt 20 years ago and she saved his life, and the spiraling meds was an issue then, too.

She dumped on me that
-this happened with her in the next room.
-that the pillow was soaked with blood.
-that she stopped herself from calling 9-1-1 and cleaned it all up. 
-that her therapist told her she made the right choice (.....?????!!!!)


While I realize theyâ€™re dealing with their own set of emotions, Iâ€™ve just been dealt this information:
(Inappropriately, over the phone, during a cursory conversation.... no buffer.  No â€œplease sit we have to tell you somethingâ€.)

Iâ€™m angry.
Iâ€™m unclear on her intentions of telling me the way she did.
Iâ€™m very frightened.  
The only way I can describe the feeling is to make an analogy to a small child whoâ€™s afraid to look in a Casket.
Yes. I realize I should be glad that he didnâ€™t complete- but itâ€™s still very frightening.
Iâ€™m heartbroken for both of them. And myself.  Our 3 person family unit is so broken.

My mom is at her wits end and has been trying to take care of him and keep him together (and herself) but sheâ€™s not happy. Neither of them are. 

He has 3 children.  But for some reason Iâ€™m the one that gets to hold this burdensome information now and Iâ€™m resentful of that.

I have absolutely no idea what Iâ€™m supposed to do.  Or say. Or not do. Or not say.
