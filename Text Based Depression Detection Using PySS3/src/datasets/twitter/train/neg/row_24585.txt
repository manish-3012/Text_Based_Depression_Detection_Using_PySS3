Feeling really unstable16F here, My friend bailed on me and Iâ€™m feeling incredibly lonely, the combination of which took me from incredibly happy to incredibly suicidal. I nearly killed my self but the wave passed, and I told my mom. But she doesnâ€™t like putting me in hospitals (Iâ€™ve been in 4 this year), and so Iâ€™m just sitting here. I feel a little safer but still incredibly unstable. So idk what to do.
