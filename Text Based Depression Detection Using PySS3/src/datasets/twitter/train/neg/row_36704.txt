I can't take anymoreIdk
What to do anymore .. Pretty sure tonight is gonna be the night . I'm
Transgender  and my family is extremely against that ,
I also struggle with severe mental illness . My depression is so bad I feel like I'm drowning , and I hear voices that talk to me and say awful things ..
I'm sorry to sound so
Negative but I keep it inside all rn time
And I think I've finally broken . I feel so so bad for the people I'll leave behind , but I can't do
This anymore . Even my own family
Dosent care enough to
Truly listen and try to
Understsnd . What hope is there ?
