Are we allowed to discuss methods here?I have semi-seriously been looking at methods to end my life. I have come across 3 methods. One is a medication which is difficult to get obtain, another is a gas which is possibly difficult to obtain and utilise successfully and the final method is a device which will stop me from breathing. The latter appears to be the most realistic method, but still I am dubious.

I am a 32 year old man. I am very skinny (5'10, 140 lbs) and an enthusiastic runner.

My life is not worth living. It never really got started and I feel defeated. I am unemployed, have experienced nothing but unemployment or long periods of time on benefits, interspersed with temporary minimum wage jobs. I have anxiety but I thought I would still be able to get somewhere in life like everyone else. I have two degrees. They haven't helped. I have no friends, no partner and still live at home. I have 6 friends on Facebook and 2 of them are my sisters. Socially I have always shot myself in the foot because I am very quiet and withdrawn.

There is just... nothing... and very little hope for my future. I seem to be different from everyone else and a pariah from society. I feel like I am not suppost to be here.

There is not much else to say. I often wonder why the heck I am still here. Everything means nothing to me.
