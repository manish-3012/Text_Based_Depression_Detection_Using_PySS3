really depressed latelySo I've been a bit depressed lately, and I can't see my counselor anymore because my parents took me off of their health insurance.  

My background: Long story short(ish), I've had depression for years.  Tried to kill myself when I was 16.  My father was emotionally and sometimes physically abusive.  Denies it to this day.  Emotionally unavailable mother.  Both of my brothers are sick and dying.  I moved away from my family with my boyfriend's family because of how toxic the environment was.  When I told them I wanted to move out, they kicked me off of their health insurance, told me to be out in two days,  and refused to sign my FAFSA to allow me to go back to school.  Oh, and they refuse to pay back about three thousand dollars that they owe me.

So, there you go.  They dug a deep shithole for me to rot in.  

And more and more everyday, I'm coming to realize that I don't know who I am as a person.  I have no skills.  I'm not intelligent.  I don't have any special hobbies.  No friends.  Not attractive.  No personality.  All my life, I did what my father wanted me to do because I was too terrified to imagine anything else for myself.  He was always this demanding presence, guiding my path.  Now that I'm not there anymore, I'm lost.  I'm straight up a fucking loser.  I can't keep living like this.
