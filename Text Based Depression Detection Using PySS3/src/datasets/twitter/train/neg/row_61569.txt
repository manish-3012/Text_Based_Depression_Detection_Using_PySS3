I just donâ€™t know anymoreI honestly donâ€˜t know what to do with myself. I have nearly finished to conclude with everything in my life. I was right on the spot ready to leave. 
Out of nowhere i meet a girl with whom iâ€˜m basicaly in the starting of a relationship.  I have never conciously felt love in my life for anyone.  Although my gut tells me that i might be falling for her right now. I just donâ€˜t feel any pain when sheâ€˜s around.
Death to me is the start of something and not the final end. So now i have to make a decision for me but i just canâ€˜t. I donâ€˜t want to hurt anybody around me but i just canâ€˜t stay. My mind is all over the place but still nowhere at the same moment.
