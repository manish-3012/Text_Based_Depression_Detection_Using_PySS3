Suicidal and hopelessI feel hopeless and think about suicide since an year. An year ago I told myself if things dont get better I willl end it all. Things got worse. ..I am studying now how to do end it all in thr best way.
I had hope. Hope just hurted me more.
I dont even know why I am writing here. Nothing helps me. 
I told closest people to me I am contemplating suicide. They dont help at all. It is useless.
Why am I even writing here and asking some help?
Who am I but a suicidal stranger for you all?
Closest people to me has no compassion at all.
