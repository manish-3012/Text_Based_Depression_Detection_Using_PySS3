I wish this was the momentMy emotions are boiling inside of me and I want out. Iâ€™ve always thought of suicide but now itâ€™s hourly. Every waking moment I am stopping myself and trying to distract myself from the emotional/mental pain but itâ€™s becoming too much. Iâ€™ve reached a point where I lay in silence and just wait. There is nothing for me. I do not want anything, except to leave my body. This is an indescribable pain. It is not depression. It is not anxiety. My body is killing itself from the inside out. It is constantly sending stress signals to every organ, cell, and every thought that I have. I can not live like this for much longer and I wish I had the guts to end my suffering today. Iâ€™ll just lay in bed and hold on for another day and hope something changes tomorrow I guess. Thanks for listening.
