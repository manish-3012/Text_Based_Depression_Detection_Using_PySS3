I often find myself wanting to commit suicide over seemingly trivial things, can anyone help me?I don't know what to do at this point, the will to live is getting  weaker and weaker and I truly don't want to be on this planet anymore. The thing that I'm somewhat questioning is that it seems that there's always something minor that seems to set me off and brings me to having these sort of thoughts. I sent a really stupid message to this guy that I'm interested in romantically, and he hasn't responded due to the message being so fucking stupid and for a few days now I have honestly thought about killing myself, and when I look at the reasons why everything's leading back to this message. 

I went through a serious depression in my adolescence and ever since then I feel like my options in life has been severely limited. I just don't want to do it anymore and I don't see the point. It's all just so hopeless.
