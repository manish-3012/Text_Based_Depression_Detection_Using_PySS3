How moral it would be to blow half of my house to shits with gas?I am probably going to a lot of lists with this one but things are fucked, so am I, so is my family. I can't get into their heads and maybe it is low serotonin or other chemical shit, but the amount of crippling depression terrorizing our tiny wee household is unbearable. The only reason I am still alive is because for my family things would only get a multitude of times worse, and I won't be able to rest peacefully knowing that because of this dumb and egoistical action some of the only people I hold dear will suffer much worse. Maybe blowing everyone up is a viable course of action? Must sound fucked, but it can spare a lot of trouble. I live in an apartment building, so I am wondering if the explosion would reach the neighbours and if there is any way to avoid that. Maybe give gas less time to fill the rooms up?
