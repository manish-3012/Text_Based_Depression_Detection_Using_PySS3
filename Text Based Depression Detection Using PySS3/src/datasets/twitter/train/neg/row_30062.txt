handsmy hands are uncleanable. they will never be clean no matter how many washes i subject them to under the running hot water and aimless scrubbing. i just washed my hands 5 times trying to complete two tasks. while proper hand hygiene is probably the best favour you can do for anyone at this time, i cant help but scrub my hands endlessly 'til my skin wrinkles and cracks and dries out and tightens up.

every decision i make has the gravity of earth behind it. its too scary for me.

i want to stop thinking. i want to stop for a while, no worries or fears, no what ifs and uncertainty. 

i feel like i am waiting hopelessly for a future that will never come.
