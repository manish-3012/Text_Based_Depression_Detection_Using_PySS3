I'm just waiting for permission to dieI feel so lonely and broken. I don't enjoy anything anymore, my ex girlfriend would feel horrible if I killed myself and blame it on herself and probably kill herself too, and I don't want that. I want her to move on completely and live a happy life. So I guess at this point it just feels like I'm waiting for the minimum amount of people to worried about me so I can hang myself. I know that I can get better, but I have no energy to do so and the loneliness is the only feeling I really have left at this point. I don't want to disappoint anyone in my life even though all I feel like I do is fuck up and hurt people or ruin things anyway. I feel so selfish but I don't want to live anymore. I've laughed maybe once in the past week and smiled only out of politeness when I accidentally make eye contact with people. I don't think that anyone around me other than my parents would even care if I died within a few days anyway. I'm sure they could all get on with their lives. I just hope and pray that I am hit by a truck or killed by a random murderer every day, because I just want everything to be over at this point. I don't want to burden any of my few friends or limited family with all this information, my parents are already worried enough about me and while they do everything they can to support me, nothing really helps or works anymore. None of my goals seem achievable or desirable, and I just seem to be becoming less and less successful and competent with each passing day.  


Thanks for reading this, it means a lot to be able to get it off my chest a little.
