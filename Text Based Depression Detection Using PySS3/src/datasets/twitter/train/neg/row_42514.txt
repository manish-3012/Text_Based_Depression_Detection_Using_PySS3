For...For you all...

I wish I had people as nice as everyone is here.

You are all brilliant for sticking around and trying to help.

Ã—

For you, S...

I will never forget.

The times we shared?

Painful, but meaningful.

The words we exchanged?

Reading them in my mind over and over again.

I will never see you again after this.

But we both know it should be like that.

It is what you wanted.

I cannot say that I will miss you.

I can say that you will not miss me.

I love you.

Ã—

For you, A...

That summer?

Thank you.

For years you were the reason I stayed.

You taught me how to live.

You showed me life cannot always be sweet.

But you always were sweet towards me.

I hope you are happy.

Ã—

For you, M...

You have always been the best person I have ever met.

You have always been there for me.

You have always acted like I was important.

Like I was not the mess that I am.

And that is why I cannot say goodbye directly.

Ã—

For you, Mother...

I am sorry.
