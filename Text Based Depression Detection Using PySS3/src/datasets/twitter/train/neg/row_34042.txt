World might just be a better place without meTurned 40. I can't forgive myself for having done absolutely NOTHING good for anybody at all all this time. I am seriously good for NOTHING! How can a good-for-nothig idiot like me do any good for anybody?
I am a coward and I can't even kill myself. Such a worthless asshole I am. 
It gets worse! I've got a kid and a wife! May be things would have been easier without them. But then it is done and I can't undo it. 
I was searching for methods for a painless suicide along with porn (yeah, I told you am an asshole) and I reach here!
Now, I am looking forward to see you guys reply to this post... will you give excuses that I can give myself for still being alive? Or will you encourage me to go ahead and end it somehow?
I do have a good life insurance, the money should take care of my kid when am gone.
I am a coward, I haven't yet attempted.
I am curious to know, how the responses to this post can motivate or demotivate me.
May be the moderators here will just block me from coming here any more. May be that's the best for everyone, right? Losers are no good.
I have a well paying job, most people think everything is ok. But NOTHING is. I've got NOBODY to share my pains with. And what is my problem? Well just that am good for NOTHING, am not even good at explaining what is wrong with my worthless life! Can you guys believe it? 
I don't know why am posting all this. May be I am just curious how you guys will respond to an asshole.
