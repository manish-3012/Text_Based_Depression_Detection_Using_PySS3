This is impossible... I need to talkIt has happened again, someone has posted a photoshopped image of PMs to try to embarrass me and that reddit post has 50 upvotes and people have been sending me messages about me being a moron and harassing me

I don't know what to do, everyone believes the person who posted that is the one in the right and everyone is on his side while ignoring the fact that he has been harassing me for the past month and sending idiotic PMs to me to insult me, people just look at ONE side of the story and start hating me, I didn't think his post would get very far but it did and now I feel very down, he is one of the scummiest people on the internet and would go to any length to try to embarrass me infront of people who only look at one side of the story, it's sad and I don't know what to do, so many people just hate me now I have been considering suicide heavily because of the stupid amount of people that have been hating me and harassing me

Also, I am getting irritated by the fact that nobody has responded after 21 minutes, I know this sounds whiny but I feel horrible right now
