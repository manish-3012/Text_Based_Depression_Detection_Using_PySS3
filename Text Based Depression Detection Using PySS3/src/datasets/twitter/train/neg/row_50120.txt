I feel even worse than I used to (bear in mind English isnâ€™t my native language)So I was hanging up with my friends today and it was good, then I came back home and noticed that I donâ€™t take joy of anything, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m able to live like that. Please help I have no idea what to do. Sorry for lack of context but Iâ€™m not good at writing
