Sleeping pills before hanging?ok, so i really dont want to live anymore, not at all. i am very suicidal and have been for a very long time. however as much as i would like to die, i dont want to die painfully. i have thought of hanging myself multiple times, ive heard hanging is very painful though, so i thought maybe sleeping pills would be better, but many people survive from that. so... my thinking is, what if you tie a noose to yourself on a tree and then take sleeping pills, once you fall unconscious, you would fall off the tree branch and be hung. and because you are unconscious you shouldn't feel pain right?
