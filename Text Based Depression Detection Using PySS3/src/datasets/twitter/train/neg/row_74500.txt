And like clockwork, things only got worseI made a post yesterday, and unsurprisingly things haven't gone well since then. So last year I asked my hiring manager for a reference, but she said she wouldn't give one because I didn't seem that motivated in the work (yay thanks bipolar). So last year I didn't get a job because hearing that sent me in a downward spiral and I ended up taking summer classes and being a lazy sack of shit for the other two months. Last week I sent out an email to another person at the old job who was kind if like a supervisor who when I left said he would be willing to give me a reference. He just replied to me saying he wouldn't give one because he wasn't the person who hired me. I know he's just being polite. I was probably the worst hiring decision they ever made. I'm a lazy, useless, dumb, stupid, boring, awkward, and awful waste. I have no idea how I'm going to get a job without references. My old ones have moved on and I have no way to contact them. And I barely know my professors plus a lot of employers apparently look down upon professors as references. I feel so lost and useless.
