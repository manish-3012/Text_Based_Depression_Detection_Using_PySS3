i'm trans and i don't wanna live anymorei've always thought that i'd never get to this point and now that i'm here i feel like i'll never escape. nothing i do is good enough for anyone and i just feel like everything would be better off if i wasnt here. i cant deal with this anymore. i get called selfish every time i make a mistake, everyone has left me. i feel like i'll never be who i want to be- and even though in my community i'm the most accepted i'll ever be i just can't get happy. nothing works. nothing makes me feel good anymore. i'm scared of what i might do. i just need help getting through the day. my mother won't take me to a therapist, so i can't get anti-depressants and every time i ask her she just gets mad at me or shrugs me off as if i'm not worth her time. she's always on her phone or screaming at me for making a simple fucking mistake.

im never good enough and i just want help getting through the day
