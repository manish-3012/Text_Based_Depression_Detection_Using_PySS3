Iâ€™m so close to giving up.I just thought I wanna share my story. 17 and already wanted to kill myself several times. It has been really hard. Born and raised in Southeast Asia Iâ€™m just so tired of it. Nothing here fascinates me anymore. I just hate my life so much. My whole life watching movies, films and reading book on what life is like in America has always been so nice. I hate it here. No friends. No parties. Everyoneâ€™s so into their own world. And more importantly I donâ€™t even like ANY girls here. Never did. Never seen a girl that could catch my attention for 2 seconds here. Dropped out of college because too stress. My family is muslim and Iâ€™m forced to do whatever prayers they tell me to and keep doing it. Fasting etc. Iâ€™m just so sick I just donâ€™t believe in Islam. I just want out from my life right now. Everytime I mention my depression to my mom she just laughs it off and acts like itâ€™s a joke. I have been sitting in my room rotting for 6 months just watching videos reminding myself how life is so much better out there. Better yet next year Iâ€™m supposed to serve the country because we should all be â€˜proudâ€™ for our country. No itâ€™s fucking bullshit. Serve with pride? I donâ€™t want to serve fucking shit. Next 2 years of my life would be me stuck in the goddamn army with no expectation on what to come after that. I really donâ€™t know what to do with my life anymore. Even if I make it past the next 2 years what am I gonna do? I have no college degree whatsoever, no job experience no connections no everything. I just wish I was born into a different family in a different country. Itâ€™s a deathwish here. If you donâ€™t study your lifeâ€™s over. Atleast in America thereâ€™s so many opportunities to make your life work out in the end but thatâ€™s just in the US. Thatâ€™s my life right now. Waiting to get enlisted and waste another 2 years of my life serving with â€˜prideâ€™ for the country. If I ever make it to 20 years of age, for what itâ€™s worth I hope I make it out to the US one day :)
