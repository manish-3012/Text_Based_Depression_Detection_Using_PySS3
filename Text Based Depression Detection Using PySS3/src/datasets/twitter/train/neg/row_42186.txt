I don't deserve happiness and I've given upI'm so fed up of life. This year has done fucked me up and I can't take it. I'm 23 years old, broke up with the love of my life and also fucked up the whole being friends afterwards because of how many needy and clingy messages I sent asking for another chance. I can't redeem myself. I've lost all sight of the future. I see no purpose in me being alive and the things which I thought I wanted, just being me pain now. All I do is make people sad and uncomfortable, including my family. I literally don't want to talk to anyone anymore, I don't even want to listen to anyone. Everything is a pain.

I don't think I was meant for this life and I don't see how I can make it any better. Hopefully I won't last beyond this year. What a joke my life has been.
