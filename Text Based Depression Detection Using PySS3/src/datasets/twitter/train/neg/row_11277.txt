i am so tiredsorry im rambling but i literally cannot continue on anymore. im giving it a few weeks at most. i cant sleep or eat or garner enough energy to do anything that might make me feel better. recently ive gotten so bad i dont have the energy to speak. i literally cannot speak and for some reason this strikes me as horrendous. this has never happened before. i dont want to speak to my therapist or my psychiatrist or my family or my friends. i dont really want to put in the work to get 'better' i dont care anymore. i just want to die
