I AM TireD OF BEING INCAPABLE/INCOMPETENT/DIFFERENT.I (20/M) am in one of my country's topmost something doing something but I don't think I deserve this or I should be doing it.

1) I am a disable (an autoimmune disease), my back hurts all the time. For my curriculum I think just reading my textbooks would be enough but I am unable to do so. I am not sure whether it's procrastination/  laziness or my back pain but for the past few months I have been academically I complete piece of shit.

2) I never had any friends, partly because I was always in my home therefore never spend time in the classroom and therefore never spend time with people my age or because of my shit personality (I am that guy who is always cocky about everything, answers everything and is always wrong I think this cocky personality was a defense mechanism so I could be proud my weak/different body) but maybe this cocky personality would have fixed itself had I attended school but I honestly thought somehow this would magically get fixed in this b-school. but it didn't and now I feel isolated.

every day, I FEEL SO BELITTLED BY EVERYONE. IF KILLS ME SEEING OTHERS TALK WITH EACH OTHER WHILE, I cannot DO SO 

DOING THIS SOMETHING WAS MY "THING THAT HELPS ME CONTINUE LIVING"
