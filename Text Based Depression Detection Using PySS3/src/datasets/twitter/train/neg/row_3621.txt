Hard times.....So I have an interesting story.... Bear(bare?) With me, if you will. If not oh well, good luck and god bless. 

I'm really having an extremely hard time dealing with my anxiety/depression/intrusive thoughts. 

Roughly a month or two ago, I started getting really depressed and anxious. I constantly thought(think) that my S/O is or has cheated on me. It's like little movies that play in my head that show what my mind thinks she's doing. It seems extremely real and graphic. It also happens when I'm asleep, I dream the same vivid/graphic thoughts. 

She gives me NO reason to question her. She leaves her phone open, offers to let me look through it, is constantly telling me she loves me. We are together every minute that we aren't at work. We're getting a place together and so forth. Both of us are extremely mature and have fantastic careers. When I say she gives me no reason, she gives me no reason. She knows all about these issues and sticks by me and supports me. 

I have a counselor and I'm on some meds that aren't working. 

I have had past traumatic relationships: ex killed herself, others cheated on me constantly, ex-wife was physically,mentally and emotionally abusive. 

Anyway,

When I get in this mindset, I really want it to stop and contemplate suicide, to the point of having a plan constructed and note written.... I just need some advice or something.... And I can't really tell too many people because they'd call 911 and well, I'm part of 911.
