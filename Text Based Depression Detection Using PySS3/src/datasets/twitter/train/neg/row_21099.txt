Fucking DONEI canâ€™t make ANYONE HAPPY.

Just the other day I was crying to my mom about how depressed I was, and she said to STOP COMPLAINING and STOP THE SELF PITY, and that only I could get myself out of it. She said to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

Then guess what? I DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I saw a PSYCHIATRIST. He prescribed me 3 medications, 1 for anxiety, 1 for depression, 1 for emergencies in case of panic attack. I told my mom and thought she would be proud. But NO. Her response? â€œWHY ARE YOU PUTTING CHEMICALs IN YOUR BODY. THATS TOO MANY MEDICATIONS. YOURE BECOMING A DRUG ADDICTâ€

Iâ€™m fucking done. This is it. Iâ€™m screwed no matter what I do. I canâ€™t make anyone happy. 

Iâ€™m leaving tonight. No one gives a fuck. Fuck all of you.
