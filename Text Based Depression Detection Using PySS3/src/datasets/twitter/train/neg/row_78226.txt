Suicide feels comforting to think about for meI donâ€™t feel as suicidal as before but the thought of suicide still remains  in my head and it sometimes feels really relieving. Like all my problems and insecurities will just go away after I kill myself. Iâ€™m not even worrying about school and how stressful itâ€™s gonna be because I know that thereâ€™s a method for me to just get out. Idk why, but it just feels comforting or relieving when I think about it. It probably sounds like what an edgy teenager would say but it just makes me feel relieved.
