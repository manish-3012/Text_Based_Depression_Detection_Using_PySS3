I've never felt this close.Thoughts aren't new. They've been on and off for over a decade but this time it's scarier, it's different. I've never felt this hopeless so I came here. I've been struggling this past year after coming out about something a family member did to me when I was 17 and because I spoke out most of my family no longer talks to me and friends are grossed out about what happened to me as if I chose it. I've battled with depression for as long as I can remember, at least since my uncle died when I was 5 but I didn't know that's what it was then. Recently I thought I was doing better but in the past several days I've tanked. I am in therapy for the trauma just not today. I'm really tired of being treated like a doormat no matter how hard I fight it or stand up for myself. I'm not heard.
