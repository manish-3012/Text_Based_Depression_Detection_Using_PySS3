I don't know if I'm becoming depressedI don't know what's going on in my life. I've always been a very quiet, easy-going person and my life has never been too bad. I've had a few bad experiences in the past 17 years but everyone does.
I have quite a few friends, I have parents who love me and I have a brother who loves me too. 

The thing is, this last month has been really tough for me.. Nothing bad happened but I just don't feel happy anymore. I'm rarely in the mood to go out because I want to stay home alone and do other things; when I'm in school I'm kind of happy because I have friends and I have fun and I just enjoy myself, but when I'm alone I just feel this hole, this pain in my chest and it won't go away. I don't know why it's there, nor what makes me sad. I know my friends and my family love me but it isn't enough for me to be content. 

I've never once in my life thought about suicide but lately I've been starting to question myself what if I wasn't here? Would it matter? Does anyone in the world feel like I have an important role in their life?
I just feel like I'm that kind of person who just happens to be in someone else's life but nothing would be different if they weren't there. Life would go on the same way.
