no reason tobut i stillw ant to fucking die.

i dont understand why.

it happens over and over again. i know im not a piece of shit but honestly it feels like it. i just want to disappear. i feel like i dont deserve anything good that happened to me. i m w lazy piece od shit that cwnt get anything rigjt.

i dont want to talk about it to any of my friends and family much less my bf. i dont know why hr puts up with me. i keep falling apart on him and it feels like im suffocating him with my problems and i cant even do the same for him because im so weak.

i just want to get work done. i just want to start being better. i know feeling sorry for myself isn't gonna di anything. i really wish i didnt feel so tired for no fucking reason.

i just want to stop being so weak and just carry on like i used to. but here i am. whining.

why did i even survive this long. i want to start cutting again. getting back into vices. rotting away. i dont know what purpose i have anymore. i just want to die.
