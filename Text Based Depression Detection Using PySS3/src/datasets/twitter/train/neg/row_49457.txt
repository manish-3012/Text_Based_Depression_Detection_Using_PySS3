I ruined my life, I can't think of ways.I took a very wrong decision by opting a undergraduation subject, which I don't feel related to.

I work hard, but can't get those things in my head effectively, whereas everybody around me seems to get all of it. Everybody enjoys the subjects, have goals centered around it, whereas I hate Mechanical Engineering. I can't enjoy the subject, I have no clue what I'll do after graduation, I literally have no goals with this subject.


I obtained a scholarship to one of the Asia's best college, but turned it down, because I wanted to study Mechanical, and now that I'm into my third year, I think I blundered.


Academics was the only strong thing I had. My family thinks I am smart, this, that- all bullshit I think. I do maintain respectable CGPAs, but I never want to do such thing, as my career in life.

I fucked up.
I don't belong here. I just want to go somewhere, where I don't have to deal with constant dissapointment, constant failing, and regret that I could HAVE DONE A LOT BETTER, IF ONLY I WAS SANE.
