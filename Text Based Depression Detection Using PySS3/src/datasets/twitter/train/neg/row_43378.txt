I (23M) am questioning if my life is really worth living at 5'2".Is my life really worth living?  
It's been more than a year since I went on a date or received an hug or a kiss or even held hands with a girl I care about. I'm so touch starved it's crazy; especially because my love language is touch.  
I don't think this "dry spell" will end soon since I'm only 5'2". Not a single girl wants to have anything to do with me, it's like I've the plague.  
Yes, I've had 2 girlfriends but haven't had sex with both of them:  
The first one used me as a rebound and every once in a while would tell me "Is only you were taller", then cheated on me. We never got past kissing.  
The second one, after 1.5 years, out of the blue, broke up with me basically implying that she was never that much into me. We got past kissing but still, no sex.  
Just to be clear, I don't seek only sex, it's just not normal that, even after more than a year in a relationship, there was no sex.  
Like, am I really THAT disgusting? Am I really THIS unlovable? Is my height really THAT MUCH of a turn off?  


It doesn't matter what I accomplish, what are my qualities, goals or aspirations or if I have a good face, girls will always reject me because of my height alone (most of the time).  
On top of this, whenever I try to vent I always get dismissed with the same things, "Oh it's your attitude/personality, height doesn't matter!", "Oh, you're an Incel!", "Oh you should love yourself first then love will come when you least expect it!".   
It's so irritating and depressing.   
I don't know if I'll be able to endure a lifetime of loneliness because of something I literally have no control over.
