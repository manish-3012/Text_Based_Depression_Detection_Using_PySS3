When is it okay to give up?It's been three years since the last time I hung out with a friend. The only people I ever talk to are my family, the people I work with and the people at the psychiatry clinic I go to.

I never used to be the outgoing kid, but I was able to talk to people and make friends. We would laugh and have fun, and I would forget my anxiety for a moment. Today I can't even believe how that was possible. I feel like the person I was five years ago is a stranger. She can't be me.

She can't be the same person as the one who freaks out at the mere thought of meeting a friend for coffee.

She can't be the same person as the one who stops chatting with people online because they suggest that we meet in person.

She can't be the same person as the one who won't even try and make friends anymore, because everyone will just be dissappointed in the end.

How did this happen? How did it all go so wrong? I had the potential of living a happy life, and it slipped through my fingers even without me noticing. I've tried to fix it. I've seen doctors, got medication, went through therapy. I did all this and ended up in a worse place than when I started. There are no words for how lonely and hopeless I feel. How can I keep living like this?

How much do I have to suffer before it's okay to give up?

I know the answer is always that suicide is wrong, but I just keep getting worse and worse. I feel like I have an illness I can't cure that keeps me alive just to suffer. I want to kill the illness, even if I have to kill myself to do it.
