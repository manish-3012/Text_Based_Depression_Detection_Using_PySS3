Feeling rejectedI don't want to fight any longer. I'm exhausted and no medicine I tried seems to make it easier for me or feel any relief. It's just dragging me down, further and further. It hurts to breathe and it's too overwhelming to think clearly. Trying to ask for help just makes me paranoid and no matter what I feel rejected because I think that nobody wants me to speak. Nobody ever seemed to listen when I was screaming for help
