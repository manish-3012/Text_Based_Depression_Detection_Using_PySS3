Fuck meI don't even know why I'm still here... 
I get judge and teased everyday... Getting punished in the army... 
I'm going to blow a fuse... I just want to punch someone... If I were to do so... I get charge, get sued... Fucking lots of problems... For me and for others... Including living with regrets.. 
If I were to end my life, my funeral cost and stuff... But I can be free... 
My friend just avoided me for a few months.. Maybe cause I'm getting judged and he want nothing to do with it.. I dont know.. 

Wads worse? Death or being teased and judge everyday... 
Fuck me and my life.. 
The idea of killing myself isn't as scary compared to last time I have this idea... I can hardly feel anything my heart feel sore..
