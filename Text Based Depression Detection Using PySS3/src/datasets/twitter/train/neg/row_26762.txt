Every day Iâ€™m waiting for the right time to dieIâ€™ve suffered from depression for the past 8 years. Iâ€™ve been cutting for around 5 years at this point. Iâ€™ve stopped trying to even hide it. My family sees the scars and fresh cuts and dosent even raise a question or check if somethingâ€™s wrong. It makes me feel disposable. I feel as if I live everyday waiting for the feeling that my life is officially done and can just die. I grew up abused. I watched the only person I truly cared for die. Any time I search for love it ends horrifically. Iâ€™m at a point in my life where I truly feel like I should either give up or just sorta go through life day to day until I will inevitably die.
