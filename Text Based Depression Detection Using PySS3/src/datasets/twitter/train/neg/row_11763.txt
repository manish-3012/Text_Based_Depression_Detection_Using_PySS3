This is my note.So I've been in a very dark place for the past 2 years. Dealing with epression, anxiety and trigeminal neuralgia is too much for me.  To top it off, I lost my job and haven't been able to tell my parents about it. I'm broke, purposeless and I owe a lot of money to a friend who never really asked me to pay it back, but the guilt is too much.
Today I've finally decided to take my own life. Some people might call me selfish but that's ok. Idc. I know the trauma that I had to face as a child fucked me up. I'm 23 now, but I still can't get over the fact that my own father abused me. I told my Mom when I was 16, but she didn't do anything about it, didn't even ask him if this happened. My brother did, but he refused and now everyone believes him and  behaves like nothing happened. I see him everyday and I feel like killing him. I've thought of it for the past many years. But I don't want to kill another human. That would be very wrong, so killing myself seems to be the best option.  I don't wish to blame anyone for my suicide. I'm doing this because I believe my pain will only stop when I die.
This is my first and only post here on Reddit. I don't even know of anyone will read it. 
Good bye fellas.
