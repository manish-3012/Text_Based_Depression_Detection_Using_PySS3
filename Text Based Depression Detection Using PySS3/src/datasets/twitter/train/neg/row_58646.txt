The Christian religion is a mind fuck.So I am supposed to live up to some degree of cultural standards... Have a job, earn money, raise and provide for a family ... basically function. If I fail I'm supposed to pull myself up by the boot straps, accept help if needed and try again and again... But even if I prove again and again that I am not meant for this world, that I can't function normally, that I am of no value to society, family or anywhere really... I can not take my own life or I will go to hell. Seems like a big fat catch 22. Damned if I do and damned if I don't. I'm so tired, seems like hell is kind of a sweet deal since I won't be the one torturing myself anymore.
