People who have gotten past their suicidal depression and recovered, how did you do it?I have fallen into a serious bout of depression and have been close to suicide. I have been working so hard and trying to live, especially because I don't want to ruin my family's lives. I keep my guns really far way from me, if I didn't I would be at a major risk. I pay a lot to see a therapist maybe once a month and I can barely afford it, I have been trying antidepressants with not much success except screwing me up more but it's hard to tell. I work out a bit, I read CBT workbooks and am learning ways to change my mood. Trying to correct cognitive distortions on my own, trying to fix areas of my life where I am lacking like friends. I am trying and it is exhausting, I feel horrible despair often and anxiety attack every now and then. But I can get past some times now where previously it would ruin my entire day, I guess it's progress, I just don't know if I will get better than this. Getting better is already requiring me to completely change how I think entirely, change my self perception, my goals, how I spend time, everything, I will be a different person if I ever make it through.

If anyone has been here before, can you please explain what it was like for you? What were the major issues, what did you do to get past it? What was helpful, what do you wish you did differently? How is life now? Are you ever scare one day all your progress will fail and you will go back to being close to suicide?

Thanks
