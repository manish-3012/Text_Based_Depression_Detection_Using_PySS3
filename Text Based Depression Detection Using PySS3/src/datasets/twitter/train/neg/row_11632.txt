I canâ€™tI feel suffocated in my own home, 
my culture doesnâ€™t support the idea of kids moving out until they get married so I canâ€™t even move out
I wanna die but I donâ€™t want people around me to know that I killed myself
Iâ€™ve been feeling this way for over seven years 
I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore but I donâ€™t want to hurt the people that love me
Iâ€™m just staying alive for them but I donâ€™t feel it
I really wanna end it but I canâ€™t even do that
I canâ€™t talk to anyone about this because theyâ€™ll think Iâ€™m crazy or psychotic 
They donâ€™t believe in mental health here
The only person I can tell will feel so much pain from this and I donâ€™t wanna tell her Bc I donâ€™t want her to feel responsible or hurt
Iâ€™m not looking for sympathy or â€œit will get betterâ€ 
I just wanna vanish from existence
