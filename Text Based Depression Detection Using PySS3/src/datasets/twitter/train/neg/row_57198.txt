Got a way. Got a why, all I need now is a when.Been lurking in this sub for years at this point waiting for things to get better, but alas it did don't. I'm pretty much ready to go I think, I have no interest in spending much more time living since it just feels like the same fucking thing over and over again.

I've prepared a (from what I can tell) foolproof method that will kill me one way or another. Cheers for the support over the years and I'll see you guys in hell.
