family is too muchI can't stay here too long. Everyone is so angry. They don't know how it's affecting everyone. Mom used to frequently wake me angrily when I was younger. I would get anxiety every morning. She knew I had sleep paralysis every night. For years, I've had 4 hours of sleep. My physical condition is holding me back. It's hard to think now and no matter what my mind is a fuzz.
