Honestly why do I put up with this existenceSo many things have happened in my life lately that just pushes me to ending it all.

My drug addict sister who abused our parents, is in and out of the hospital and had a baby with severe health issues due to her drug use that has now been pushed on to my mom.

Finals and mediocre grades. Im years from graduating even though I should have graduated this year.

Financial debt that got mostly racked up from school and letting a boyfriend take advantage of me.

Im still not over being in an abusive relationship 2+ years ago. And my most recent ex didn't take me seriously because I was in an abusive relationship, so that opened old wounds.

I fell madly in love with someone who is terrible for me (again). I broke it off with him but thinking about going through life without him makes me feel so alone.

Honestly, life hasn't gotten better. I've just gotten used to disappointment, grief and loneliness.

I'm think I'm finally going to kill myself by the end of the year.
