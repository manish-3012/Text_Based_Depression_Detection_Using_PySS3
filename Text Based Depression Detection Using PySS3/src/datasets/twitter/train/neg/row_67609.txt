No, not now. For the last while I was fine, but a few days ago suicidal thoughts hit me like a fucking truck. It's affecting my performance at school now. I don't understand what the hell is going on anymore. It's getting harder to resist jumping underneath one of these transport trucks. And of course this had to come around when I was doing alright. 

My usual ways of coping aren't working, and I wonder if it's because I've been facing a big moral dilemma on top of things. I hate that I would rather die than do something about it. It will either make me feel worse, or maybe better. Damn, I don't know. 

Still breathing. For now.
