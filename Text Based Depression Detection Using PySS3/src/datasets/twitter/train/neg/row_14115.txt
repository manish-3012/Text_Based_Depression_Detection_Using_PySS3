Concerned about someoneMy friend is dealing with a suicidal person right now. The person had attempted multiple suicide attempts in the past. They're only in contact via social media and there's no chance of real life contact. Telling a person to keep an eye on the suicidal person is a bit hard, we wouldn't want to burden another person with this type of information as we don't know how they'll take it. Additionally, if this person does end up taking their life then the person we told to keep an eye on them might feel like they have blood on their hands.

Currently the friend is trying their best to talk them out of it, but is terrified. The person had agreed to call my friend if they do decide to commit suicide to have one last call. That's when my friend is planning to call the police to hopefully stop and save them.

Unfortunately there is no national suicidal hotline in this country.
Any advice on anything that could be done?
