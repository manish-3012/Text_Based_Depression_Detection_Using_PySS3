I don't want to hurt myself or take my own life, I just want it to be overPart of me knows that the things I'm dealing with right now are temporary. But the cyclical, up-and-down, good-to-bad-to-good and back again rhythm of life is not. Yes, things are going to get better. But then they're going to get worse again.

I know I have friends who love me. I have a pet to take care of. I have work to do for business clients. But I feel so lonely, and knowing that even if things will get better, they'll get worse again, makes it all seem completely meaningless. I just wish I could fall asleep and never wake up, without it being my own action.
