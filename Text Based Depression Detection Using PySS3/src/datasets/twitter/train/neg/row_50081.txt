My friend left me to dieMy friend claims she cares about me and I said I was going to kill myself this week. She agreed to talk later about when the time comes and it came. She said she was sick of my shit and said she wanted a break from me. She is now ignoring all my messages. Worst thing is she is my only friend. I guess I was right all along that no one really does care about me. I have plans for today or tommorow to hang myself at midnight.
