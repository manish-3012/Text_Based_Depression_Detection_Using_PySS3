I really don't think I can do this anymore.I've spent the last three years convincing my parents and friends that I've gotten better, when within the past six months I've been in a total downward spiral with no foreseeable way to stop it. I can't deal with the shame and the hurt I'd place on my parents if I told them I was struggling again.. I just want to disappear. Maybe I will. It sounds like the best option now, and I can't reach out to anyone else because I feel like they'll tell my family.
