I got the closest Iâ€™ve ever been to killing myself last night: need adviceSorry in advance, as Iâ€™m new to Reddit and really donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing. Iâ€™ve been extremely depressed and somewhat suicidal for about the last 2 months. Iâ€™ve pretty much always struggled with depressed but I havenâ€™t gotten this low in years. Yesterday evening once I had time to myself I sunk back into a dark place I had been in the day before as well. Except yesterday, it got much darker. I began wandering around my campus aimlessly because I didnâ€™t want to be at home. I started to burn myself. Iâ€™ve never self harmed before 2 days ago. I wandered for hours just sitting place to place either crying or feeling absolutely nothing. the things that I remind myself of that usually make me not want to die werenâ€™t working. I started thinking of ways I could kill myself easily in that moment, which was big because I usually donâ€™t plan or get too emotional to plan. I didnâ€™t tell anyone what was going on until I snapped into a moment of clarity and texted my best friend that I really needed help. Itâ€™s the following morning and he still hasnâ€™t opened the messages, but I could see where he was on Snapchat and at one point he was at a bar so Iâ€™m sure he was drunk and avoiding me which really hurt. I almost fell asleep in a field just because I didnâ€™t want to go back. I ended up smoking a lot of weed and feeling better, but that was a just a temporary solution. I know this post is really long I just donâ€™t know what to do and I feel like Iâ€™m running out of options. Any comment would help. Thank you.

Note: Iâ€™m not sure if this is related to the events now, but I tried acid for the first time on Saturday and had a really good trip except that the friend I did it with got depressed on the come down and left only saying â€œI need to be aloneâ€ which made me kinda spiral and get really anxious and depressed. Today makes 3 days since the trip and Iâ€™m not sure if my mood now and the trip are related and to what degree. thought Iâ€™d add this at the end just in case.
