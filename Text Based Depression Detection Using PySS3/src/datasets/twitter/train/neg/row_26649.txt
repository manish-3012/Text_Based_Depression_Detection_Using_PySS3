Iâ€™m Officially Done, I think Iâ€™m cursedI have no skills, Iâ€™m struggling to grow a business because I have no money, I canâ€™t deliver with postmates because my parents started door dashing. Because apparently both of them having jobs isnâ€™t paying the fucking bills, I canâ€™t get a job either because it will take forever and Iâ€™ll have to take a bus or Uber there, because like I said I have no money

I donâ€™t even know why I try. I tried every way to make money, I tried to think positive and find ways around it. None of it worked. So Iâ€™m done thinking positive and Iâ€™m done trying. Iâ€™m just going to keep failing if I try. I wonâ€™t make any results

Iâ€™ve been trying for months.. but now I think Iâ€™m borderline cursed. By some black magic or something. There is no other cause. It canâ€™t be coincidence, I canâ€™t fail THIS many times. Iâ€™m at the point where I have ZERO ways to make money

All I can do now is ask the internet for money

Like that will ever happen

If you want to help me the least you can do is tell me how to end my life quickly and painlessly without spending money

DO NOT try to help me, DO NOT pity me, I want to die. I know no one will listen so anyone that does this is going to really get it
