Might need some help!This is my first post on a sub so i apologize for any mistakes. So to start it off, I am a 20 yo boy (finished first year of university 3 months ago). Iâ€™ve been suffering with depression,social anxiety etc. for a couple of years (4-5 years) and that has been leading to me having suicidal thoughts constantly. Last night i decided to commit suicide through either OD or wrist slitting (yeah,both ineffective and pathetic ways but those where the only ways i could for the moment), but i couldnâ€™t do it just because I couldnâ€™t hurt my family (parents and two brothers). The reason why i decided to kill myself is that i am a terrible person, to specify it more, a liar. Last year i decided to attend university in another city. But my depression and social anxiety made it really tough for me to study there (skipped classes, didnâ€™t make any friends,was too lazy to study etc.). In the end i failed the first year, but i havenâ€™t told my parents yet only because i didnâ€™t want to see them sad and because i had already decided to commit suicide by the start of second year. (Just FYI, my parents have paid for everything,so me failing the classes has really fcked me up). This is where i need your help. Should i confront them about everything? If yes, how? Because i donâ€™t have the guts to look at them in the eyes and tell them about failing classes, trying to commit suicide etc. Even in the moment Iâ€™m writing this i still think of OD-ing so please tell me what to do and sorry for the long text. Have a nice day.
