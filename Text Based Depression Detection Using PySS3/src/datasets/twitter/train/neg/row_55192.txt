Can I just sleep forever and a halfPlease I just want to not feel anymore. It hurts so much and I cant even feel anymore. Everything I think I feel is not actually there its like living in a bubble with all the negative thoughts just piercing through your brain like needles. I crave the slice of a razor on my arms like little fireworks in streams of red. I could never have the balls to kill myself but god would it be so nice to have the peace of sleeping forever. My head hurts all the time and I dont know what to do, my family cares about me like they care about the spider living under the fridge. They don't im just there no one does actually care and I honestly dont want them to care. Just one bullet to the head or swift jump off a high bridge. I've researched how many floors it would it take to actually die so many times I can tell you a story about how to properly kill yourself
