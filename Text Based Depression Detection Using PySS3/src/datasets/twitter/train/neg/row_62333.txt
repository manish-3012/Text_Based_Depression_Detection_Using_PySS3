Will I ever stop thinking about suicide?I've been having suicidal thoughts almost daily since I can remember (10ish). I'm on anti-depressants and mood stabilizes, and have been for awhile. I'm even happy some days, but will still think about killing myself at least a few times.

I guess I'm wondering if anyone out there has been able to escape the suicidal thoughts. I don't think its possible anymore, and boy am I tired of constantly thinking about how killing myself is the thing to do.
