How different would the world be if everyone just did it?Obviously I don't condone nor am i telling anyone to commit suicide. But imagine if we all just did it one day, every one of us that considered it, and succeeded in doing it. How many people would go? How different would the world be without us? Better? Worse?

Just a thought
