I'm trying so hardEveryday just feels like its getting worse. None of them are like cataclysmic but I still think about ending it everyday even on the good days. 

I'm in therapy and have been in partial and intensive outpatient for the last two and a half months and they have definitely been helping but I still have these thoughts. I still fight myself on whether or not to self harm I still fight myself on whether or not to just leave a note for everyone important and leave. 

I appreciate all the messages I have received from those of you on this subreddit. I haven't responded as I've been using this as more of a venting place since telling people in my life usually just causes more problems. 

How do those of you struggling with something similar cope?
