After a lot of consideration, I realized I should probably die.I've always known I'm a shitty person. Today my sister told me I need to start taking responsibility because my misery is my own fault. I know she's right-- I'm irreparably broken. My happiness can only last a few months at a time and even then, it's just artificial. Too much energy and reckless decisions make a person feel like they're happy and they're having fun. I always come crashing down with the realization that I'm ugly, untalented, awkward, selfish, and stupid. 

I show no promise in my life. I'm twenty years old and I've never even had friends or a serious relationship. I know people don't like having me around. Whenever I come home from my school, my family makes it a point to tell me I'm a burden, that I get in the way, I annoy them, etc. 

I feel like a mirror image of a person. Backwards. An illusion. If you reached out and touched me, you would cold, hard, glass.

I don't really want to die. But I don't have any other choice. I'm out of options and nobody wants me around anyways. Dying is the single most altruistic thing I can do.  I've already chosen a method and started writing my note. I hope whoever finds my body can forgive me for the trouble I cause.
