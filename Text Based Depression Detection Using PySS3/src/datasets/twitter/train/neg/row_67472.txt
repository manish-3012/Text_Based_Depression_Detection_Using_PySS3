I can't stop imagining itIt's a relief to imagine finally dying. I do it all day no matter what's happening. I can't tell anyone because it'll bum them out or they'll think I'm crazy. I don't want to burden anyone with worrying about me. But I don't want to live. I don't want to make plans or hang out with friends or even wake up.
