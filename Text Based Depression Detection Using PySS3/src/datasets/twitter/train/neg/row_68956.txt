I'm a disgracei literally made a new account to post this cus im ashamed.

im 17, college apps are due soon. my grades are horrible. my portfolio is shit. I probably cant make it into my top colleges. I had a way better upbringing compared to many other teens out there, but even so I end up disappointing my parents and myself over and over again.

im ashamed to tell my friends about my bad grades. i'm ashamed to tell others about my suicidal thoughts. honestly ik my problems dont even compare to many people out there. I don't even deserve to feel sad abt my life. I brought this all upon myself anyways.

everything about me is a disappointment. sorry for the rant
