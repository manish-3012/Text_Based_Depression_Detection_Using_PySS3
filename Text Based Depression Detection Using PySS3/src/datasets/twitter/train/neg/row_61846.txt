Ready to end itI've been having suicidal thoughts for years but I never payed them much attention. They were just impulsive thoughts that would pass, and they did. I would think about ways to properly suicide, though I never seriously considered it.

But these past few months have been a mix of hell and extreme apathy for me. I finally want to end everything, because I'm a coward who doesnt want to fix her problems nor ask for help. All I ever do is try to fill the void in me and pretend to be happy and okay to most of the people in my life. I only reached out to one friend, and even so I didnt fully tell her everything because I didnt want to burden her with more of my suicidal thoughts. I knew it worried her. I wish I could stop.

I'm surrounded by people who could be burdened by my death, and I don't want to pass my pain to them. I want my siblings to have a bright future, I want my parents to have a happy life. But I don't want to do this anymore, the solutions I can think of are getting blocked by too many things. I want to either run away or die. I just wish people didnt care about me in a way that my death would hurt them a lot. The only positive thing I can think of about my death is that I can finally find peace, and that the person I hate would be screwed over because of my suicide.
