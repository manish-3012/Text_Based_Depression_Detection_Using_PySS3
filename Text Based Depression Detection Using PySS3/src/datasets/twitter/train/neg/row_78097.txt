The thoughts never endTaken straight from my diary.

All I ever think about is dying. Its the first thought that comes to my mind when I wake up every morning. And it repeats, over and over and over again, like a broken record. I can't focus on anything else. This isn't a way to live. How can someone live when all they think about is dying? I'm 22 years old, alone, depressed, and I don't know what I'm doing with my life. This type of thinking is so painful to live with, day in and day out. Sometimes I wonder, those little moments called "happiness"; are they even real? Or am I pretending, lying to myself to make it seem like I'm okay? I'm scared to tell people thoughts and feelings. "You're a grown ass man, you're not a child anymore, quit being such a pussy." "I've been there before, everyone goes through depression, stop thinking those thoughts." These are some of the responses I've gotten from people. Maybe they're right. But either way, it does not help me. In fact, it makes me want to isolate myself even more. I don't blame them, I'm so fucked up in the head that I can't understand what they're telling me. I know I need help, but it seems like there is no help to be found. The VA fucking sucks, and all they do is prescribe pills, as if that'll solve the problem. If I didn't give my thoughts so much power, maybe I'd be okay, maybe if I didn't believe all those negative thoughts I have of myself, then everything would be fine. But unfortunately, I can't. I'd rather just stop the thoughts all together. And that means ending my life.
