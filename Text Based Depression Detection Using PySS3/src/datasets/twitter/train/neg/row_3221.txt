I deserve my shitty life.I'm angry, full of hatred and selfishness. I hate every God damn person who cares about me and only love those that don't want me. I ruined my life completely and no matter how many times people tell me that I can get back and things can get better, I know it's not true. Shitty people never stop being shitty. Bad people never change, and I'm a bad person. I can't wait to take my bath in an hour and slit my wrists and hopefully get the job done right. I'll be doing the world and myself such a huge favor. No one needs my demon spirit around any longer, and I refuse to deal with myself anymore.
