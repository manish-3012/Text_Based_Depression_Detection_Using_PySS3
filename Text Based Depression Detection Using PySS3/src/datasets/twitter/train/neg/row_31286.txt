Happy lifeI've had intrusive thoughts for a while about offing myself. It started when I failed my A levels and had to repeat a year. I think it was the lasting disappointment from my parents and seeing my only friends move away to university that started this. This might seem a very poor reasoning but it's what I've got. 


I'm 23. I graduated from an OK Uni last year with a 2.2. Not the worst, but it was another disappointment. I never made any friends at Uni, and the flatmates I made in halls in the first year quickly swapped me for someone else midway through my second year, leaving me to live on my own for my final year.


Since then I've just sort of existed. Doing nothing apart from working for rent. I come home and stare at the ceiling or reddit for hours. It was last night when I was thinking about moving abroad and starting a new life that I realized I needed actual useful qualifications. This is also the reason I've not had much success in getting a job with career prospects. 


I've sat down and realized how boring my life is going to be. I'm not ugly, but I'm not attractive. I'm not unintelligent, but I'm not smart either. I just sort of exist in the middle. Ever since then I can't get the thought out of my head of just ending. Living through 50 years of this seems excruciating.


I don't have any friends or hobbies, or close family - I fell out of contact with anyone I knew. Everything just feels so tiring and grey these days and I don't see any way out.
