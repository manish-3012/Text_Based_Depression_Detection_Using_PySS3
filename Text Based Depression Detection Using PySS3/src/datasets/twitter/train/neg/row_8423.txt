What happens if you die by suicide with your property?I have a interesting situation, I've decided I want to be with my little girl who was killed 12 years ago now.
I own a lifestyle property and Orchard and many animals, a couple weeks ago my partner of ten years left, I don't want him back this is not a cry for someone to stop me, I just want to know exactly how I can tie everything up nice and tidy before I leave to be with her. 
I have a $76000 mortgage and it's the only debt I hold atm, and I won't leave until I know that this will be paid from my insurance. My conundrum is that at this time my ex is the benefactor, can this be changed without affecting the insurance or mortgage in the meantime? Anyone else know how it all works?
