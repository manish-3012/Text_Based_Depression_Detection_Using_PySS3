I wish someone would do it for me...I'm too much of a wimp to commit suicide. I just wish someone would walk up to me and shoot me without the person getting caught. They probably wouldn't get caught anyway, it's not like anyone would even notice that I was gone. Maybe someone will do the deed for me one day, but until then, I guess I'll just live in this hell we call life
