iI will go through long periods of being normal and functional and not having any symptoms or negative thoughts.

Then I am thrown into the negative/unhealthy thoughts and my symptoms start coming back. This is one of those times where it has come back. When I am functioning and â€œnormalâ€ and I look back on myself when i am not being normal, itâ€™s like looking back on a different person. Looking back I know how crazy and annoying and weird the things i think are.

Now that i am back in this mindset I feel crazy. But mostly iâ€™m frustrated. I am beyond frustrated I am like this. On good days I can convince myself iâ€™m normal and i was just going through a phase. However, in times like this i am reminded that i am sick and this will always happen. I am not normal. It feels like a hidden sickness that I have to work so hard to hide from everyone. I am disgusted and disappointed in myself. I wish I could always feel â€œnormalâ€. Now day to day I am exhausted and I feel alienated and alone.
