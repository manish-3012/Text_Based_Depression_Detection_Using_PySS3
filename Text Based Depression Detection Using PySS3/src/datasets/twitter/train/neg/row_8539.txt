19 years old and it already feels like my life is over. i donâ€™t know how much more of this i can take. (vent)it started with a diagnosis of depression and anxiety aged 14. then aspergers. then borderline personality disorder. then bulimia. in the middle of all this, my friend killed herself, i attempted suicide myself, i watched my family deteriorate before my very eyes and every single dream i tried to make come true seemed to slip between my fingers. i got so close to being the person i wanted to be - i left home, got a great job (which i hated, but ironically it was a job most people would die for) and i almost made it. but my brain said no, i fucked it all up, and i am left with nothing. iâ€™ve pushed away everything i care about, and the people who are left resent me because i believe thereâ€™s no possible way they could fix this. i have no prospects. no future. no relationship. i canâ€™t see a single reason to keep going in a world that would benefit from my death. all i do is cause pain to the people i love. and the most depressing part is, i keep pussying out. if i had the guts to actually end it all i would be long gone. iâ€™m too pathetic to do everyone a favour and kill myself. i canâ€™t do it. iâ€™m so fucking weak. all iâ€™m waiting for is that final push that sends me over the edge, so i can finally push the blade down and be happy. i know this is all horribly depressing, but i have nobody and i needed to vent about this shit.
