I don't think I'm ok anymoreI feel like I've been pretending that I'm ok for so long and I can't do it anymore. I can't keep the bad thoughts away telling me that I'm useless and unwanted. I feel so alone. I feel like I've fucked everything up. I just want to stop feeling. My brain keeps thinking about death and about how it might not be so bad if I was dead. They feel like they aren't my thoughts but they won't go away.

I think I'm safe today. I have my kids at home and would never put them at risk. Tomorrow I'm on my own and I'm not certain I'll be safe. I've always been certain I'd be safe before. Now I'm not and I'm really scared.
