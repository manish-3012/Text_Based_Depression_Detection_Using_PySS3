Nobody gets it! NOTHING IS â€œFINEâ€!I am tired of the world, society, my emotions, and myself! My family will never get whatâ€™s going on, and they always lose their temper on me! I want to talk to a counselor, but I have trouble expressing things verbally. Society would never listen, they are just to committed to their own selfishness. The world is getting worse and worse by the day, and letâ€™s face it, itâ€™s never getting better. So you know what, Iâ€™m done trying! My anxiety, depression, and OCD have gotten worse and worse to the point where it controls me like a puppet. I have gotten bullied since third grade, and I have tried to get my personal, social, and school life (I get sub par grades but I used to get honor roll). So guess what, from this point onward, I GIVE UP! IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT WORLD!? YOU HAVE BROKEN ME!!! I hope everyone is proud of themselves!
