I'm not depressed anymoreeverything feels like there's no meaning in it and I don't even feel sad anymore. I'm so bored of life. Not a single good thing is in my life. I've studied art my whole life yet my arts are so shitty it makes me pissed. I don't have money and my family hates me and I don't have close friends. I don't have hobbies because everything seems so pointless. why tf do I have to keep living? I really don't know.
