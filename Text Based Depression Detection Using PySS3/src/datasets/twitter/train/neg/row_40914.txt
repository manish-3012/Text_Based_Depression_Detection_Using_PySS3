Girl asked me if I was depressedA girl in my class, don't know her very well and I'm not sure about her at all. Just randomly asked if I was depressed. I was taken back from the question, I said no. But anyone could tell from my hesitation that I was. 

Gonna be a shock when she hears of my death, huh?
