I'm worried about my brotherI'm sorry, my thoughts are going to be all over the place. 

My brother is suicidal. I could go on about the background as to why, but mostly it's financial. He's in his 30's, two kids (Both "accidents") He doesn't have a job, and he refuses to work for anything pretty much under idk $30/hr. Yet he has no skills on his resume other than flagging. He made over $30/hr flagging (Years ago) and that still wasn't enough apparently. He just refuses to work for anyone period. 

He's had ideas for starting his own business, starts gathering supplies, plans etc andddd stops. He lets a rut or obstacle completely halt it. I get it, that's one of the biggest parts of depression is lack of motivation. But I just do not know how to help him. I've tried everything in the book. My whole family has.

He's smart and capable of great things, but basically has no platform for it. I think he could build that, but again, he has to do that, but his depression just takes over. 

He's had psychiatrists and meds in the past, but it's as if it made it worse. He absolutely refuses any type of help like that. 

I just don't know what to do for him, and I feel it's just a matter of time. Me and him are the ones with the closest connection in the family, so naturally I feel as if it has to be me to help him, and if he does something, I've failed him. This is about him though, not me. We all love him to pieces, but obviously there's only so much we can do.

I don't know what this post is for exactly. I guess maybe get some ideas that maybe we haven't tried. I just need to try and plant a seed that it's okay to get help, people have been helped, and he can get help, but then again, we've tried that. 

Everybody that meets him, loves him.
I just don't want the world to lose this great, kind hearted, funny, dude.
