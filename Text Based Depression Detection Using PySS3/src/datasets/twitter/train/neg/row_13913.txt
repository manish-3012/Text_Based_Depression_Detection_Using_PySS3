My story.I am a 16 year old male that lives in England. I have had illnesses such as depression, anxiety and claustrophobia since i was 13 and in the past week or so everything has got worse. Long story short, i just found out that my "friends" have been talking behind my back and now they have left my completely. I still have one year of high school left and i am completely alone at this point. I don't know how i'm going to last that long.
