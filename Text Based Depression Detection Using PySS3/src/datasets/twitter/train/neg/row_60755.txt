I'm Going to Hang Myself LaterI'm a piece of shit. Everyone is a piece of shit. The world is a piece of shit. No matter how hard I try, I can't think my way out of my own misery. No one really understands me, and I think if they did, they would hate me just as much as I hate myself. I don't have a gun sadly, but I remember the last time I choked myself with my belt it was surprisingly pleasant, so I think I'm going to wrap it around a door handle, or find something more sturdy in my house. I feel bad about how it will affect my dad, but at this point I can't live another day. It'd be nice if I didn't go to hell.
