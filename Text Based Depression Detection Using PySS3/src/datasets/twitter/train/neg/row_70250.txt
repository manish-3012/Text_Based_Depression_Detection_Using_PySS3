I need some opinions...I am a teenager, who has it pretty tough.

My parents are demanding, and i am a germophobe but it doesnt feel like my parents are helping.

They make fun of it a lot, and they always say i am anti social whit them, and they throw some of my stuff out even tough they didnt ask me, and tried to hide it from me.

I feel really hurt, that those who are supposed to guide are like this.

I. have friends and hobbies, but they get critizised my my brother, and he also makes fun of me.

I feel kinda jealous of my friends family, everytime i am over to their house they look so happy.

I feel like i kinda want it to end, but i still have so much to do whit my life, like becoming a better parent than they were.

Am i in too much self pity? am i overreacting?

What should i do in this situation?
