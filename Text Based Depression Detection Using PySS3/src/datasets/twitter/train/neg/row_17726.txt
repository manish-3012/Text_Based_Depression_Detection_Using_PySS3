Will they care?My ex coworker was shot dead by my ex boss. Reports say accident. Emplyeees there, everyone that knew him were depressed that day, it was the day before Christmas. I cried and I never moarned someone's death before.

A day passed. One day. All of those guys that acted depressed and pretended to cry were over it, had a happy Christmas, and forgot about him. 7 days later no one even speaks about it, that restaurant where he died had reopened and the old customers and his friends go there to drink and have fun, as if nothing happened.

"imagine how sad they will feel"
The only people that will even remember it after a week are your families. And if you hate each other already, who then? What's there supposed to stop me?

We live and die for one thing, money. You leave money behind, they will speak good about you. You leave nothing, waste of life. Waste of time. Waste of their efforts and resources.
