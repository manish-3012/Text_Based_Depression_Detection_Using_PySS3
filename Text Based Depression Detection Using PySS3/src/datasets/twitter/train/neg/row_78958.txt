I feel dumb.I keep crying. I can hear my dad yelling at me in my head. I feel so dumb. I don't even know where this came from. I just feel so childish. Even now, I can't take his criticism well. I just want a hug.

I want to talk about it and be asked if I'm okay and I want to feel safe, but I'm alone here. The friends that I know in real life - I can't bother them with kind of thing. It's depressing to have to hear about how your friend just wants to die. I've been on the giving and the receiving end of that, and I know how hard it is so I'm not going to bring it up with them. I don't know. I just want a hug.
