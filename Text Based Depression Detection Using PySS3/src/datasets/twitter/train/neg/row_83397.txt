Easiest way to kill my selfJust really want to know the easiest way,with the least amount of money spent and something I can do at home. Like Iâ€™ve seen about people dying from abusing solvent (deodorant) but I donâ€™t get how that would work. Iâ€™ve tried â€œhangingâ€ by tying shoe laces together and tying it to my bedroom window. But every time I get close my body just panics and stops myself. My house is pretty suicide proof to. Nothing really to hang from in my room. The only place really would be the stairs but Iâ€™d get found before I could even die. I donâ€™t want talking out of this. I just want someone to give me a solution to this. Iâ€™ve already attempted multiple times and failed in each attempt pathetically.
