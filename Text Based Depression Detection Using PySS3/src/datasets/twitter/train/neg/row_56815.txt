Help me guysI don't talk to anyone about this, had therapy sessions after I became single and told him I couldn't do it to my loved ones. Over the last 9+ months I have scary thoughts, I sleep with my pistol because "just in case of intruder"

I have debt, no SO, family all have their own problems and rarely pay attention to me, stress is building, and I just got into a short but heated argument with my roommate. I refuse to take medications, and have a strong mind over matter personality, but can't shake these thoughts. Its better than the original nights where I had gun in hand, but I don't want to hear pity and 'classic' "we need you/love you/would miss you dearly" I've even gone so far as to not cry for help(because I know that's the first sign, I've delt with it before in others), because I ask for enough as it is. I can't see any point to my continuing life. I clean after ungrateful classist assholes, I'm living at home again at 24, and don't see any other way to get myself out of this terrible funk..... hopefully you can help me a bit
