Ruining my family.So. I've been diagnosed with major depression, PTSD, and have been told that I may have Dissociative Identity Disorder. Yesterday, I told my single mum that I wanted to go meet my idols in Birmingham, UK. I live in Singapore. I wanted to go there on the 27th of February. They disagreed (which is sensible). I initially said I was ok with not going. But then I sensed something change within me, and I flipped out. I lost my shit, I went berserk. Started cutting myself, almost cut vertically. Blood was dripping. Argued with my mum, she broke down. Then I felt something change again, and I broke down crying as well. Then I felt something change AGAIN and I went all stone-faced. I didn't give a shit that she was crying. I just left the room. And then I fell asleep and woke up the next day feeling terrible. I don't know what's happening. I wanna die.
