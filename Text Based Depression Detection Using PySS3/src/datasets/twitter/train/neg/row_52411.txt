I'm not actively suicidal, but if I died tomorrow, I'd have no problem.I have a lot to live for, and I know there are people who love me, but at the end of the day, it doesn't make up for the overwhelming sense of worthlessness and lack of belonging that I feel literally all the time. No one who claims to love me seems to be able to stand me for more than a few hours at a time. 

I've tried so hard, for so long. As long as I can possibly remember. But it never gets better. My worth is never recognized, and everything I strive for bears no fruit. I'm just so tired. It's all I can do to just show up to work tomorrow and pretend to care, while I'm rotting away inside. Its been so long since I was happy and content with life, I honestly don't remember.
