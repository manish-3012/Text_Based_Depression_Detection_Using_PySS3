Just found out my little 14 year old is also suicidal and being abused and I feel it is my faultI donâ€™t have the stomach to say this but it feels as if my brain has gone numb from the overflow of thoughts. Iâ€™ve never said this out loud and every time I think of it, I want to kill myself of anger towards myself. I will just say it
When I was a kid, I donâ€™t remember how young, I wasnâ€™t thinking and I didnâ€™t think or process how bad it was what I was doing, I took advantage of..her while she was asleep 
I donâ€™t want to get in details but it was not too explicit but enough to ruin my life mentally and haunt me. I never thought me, how could I, Iâ€™m the nicest, genuine guy I know. I care for people, loving family and I am a part of that, why did I do that. Why did god allow this to happen. Iâ€™m a fucking freak for it and I get shivers.
Besides those thoughts buried deep in my head, Iâ€™ve always fought depression, and since Iâ€™ve moved out on my own, itâ€™s become serious. 
Today I found out my sister has been getting abused through text trying to get her to do things by some fucking creeps, they mentally abuse her and have led her to believe sheâ€™s nothing. Theyâ€™ve pushed her to become sucidal. My whole life Iâ€™ve tried to make sure I guide her to live the life she deserves, sheâ€™s just a fucking wholehearted kid. Iâ€™ve always tried to be a good role model and then this shit. She seeks attention and a feeling of acceptance and Iâ€™m filled with the thought that maybe she wasnâ€™t fully asleep, and itâ€™s fried her brain since then and Iâ€™ve caused this... I donâ€™t know how to live with myself. Please someone help
