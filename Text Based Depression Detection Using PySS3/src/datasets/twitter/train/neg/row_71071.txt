Attempted to kill myself todayToday, my dad and I had an argument. Well, more like, he got irritated about me that he told me everything how he felt and I'm just silent, since I can't really talk back on my dad. So he was telling me that I'm going crazy, I should never have called for help in FB and just killed myself, I should just die. And he knows I have depression. 

So I did the most logical thing to do. I tried to drown myself in the shower. I had a large bucket, filled it up and stuck my head in there. 

Unfortunately, survival instincts kicked in and I didn't die. I did this three times but I would always grasp for air. I realized that this is a too gruesome death, I dont want to be found naked, and I haven't wrote a new suicide note yet. So I decided to not kill myself today. 

Someday, I'll do it. Just need the right method. 

Edit: starvation sounds like a good idea.
