My friend on Discord wants to kill himself. He's obviously depressed but I don't know what to do.### **Update:** Things seem to be getting better for the guy, and I'm very happy about that. He's getting rest now and I hope he'll be good when he's done with that. Thank you to those who upvoted and even replied.

This is my first time ever dealing with a depressed friend, go easy on me if I'm doing something wrong.

3 days ago he was totally fine. We were having fun in servers, we had fun in DMs, he was acting totally normal. I thought he was like 13 years old or 15-16 years old. We've been friends for months and he's been totally normal (until now i guess).

One day later, I think he was just messing with me in DMs, he was acting drunk and tired and such and it was probably inspired by his little alias change where he gave himself an avatar of a custom drawn version of the head of the character "Rick" from Rick and Morty, and also changed his display name to "Rick" as well. He hasn't changed any of that since. I guess he was just messing with me because we play around in DMs a lot.

Today it went a bit too far. For the past 7 hours, he's literally been contemplating suicide and I've been trying to help him but he either ignores me and says something else about wanting to die, or he says he just "can't do it" or he doesn't want to try. And remember when I said "I thought he was like 13 years old or 15-16 years old" ? Well, he told me he's TWENTY today. I was not expecting that at all and I don't know if he's lying about that or not. It's one thing that makes me believe he's faking all of this, but everything else he's been saying does NOT seem fake. I'm not even 15 yet and now he's telling me that he's 20 years old, we've been friends for so long and I don't know whether or not to believe that such an age gap between us really exists. Anyways, I don't know if I should be giving him the advice I'm giving, but basically I'm trying to tell him that it will get better for him if he actually tries. Like, if he works hard, if he stops drinking (he told me he's suffering from a hangover, seems he's been drinking alcohol as well), and if he actually takes the advice I've been giving him, he can approve. I've been paraphrasing stuff like that for hours now but he simply wants to die.

He revealed a lot of crazy stuff I didn't know about AT ALL today, for instance, he told me that he had a boyfriend in 2013 who died that same year. Apparently he's been depressed for **years** and it's been getting worse ever since his boyfriend died. He's been so sad and lonely about that, apparently, poor guy... and he wants to die so that he can see his boyfriend in heaven. I bet that's a common thing with a lot of depressed people, wanting to commit suicide due to a loved one already dying. How can I help him when he's dealing with such a thing? What advice have you guys given others who are depressed due to loved ones previously dying?

On the other hand, he could be pranking me EXTREMELY well right now, but I just can't tell. The way he's been acting today is EXTREMELY weird but maybe he's just roleplaying. And I hope that's the case and he doesn't actually want to die. He's been telling me that nobody cares about him, that there's no reason he shouldn't kill himself, etc. and I just don't know how else to help. I've been giving him good advice, I've been telling him to take it, I've been telling him to actually try and not say "i can't try" and I just want him to be okay. He's a good friend and I'd rather not see him do such a terrible thing to himself.

He also apparently already tried to kill himself today while I was trying to help him, but failed and was simply left in pain. I wish he had just given up from there but he still wants to end his life.

What should I do to help him? How do I know he's not just messing with me? Feel free to ask any questions if you need more info. Idk what to say...
