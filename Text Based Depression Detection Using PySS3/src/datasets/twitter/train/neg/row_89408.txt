I think it's time but I'm afraidI think I'm ready to give in I have several pets and a toddler child. The father is not a bad person, just misguided and irresponsible. I don't think he could manage being a single father. I don't have any family or friends really. I don't have a gun but I live next to busy train tracks. I'm not a hundred percent sure on the method and I'm not sure how to create a plan for my dependents. Can anyone offer insight of creating a plan for them?
