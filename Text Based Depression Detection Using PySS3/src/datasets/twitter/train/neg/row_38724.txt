What I would've missed out if I died earlierI can never relate to people who say "if I committed suicide last year I wouldn't have missed anything good", because I'm a weird case who can name a dozen things I would've missed out on -- it just doesn't make me less suicidal.

On Friday, nothing was going wrong, but I told myself "OK, that's it, today is the day I die." I hung in there for another day, and on Saturday I tried a macaron for the first time. It was wonderful. One of my favorite forms of social contact is interacting w/ strangers on the street, and I got to experience that again the same day, albeit under bad circumstances (I almost crashed my bike.) Afterwards, I had a phenomenal chat w/ my friend. Despite how great that day was, the next morning I thought "why not end things on a good note?"

On one hand, I realize this all means it's impossible to find peace through things outside of myself, and that even if I keep myself busy w/ the things I love 24/7, I will never feel better w/o rebuilding the inner stability that was taken from me by abuse; on the other, I also worry that after spending so many years ruminating on this and actively rehearsing my suicide upwards of 20 times, maybe it's too late for me. It's still worth going to therapy and my support program anyway, though -- even if it were the case that I'm a lost cause, why not make the quality of life a little better for me and others while I'm still here?

Thanks for reading; forgive me if I delete this later.
