I have a plan, y'know. A plan for this Sunday. Another year older, but another year I don't want to go through.Throwaway. My birthday's on Sunday and I think this is it. This is the day that's been waiting for me. Time to let go. I think it fitting, to leave the earth on the same day I was brought into it.

I've tried for so many years to get better. This cesspool of self-hatred, anger, envy, and general feelings of self-hatred have been slowly welling up, day by day. I can't take it anymore. There's really nothing left for me now. 

There's a certainty within me that the people I call friends and family will do so much better without me. One less piece of scum ridden from the earth. Already many have commented how distant and much colder I've become. I'm losing them. I'm losing me.

I'm done with this.
