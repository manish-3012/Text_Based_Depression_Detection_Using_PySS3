I'm scared to kill myself, but it needs to be done!Why the hell can't I just do it!? I've come so close to killing myself numerous times and they all just turn into petty little attempts because I chicken out! I've gotten myself put in the hospital on more than one occasion. I could have been out of this world a long time ago, but here I am, still going though the exact same shit. 

My anxiety is controlling my life and I am almost constantly in a panic attack. Its not something that goes away. I haven't left my house in about 9 months and I have recurring infections, random pains and chronic nausea that I need to see a doctor about. I am nauseated almost constantly. But I can't fucking leave home because i'm scared. I hate life so much. I want it to be over. 

I havent had friends in almost 2 years. I sleep at 10am, get up at 5pm. I stay on my laptop constantly. I neglect my hygiene. I eat CRAP, hardly ever anything healthy. I just don't have a life. I contribute nothing to society, or to my family for that matter. *All* I do is sit at home all day every day. 

I just don't see a reason for anything anymore. I need to get over this pointless fear and realize this is for the better.
