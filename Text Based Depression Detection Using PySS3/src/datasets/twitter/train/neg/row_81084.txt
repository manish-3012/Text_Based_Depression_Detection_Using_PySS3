I think I'm having a crisisI'm really fucking scared and I have absolutely no idea who to reach out to other than people who I know will call the police or something, so here I am. I'm not going to do it today I don't think, I'm just worried I'm going to do it soon. I don't even know why, and I think that's the most frustrating part. I just really really don't want to live. Sorry if this worries anyone I'm just getting kinda desperate for something.
