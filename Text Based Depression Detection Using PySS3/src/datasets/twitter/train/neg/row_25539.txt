Im sorryThis is for courtney.. I hope you understand why you couldnt see this ahead of time.. I dont know if you even care anymore but its probably better if you dont.. If you do though..
For 4 years you gave me purpose. Thank you for that.. Its important for you to know you kept me going this long. Its important for you to know that i don't regret those years. You gave me something special.. I'm sorry i caused you to love something that couldnt work. I knew it was a bad idea when we were talking about the idea of you getting pregnant, i let it happen anyway. I even tried to talk to you about it then.. I tried to push you away.. Do you remember when i cheated on you years ago? I never told you it was because i wanted to give you a reason to walk away.. You forgave me.. And i let you. Like i said.. I dont regret it.. Im just sorry for what ive done to you. I truely hope you can recover from the pain ive caused. I have to believe you guys will be okay. You have all been strong so far. I will be done dragging you guys down soon enough.. Im not sad.. Im not upset. I currently care enough to do whats best rather than whats selfish..
