I can't take the loneliness anymoreI feel so alone, like there's no-one that cares for me at all. My family are amazing, my sister especially, she would do anything to see my happy. I have no real friends of my own, I go to university and I have friends there but I mean nothing to any of them outside of university, accept someone the came to if they can't do the work, like I'm a living google search. The friends I do have outside of uni are only because of my sister, this is how much she does for me, even giving me her own friends in an attempt to see me happy but it just doesnt feel the same. My 'best-friend' pushes me aside when anything is wrong and so I have no-one to share my feelings with, no-one to game with, no-one that makes me feel happy.

Just thinking of how much it would upset just my sister is the only thing stopping me right now, and even then it's starting to wear thin...
