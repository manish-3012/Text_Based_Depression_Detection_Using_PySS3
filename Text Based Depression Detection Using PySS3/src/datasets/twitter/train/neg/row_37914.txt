I'm not even worth to be a son or boyfriendI'm a 19 year old boy whose mother has terminally bad kidneys, for this she'll hopefully get one of my fathers kidneys soon. I just feel like a burden, I never show her how much I love her and how much I care about her condition. All I do is bitch about things I dislike and all. Now she's been getting worse and worse and feel awfully lonely since my siblings moved out of the house a long time ago and my father works full time. I'm in school so can't always be with her, but even when I'm home I spend my time in my room and barely even see my mother, does she deserve any of this? I'm a piece of shit for not even talking to her unless she talks to me, I never take her places. I wish she had a better son.
Other than my mother there is another person who is too good for me. My girlfriend, I love her with all my heart and try to make the times we spend together good ones(She lives 4.5k miles away, so we only really message and facetime), but I can't even do that. I get her depressed and can't even seem to make her smile anymore. I'm so scared of losing her and I am far from the right person for her, I just can't lose her I won't be able to take it.

Do I even deserve to be alive? I need to know
