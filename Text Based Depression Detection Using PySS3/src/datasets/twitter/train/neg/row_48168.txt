Here I amI never thought that Iâ€™ll post on this subreddit but here I am, Iâ€™m a 14m and Iâ€™m in the middle of the forest with my stuffed animal that Iâ€™ve had since I was born and a blade along with a shit ton of pain killers I took the first few cuts and drew some blood and Iâ€™m about to take the last few and Iâ€™m typing here to say donâ€™t do what I did go on and live a happy life goodbye
