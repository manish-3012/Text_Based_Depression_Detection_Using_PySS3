I can't do this anymore.I just want to not be such a stupid fucking burden.  I'm useless and always will be.  My grades are poor and I may fail a class.  There's no going back for me if I do.  I just wish I could die.  I've come so close to pulling the trigger or downing every pill we have in the cabinet.  We have some oxycodone.  I think it would be enough.  

I just wish I could lose control of my car or  get hit crossing the street or literally anything.   There's only one reason I want to be alive anymore, but I don't know if it's enough.  Just existing is painful.  

Why cant I just die.
