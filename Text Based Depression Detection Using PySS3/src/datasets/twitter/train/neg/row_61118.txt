Loser helpWhere do I even start? I'm 25. Never kissed, hugged or held hands with a girl. Still a virgin. My social skills are terrible I can't talk to women. I fall in love with girls who I've known for a week, she's obviously gone back to her ex as stupid little me isn't good enough for anyone. I should of known that love for me doesn't last long. I still live at home with parents. My heads a mess my anxiety is through the roof. I worry about everything and everyone. I even worry about where my siblings are constantly. I don't feel suicidal or depressed but I'm beginning to think that I am and this pain is all I've known and I've just got used to it. Not sure where to go from here. I can't keep going on. It's painful just existing. Life is very long when you're lonely........
