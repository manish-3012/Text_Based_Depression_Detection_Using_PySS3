I just want to get out of this house so damn bad. There is no abuse or horrible relationship, I just want to be free and independent...My mom never leaves me alone. I just want some goddamn space. Today, she commented on my stretch marks (something Iâ€™m very insecure about because of body dysmorphia). She said they arenâ€™t very attractive and I should get some cream for them. I know, I know. But it pissed me off so much. Why canâ€™t she just keep her shit to herself? 

I want to be able to cry at any time of the day. I want to be able to play my music out loud whenever I want (music means so so much to me). I want to be able live with someone who I enjoy being around. I want to be able to drive wherever I want, whenever I want. I hate being at this age because I have no freedoms. Why are these years going by so slowly? I thought they were supposed to whiz right by? 

I canâ€™t wait for summer and when the quarantine will end. Iâ€™m going to play tennis, jog, rollerblade, go to my cousins house, go to my friends house, (or whatever) every day. I just want to get away from this house and away from my family. I canâ€™t stand them anymore. I feel like I canâ€™t breathe.
