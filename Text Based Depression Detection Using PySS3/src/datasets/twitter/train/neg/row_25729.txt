I can't take it anymoreMy girlfriend broke up with me today. She called me and said even though she loves me, she doesn't feel in love; the long distance just isn't working. The one person I trusted and cherished the most in the world is gone.

 My mind and body have been regressing in the last couple of weeks and I've been a shell of what I once was. I can barely hold conversation, I can barely process words and speech anymore, and my mind is constantly empty. I'm sluggish and I haven't eaten in days just because I feel so empty. I can't take living anymore. I've tried reaching out but no one will listen. 

I'm going to hang myself like I tried and failed to do on Friday. I've already written my note and I'm going to do it once I say goodnight to my family. Goodbye reddit, thank you for everything. If I somehow fail, then I'll try to come back here to the people that actually helped me when no one else would. Thank you.
