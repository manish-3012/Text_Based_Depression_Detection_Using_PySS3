I can't carry onEvery day everything becomes more and more difficult. 

Every night I lay in bed trying to get to sleep with every unhappy thought in my head, all the thoughts are so disjointed, unclear, as if I can't think properly. 

The only clear thing is that these thoughts are quite literally overwhelming. Every night I resolve to kill myself in the morning. 

Then it's morning. It's not that having slept on it things are better, it's more that I've come down from being past the point of being able to cope to just on the edge of my capability to cope. I go through my awful day, it's evening again and the whole process starts again

One day sooner or later, I feel like sooner, I won't wake up like that. I'll wake up still committed to the idea of killing myself. 

I cannot remember ever being happy or even just okay. I'm 25 now and I can remember crushing unhappiness going back at least to when I was 15. When I was in school I could look to the idea of 'I'll go to university and things will be different, I'll meet new friends, it'll be a new start'. When I was at university and that obviously didn't work out I could think the same about finishing university. Now though there is next stage to look forward to and even if there was I know it'd end up being no better.  Life now is deciding to kill myself in the evenings, deciding against that in the mornings until one day I don't. 

I have nothing good in my life. I have no real friends (and no clue on how to make them), I've never had a meaningful relationship (It's quite difficult letting people close when like this), even my family don't like me that much (the feeling is mutual). Sure I've got a job, but the thought of going to my workplace every day makes me feel physically ill and it's a dead end job that's going nowhere. 

What is the point of living if all living is is a constant fight to have the will to live? I might as well give up now
