It's less like I want to die but more like I don't want to feel anything any more. But death is one way to go. why? I don't know where where else to go.Life is absurd. As there is no god or intrinsic reason for life there is no reason to live. I've tried to "imagine Sisyphus happy" but if I can't. If I can't stand against the absurdity of life then why should I live? I've tried to make myself unable to think of this but I cant. So much for alcohol killing brain cells. I know it's healthier to want to live and feel so something must be wrong with me. What is it? Help. I don'st want to do something wrong.
