Tf is there to do12 months ago i got real sick, had to live in a very poor condition ever since, i am healed now.
Wifey left cause she couldn t stand being with me, our relationship deteriorated due to me being depressed but it was coming for a while imho
Relationship was also abusive, i became verbally abusive due to her physical abuse.
During this year i got very successful at what i do and all i think about really is just giving up and picking up a new drug habit.
I think i consumed mdma 10 times during quarantine, been smoking way too much weed, got back on the cigarettes and the booze, rather heavily might i add.
I m not 30 yet but this new mix of working two days straight on speed and drinks isn t helping.
Diet is also shit but not as bad as it could be.
I don t have a support group cause i never open up for real, there s ppl out there but i always say fuck it
I m so sick of everything and i don t think i have the energy to meet someone new, i don t want a new connection, i don t want wifey back either really, she ain t helping

Sorry for the long rant, i need some new perspectives
