How to get help without being held in hospitalSuicide has gone from something I never thought was possible to highly likely.  I have three young kids, so i havenâ€™t done it yet due to them. 

I live in Florida where the Baker Act allows anyone to be committed for 3 days.  I do not want this to happen.

How do I get help without worrying about being committed or having police involved? My fear is if I tell anyone my mental state is not good they will call the police.
