I don't know if I'm suicidal or just really entitledI know I want to die. I know I have barely any people I actually feel close to. I know depression makes me incapable of forming bonds to people because there's this third person in every relationship who seems set on sabotaging it. I know I feel empty inside. I know learning used to make me happy and now my MSc is draining me of any and all hope. I know I've wasted a shit\-ton of money I didn't have on degrees that have done nothing for my hireability. I know every time I apply for a job and they reject me because there was a better candidate I take it personally. I know I ended a three year relationship cos stress, depression and distance crushed. I don't know if that was the right choice. I don't know if accepting it when one of my only close friends said he'd like to date was the right choice. I don't know if being alive is the right choice. I don't know if I feel like this because my life is genuinely shit, or if I'm just emotionally weak and self\-indulgent. I don't know if I'm just always going to poke holes and find problems and feel sorry for myself because that's just my personality. I hope it isn't. I don't feel like I have a right to hate myself as much as I do, I'm not worth the headspace.
