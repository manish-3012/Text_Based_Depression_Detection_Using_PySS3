My distant girlfriend tried to kill herselfShe seriously has no hope anymore, tonight she spoke with me after a week of passing after a fight. It was a really honest conversation from her. I don't know what to do, I've been crying all night and I haven't slept yet. I just want to teleport to her place and snatch her away to me, but it doesn't seem like she has the will to go on either anymore not even moving to me from her bad place.. I have depression myself and just hearing those brutally honest words is just encouraging to do it myself, I seriously don't know what to do anymore she was the reason I smiled at work I don't want her to die I want to marry her... I can't move on from this I would never be ok I can't help but scribble together these words without crying
