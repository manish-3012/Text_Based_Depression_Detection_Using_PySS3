I just had a mental breakdown.im 17, when i was 7 my dad died, before that my mum spent all my time looking after him, he had Motor neurone disease.

I got no attention as a kid, and developed a communication issue which stops me from being able to express myself and communicate with my own family, whereas talking to friends and strangers is fine.

 this communication issue killed me from the inside over the course of my life.

i began to think about it and like usual fell into a depressive episode again, which spiralled into full blown screaming into a pillow mental breakdown, punching walls and punching everything around me screaming at everything.
i need help. nobody takes my condition seriously. its killing my mental state and destroying me viciously, i need help
please i need help i don't know what to do. therapy does nothing and i am 40th in line because nobody takes me seriously
