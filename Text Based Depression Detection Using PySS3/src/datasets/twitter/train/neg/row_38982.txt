I'm losing EverythingA few months ago I got accused of sexual harassment with little evidence. Not long after that the same girl told my fiancee to leave me because I was telling her we should have sex (I never did) In a few days I lost my job, my fiancee, and my apartment. I know have to live with my parents again, but have no one to talk to, since everyone thinks I abuse and harass women. I don't know what to do, I feel so lonely and useless, i try to talk to my old friends but end up hurting someone. I would feel better died.
