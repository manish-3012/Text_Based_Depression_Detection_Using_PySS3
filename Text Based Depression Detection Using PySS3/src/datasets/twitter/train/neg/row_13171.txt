Hello.I'm not going to kill myself anytime soon so if you're looking to talk to those in immediate need you should skip this post.

I'm far more likely to be a net negative than a net positive in The World (trademark symbol). If I were to kill myself, I'd have done more harm than good because my parents would be distraught. But as I continue to live, I will probably do more harm than good also.

I'm not all bad but what is good about me is replaceable, and the shitty parts of me are uniquely awful. If I didn't exist, the handful of people I am close to would probably be happier because the space in their lives for someone-vaguely-like-me would be filled by someone with my good qualities and without my drawbacks.

The people who have to look at me and/or talk to me on a regular basis likely have a nagging feeling that they could do better, but are afraid of admitting that feeling, even to themselves.

The world is a little worse off because I'm me and not somebody better. And the world really needs help right now. I'm sorry.

I've changed a lot since I discovered this subreddit at 14. I'm 22 now. I'm not depressed anymore. I've done some things, vaguely. But it doesn't really matter. I feel like I have become just good enough to definitely understand that I cannot be good enough.

This sucks.
