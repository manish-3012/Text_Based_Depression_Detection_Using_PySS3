To everyone who is on the verge right nowHey everyone my names dani  i just joined this subreddit . Listen i am here for you. If no one else you can vent to or talk to im here for you. I know everyone on this reddit is going through the same troubles and i would love to help. Im 19 and a transmale, ive gone through depression for maybe 5 or 6 years and its terrible, going to the mental hospital 6 times in a row and attempting suicide in the last two years it was a journy to get through it. I know whatever you are going through it can be fixed and you have a voice. I neevr thought when i was in my worse place that i would be here now with a loving relationship , my own pets, and finally being on hormones for almost 3 years. Things can change and your life can improve. If anyone needs to talk please text me. I know right now you dont want to live but for now try to talk to someone.
