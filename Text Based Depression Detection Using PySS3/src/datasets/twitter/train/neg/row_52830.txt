WhyI feel like everybody in this world has something to live for. Life gets hard and depressing. Most people won't admit it, but everyone has probably had "suicidal thoughts" at one point or another. You gotta be strong, I wanna be someone that has the answer to people's problems. If you wanna kill yourself tell me why, and I'll see if I can help with a solution to your problems.
