Youtube Recommended Me "The Bridge" documentaryI just finished watching it and it's an eye opener. Everyone from friends to family to strangers to one survivor had different opinions about what they've seen, what mistakes that they've made, and how they felt afterwards. I was surprised that some people, like Gene's grandmother and Philip's parents accepted that their children were going to die and they couldn't do nothing about it. Meanwhile, others were in denial and regret their mistakes. 

Just an observation and it's even crazier this got recommended on NYE 2019.
