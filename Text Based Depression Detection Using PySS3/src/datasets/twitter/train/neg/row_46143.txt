I just left the military and I donâ€™t know what to do.I just left the Air Force due to not making rank in the appropriate time and was told I had to get out. I came home two days ago and I feel empty, I hadnâ€™t been close to my family in years and I came back to them and itâ€™s been nothing but short of stressful, just people asking stupid questions and making shitty remarks about each other. And judging, always judging. I donâ€™t know what to do and I feel stranded without purpose now. I donâ€™t think I can start over and I think I wanna end it. Iâ€™m not looking for pity, I donâ€™t know what what Iâ€™m doing.
