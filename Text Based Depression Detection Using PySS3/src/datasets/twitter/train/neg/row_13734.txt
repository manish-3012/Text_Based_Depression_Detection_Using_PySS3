This isn't about me anymore.I am unsubscribing because 100% of the time I come here, I end up feeling worse.  Much worse.

This message is for the others, like me.  There have got to be a few...

I've wanted to die since 1990.  I've had many many different kinds of therapies, constantly, since then.  I am much much worse.  There are no friends or family left for me to talk to.  

My emotional pain is so severe, sometimes gag/choke, involuntarily.  If I was addicted to a chemical substance, there would be a huge variety of long-term residential treatment options for me.  But I have no chemical addictions, and I'm only allotted 50 minutes of therapy/week.  

I have always presented as "normal", and this contributes to the great difficulty I'm having in actually killing myself.

All I want is someone who understands, and will emotionally support me in taking the needed steps.  But this has never been available...

Why does this sub upset me even more?  Because I know that I am in a much much different place than most of the people who post here.  (yeah, when you measure you suffering in decades, you get to make that call).

So, anyone who ACTUALLY understands where I'm coming from, this is to you:

I hate this world that has no room for us and our suffering.
I hate that people decide that our legitimate wishes (to die peacefully) are illegal.
I hate that we keep getting told "Your suicide will upset the people who love you!" - when there are no people who love us.

I hate that this will probably get deleted, downvoted, or empty pleas to hang in there.

I hate that, after this, there is no place else for me to go (I've been looking online for support since I had a dial-up modem)

I hate that all the people like me, are too depressed to come together to help each other.
