Literally what can I do?I want to die, but I tried to kill myself various times and keep getting hospitalised or police involved or whatever.

My GP doesn't want me contacting them.

The hospital just locks me up for several weeks then kicks me out.

How am I meant to die or get help, I'm just suffering, what can I do?
