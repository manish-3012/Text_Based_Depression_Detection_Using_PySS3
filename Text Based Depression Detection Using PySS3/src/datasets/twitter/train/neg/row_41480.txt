I'm so weakI've started to shut everyone out and isolate myself. I don't know if it's a conscious decision anymore. The line between what I'm doing consciously and what my self destructive tendencies want is so blurred now that it's a struggle to tell the difference.


I'm so tired of fighting. I'm too weak to keep on trying to win this losing battle. I just want to lay here here and close my eyes and not wake up. 


It's hard telling the people you love that you can't face it anymore. Especially when they try so hard to make you believe you can carry on when you know that you can't. I guess I'm pushing everyone away so that it's easier to give up fighting. I desperately want this to be over.
