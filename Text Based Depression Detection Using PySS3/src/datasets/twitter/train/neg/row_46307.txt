Ironic.Isn't it ironic that the guy who helped pull at least 6 people out of suicide has no one to listen to his cry for help? Isn't it ironic that the person who spends so much time voluntarily counseling people online has no one to go to? Isn't it ironic that no one cares and no one will notice him being gone? 

I can't do this anymore. I'm done.
