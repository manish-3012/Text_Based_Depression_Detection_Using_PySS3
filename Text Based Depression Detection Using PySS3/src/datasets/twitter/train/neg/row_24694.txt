Been struggling with depression and now suicidal thoughts for two years now, need someone to talk toI've been suffering from invasive suicidal thoughts and severe depression for almost two years, the depression has been around longer. I'd rather not publicly post for what reason, but I need someone to talk to about my situation. I'd prefer a pm with some background about yourself and I'll give a point of contact for you to reach me. Many thanks.
