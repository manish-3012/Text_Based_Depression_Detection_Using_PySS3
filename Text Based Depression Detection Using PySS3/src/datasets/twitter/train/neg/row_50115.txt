Feel Distraught and StuckI was in a relationship with an alcoholic.  One of her kinks was her partner being intoxicated.  In a rush to finish I was a bit loud and telling her I was close and it would be seconds in the hustle as I was passionately talking she told me to stop I didnâ€™t hear her but when I looked back down I saw a visible no revoking consent so I stopped right then and there.  I have no idea what the legal consequences is for this but I canâ€™t live with the guilt.

There were a lot of instances of trauma when I was feeling violated in the relationship when she would berate me for wanting to wear a condom, when I told her some of her kinks I didnâ€™t want to be a part of and the last time we were intimate she convinced me to not wear a condom and forced me to ejaculate by sitting on my while I was inside of her.    

Iâ€™m unsure now that my brain has let me relive this trauma it had protected me from years later.   Lately as yesterday Iâ€™ve been considering taking my own life because I see myself as a sex offender without a conviction and I disgust myself.
