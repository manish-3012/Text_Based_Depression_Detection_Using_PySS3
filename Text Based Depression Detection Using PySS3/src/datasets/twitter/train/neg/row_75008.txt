I have never felt this way...Ever since I have gone to college I have had this struggle with my religion. My family is hardcore about islam, they have followed it by the book. But recently i havent had much faith for it. I left it a 6 months ago, but leaving it has made it much worse for me because while i was trying to figure out who i was because it bothered me it made my grades drop. My parents are upset and wondering how this could have happened but im afraid to tell them because im in big enough trouble as it is. I have smoked weed twice in the last 3 weeks, each time it made everything unpleasing pleasant. should i just smoke for the rest of my life even though it changes who i am?  i have thought about ending it all even though it would be the end of me it would be the a life time of agony for everyone else which is why i have tried to keep away from those thoughts , but i cant help it.
