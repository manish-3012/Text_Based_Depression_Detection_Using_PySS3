First NooseI tied my first noose just now. Ive been thinking about suicide for the last 2 or 3 years but Ive never actually done anything with it. Its just been a series of suicide notes and thinking about how I would do it . But I just found out all 3 of my "best friends" went off to go party together at a university and noone bothered to tell me. So now not only am I sad and lonely as hell, I have no friends, my hands tied this noose on their own and idk what to do anymore I dont even know if I make sense I doubt it
