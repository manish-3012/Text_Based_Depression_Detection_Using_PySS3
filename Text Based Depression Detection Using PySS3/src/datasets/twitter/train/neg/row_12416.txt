JuST WaTCh YoUTuBEI have no skills or talent... I feel lost and confused and I don't know what to do. I have nothing special about me and I feel like I'm going to die and become homeless someday because I can't compete with anyone, and I don't do this "networking" thing that everyone is on about. Its hard and because of Covid I could never do anything even if I wanted to.
