Joy?I can't seem to feel anything but fear and anguish anymore. I don't think I'm going to kill myself. Not quite yet, but I've entertained the idea too many times recently. I suffer from BPD, and pretty extreme hypochondria. Every little thing going on in my body sends shivers down my spine. I used write and play music all the time but I can't even come up with words or melodies anymore, and I don't see much of a reason to go on living like this. All of these are things I can't control, but I know medication would just make it much, much worse. I've even considered picking up heroin as of late. Drugs seem to help the feeling temporarily, and being how I am I'm not too afraid of a heroin overdose. Seems like the best way to go. I honestly don't really know why I'm posting this, I guess it's more of a cry for help or something. But I can't seem to feel any positive emotions anymore.
