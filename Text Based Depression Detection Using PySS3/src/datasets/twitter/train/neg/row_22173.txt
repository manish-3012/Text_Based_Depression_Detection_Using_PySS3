I don't know what to doGod I'm fucking depressed and I've suppressed these emotions for so goddamn long I don't even know if they're minor. I don't know so much. 

Every single day I go to school I get bullied. the people who say they're my friends and say they're there for me will tell me to my face so you're so ugly or oh no one likes you. I tried joining communities I tried joining the ultimate team I tried joining the musical. I'm in the musical right now I'm sitting in the back room contemplating suicide because everyone else got rides to go get food and they left me here alone. I'm just so alone. 

I don't want to die so much as I want all of this to end. I think I'm going to run away. 

I have one friend who has never betrayed me but every single day I hear people ask her oh why are you friends with him. everyday it pushes me a little bit closer to doing something about it.
