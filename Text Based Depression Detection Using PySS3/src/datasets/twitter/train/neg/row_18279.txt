InvisibleI feel like I've already disappeared. When life is better, people are there. It's great. But when I feel like the darkness is closing in on me, I swear everyone else pulls away. My boyfriend told me to see a therapist but I don't really feel like he cares about me anymore. I feel so negative but I think I'm just tiring everyone out.

I am a broken record. I just want to fucking feel something. I don't really want to keep living this way. My throat is tight. I am bitter. What difference will it make?
