I don't feel like I should exist (kind of a vent post?)Or at least on this planet? I'm not entirely sure how to explain this feeling. Have you ever felt like you wish you could just be completely alone, like on another planet? This post is gonna be an absolute mess because it's 3:30 am and I took sleeping pills (the prescribed dose, don't worry) so I apologize in advanced. 
I'm in my room right now and I'm listening to music and I just really don't even feel real. I physically feel like I don't exist right now and it's such an odd feeling. I've been in a really bad place as of late, worse than I have been in a long time, maybe even ever. I've gone through up and downs basically my entire life but this is something else. I always want to die, but usually I think about friends, family, my partner, ect and how they'd feel and talk myself out of it. But it's getting increasingly harder to talk myself out of it. At this point in my life I'm exhausted from just breathing. My mind keeps telling me to do really self destructive things and luckily I haven't yet. I'm not sure how else to get whatever is cluttered in my brain out on here right now so maybe I'll make another post eventually. 
Maybe you folks can ask me some questions to get me thinking about other stuff? If you want, I mean. I'll probably answer later today instead of right away because the medication is making me pretty tired now, but I already know I'll wake up in a not so great state. Hoping I won't have another anxiety dream this time though. Any idea on how to stop those? 
I'm not proof reading any of this tonight, I just don't have the energy. 
Night everyone.
