I thought I could beat it againI did it all over again... Convinced myself that I beat this and that my life was worth something. I'm so stupid to ever think I'm worth anything anymore. I never was and I aren't now and I never will be. The only thing I've ever enjoyed was basketball, and I was actually good for a little while. I think God saw I was doing good at something and snapped his fingers and now I suck. All 2 of my friends are moving off to college and Gabby ( the girl I liked) moved away out of the blue and got a boy friend. I'm not going to college or therapy so please don't tell me to... There's nothing left for me any more. I hate myself with all my heart and I think it's good that I'm gonna die.. I won't ever have to fight it ever again or weigh anybody down.
