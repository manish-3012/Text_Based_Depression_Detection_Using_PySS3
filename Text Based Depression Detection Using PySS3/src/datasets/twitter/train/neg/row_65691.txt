Sleeping is good and itâ€™s better than living lifeMy brain has been very foggy recently and Iâ€™ve been finding it hard to remember things or think properly so apologies if this isnâ€™t well written 

I slept all day and night yesterday and it was like I wasnâ€™t even here any more, just intermittent dreams and blank space, I didnâ€™t even feel hungry just a little thirsty.

 Having a quick meal and drink now and will then Go back to bed and see if I can sleep all day and night again. This feels good. Better than the emptiness and sadness and anxiety. Being awake is like living life through a camera that hurts my heart, but sleeping is like how I used to warn Things to be. No more wants when Iâ€™m awake just an end looming always ahead of me, so sleeping feels great

I dreamt of a beach and a girl and being happy and of getting a haircut
