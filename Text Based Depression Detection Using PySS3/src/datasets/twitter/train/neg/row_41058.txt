Just wanted to say thank you.I don't know any of you, and I likely never will, but to those of you who take the time out and listen to those of us struggling, thank you.

It's still an uphill battle for me, and many days I have trouble with motivation, but I'm more certain of myself. Therefore, I'll be deleting this account.

For those of you out there struggling, keep struggling. Keep embracing the pain, the fear, the anguish. Keep being human. Find joy in the small things, when you can.
