I feel like Iâ€™m going to go deafIâ€™ve had muffled hearing since Tuesday and Iâ€™m starting to think I mightâ€™ve gone partially deaf. The thing is I lost my hearing literally overnight on both of my ears and I canâ€™t go to a doctor because of the coronavirus. Itâ€™s already bad enough Iâ€™m stuck inside the house and I canâ€™t even order any food off of door dash, now Iâ€™m stuck with partial hearing loss until it gets checked out. I used to think it was ear wax but my dad keeps shaking he doesnâ€™t see anything in my ears and Iâ€™m staring to think itâ€™s not just impacted earwax. Despite feeling like there is earwax in my ears. Iâ€™m starting to think I lost my hearing and I swear if I did Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I canâ€™t live like this. At all. No matter what. I donâ€™t understand why of all times I lose my hearing it has to be during the worst possible time. I canâ€™t do anything about it and itâ€™s driving me crazy. Iâ€™m probably going to kill myself tonight
