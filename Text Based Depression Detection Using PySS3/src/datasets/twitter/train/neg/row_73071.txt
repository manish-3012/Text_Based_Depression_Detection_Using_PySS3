Nothing can fill this hole...Iâ€™m sick of this. All of fucking this. Nothing can fill the hole thatâ€™s in me. Not meds, not things, not people, the love of my pet, fucking nothing. Why do I do this?? Why do I carry on when it doesnâ€™t fucking matter! My own life and I canâ€™t even live it for me. I stay alive so as to not hurt anyone but what about me?? Everyone just takes and takes and takes from me and I canâ€™t get shit in return. Not even when I manage to ask. I have no one to blame but me. I screwed it all up. Itâ€™s my fault.  I canâ€™t ask for help. Help means admitting Iâ€™ve never been okay. How dare I ever break that illusion or hurt someone.  Help costs money my shitty job doesnâ€™t afford me. Iâ€™ve tried everything I can on my own. Self medicating, cutting, text based therapy, telling trusted people. But the cycle just starts again. When does it fucking end?? Fucking never. Iâ€™m so tired. Numb, pain, numb, pain, numb, pain. Thatâ€™s all life fucking is. Thereâ€™s too little good to fuel this for me. I donâ€™t mean thereâ€™s not enough good in the world, Iâ€™m glad that people find enough but I fucking canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve tried so hard. I try and it gets me nothing. What else can I do? Let me throw it away. Please let me fucking throw it away. I donâ€™t want it. Iâ€™m so tired.
