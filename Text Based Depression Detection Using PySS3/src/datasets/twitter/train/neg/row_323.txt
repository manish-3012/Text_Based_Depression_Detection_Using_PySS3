I am so fucking pissed off it makes me want to finally kill myself.No body cares about me. I have no friends that give a fuck about me, nobody wants to put in any effort to spend time with me or make me feel special--and of course living this way my entire life comes crashing down on me and pisses me the fuck off sometimes. But I can't say shit about it because all that would do is drive people away, so I'm forced to just keep everything inside and hide it the best I can and pretend that I'm somewhat emotionally stable and friendly. 

It makes me want to kill myself, I've already been suicidal for so long because I'm such a fucking loser in life, at least now I realize the rest of the world sucks and hates me and sees me as disposable as much as I do.
