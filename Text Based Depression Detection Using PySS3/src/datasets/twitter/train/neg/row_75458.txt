Welp. I think this is it.Well... I think the straw just broke the camels back has finally landed. The one person I relied upon for hope, the one person the kept me strong is gone. She wants nothing to do with me now.

I don't know what to do... my one reason for living was for her and now it's just... gone... discarded like trash... I'm at a loss for words. All I can think about now is the rope... There is no hope left. The one little light I had is gone.

But that's my life I guess. Just one good thing to be ripped out for under me after another. I should have known it was too good. A happy life with someone who loves me? HA! No one loves me! No one can love me! I am so fucking messed up, so fucking damaged that everyone fucking gives up! Fucking all thanks to my impossible to control PTSD. Fuck that disorder. Fuck my life. Fuck the event that turned me into a fucking monster who no one can love!

I hate myself! Fuck I am awful! All I can think of is that one event that screwed me up, it won't fucking leave me alone! I am so lost and I can't get out! I just want to die! Just kill me! I can't take it anymore! I can't! Just kill me please I am begging you! I am so sick of being turned away because of this! Hell, even therapists don't seem to know what to do!

Just kill me... I can't take my heart being broken any further. I can't. I finally trusted someone. Finally after 10 long years. And now she wants nothing to do with me. Just... kill me please. I cannot take this pain anymore. I am cursed. I am monster! I am unlovable! I am fucking unlovable! It doesn't matter how little eat or how much I work out, at my core I am a bad person! And NOTHING will ever change that! Nothing! Nothing will ever make me good or make anyone love me. I am bad at my core, I am a bad fucking person and everyone can just smell it.

I give up. I fucking give up. You win life. You win. I want to die.
