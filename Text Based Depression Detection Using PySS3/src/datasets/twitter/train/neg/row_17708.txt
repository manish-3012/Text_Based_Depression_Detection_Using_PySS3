I need to get out of my parents house sooner rather than later...My dad wont stop calling me faggot and it's starting to really break me down...He gas lights me on a daily basis. Insults me and puts me down constantly. My mom just doesn't care. Oh yeah and My brother calls me a faggot too. 
I have no job. Nobody will hire me...I've been trying to get a job for over a year now.
I have no friends. 
I have no place to go. 
I have no money. 
I am completely and utterly dependent on my parents...its all my fault i know. 
So I'm stuck here.

If I don't at least have some hope of getting out of here then Its guaranteed that I will kill myself.
