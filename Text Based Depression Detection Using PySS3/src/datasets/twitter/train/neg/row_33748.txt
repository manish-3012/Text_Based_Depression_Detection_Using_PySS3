Need Help with my cousinHello, I need help. My cousin has attempted to commit suicide \(2nd time now\). She is currently in the hospital and keeps insisting she wants to die. My aunt and uncle are trying to get her help but she keeps any help \( she is 22\). Social worker stated that they cannot do anything since she is an adult and its her decision. Is their any way to get her help, like rehab center, psychiatrist or something without getting her to say yes. My family is running out of options. Thank You
