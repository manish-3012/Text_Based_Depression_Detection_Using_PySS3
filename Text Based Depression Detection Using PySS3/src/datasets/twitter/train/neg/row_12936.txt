Please read this before you leave(TL;DR at the end) I donâ€™t mean to encourage suicide, but I like to point out the fact that we wonâ€™t even â€œdieâ€. From our point of view, itâ€™s like weâ€™ve fallen asleep. You canâ€™t know exactly when you have fallen asleep. You canâ€™t be aware of being asleep unless youâ€™re dreaming. In the same way, when we die we wonâ€™t experience death. We suddenly go unconscious similar to falling asleep. We cannot be aware of being unconscious. Since we donâ€™t wake up, we are unconscious forever and at that instance ABSOLUTELY NOTHING matters. You donâ€™t need to worry about your parents missing you because after passing you no longer have a brain nor do you exist from your perspective (at this point, the concept of perspective doesnâ€™t even exist) . You might as well have never existed, so why donâ€™t you live?


TL;DR So what Iâ€™m saying is, we all die anyways and when we do it will be like we never existed from our perspective. Because of this fact, you should keep living.
