Totally alone.I'm fucked up, but I'm sober unfortuantely.  
My fiancee has a 2 year old daughter who she let me get close to.  
We had a fight and broke up, we decided to stay faithful but to just "be friends" till emotions settled.  

"Goodbye (my name), I love you but you're not worth waiting for. I hope you're happy. Goodbye."

I got that text 3 days ago. Yeah, a text.

I don't know if I could actually do it, but I don't know that I can't either.  
I'm in shock, and have a gun sitting in the corner of my room. I've looked at it a lot tonight.

Please spare me and don't fucking say "It's just a break up, you'll be alright." 'Cause I've heard that more than enough.  
I don't know what anyone could say or if I want anyone to say anything, but my head is going to fucking explode if I don't get this out.
