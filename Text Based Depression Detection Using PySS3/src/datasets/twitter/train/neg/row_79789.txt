My mind was meant for me to kill myselfI'm tortured by my obsessive mind in a way I haven't heard of, like two opposite troubled people who trigger each other, and I've been searching the internet about this for all of the internet as well as my degree was half psychology so I have education. I've stumped therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists with how I don't respond to a lot of forms of therapy, changing your mind and meds. I know what it's like to lose someone to suicide but my mind gives me such hell for decades
