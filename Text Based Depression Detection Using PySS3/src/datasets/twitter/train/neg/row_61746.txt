Not sure what to do anymoreAll through my life I've had shit thrown at me and had to take on other people's issues without them taking the time and effort to take on mine. I've been in abusive friendships, had an abusive parent, had 3 abusive relationships and am now completely alone. I wake up and go to sleep crying, and have to go through the day having to put full effort into not killing myself. I've made 2 past attempts which failed and I managed to keep quiet about, and have had to stop myself countless times.
If I go to my countries health service (NHS - UK) I will have I'm scared it will be on my record for the rest of my life, I already know it may be because anxiety is and I'm already treated differently by them during health care (was asked if anxiety was the cause of neck pain when I actually had a slipped disc and mild scoliosis) 
Every other therapist I see I end up getting discharged. 

A sane part of my is keeping me alive but I don't know how long I can keep it up anymore

I realise now it seems mild compared to everyone else's scenarios but I'm not comfortable disclosing much else than I already have
