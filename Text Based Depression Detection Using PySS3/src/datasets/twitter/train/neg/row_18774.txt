I i'm not doing fine and i think i cannot go onI'm really considering killing myself, first of all i don't want to hurt anyone but i think i simply cannot handle myself anymore, i cannot eat, sleep or think in a future where i'm genuinely happy. I don't have friends that i can count, when this all started, an old friend invited me to stay at his home because he was worried about lefting me by myself, and that helped me a lot but i can't just let someone take all this from me. The reasons that i think i just human garbage is, i cannot find a job and it's almost a year since i have one and my parents are almost kicking me out of their house and almos every single day i need o wake up with someone screaming at my door because i'm useless and i cannot do a thing, because i tried so hard to find anything to make a little money and even so i just can't (this is the thing that haunts me most), then i was on the middle of my college and i just cannot finish it and i'm feeling like an idiot, because i was trying to enter there since i finished my high school and now i just dropped and now i just can't get in another university because i'm not that smart and this was the thing that make me realize that i'm usefull as a stone, my girlfriend and i was celebrating our third month together, we drink and eat like a couple, have a nice night and when i came home i just talked to her and she broke up with me, because she see me as a friend and needed time to think about it and, this was last week btw, and yesterday i just send her a message to check her out, because i'm a little worried about her but she seens fine, like she doesn't even care, like she dumps me and i'm the only that feels it so i just don't wanna be here anymore, i just wanna sit and cry and wait for the pain go away but it never goes and it's a little hard to breath sometimes and sometimes i just feel like being myself hurts so, i came here looking for i dunno help or at least a friendly word? I'm just kinda lost right now and the loneliness it's killing me, so how can i be usefull besides killing myself and just stop being a dead weight? How do i start again? Just needed to say where no one can hear me, so thanks and sorry for bother.
