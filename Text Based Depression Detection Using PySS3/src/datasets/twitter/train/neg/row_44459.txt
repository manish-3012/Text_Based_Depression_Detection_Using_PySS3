Thinking of Rational suicideWell the title sort of says it. I'm not particularly broken and ruined like many unfortunate people are on this subreddit. My life is alright. Thing is, I've grown to drastically seperate my emotions from the rest of my personality. I see things very logically. I know thinking suicidal thoughts suggest mental illness, but I don't think that's it in my case. 

The way I see it: The universe continues on after my death, after any suicide. That's just life. And sure, your friend and family will suffer emotionally. But those emotional connections are biological adaptations which help us try to stay together. When someone asks "What is the meaning of life?" They really mean the social life. Life society has created for everyone in it. And that has meaning sure, but what does the real biological life mean? Well. Nothing more than to extend the species. And a suicide or 2 won't do that. 

After understanding what the social life entails and what it includes. I find I don't want to be apart of that. And well, the universe still goes on as normal after my death. So, this is sort of how I see suicide.

Some have asked me what about living for other people? And part of me finds an appeal into that, however when you take a solid look at the actions and behaviors of people in general. They are often nice on the surface, and underneath devious and mistrusting. They are, for lack of a better word inconsistent. To me, I don't see an incentive to stay around for my "loved ones" as I know they care about me for things aside from actually me. 

Dunno where I was going. But I'll.leave it here
