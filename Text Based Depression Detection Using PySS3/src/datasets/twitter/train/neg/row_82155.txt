More than my cake day--Today marks 1 year that I put a gun to my head--ready.

Before it, I wrote. I read. I drank.

Letters to loved ones. Memories off all ones.

Before I squeezed the trigger as I had practice for weeks to this point--

I counted. I counted a 1,000 reasons to stay here. Done to the the stranger who told me "good morning!" a year ago. I counted.

I stalled. Calculating that I had indeed tried EVERYTHING to address the heaviness of breathing.

By times end , the sun was rising. I had stayed up all night only sharing a teared glance at my revolver.

At square one I found myself--alone. On the floor. Broken.

But alive.

Since that night--I've gotten up and done things I in no way could ever imagine that night. Absolutely no way.

Y'all watched over me this pasted year--I'm here to be a watcher.

I'm ready to watch you outlive yourself today--the self you hate. The self you loathe. The self that conscience. The self that's harmed by the feelings of despair, hostility and hopelessness. Paired to loneliness and sadness unmatched to a darkness that only comes with knowing you want to die.

If you ever think someone doesn't want to see you live--I want to see you live. If no one told you they love you today--Know that I do.

Thank you.
