Finally got my LTC (license to carry) cardHey guys, I been a lurker for about a year here but never thought I open up but here I am.

I often think about suicide for a couple years but not in the way you wouldn't expect. Not in the sense of depression or loss of hope but rather a fear of living without pride. I'm a doorman for an luxury apartment in Boston and I hate it. Not because I'm not happy but because I am in subjection to these vain, gluttonous wealthy asswipes. With just one complaint can jeopardize my job and I can't stand being so powerless, so disposable as if I was as if I was machine. I bust my ass for my dickhead boss and get paid less then I'm worth. I'm not saying that I'm not happy, not saying there aren't good times. There are so many things to be happy for all things considered so I realize that this could be seen as ungratefulness and narcissism but I rather choose fulfillment and purpose over the longevity of life. I have to live my life to fullest, I want to be the best I can be for me and others because if I'm not then I feel no more significant then the tweekers who constantly get high wasting away in the streets. I have to feel like I am doing shit or what's the point.

I owe it to myself to try to and if I fail and become stagnate there's not point in me existing. At all. So I went down to my gun store and purchased a revolver and a safe and put in room. I took the police exam bout 2 weeks ago, losing weight while getting toned, and trying my increase skillset. I getting out of the 9-5 **one way or the other**.

Let's hope for the best.
