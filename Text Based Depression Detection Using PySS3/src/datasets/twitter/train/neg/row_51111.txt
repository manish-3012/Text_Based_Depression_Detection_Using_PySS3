I didn't think I would reach this far down my rope.I just don't know anymore. I've had suicidal ideations every since I was a teenager. I've always been able to handle it myself and mentally overcome a lot of things. I also dont like sympathy etc. So I've never really talked about it before. I've never attempted suicide, but I'm closer now then I ever have before, and it scares me.
One of the only reasons I'm still trying to hold on is for my mother. I've always been the rock for her when she's gotten depressed etc. I'm always the one everyone turns to when they need that...

I'm just sitting at work right now on the verge of tears cause I don't know if I can carry this charade on anymore. I've never been in as much pain as I am now. I suffer from fibromyalgia... Which has been progressing over the last few years. It's at it's worst point it's ever been at in my life and the pain is driving me insane. I go to sleep in pain, I wake up in pain, and it just doesn't go away. (Yes I've seen doctors for this, and I've tried a myriad of drugs, with no effect... Most recently tried CBD oil and it worked for a bit then stopped)
On top of this I've just been so alone... I don't really have any friends, my one good friend lives like 400 miles from me, and we rarely talk. I've been trying so hard to date etc, but nothing ever comes of that. (I've been on 30 dates in the last 3 months... ðŸ™„) 

I just come home and contemplate whether life is worth living at this point. I'm in pain, work is stressful, I've got no joy in my life. I just don't know how much longer I can fight this... ðŸ˜‘

Anyways thanks for letting me rant. I don't know who to talk to about this so Reddit I guess.
