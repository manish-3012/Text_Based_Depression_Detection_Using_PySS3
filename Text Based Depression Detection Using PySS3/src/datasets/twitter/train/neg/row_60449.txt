I don't know what I'm expecting.I feel the need to write this.  
Like one last shout into the void.  

Nine years ago I was 14, I had anxiety and depression, and was on medication for both.  
I had a terrible panic attack on one particularly rough evening, and just started swallowing pills to get it to stop.  
I woke up in a hospital bed a day or so later with the awesome revelation that my brain had instinctively tried to end my life, and that I had failed at it.  
It took a long time for me to get over that with a lot of people keeping their eyes on me, but I eventually reached a state of normality.  
Fast forward nine years, I'm done and I couldn't tell you why. I am pretty sure my brain is trying to finish what it started. I haven't felt anything in months, except the urge to slam my car into a tree or eat a fucking gun.  
This feeling has always been there and it's never going away. I'm doing this eventually and a loved one has recently flat out told me "do it or don't."  

So I'm going to.  
Later.
