Portable charcoal grillsHow many is needed to kill myself? Iâ€™m going to drive my car into secluded part of the woods where no one can find me. Goal is that Iâ€™m never found at all...
I think if thereâ€™s no body, then my parents wonâ€™t have to pay for a funeral.
Does a will have to be notarized for it to be legally binding ? Just wondering. 

Anyway, just in case -   I wrote a note on my phone ,  saying if my body is found I wish to be buried with no coffin ,  does it make it so? 
Let me know, please - ASAP, thank you.
