The last strawI sit here alone again. It has been too many lonely nights to bother counting. It has become my status quo. I don't know even know what it's like to be wanted by another person. I'm stuck, with no way to get free. I know no one wants me because I don't like anything about myself. But I also don't like anything about me because no one wants me. No one wants me because there's just something wrong with me. It's the only logical that I'm the problem. It's not like every one I met just happen to be self-absorbed, wastes of a life. So, here I am, one more night alone, one more straw placed on my back. One more seemingly insignificant burden I have to bare. It's becoming just too much. I don't know how much longer I can continue. It seems, sooner rather than later, I will just break.
