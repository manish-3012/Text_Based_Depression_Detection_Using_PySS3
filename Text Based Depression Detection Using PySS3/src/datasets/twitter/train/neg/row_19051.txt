I dont even know what im doing.I feel so useless and empty all the time I'm only happy when I'm with my girl but that shits too complicated to get into. I've got people in my life that care about me but I feel like they only care when I'm around I don't feel like I belong anywhere i go. I really can't see a future for myself in this place and I don know how much longer I can go on.
