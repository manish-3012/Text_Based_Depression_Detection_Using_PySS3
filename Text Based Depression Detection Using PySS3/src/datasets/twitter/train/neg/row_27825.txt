Falling back down the rabbit hole...After over a year with minor depression symptoms, I'm back to struggling to look after myself. I'm cutting. I'm not taking my meds. I know I should fight. But this is so familiar. And fighting is so damn hard. I don't have any friends and that makes it so much more difficult to find the strength to resist. It's so easy to just fall back down the rabbit hole...
