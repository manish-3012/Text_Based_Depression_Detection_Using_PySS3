I've been thinking about suicide more and moreI've been really suicidal twice in my life. Well, sort of. First time I had it planned out but told someone before anything. Second time I told my [then] girlfriend I was suicidal and belonged in a hospital, which is what ended up happening (thought I was put into detox there instead because of my alcoholism). But lately the thoughts have been coming back. I'm in rehab and been sober three months, but still there. Lately I've even been thinking about what I would include in my suicide note, like formatting it, I know how and where I would do it, and it just sucks. It isn't so much that I feel like tonight I'm going out the door to do it, but it always lingers in my mind. I brought it up to my psychiatrist today, but just told him thoughts about it are returning, not the extent of it. he pretty much said start going outside and other shit and blah blah but I like what he said. I don't want to tell my therapist at rehab or my case manager because I am afraid that they will send me to some "higher level" of care and I do NOT want to be sent somewhere like a hospital or whatever. I have a job and am trying to start a new life out here. Maybe the stress of all that is getting to me? Like when things start going bad my mind goes to how I could just kill myself, everything will end and I won't have to worry about it. I also worry that sometimes I think about it and want to do it, or attempt it, just for attention, and that makes me feel like a piece of shit and even worse, which starts that circle of making me think about it even more. I have been taking my medication every night and like I should, no alcohol, but fuck man. What is wrong with me? I know this isn't normal, thinking about what it would be like if I was just dead. I'm sorry to ramble but I need to just fucking tell somebody that it has started to get to the point where I think about a lot everyday. Thanks for reading.
