I'm so confused about how I feelRecently the treatment I've been receiving for my depression suddenly started working and I went out to my friends for the first time in several months. I feel like I have renewed energy and like I could even go back to my school I left several years ago. 

However, I feel this persistent and overbearing desire to have my life come to an end. Whenever I think about the future I think about existing until I can kill myself. Even though it feels like I'm able to function I don't want to exist. I don't want to live.

I guess I'm just going to go through the motions until I gather enough courage to put myself out of my misery. For what it's worth I'm a worthless coward so I won't be hurting myself today. I also fear involuntary psychiatric care more than anything else so I won't be taking any chances. I'll just go to sleep and hope I don't wake up I can't stand this stupid life I don't even know how I feel I just want to stop existing I hate it. You know what go help someone who needs it I'm a worthless failure who's too much of a coward to kill himself and too much of an idiot to take the help that everyone around me slaves to give me
