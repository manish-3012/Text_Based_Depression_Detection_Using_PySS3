Someone wished me a happy birthday today.Last year, my birthday was one of the most difficult days. No one called me. It was lonely. 

But today, a friend called me, offered me beer (I rejected but told her I would go see her next week and we'll get hammered together.) 

So far, just having someone care about me is amazing. I couldn't be happier.

It's been a great 21st birthday. :)
