Tired.12:34am at night. 6% charge on my phone. World is quiet, world is dark. I just want to pass away in my sleep. I do not want to wake up. I want to die peacefully and soundly. I wish to not see tomorrow. I wish to die. I hope my wish comes true haha. Otherwise I'll have to kill myself, which is too much effort and a lot of planning. I hope I die. I am an atheist, but maybe for this one time I can ask God to grant my wish and kill me off. Goodbye.
