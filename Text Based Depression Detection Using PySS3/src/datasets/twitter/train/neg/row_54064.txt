Never expected to post hereSeveral times within the past month Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts. And I know where it comes from. I think itâ€™s depression, but I havenâ€™t been diagnosed. Hopelessness, sadness, you get the deal. I feel almost too guilty for myself, while being angry with myself at the same time. Itâ€™s exhausting, confusing, and generally overwhelming. I have been seeing a counselor, but I havenâ€™t talked about my suicidal thoughts with him or my parents. Am I wrong to hide this from them?
