I feel depressed and emotionless and I canâ€™t stop thinking about ending thingsI feel like Iâ€™ve been like this for years and itâ€™s subtlety affecting everything in my life, for better or for worse. Iâ€™m about to go through chemotherapy for cancer after having surgery to have a tumour removed and over the past few weeks that Iâ€™ve been dealing with this I just donâ€™t feel anything about it, everyone keeps asking me how Iâ€™m doing and if Iâ€™m holding up and I guess I literally donâ€™t care at all? I couldnâ€™t feel anything even if I really wanted too, maybe itâ€™s because I fantasise about ending my life constantly throughout the day (and have been doing so for years). My most favourite past time was playing games and watching movies but now I canâ€™t seem to keep focused on anything for more than 5 minutes without just giving up on it, I think I just canâ€™t keep myself into it long enough for it to actually attract me anymore. I have two baby nieces and my whole family is obsessed with them, they have multiple aunts but Iâ€™m their only uncle and I barely feel anything towards them, I feel literally incapable of feeling love towards them, it makes me feel horrible that theyâ€™re not getting the same love and attention from me that they do from everyone else. Iâ€™m about to go through chemotherapy and I think the one thing I felt love and affection for was my girlfriend, but we split a few days ago when she told me she basically stopped loving me, I had to let her go because this relationship, upon multiple other things, was causing her to stress and feel depressed herself, I had to let her go and I told her I would be there for her and that if this is what she needed then I couldnâ€™t stand in her way, now this breakup is hurting me so much, itâ€™s one of the only things that I feel like can actually move me except itâ€™s hurting so much rather than healing anything. 

Everyday I feel like it would just be so much easier to end things, I know that itâ€™s a permanent solution to some temporary problems but I have no goals or aspirations in my life, everyone keeps asking me what I want to do next year in terms of studies and I have no words to say on the matter, I know that I have all the time in the world to study and work on my career but I havenâ€™t had the slightest clue on what I want to do with myself for years, because I donâ€™t even want to be alive let alone studying for a degree.

I cry a lot some nights because I think of everything I might leave behind, some great friends and so many memories to be made with my nieces growing up, I know that thereâ€™s potential for me but I just donâ€™t wanna go through with life, and every day the things that anchor me to this world are leaving or growing weaker by the day 

I dream of just taking a nice walk to the nearby forest with a rope and just hanging myself, Iâ€™ve already thought about leaving behind a bunch of videos addressed to people in my life and leaving it on my computer, I literally think of what Iâ€™m going to say in them as Iâ€™m hugging my baby niece and playing with her.

I manage to get a ps5 launch day preorder for all my gamers here, I think Iâ€™m going to play it a little bit before I leave

Lastly, the one thing I feel like Iâ€™m flawless at is acting, I feel like none of my friends, family or even my now ex girlfriend have ever suspected anything, Iâ€™d told the latter about my past attempt and I believe thatâ€™s all they know, it just hurts more because Iâ€™m sad about the shock/sadness theyâ€™ll feel if the day ever comes

This is a lot for someone to read so I donâ€™t care if anyone doesnâ€™t, i think I just felt like typing it out somewhere
