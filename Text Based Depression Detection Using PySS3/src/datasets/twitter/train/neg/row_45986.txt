Hey look, a post all about me &gt;_&gt;Obvious throw away for reasons. I don't really want my friends to know about this. It's not something they should have to deal with.

I've been in and out of severe anxiety disorders for most, if not all of my life, due to traumatic childhood experiences. Now that I'm with my SO, who is borderline abusive due to his EXTREME childhood trauma, I'm pushed into more and more situations where I am becoming increasingly stressed, and stressed until the point of me drinking myself asleep, which I know is clearly affecting my health.

But my *main* issue is, is that even though I have received treatment, even though I have taken the pills and worked through things, and enjoyed life, I still want to off myself. It's like all the therapy, all the drugs, all the 'support' has just been a guise. It's just a temporary rift between me and not being on this earth anymore. They're no longer helpers. **They're obstacles.**

So, is this the point of no return? I mean, I stay alive for a few people (most notably, my siblings, one of whom is an infant). But I always think to myself that I could just write a note, just say that it's better for me to be dead. They would be happier without me.

So, this isn't a cry for help... I don't think. I guess this is just for me to know that it's ok to see through the veil. It's like I've wasted countless hours of people trying to tell me it's alright, when it's not. I'll be the happiest person around, actually enjoying life, honestly, and I would still take the first opportunity to throw myself off a bridge (my desired method). 

I don't know if I'm beyond anything now. I don't know if my stress and anxiety can take over any more of my life. What the fuck am I meant to do, if even at my best, I am still prepared to end it all?

Thanks for your time. You guys do an awesome job.
