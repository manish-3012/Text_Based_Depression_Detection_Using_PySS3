I will finally be homeless soon.But honestly I'd rather be dead than homeless. I don't have anyone else to talk to or rely on. My family doesn't want to help me. My friends are tired of supporting me. I haven't been able to find a decent job since I got out of the military in 2016 because of a misdemeanor charge from years ago. I barely talk to anyone as it is. And now I'm about to lose everything else I have. I just don't see the point in continuing anymore. I don't see this turning into a success story. Given how little I interact with people, they can barely remember me enough to miss me.
