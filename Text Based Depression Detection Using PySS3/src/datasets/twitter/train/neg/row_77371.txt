Want to kill myself SO badly but Iâ€™m filled with Christian dread.I found God through philosophy and a religious parent but I mainly grew up atheistic. I am a Christian and I donâ€™t want to go to hell I really donâ€™t but fuck is this place hell. I hate every morsel of my life, i have no friends no family no life experiences. Iâ€™ve read a lot of Aquinas and Danteâ€™s inferno and Paradise Lost and that shit scares the fuck out of me. If it wasnâ€™t for Christianity I would have been dead years ago. Iâ€™m 17, in college, massive student loan, had maybe two friends thoughout my entire life, never been touched by a girl before, I spend all my money on whiskey that I drink alone, I show up to class drunk or not at all, I thought it was gonna get better, it hasnâ€™t at all. I want to go to heaven and I want to see my father and his father but FUCK why does living have to be like this. at this point I try to be atheistic but everything Iâ€™ve learned brings me to God. i was this close yesterday. I wish I never learnt all that shit, I wish I was like every other dumb humanistic atheist out there. i drive and ride my bike purposely reckless in hopes that Iâ€™ll get into an accident, i guess that doesnâ€™t count eh? FUCK.

Tldr: I just want to die but my Christian dread is eating me alive.
