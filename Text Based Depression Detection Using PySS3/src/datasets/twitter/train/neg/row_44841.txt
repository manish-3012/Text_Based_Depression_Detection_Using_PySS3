Thoughts but no actionI've never attempted but every time I walk to work or to the shops I wish that a car would swerve and hit me. It gets worse after I visit the therapist, I feel good for exactly 10 minutes and then the gnawing thoughts of seeing the death of my grandpa (He died very suddenly and not very peacefully, I never even got to say goodbye), and remembering my ex-girlfriend (she was my whole life, she kept me together, now she hates me for being clingy, due in part to my anxiety) flood back and I'm worse off then before and the bridge between the hospital and my house is always hard to cross, I don't want to die but sometimes I feel like it would be easier. I have nobody in my life that cares enough to listen without judging me...I guess I need someone to talk to...
