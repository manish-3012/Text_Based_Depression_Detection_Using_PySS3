Not good enough.I donâ€™t drink. I donâ€™t smoke. I donâ€™t cut myself. I donâ€™t break in to places. I donâ€™t hurt other people. I donâ€™t leave the house after sunset. I donâ€™t rape. I donâ€™t kidnap. I donâ€™t maim. I donâ€™t kill. I donâ€™t steal.       
       
But Iâ€™m still not good enough for my dad. What matters to him is how well Iâ€™m doing in school, and if I miss one assignment, Iâ€™m not good enough.       
         
I know I suffer from something, ADD, mental retardation, autism, I donâ€™t know. Whatâ€™s important is when I went to the doctor the other day, he denied me ADD medication, not because I couldnâ€™t afford it, but because he didnâ€™t think I needed it.

Why the fuck are my parents still paying him?     
          
Iâ€™ve lost faith in my parents, medical professionals, teachers, and nearly everyone else. As for whether or not itâ€™s about religion, I have come to two conclusions:         
1) There is no God.           
If there was a God, and God was good, then no person would suffer like I am suffering.
2) This is Hell.          
If God is real, then this must surely be hell. An eternal adolescence of inadequacy and despair, stretching on for what feels like forever, with memories of things enjoyable but never achievable, and the looming weight of your entire future on your shoulders.          
          
Physician-assisted suicide is not legal for me in my country, but my father is planning to get a handgun. As soon as I get the chance, I will shoot myself.          
          
To those of you who actually see this, fuck you. Fuck you all for encouraging me to do better and be better. Because things donâ€™t get better, and I canâ€™t get better.
