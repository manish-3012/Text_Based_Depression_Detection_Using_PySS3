Feeling so worthless and exhausted.I'm 18, for a long time now I've been depressed. Really depressed. I know I don't have it as bad as other people and I should be grateful and spend every waking moment happy and fulfilling life- but I can't. I'm not happy and I can't fake it. I've taken medication after medication to try and fix me but they don't work. I've been to doctors and therapists but they don't work. I don't know if you would even consider me suicidal for the purpose that I don't think I could go through with killing myself- I just think about ways that I could. I think about it with such detail that I'm scared that one day my body will take over and I won't have any control what I'm doing with myself. I have a box filled with pills I stopped taking and sometimes I just go into that box and take a mystery pill in hopes that I will feel better but it doesn't work. People say I have my whole life ahead of me; it gets better; you don't have it as bad as a lot of other people. But truth is I don't have anything ahead of me, my anxiety has distant me from making friends, getting a job, and my depression has distant me from even wanting to have a life. I don't think it gets better, people 20 years older than me are still depressed, people 60 years older than me are depressed. It really doesn't get better and these lies that I've been fed just give up my hopes and make me more depressed than I already am. 
I struggle with my weight- I know I'm not even that fat, and even knowing that I still go on and fight with myself that I am fat. I go to the gym but I'm just too exhausted and worn out to get up in the morning sometimes. There are some days I just lay in bed until 3pm and I just think about all the different ways I could kills myself...
