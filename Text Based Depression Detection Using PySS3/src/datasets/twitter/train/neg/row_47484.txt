Life is just too hard.First thing let me be clear. My story is not the kind of story of "I have a past of abuse/depression/etc

The point is I just cant stand my life anymore. I'm a 26y old with no job, no fiancees, no hobbies, no interests, nothing at all. Tried to do something, had a 
shitty job and lost it. Just the idea of doing that kind of job everyday for the redt of my life make me want to cry. I'm not interested of living a life of misery, or a life at all. I dont even know why I am writing here, probably cause I'm desperate.
