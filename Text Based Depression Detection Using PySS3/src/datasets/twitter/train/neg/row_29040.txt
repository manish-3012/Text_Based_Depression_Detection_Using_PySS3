I opened up last night..I explained how I was feeling. I explained i felt like a failure. I started sobbing uncontrollably and felt a panic attack coming on. I got told to calm down and stop feeling sorry for myself and that I'm the adult and I need to get one with it.. one thing that got said was 'only you know what you need to do to fix this and make it better' 
That is the last time I'm going to bother opening up to anyone! I'll hold on a little longer but the end is in sight now because yes I do know what I need to do. 
Funny thing is a few hours later we were watching something where someone opened up to his friend about his depression and the reaction he got was very similar to the reaction I got. Funnily enough he watched it and called the 'friend' a heartless prick... i didn't say a word. How can someone be so blind?!
