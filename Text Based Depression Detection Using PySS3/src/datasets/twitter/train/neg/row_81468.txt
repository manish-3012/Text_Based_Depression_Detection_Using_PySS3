I don't care.I don't give a shit about anything.  I'm 16 and a sophomore at an amazing private high school.  I love all of my friends.  I love my parents.  I love my whole family.  I love life for the most part.  My family is wealthier than I would like to admit.  They have provided me with everything I have ever truly wanted and I have done nothing at all to show them my worth.  I don't care about anything.  I think my passion is music, I love it so much, but I can't practice for some reason.  I had ADHD and have been through all sorts of medications but never really try one for long enough to find the right dosage.  I don't do my homework.  I go to school, and think of all the great things I'm going to do when I get home, and then I sit at home on the internet for hours until I go to sleep.  I want to care.  I really want to care, and I want my parents to be proud of me.  They are already proud of me, but I want to prove to them that I am worth it.  Today I found out that if I don't get my grades out I'm being kicked out of my high school.  This terrifies me.  I am so scared.  I will go to the local public school in my district if this happens.  I don't want to loose my friends.  I want my parents to stop crying every night.  I want my mom to stop being disappointed in me.  I am so scared of leaving and so scared that my life will become nothing if I don't change, but for some reason I still can't fucking get motivated enough to make a change.  I want to do all my work.  I want to pursue my passions, and I fucking can't.  I don't think I'm worth it.  Why was I ever put onto Earth if I was just going to be a spoiled brat that failed his way out of high school and lived with his parents until he died.  I want to care.  I want to care so much.  I just needed a place to say this.  Thank you.
