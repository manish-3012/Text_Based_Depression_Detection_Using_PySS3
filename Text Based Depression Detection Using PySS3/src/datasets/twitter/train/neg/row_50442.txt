Those who have therapists: what's the point of telling them about your suicidal thoughts?I've been wondering this for months. I have a therapist I see semi-weekly (once every two weeks), and a lot of the time, I'll talk about my suicidal thoughts and how sometimes when it's bad, I'll go driving and close my eyes, hoping I run into a tree or someone runs into me.

But my therapist--actually, he's a psychologist (has a PhD and everything)--doesn't do anything about it. He just asks why I do that, why I have those thoughts, why I feel like I'm worthless and useless and stupid (etc.). Then he says stuff that's supposed to make me feel better but it makes me just cringe at the fact that I told him and it makes me mad at myself for putting myself out there.

I feel like sometimes I do it so that he'll see that I'm really hurting and urge me to commit myself. Maybe on some level I *want* to not have those thoughts? But more often, I just want someone to talk to about that stuff and not have my past be analyzed by someone.
