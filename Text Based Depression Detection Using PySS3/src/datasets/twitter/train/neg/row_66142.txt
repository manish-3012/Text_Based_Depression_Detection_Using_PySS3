Iâ€™ve planned my death for a yearLast November, I found the perfect way to die. I thought that I should at least give it time. 

On January, I was set on it. 

By May, I couldnâ€™t be more depressed and suicidal. I was dreaming about death while sitting at the table, eating dinner with my family. I felt sick then I felt like nothing. 

In July, I started looking at the minimum height to jump off of, so the fall was fatal. In reality, there isnâ€™t a sure height to die on, only the right way to do it. Remove your clothes and shoes, fall on your head. Itâ€™s the backward instructions for a suicidal diver. 

When August hit, Iâ€™ve already bought the plane tickets, booked a hotel room. 

Only in September did I realise what I was doing. I didnâ€™t stop. In contrary, I started planning for more. It had to be perfect, I thought. I looked at maps and weather conditions. I checked everything. 

There was no turning back. 

I shall die in two days. 

October 1st.
