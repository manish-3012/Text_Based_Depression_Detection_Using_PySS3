Suicide attempt? (Not sure)I tied a belt around my neck a couple times today. Even tied it to the doorknob and I bent down to see what it felt like for just a second. Didn't go through with it and my mind has not stopped racing. Main reason was because I didn't want my body to be all FUCKED up when someone found my body. Trying a free clinic tomorrow and I really don't expect much, and I'll prob just kill myself some other dumb way or maybe I'll actually use that belt. Posting because I felt like ranting.

Did I attempt suicide? I'm not sure because I don't feel like I really did. I just kinda wanted to gauge the pain levels of hanging and I have actually attempted once before and gotten hospitalized and all that FUN jazz. Lmk
