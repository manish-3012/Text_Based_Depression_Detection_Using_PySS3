I'm considering itHey I'm on mobile so it might be fucked up. I just feel so alone and I'm planning on killing myself. I got 50+ missing assignments at school and am failing the majority of my classes. I'm 15 and I don't know what else to do honestly. I am way to open about my depression and it drives people away because I'm so desperate for help. Fuck using a throwaway I don't really care. My dad doesn't know how to show love and I'm just a scrawny emotional bitch who hates himself.
