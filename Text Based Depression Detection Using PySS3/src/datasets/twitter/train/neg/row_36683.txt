Fantasizing about killing myself is the only way I can cope with lifeI just want to return to the time before I was born. I fantasize about killing myself everyday. I was perfectly fine not existing. I felt no pain or sorrow. I didn't have to live in misery every single day.

I want to die so badly. It has become unbearable. Knowing I can end all of this is the only way I can cope with living in misery. I was not meant for this world. Nothing gives me joy. I live day to day with no hopes or dreams. I can't do this anymore.

I resent the fact that I was even born. I always tell myself this is the week/month/year that I finally kill myself. But I could never do it. Recently I had a failed attempted and since then I have become obsessed with trying it again.
