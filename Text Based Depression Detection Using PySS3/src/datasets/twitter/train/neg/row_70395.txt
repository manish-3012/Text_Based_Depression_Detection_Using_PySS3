I begged for help but no one cameLast night was so hard. I felt like every trigger that I had was being pulled all at once, to this perfect fanfare of self-hate and disgust. I begged for help. I texted people. I called. I tried to reach family, friends, strangers, hotlines. I did what I was supposed to do. But no one was around. It just made it worse. No one cared. They wanted me to stop messaging and calling. I canâ€™t believe I woke up today after taking everything I did. I donâ€™t want there to be a today. Maybe Iâ€™m weak. Maybe Iâ€™m broken. Maybe something is wrong with me. But why was no one around? Why did no one pity me when I begged? Am I that bad? It makes me want to go more. People didnâ€™t even open my messages. They still havenâ€™t and itâ€™s the next day.
