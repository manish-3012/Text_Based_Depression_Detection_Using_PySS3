I messed up too much and i that I'm too weak to deal with the consequences.I didn't think that college was going to be easy, but I've also certainly never been one for online school. In all my past experience with it all I ever experienced was constant failure, and as a student I guess my academic performance defines my worth and therefore I am: a failure. The semester draws to a close now and I have nothing to show for it, I have been more than just "unhappy" for some time now. I don't think this is going to solve anything, it's an alternative. I'm sorry I couldn't do better. I'm sorry I didn't ask for help, I didn't want anyone to think I was messing up. I'm sorry I'm so weak. I'm sorry I don't have it in me to deal with the consequences. 

I don't have a reason for living if I can't meet the expectations of those who keep a roof over my head.

I don't think I'm even worth calling a person anymore.

I'm sorry.
