I just want to get life over withBecause there's no point. Everyday is so repetitive. I question whether anything in life is worth living for. If any of it even matters, if it ever makes anyone happy. No matter what i do with myself &amp; my life, i will always come back to thought of intentional death. Regardless of how happy i get, i will always fall back into this. Scientists say we have 12 years left until Earth breaks out in climate catastrophe. I don't want be here for it. Ill be 28 watching the world i had so much false hope for crumble. Death is the ultimate gift of life &amp; I wish I could just erase myself from the timeline. I wish i had been another one of my mother's miscarriages. I wish i owned a gun. I wish i could speed up this hellish process that ive been forced to live for the past 16 years. I don't want it. I dont want this life on this planet.
