I can't See myself getting olderHow can it be that people Even Wanna live beyond 65 you basically cant do anything, except wait for the inevitable? And Knowing you leave your kids behind If you have any..  I cant imagine how depressing that thought is. My mom Works at a nursing home for eldery, and she told me a Lot of them complain to hear that they are still Alive.. like who the f*** would design this game we Call life? You essentially Work and level up all your life, just for your character to get deleted automatically
