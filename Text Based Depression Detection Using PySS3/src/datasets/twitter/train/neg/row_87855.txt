I cant be bothered anymoreI accidently took down the last post before i got an answer so ima keep this one short. My family doesn't seem to love me and treats me as basically a slave despite being the only child isn't on drugs or a drop out i'm pretty sure its because i look so much like my dad whom everyone (including myself hates) and so they in turn hate me as well. in general i see no worth while living future for the earth, i'm intelligent and would probably have a really good career but whats a career with out a working planet earth or family and my friends although kind and supportive just aren't enough to keep me going, and i've suffered from bullying all my life. so i really cant be stuffed i'm not here for crap like "oh it gets better" its a lie we all know it doesn't i just wanna know from someone who has attempted was it peaceful as you were about to die or were fading at least? could you feel the suffering just draining away or did it just suck and hurt a shit tonne. i wanna do it but i'm also not looking to feel to much pain so what method was it and how did it feel whilst going?
