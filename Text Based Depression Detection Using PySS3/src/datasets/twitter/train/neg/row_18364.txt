I am done. No job for 4 years, escaped the country to places half the cost of living - Still no job. Cannot pay the minimal cost of life.&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 4 years of horrible suffering, starving, embarassement and being taken advantage of in the most vunerable times in my entire life.

Fleeing from the first world, because life turned out unaffordable, no employment, nothing, to now living in the cheapest third world countries and being in the same situation. 

I have applied for more than 2000 jobs - nothing &amp; paid my last few dollars i had to scummy freelancer platforms like UpWork, so i am allowed to bid-beg some lowballers to choose me for the already underpaid job, in hope that even 5$ dollars an hour would pay minimal life. 

But no... Apparently 5$ is not cheap enough... The rich and crazy growing US company now needs a rockstart specialist, paid at $3 an hour - Thats what specials usually cost... You know?  

There are "Employees" from the first world on these platforms" paying an average of $1.2 dollars per hour at 5000 hours paid, to freelancers. Disgusting. 

Did that for a while... Apparently $200 a month working full time is 5 times not enough. 

There are employees, posting jobs, where i wasted money on, never ever again checking their inbox after posting... 

Writing businesses on Facebook who are supposedly booming, but seemingly forget to open their Facebook messages for weeks or never...

Sending out emails, no response

Writing Businesses on Yelp, no one cares

Reacting to instragram posting of hirings - Yes, no response... 

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on... and on... and on...... and on.... all day....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am now sitting in the cheapest hostel i could possibly find, in a dirt cheap underdeveloped country, more than 1 month due with pay, visa is experied for 2 month, haven't eaten in 10 days, drinking dirty water from the water tap, having consistant diarreah as a result... and if i not gonna find myself on the streets, i gonna find myself in jail for trying to life minimal life... 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish all of you more luck than i had... Please don't give up like i did... I am going to end my life today.

&amp;#x200B;

Bye
