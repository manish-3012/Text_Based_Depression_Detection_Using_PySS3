I just want to take a walkfar away from all the people I've hurt, far away from all the people I'll hurt if I stay near them. I don't know if I'll come back, or want to come back, or get too cold and wind up coming back suddenly sobered and probably hungry. 

I tell myself everything I'm doing is just-in-case, like writing my dad's phone number on my arm or writing my favorite quote on a card in my wallet and writing my phone pin on the other side. Just in case I get hit by a car on my walk, or if I get a heart attack, or I suddenly develop a severe allergy. 

But I just need to walk. The thought of dying has been on my mind for a few weeks now and I've been staving it off fine. I'm waiting for my phone to get all the way charged, and I tell myself so it's that I have enough to get back home with if I stay out late and want to listen to music. So I could talk to someone. But about what, I ask myself?
