Whatâ€™s the point of continuing? We all eventually die right? No shame in taking yourself out to meet something that was gonna eventually happenI have a homie that killed himself almost 2 years ago now, if he did it, the big move, like 100% permanent move, like packed his bags and dipped out this earth, I think I can too. I donâ€™t have anything to live for anyway. I hope death is just like sleep. Itâ€™s all I get comfort from now anyway
