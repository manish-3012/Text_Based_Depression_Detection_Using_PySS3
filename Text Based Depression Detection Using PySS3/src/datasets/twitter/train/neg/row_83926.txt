I've lost my reason to liveI had a person that meant the world to me for 3 years and 4 months. I'm from London and her romania(Singapore born). We met in a game.. And we got to know each other.. And then after few weeks we declared our feelings for each other. I suffer from depression and social anxiety so I'm very very bad at making friends. She was the first person in the world I could talk to anything about. She found me attractive. We did so many things together. We met and lost our virginities to each other. I've never ever met anyone like her in my life. She is beautiful, doesn't need make up. 

Anyways.. This week.. She told me she has to move on.. Because she cant keep hurting me she says.. Even though she is worth hurting for. 

I don't have the energy to do anything anymore. I'm in bed typing this because I cant sleep and it is constant torture thinking about how I wasn't good enough for her to keep me and how I will never ever find someone like her again. I can hardly eat anything and I haven't showered for few days and I missed few appointments.

 I've been thinking about ending it because I've nothing left now.. I know I'm pathetic.. But she was perfect for me :(
