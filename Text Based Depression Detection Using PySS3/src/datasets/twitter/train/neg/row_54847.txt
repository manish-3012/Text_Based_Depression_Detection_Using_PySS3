I feel like the game has already endedI was planning to kill myself yesterday, 20/10/19, but didnt do it. I dont know why i didnt do it, i still want to kill myself, i still want everything go away, im still depressed, i still think that nothing has a point... But i just didnt do it, i just acted like it was a normal day. Today i felt like i shouldn't be here, i feel like im not only dead inside, but outside too. I feel like i finished playing a game, the credits already rolled, but im somehow still playing it. Its not particularly good or bad, its just extremely weird. Any other Anon can relate?
