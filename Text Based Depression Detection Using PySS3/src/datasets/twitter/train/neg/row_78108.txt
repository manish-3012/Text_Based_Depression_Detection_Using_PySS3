I'm thirteen, and I need some guidance.Hi.
I'm a thirteen year old girl, and I may be suffering from depression.

A few months ago I did something horribly stupid, and I can't get over it. I am a generally smart person, but the mistake I made makes me rethink things.

I stole something, and I'm not proud of it. I have not been caught, but I have a feeling that I will eventually suffer the legal consequences for my actions. At first, I felt that adrenaline rush. It felt exciting and rebellious. I didn't realize what I had truly done until I got home, and froze in fear. I reassured myself by thinking that the police couldn't catch me; I was safe at home.

This consoled me for two months.

One night, the guilt came crashing back down. I couldn't sleep, couldn't think or function properly. I had to tell someone, so I told my mother. My mom is a kind, understanding person. She took it considerably well, and told me to *never* do it again.

So I was fine after that, still sad, but fine.

School started recently. I thought it would help take my mind off of things, give me something else to focus on. It didn't. It only got worse, to put it simply. I started to have suicidal thoughts; I wondered what would happen if I just left the world.

I'll go back to the main reason of my sadness: I'm a good person. I went to a nice private school, did all the right things, followed the rules. Something so sudden and rash to happen like that was a huge emotional blow. I couldn't accept the fact that someone like me could make such a dumb error in life.

Trust me, I've learned my lesson. I've also read about the laws related to juvenile theft in my state. This seems to comfort me a bit.

I don't feel like I'm good at anything anymore. I can't do certain jumps or spins in ice skating, I'm not in any honor classes.

What I'm asking of you is, what do I do? If I go to a counselor, will he/she report my crime? How do I accept my mistake and move on?
Thanks so much.
