I thought I failed....Hey there..

So I was (still am kinda) one of those r/2meirl42meirl4meirl redditors.. and I had exams week (4 exams in 4 days in a row) last week and also had some serious thought about what I would do when I failed.. (cuz i would loose not just the opportunity to continue my study but also loose my current job etc.) 
And the exams where faking awful I mean itâ€™s not like I didnâ€™t study but the exams where just.... ugly through and through..

So jic I kept myself away from railway and height buildings.. even tho I new Iâ€™d probably never gonna go through with it...


*However,* now I got the results of the 2 most frustrating exams and I passed both.. now Iâ€™m on vacation and had my music on shuffle and then there came the fav song of a classmate who took his life like 7 years ago.. and I had to think what he missed all those years and how he couldâ€™ve lived and experienced life all those years if he didnâ€™t..... r.i.p. Maximilian &lt;Â§

Then I had to think about all the things I wouldâ€™ve missed if I did.... 
-&gt; and I realized suicide is wayy to serious to just make stupid jokes about it.. 
and:

-&gt; Life is to precious to throw it away just like that..
