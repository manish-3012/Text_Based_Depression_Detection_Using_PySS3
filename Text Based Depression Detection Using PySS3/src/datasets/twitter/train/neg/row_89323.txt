I hate being alone all the timeI've always been alone, the odd one out, the one no one really cares about, everywhere I've gone. I'm so lonely now. I don't know what it's like to not be lonely but it has to be better than this. Anything has to be better than a lifetime of loneliness. I can't live like this anymore Its driving me nuts. After 19 long, lonely years it's reasonable to assume that you'll suffer alone for the rest of your life right?
