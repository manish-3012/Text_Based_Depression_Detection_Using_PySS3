I genuinely hate almost everything about meNot sure if this is normal, but I mumble or talk to myself â€œI just wanna fucking dieâ€ dozens of times every single day. Iâ€™m not like most other people with a horrible childhood, abusive partners, or any form of great tragic in life. I have supportive middle class parents that encourages me to do what I like, cares about me, never had to worry about much growing up. If I have to say the worst that happened to me were just stuff like my grandma passing, or getting rejected. So I donâ€™t really have a reason to be depressed or anxious about anything. But still, every morning I wake up thinking that I suck, wanna fucking die, you get the idea. I feel useless, was never comfortable in my own skin, and is anxious or generally in a bad mood all the time. Just, fucking end this already. I think currently the only reason Iâ€™m still here writing this pathetic post complaining about nothing is just cuz Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to actually take my own life.
