I deserve to die a violent deathI'm sitting at home alone and my mind is going crazy, I'm just in so much pain. I think about going out and getting a disposable BBQ, sealing up my little bathroom, setting it alight, and then taking 6 months worth of quetiapine and going to sleep. Then I suddenly feel guilty because I feel like I should kill myself in a worse way like jumping off a building or beachy head. Why should I die peacefully when my mind is nothing like that?
