I feel like there's no help for me.Yesterday I told my therapist and psychiatrist that the suicidal urges were worse than ever. I feel an intense pressure in my chest that is urging me to hurt myself. It's terrifying and I don't know what to do. But I've never made an attempt before, and I guess they don't think I am actually going to do anything, so they just sent me home. It feels so frustrating. I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to an attempt. Is that what has to happen before I can get the help I need?
