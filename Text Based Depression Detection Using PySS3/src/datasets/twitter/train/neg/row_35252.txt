Signing outThere are so many things I wanted to see. I never made it out of this state, in more ways than one. They all treated me like garbage and I manifested it. I became what they wanted, and it still didn't buy me any semblance of a family unit. I am nothing but fear and hatred, self loathing and insecurities.

I came into this life as an accident that nobody wanted to take responsibility for and I'm leaving it the same way.
