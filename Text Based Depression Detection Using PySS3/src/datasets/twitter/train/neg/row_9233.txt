I'm just tired.I tried to hang myself last night. I used a belt. It held about a second before breaking under my weight. It was demoralizing to sit on there on the floor, now with one less good belt.

There's really nothing I can do that isn't drowned out by depression. I'm just tired, and beat down, and I wish my thoughts would have mercy on me. I give up. I give in. I'm ready to go.
