I was released from a mental hospital yesterday and Iâ€™m planning on killing myself tonightI was admitted to a mental hospital  for being suicidal. Every day when I was getting my medication, they asked me, â€œAre you having any thoughts of hurting yourself or anyone else?â€ I always answered no, because I wanted to get out sooner. I was lying.

Iâ€™m transgender. Millions, if not billions of people hate me by default and would rather I were dead. All Iâ€™ve ever wanted is to be a man. No matter how many hormone injections or surgeries I get, Iâ€™ll never look quite like a biological man. (Furthermore, I canâ€™t even get on HRT,  the one thing that might make me feel a little better, because Iâ€™m a minor and my parents are unsupportive.) My body has been disfigured by female puberty and thereâ€™s no going back now. No one in my life sees me as a man. If they call me one, itâ€™s because theyâ€™re trying to be polite. My mother has made it clear I will always be her little girl; she loves the version of me sheâ€™s made up in her head.

My friends didnâ€™t care that I was in the hospital. They werenâ€™t worried and they didnâ€™t miss me. Life went on without me. Life will go on without me after tonight. I have not felt true happiness in 4 years and I donâ€™t expect to anytime soon. I have no reason to live.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this. I guess I just want somebody to finally listen. My friends donâ€™t take me seriously when I say Iâ€™m suicidal. I have no idea what to do. I just want the pain to end.
