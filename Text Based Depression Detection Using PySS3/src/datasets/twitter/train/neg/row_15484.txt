I have let my whole family down all my life and the guilt is crippling meEver since I can remember I have been suffering from bad anxiety and depression. When I was 9 I used to go to bed thinking â€œwhat is the point of existing on this flying rock in space when the only thing thatâ€™s guaranteed is deathâ€

Im 18 and I have basically jumped off the rales during the past few years. I was working in realestate for a year and a half but hated every second of it. 6 months ago I lost my licence therefore lost my job because I needed my licence according to my job description. I tried to kill myself around 8 months ago but my dad stopped me and bear hugged me until an ambulance came. If it wasnâ€™t for him I wouldnâ€™t be here right now. I went through a rough stage abusing xanax for a couple of months doing all the wrong things with no memory, I got myself into a lot of trouble and thankfully havenâ€™t touched them since. All I have been doing is trying to run away from myself. I am slowly coming to the realisation that I have dug myself a deeper hole. I have caused much pain for my family. My 11 year old sister has seen the worst of me and some things will never leave her. I should be so grateful to have parents that care about me more than themselves and it kills me to know my mum has sleepless nights over me every night, and it kills me to know what she thinks of me and what she thinks Iâ€™ve become. I just feel so lost I have no idea what I what from this world, i basically depend on weed to feel normal, when I donâ€™t smoke I am crippled by anxiety and have bad mood swings. I really know I have to stop smoking and have cut down a lot in the past few weeks therefore I am feelings a lot worse than usual, and my usual has never been good. I really canâ€™t kill myself but thatâ€™s all I want to do, or at least I get urges to. 

Thankyou for letting me vent and I hope you all have a great day
