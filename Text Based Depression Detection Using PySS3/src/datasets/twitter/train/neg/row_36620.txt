Don't know if I can continue with this pain I don't see it getting any better the stress and anxiety i face daily are crippling. I am now 30 years old and have had about 1 year total of not feeling like I want to leave this world since I was 12. I have seen a dozen therapists. Been on and off meds since I was 13. I feel those around me are tired of trying to help, and to be honest I don't want them to anymore. Every call and text just adds stress and increases my anxiety which increases my depression in turn.

I want to stop existing, stop feeling, stop hurting. I pray that I die in my sleep sometimes or I get some deadly disease that takes me quickly. I'm too much of a coward to take my own life I have always thought, but the pain is so unbearable now I'm not sure. Everyday I'm growing closer to leaving and I don't know how much time I have left. I just need to make sure my cat and rabbit are cared for, they are the only reason I continue to live but I don't feel I can go much longer. I'm sorry Mr. Gray and Spots, you deserve better than me, everyone does.
