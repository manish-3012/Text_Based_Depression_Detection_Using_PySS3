MY GF packed her bags todayI am such a wreck. After 1.5 years my GF packed her bags with her friend right in front of me. She constantly changes her plans with her friends and the plans keep changing and it causes my autism and anxiety to shoot through the roof.

I guess she was done with it when i told her i didnt like this. so she packed her bags infront of my family and left. I feel so worthless...i wish i was normal and ddnt have this problem i cant help. i never been so mad in my life
