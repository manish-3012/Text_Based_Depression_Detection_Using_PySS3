nothing interesting to sayi feel like an attention seeking dumbass just posting here and this is a lot of stream of consciousness nonsense so sorry, but i really want to kill myself, and i've felt this way for about 6 years now, which i realize isnt long at all compared to some people's struggles but already feels like 6 years too long. i have nothing meaningful to contribute to anything, no worth to bring to any experience or relationship. i've had therapy, i've tried antidepressants; despite genuine optimism at first, i didn't see any real improvements and i don't see the point in continuing to try. there's so much to say but none of it matters. i wish i could just stay in my bed forever and no one would ever find me and i could just quietly slip away.
