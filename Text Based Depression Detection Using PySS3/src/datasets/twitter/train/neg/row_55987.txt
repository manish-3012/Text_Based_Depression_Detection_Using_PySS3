On my way out to a downtown highrise to throw myself from it...Not bothering with a throwaway cause I guess it wont matter soon. Not going to put a ton of info here cause I might miss the last bus there if i do. im sorry mom, its not your fault. i was never meant for this world.

I'm sitting at the edge now wondering what to do
