I am rightI have done everything I thought I was supposed to. I acquired two degrees in the physical sciences, an internship specializing in web applications and quantum mechanics, and spent countless hours in resume workshops and job hunting seminars.

I am right.

I also suffered a mental breakdown from an abusive family and financial strain. I barely passed and have been looking for work ever since graduation eight years ago. I have never been offered a full time non-temporary job.

I am right.

I have finally reached my thirties. Most economists peg the maximum a person is worth at 35. I have never been shown or known affection of any kind. It is unreasonable to ask a woman to couple her life to my failed attempt at one.

I am right.

I have gone to what friends still remember me. I have gone to what family members do not actively hurt me. I have gone to state officials, professional job hunters, social services, and aggregate web sites. I have pleaded with religious leaders, charity centers, and even mental health care centers. I have asked each and every one of them if they can imagine a life I can live, a hope above destitution, or a single argument against what I know I must do.

I am right.

I have lost my last job. I have forgotten my last friend. My skills are atrophied and useless. Even job hunters tell me to stop trying. The only people left are the faceless electronic names freely available on the internet. I beg one of you to tell me, or those like me, what direction to take. What instruction I should give to those still like me. What I should tell the siblings I have, the dying students I try to help, the forgotten and failed that are also ready to end their struggles with a world that actively avoids them. 

Tell me, I dare one to tell me, why I shouldn't encourage all of them to take the only true career path any of us have an innate right to.

I am right.
