Antidepressants questionsLately my depression has been very strong and I've been thinking about taking antidepressants but I don't really understand them? Does them just make you happy? Or does then silence the bad voices in your head? I really don't understand and if anyone would like to talk about them I'm interested. Also, I think my mom and dad are on antidepressants so can it be biological? I know it's a stupid question but if anyone knows about that too, I'm interested
Thankx for reading
Hope you have a nice day
