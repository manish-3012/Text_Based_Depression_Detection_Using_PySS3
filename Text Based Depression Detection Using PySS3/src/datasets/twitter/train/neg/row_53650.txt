Back here againThere was a TV show I really liked when I was a kid, and one of the guys from it died this morning. It got me reminiscing a lot about being a kid and I've been thinking what a sad life it's been. Just to clarify, I don't mean 'sad' in the way Donald Trump uses it, I mean the melancholy sort of sad. I have been happy here and there, some good things happened and I had some nice friends at times. But I've been really sad for great big chunks of it.

I had a girlfriend that I really liked, I love her more than anything and I've got really nice memories of laughing with her, spending lazy afternoons getting high and watching crap TV. She lived in Germany last year and I went to visit a lot, I like thinking about those times too. But I fucked it all up and made her hate me. I've stupidly been reading old texts, I keep thinking over and over about one in particular that says, "Why haven't you killed yourself yet!?".

Believe it or not I am naturally a happy person, in spite of circumstances, and I was always optimistic. But everything's different now, I haven't got anything any more, nothing to be here *for*, nothing nice has happened to me in ever such a long time and it's just never going to change, so yeah, why haven't I!? I just need to get on with it, no-one will even realise I'm gone, and it certainly won't affect anyone's life. I bet this sounds like I'm laying it on a bit thick, but I promise it's true.
