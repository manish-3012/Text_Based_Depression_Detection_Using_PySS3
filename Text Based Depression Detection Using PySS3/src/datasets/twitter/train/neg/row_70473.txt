I want to end myself but Iâ€™m too afraid toIâ€™m sorry if this sounds envious but I wish my parents loved me. Itâ€™s such an important thing of anyoneâ€™s past that canâ€™t be given anymore once their childhood ends. I do have friends but the anxiety of burdening them with my problems is the reason they can barely see my cracks. And now Iâ€™m just stuck between this limbo between my desire to end it all, and the courage I am lacking still to do it. Iâ€™m not asking for anyone to go out of their way to support but I hope people can just listen
