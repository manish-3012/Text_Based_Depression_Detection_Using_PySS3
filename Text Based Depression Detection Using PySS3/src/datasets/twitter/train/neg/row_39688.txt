I'm going outI do not know why I'm the person I am. I fucking hate myself. I really tried to live, to be a better version of myself, but it does not matter I always find a way to fuck everything, to sabotage myself. 
The odd flavor in my mouth always returns, the sadness, that pain in my stomach, the lump in my throat. 
I'm tired, really tired, It's like trying to run without legs. 
I give up. I'm a failure and I must go, I do not know when but I hope it's soon. I wish you well and I send you my love, I'm really scared too.
