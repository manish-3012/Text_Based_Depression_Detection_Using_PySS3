I hateI've been thinking about it a little bit the last days and I think I do feel hate. I feel hate for the at least two people who really did everything to destroy my life and every life energy I have left. 

And I am loosing more and more boundaries concerning suicide, but an idea that I keep and that keeps me from doing it, is,  that what I will do is pass my hate to those who survive. 

Not only the sadness. The hate. 

Then my mother and my sister will be as confused as I am and will have lost something and will feel the same sad incredible hate I feel. 

That's cruel. For me to live, because I don't wamt to live others in the same pain.
