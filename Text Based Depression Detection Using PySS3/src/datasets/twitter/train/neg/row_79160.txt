It feels like I've been pushed over an edgeMy mind has reset. It feels like I have a newfound clairvoyance. The once bottomless pit of kept emotions that was my mind is now a mere colander. I don't see myself ever being happy. I will never achieve satisfaction or happiness and I am sure of it. I am incapable of feeling any sort of positivity. 


I don't want to spend my life slaving away for a corperation just to survive, unable to appreciate anything. I don't want to be unable to retire, or to live in constant paranoia and anxiety that I may not be good enough; gained from my own home. I don't want to deal with anymore pain that life has to offer, I've had enough. Why experience every ounce of pain and hardship just to die? 



I've felt like this since I was 11. Not specifically these thoughts but just awful. But in all of those years today I haven't felt so far deep as I do now. I've started to let myself go in hopes that I die faster, disguised as health issues. Cigarettes, substance abuse, alcohol, binge eating, sitting around moping, you name it. I feel almost certain, and at one point, I *was* certain. I am such a flawed and doomed individual. I feel as if I don't have much time left. I don't have a place here. I'm simply not mean't for this earth. My happiness is unreachable. I didn't want to worry any of my family or friends, so I came to strangers. Maybe one day I will heal, but only if I allow myself the time, which is a gamble at this point.
