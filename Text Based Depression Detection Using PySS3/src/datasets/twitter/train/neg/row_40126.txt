Fuck bipolarity.Iâ€™m crying for the first time in 12+ years right now.

I have everything I could ever want. Great friends, a great family, but I just want to end it all. 

Sometimes my ego is too big for me to handle, and when mania comes back around (like today), I just want to kill myself.

I rode the bus home from my high school, holding back tears. I was and am seriously thinking about killing myself, but I donâ€™t even want to think about the pain everyone around me will endure.

If I go on, I know Iâ€™ll kill myself if I ever had am â€œactualâ€ motive, like another of my friends dying, or a family member passing. I canâ€™t stomach the thought of going on, but I also donâ€™t want anyone to feel the pain Iâ€™m going through.

I just donâ€™t understand this feeling, this is the worst my bipolarity has gotten in recent years. Anyone have any advice?

Warm words are welcome. I think I might need some for the next few weeks, or so.
