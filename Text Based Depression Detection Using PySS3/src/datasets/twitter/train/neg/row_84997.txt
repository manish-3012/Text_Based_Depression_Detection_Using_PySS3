Just heard my family completely bashing me outside of my room, thats nice.As the title says, I'm sick as hell. In the 101Â°, and this isn't the best. They were outside the room bashing me, the whole time. Just completely saying how I'm only here for a mouth to feed, and I'm not doing anything with my future. I sit on a screen all day, and my mental state is just so fucked. I don't have friends, or anything. In person, and in the internet. It's honestly amazing to see how I'm still alive. I can't work, my body gives up on me now, and I'm sure I'm not gonna make it to 20 years old. 

I honestly can't do anything, I'm tired of breathing. If they want a son who can do a better job than them, then I guess I failed more than ever. I'm not sure what I want in life. And I probably won't ever. I had an attempt on my life not too long ago, and I'm pretty sure they shrugged it off. I'm not positive on anything anymore. I'm always saying I'm probably gonna try suicide soon, but I just give up on that. I don't believe it'll get better. 

I'm honestly just want friends. I'm not even sure what to do anymore.
