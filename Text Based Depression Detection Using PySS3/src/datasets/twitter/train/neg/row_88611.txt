Have you ever came to a point where u literally don't care?Like nothing matters? You know ur gonna die sooner or later so why even try? And besides, we are literally nothing. Even if our planet dies it wouldn't change anything.... that's how much insignificant we are... we should all die just for the sake of not suffering anymore.... rn the only thing that is making me not die is finding something so that I'm not bored....
