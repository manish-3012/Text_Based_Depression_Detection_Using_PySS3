It's quite clear that killing myself is the correct optionI've not had a clear thought in months. Maybe longer, it's hard to tell. Every thought I have is 'hazy around the edges', as if I cant concentrate enough or I don't have the attention span for the thought to finish. It's as  if my mind is just 'coasting', not broken enough to completely break down but to the point where I don't live,  I just exist. But today? today I woke up with the clearest thought I can every remember having; that killing myself is clearly the best option. I don't know how I'm going to do it or when but it'll be soon, very soon no doubt.

I'm 25 and I don't think I've been happy for at least 10 years, even then I'm not sure if I was happy. It's hard to remember. I don't live,I exist. I have no friends, a horrible relationship with family, a job that thought of going to makes me feel literally sick, anxiety so bad that it stops me leaving the house regularly. I could go on but what's the point? It's always been like this. a couple of times I've thought to myself that it's going to get better; it hasn't. In fact it's just got worse, to the point where I now can't even think properly.

But the end is in sight now, the first clear thought in a long time has shown me that. I can't cope anymore but all the problems will be over soon.
