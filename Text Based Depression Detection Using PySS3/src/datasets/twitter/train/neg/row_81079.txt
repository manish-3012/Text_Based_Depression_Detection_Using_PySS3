1997 - 2019 (?)I've been depressed/suicidal for damn near 8 years now. It's better some days than others, but my desire to end my life is not something that I've ever been able to push out of my mind.

2019 so far, is easily the worst year of the 22 that I've had. My mother was diagnosed with leukemia on my birth month, and it only seems to be getting worse. I go to college in a different state, and I won't be able to see her before an extremely dangerous transplant procedure. In addition to this, I learned that my grandmother was given about half a year, that my girlfriend (now ex) of four years was an emotional cheater, and finally, that my father is unwilling to support my education past this year (I need more time because I had to drop a few courses due to emotional stress; oh, and my dad doesn't believe in mental illness).

I'm thousands of miles from family. My college friends have all graduated. And my future is uncertain given my current state. I have low-esteem and crippling anxiety (I wanted to post on r/toastme but I'm too self-conscious).

I don't have anything and I really want to die. I'm just too cowardly to actually go through with it. I'm a failure and I don't know what to do. I wish I could have a hug.
