26 lost out of my fucking mind and its only getting worseI dont fit in anywhere anymore, Im losing more friends by the year, My dad is 84, I am unemployed, jaded beyond belief, I dont know how on earth my life ended up like this - I used to have it all it felt. I feel pressure at all angles, dont know who to fucking trust, cant open up, dont know whats worth fighting for. I just want the old me back. But its impossible, i dont think anyone realises I have been depressed out of my mind, Ive ruined chances at love, I feel like I am becomming like a cowardly cunt. I used to be the oppositte. - I am lost beyond belief
