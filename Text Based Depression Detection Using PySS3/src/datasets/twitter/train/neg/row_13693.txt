I'm sorry..I'm going to do it. Tonight. One more hour.. I've come here to see if maybe someone would be able to talk me out of it. I don't think they will, but I hope so. The truth is, I'm scared, and I don't want to do it, but it's the only way out for me. At least, that's what the demons tell me. My life has gone to shit, I'm worthless, and nobody cares.
