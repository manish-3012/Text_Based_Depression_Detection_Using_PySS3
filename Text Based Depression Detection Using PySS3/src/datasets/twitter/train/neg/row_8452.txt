I don't even knowI don't know why I'm posting.  I'm too cowardly to kill myself.  Ive thought about.  I used to try to take my life but I'm too weak.  I tried to hang myself and failed.   That happened a few times.  Ive held a knife to my throat but chickened out last second.  I just don't know where to go.  My bestvfriend replaced me.  She doesn't want to be my friend.  My family doesn't take my problems seriously.  I cant be honest with my family because if I was they would hate me.  I'm bisexual.  They wouldn't approve if they knew.  My dad bated my all my life and then abandoned us.  Now hes trying to bribe me into seeing him.  My life's just kind of fallen apart over the years and I kinda just want it to end.  So yeah.  I guess that's all.  Just wanted to rant and I'm hoping for some people to comment and talk to me.
