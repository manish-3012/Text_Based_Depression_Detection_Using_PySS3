am i stalkeri used to be relatively happy and did what ever i wanted like what i call parkour set my self on fire talk to everybody and was a general pain in the butt. i was reckless, obnoxious, ugly as sugar huny ice tea and really enjoyed the sound of laughter evan if they were laughing at me mot with me. back then i had a a girl friend we went out for the last 2 week s of school and just texted each other for about 2 years after a while, we hadn't seen each other for any of these 2 years, she broke up with me but we were still friends and i wasnt to sad so i decided to move on so on the first day of high school i was ready to have fun and stay single so i told all my friends that i was asexual and thought i wouldn't like any one else but then i met this girl who i thought was really cute so i decided to be frieds with her and after a while, because i was bored, i made a map of her schedule and found out things like how smart she was and that she liked anime which i really enjoyed 2. i also set myself on fire to make her laugh which she did but told me that she was scared whei brought it up latter. this was in freshmen year. i also started watching shows in sophmore year and would only watch them half way through so that when we started going out we could cuddle and watch them together i also built a spread sheet so that when we got married i could biuld a computer for her specifically for her workload. started feeling bad about watching porn (hey im in high school ) i steadily started losing friends because i dedicated my life to hers behind the sceans at this point i some how found out her social media info and we started mesging each other back and for warth with me sending many messeges to have her respond with a stupid kpop picture . that kills me every time i told one of her close friends how i feel and she green lighted me in freshman year but i was to scared so i waitedand she texted me that she diddnt have fellings for any one and that she was asexual so i made up so bs that she told me last year and that i was also (which is slighrtly true i dont like people sexually i think thay look nice but i can appreciate that on both guys and girls) i ran into her at a store once and relized how small of a town that we live in so i decided never to act stupid in front of anyone besides my diminishing number of friends so as not to emberess my self in front of her friends or family i didnt do it but i learned how to hack on android and find out geotracking info at which point i realized how far gone i was at this point i started cutting my self with exatco knives not to harm my self but becase they would scar and be nice conversation starters and because the small moment of pain made me feel sick but some what better about my self at this point i didn't have any one reliable to talk to and started making fake friendships so as to become closer to her o(ne guy im prety sure is my competition and they seem to be good friends and i would be friends with him if she wasn't there but actually hate ) while i dont act depressed i starterd hating my self for being ugly and not good enough for her i found out her birthday and made brownies and a as a joke frosted a can of beans and she found it really funny. i gave annonymouse valintines to her and a clothspin that says i &lt;3 you. over time my personalty has degraded to an open older brother teacher/ anoying person/ reliable person to a hunch back geek / bumbling idiot and is over weight and started cudling with my pillow pertending it was her and thinking how pathetic i was whenever i laugh i cry inside and if ime alone i wish i could becuse it makes me feel slightly better. my parents would disown me in an instant if they foud out about this . junior year started and I want to die my hear aches like crazy i havnt killled my self yet (obviously (srry sucide is not funny but i hope someone likes dark hummer)) only because i am to lazy and dont want my fammly to bismerch my memory (supper religous and new to america (they think love dosent work unless its aranged (what your thinkng is racist and that is why i didn't put a race))) or in the on in a million odds the girl actually likes me and suffers for the rest of her life
