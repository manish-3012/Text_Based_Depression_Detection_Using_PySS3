I already wrote my note now I just gotta do itIm in my 3rd year of uni and Im too burnt out to go on. I've been able to put this on others before, to find a reason why: I was bullied for years, I didnt have friends, I got a life altering eating disorder, I figured out I was a lesbian, etc. But now people support me but Im still so sad and empty.
No one has ever loved me, they only use me. Im only happy when Im drunk or high. And coming down is terrible. I dont wanna be sad, I dont wanna be gay, I dont wanna have to count every calorie that passes my lips.
I just wanna be dead.
