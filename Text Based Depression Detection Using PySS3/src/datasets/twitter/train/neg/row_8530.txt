Worried about my friendHi guys, I'm sitting with My friend who is a 21 y.o male. Yesterday, thursday he drank alot of liqour and he cut himself all over his torso and shoulders. And today, friday. He went to work.. Its nighttime now and we are sitting outside the rockclub i drove 2 hours to get here. (I'm sober) tonight. I asked him if he wanted help, from Ã  doctor about his thing right now he Said yes. 
 I understand depression, i had it from mars or so til recently. It just went away, all the suicidethoughts etc. Im not happy or anything But im not feeling any sadness or that cold feeling you get when you wake up.. 

Does anyone here have experience with helping Ã  friend with this? Please help, he is my best friend and we have been through lots of Shit together, both happy and sad moments. Sorry if this is wrong sub
