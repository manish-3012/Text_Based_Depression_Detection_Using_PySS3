I'm stuck.My mindset constantly flip flops everyday. For most of the time, I've accepted that I'm going to end it soon. But then the mental battle starts. My thoughts teeter as I consider trying once again to make things better, to salvage the wreck that is my life.

My thoughts are at such a constant battle with themselves that I cant make significant progress towards either goal. I'm just stuck.
