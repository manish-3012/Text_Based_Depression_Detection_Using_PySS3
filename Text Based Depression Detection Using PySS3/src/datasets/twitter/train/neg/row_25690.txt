Well here I am again.I just tried to kill myself by tying shoelaces around my throat and then twisting them tight with a pen. But I just couldn't go through with it. This is my third failed attempt in two months. I'm beginning to think that the reason I should live is because I can't follow through on my attempts.

I will be contacting mental health and setting up for counselling. I'm really unhappy about this, I just want to die.
