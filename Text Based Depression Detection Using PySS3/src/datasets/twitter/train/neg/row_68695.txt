I feel like I peaked in high school and that I have lost all my talents and I just really hate hyselfI feel guilty over this too because I am happily married with a husband and daughter and have some friends and am close to my parents.  And I still feel empty.  I have ADHD and have a difficulty focusing and can for get things and am hard of hearing so I am always afraid people find me annoying.   I have always wanted to be really smart and actually contribute positively to society but, in all honestly I am bad at everything.  When I was younger I was into all this stuff like writing, magic, theater and had ambitions to work in the film industry or be a social worker and even thoughb I got degrees in Radio TV Film and Sociology, I just kind of burnt out.   I had a few failures and just started drinking too much and hanging out online.   I
 am a SAHM and really love being a mom to my daughter and I love the hobbies I do have like stained glass and magic, but I feel so depressed that I am 39 and have gone no where in my life.  I used to really love writing and now33 I can't  even do that.  I am afraid to try acting again and even though I love stained glass and magic, I just feel like everyone in my life is working real jobs and I just have these meaningless hobbies.   My husband and best friend are both super nice and kind and I get so annoyed and irritated with everything and everyone.   I am also boring and don't even understand how anyone can even like me.   The only reason I haven't killed myself is I don't want to hurt my loved ones and 'I am afraid of death.  I have been depressed since I was a child and don't seem to know how to be happy...I am so envious of people that have a good head on their shoulders.
