Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™m a phony. Iâ€™m not supposed to be here. I DONT deserve to be here, Iâ€™m not depressed enough. But here I am.

I wish I could just go back to when I was five, and just die then. Days of kickball with my sisters and dad. Days of pure friendship. Everything was simple. Why did everything change? From first grade till now, I cannot think of a single year Iâ€™ve been satisfied with that year. 

Since first grade, to now Iâ€™ve been lonely. Things kinda picked up Iâ€™m sixth grade. Until winter break. Then it got worse. A supposed friend I had kinda ditched me for another. I guess thatâ€™s a stupid concept, but for some reason, it really messed me up. They laughed and giggled, while I was alone in the corner. 

Once, I didnâ€™t have anywhere to sit during lunch, because you know, stuff, for a good couple months. I stood by this friend and talked. She shoved away, smiles â€œgo sit downâ€ she says. I walk away, I feel lonely. 

Luckily, I have another good group of friends. But I mess that up, like I mess everything up. I always have to sabotage myself. 

Why am I always the laughing stock. Im always the joke. Why do I have to be so extra? Why canâ€™t I just stop being so lame and stupid. 

Why did I have to ruin that friend ship with that good friend. Why did I push her away? She was such a good person for me and I messed it up. For the best anyway, too good for me.

Why am I so grotesque? Why can I come to terms with it so I could eventually just get over it? Why did I let his insults get to me and sob all of sixth period? Why is my body so disgusting? Why do I eat my feelings 

Why doesnâ€™t mom ask why Iâ€™m crying? Why doesnâ€™t she ask if Iâ€™m okay? Why did she yell at me? Why did my classmate seem so annoyed with me when I cried?

I feel like Iâ€™m no ones first. Friend who kinda ditched me found a new friend. Better than the other one. A lot nicer actually. A kind girl, who Iâ€™m acquaintances with. I have a friend group, but I feel as though I have no friends. Another question, why would you put a backpack on the seat I usually sit at, smile at me with that fake sweetness, and say â€œsorry, saying this for s. You can sit over there.â€ The place with girls who are pretty cool, but Iâ€™m not too close with them. But I suppose it gave me insight on what I am. Someone who is unlovable, except by family

If I wanted to kill myself, my dad would know. He would be heartbroken beyond belief. He loves me and I love him. My sisters are so mean to him, who would have to walk through the mall with? 

Even if I wanted to kill myself, what happens after? Do I go to hell like brother rami says? Or would Allah take pity? Is He even real? What do I believe in?

If I have to be this age, want a husband and kids. But like he said, Iâ€™m ugly, and when I said no one would want me, he agreed. 

I truly crave what I said at the beginning. To be young again. Everything is so much more wonderful. The complexities are life are gone. It would be beautiful.

I would ask for help, but my mom would be mad, and my dad would be sad and stressed to know his daughters like this.

Iâ€™m sorry for being here. Am I even supposed to be here, let alone taken seriously? I am in early adolescence, Iâ€™m not supposed to be taken seriously about this, am I? If you read this, thanks for sticking through. I genuinely appreciate it
