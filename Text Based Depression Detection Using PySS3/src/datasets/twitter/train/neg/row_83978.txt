I am going to finish my life after I complete the video games I have left to play.(English is not my mother language)

Video games has been keeping me alive since I was 13.

I am a functional member of society, but that's not all in life.

In 2019 The last of us 2, Cyberpunk2077 and Death Stranding are going to come out. When I finish them, I will be finally death. I have my house and my job. But I've never had a girlfriend or a best friend.  

My health has always been good (184 cm and 76 kg right now), but 2 weeks before. I was diagnosed with a muscular disease that will stop my heart in 7 years more-less. 

I feel accomplished with myself (I am a computer engineer and video games developer), I will donate all my net worth (73.467 $ right now). 
I will be alive until 2021.
Good luck to you all. :)
