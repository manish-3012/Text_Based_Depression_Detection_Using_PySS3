How can I know if my e-friend is dead?16 days ago a user by the name of "sadbestfren" posted here about wanting to end it all, even though things where going better. 2 days ago she told me "I might not wake up", she hasn't talked since and I want to know if she successfully overdosed or not. Is there any way to do so if I dont know her full name or any other personal information? She lives in New Zealand btw. I just need to know if she survived.
