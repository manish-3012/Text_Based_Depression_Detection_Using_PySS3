i'm starting to slip...i've had overwhelming help from here recently but i'm really starting to slip again.. everything is just starting to become so overwhelming. my emotions are starting to get the better of me and everything is just pushing me to the edge.

i have msn if somebody wants to contact me so i can talk.
or maybe even make a friend..
