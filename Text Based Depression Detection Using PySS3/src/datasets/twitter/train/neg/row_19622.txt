Bedtime is a new kind of torture.I was formally diagnosed with depression many moons ago, as a young teenager. Now I'm in my twenties and so far every promise that life gets better has been a lie. Because even when I got a better job, got a boyfriend, etc, the chemicals in my brain are still out of whack. And now that the job and boyfriend are gone, I'm about done with this life.

I've always wondered why if this is my life and my body, I can't choose to go. I can pierce and ink it, I can fill it with smoke or sugar, I can throw it from bed to bed, but I can't choose to end it when all signs point to a long life of unhappiness ahead of me?

I have been an insomniac since before puberty, but where I used to stay up with a whirlpool of restless energy or unanswered philosophical queries or wretched with anxiety, now I stay up playing a series of snapshots in my head of times that I was happy but cannot reclaim.

The funny thing is most of those memories are at least partially false. I think my mind is just trying to cope by imagining what happiness and peace must feel like.

Maybe I'm not quite ready to pull a trigger, but my note is written. I'm ready to stop looking both ways when I cross the street. And I'm ready to stop eating.
