Is the pain of people left behind more important than the pain of a suicidal person?I want to end my life. Not right now, but I have no interest in dying of natural causes. I don't have a family to speak of I have a girlfriend but I feel like Iam a burden to her. I have an unending void inside me. I loath myself to the core. But iv never done anything about it because Iam scared of the damage it will do. I feel like that could be my ego and it would be better for everyone if I just got on with it.
