I'm going to jump out of my apartment soonI can't take the loneliness anymore, I'm done. There literally is no way out of it. I'm 22 years old and I still feel like a fucking child compared to my peers because I haven't had the experiences they have had. 

It feels like I have permanent brain damage because of years of isolation, it is impossible to recover from it. And I rather kill myself than live the rest of my fucking life in loneliness.
