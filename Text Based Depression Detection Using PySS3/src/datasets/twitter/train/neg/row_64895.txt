I wish I could help you all.Around a month ago I posted a text called â€œIâ€™m considering suicideâ€ a day after posting that someone who is now I consider a great friend to me stopped me from doing it. If I had half the socializing and communicating skills she has Iâ€™d be so happy. If you are here tonight for help please please DM me I will try my best to help. I truly care and I know itâ€™s hard to believe but please donâ€™t act out your thoughts without thinking twice.
