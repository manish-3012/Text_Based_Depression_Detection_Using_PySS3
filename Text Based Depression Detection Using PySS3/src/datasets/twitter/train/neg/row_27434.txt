Just a few words...Iâ€™m a horrible person. Do you understand that? I should never have been born. Ever since 26 October 1988 Iâ€™ve been nothing but a burden to everyone around me. A source of immense grief and worry. Worry about how to fix me. Grief when the surgeries failed. Over and over and over again.

I could never do anything on my own. Every time I was in trouble mum or dad had to step in drag me out. At school and outside of school and everywhere.

I have amazing parents. I donâ€™t deserve such care and goodness.

Iâ€™ve been kicked out. Have nowhere to go, no job, no place to stay, no money to speak of.

There is just one thing left to do now. Travel far away and go quietly. Peace and quiet for everyone I ever hurt.
