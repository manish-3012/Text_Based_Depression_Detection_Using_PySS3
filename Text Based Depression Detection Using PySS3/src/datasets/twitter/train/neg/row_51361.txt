Am I the only one who gets more depressed on their birthday?I honestly didnâ€™t even see myself living this long I sure as hell didnâ€™t want to live this long...My family is already being fake happy and nice and itâ€™s killing me...itâ€™s like today is a day of mockery.,,Iâ€™ve been on this shitty earth for 20 years..with no achievements...a shitty child hood....constant heart break.. constant pain and misery...traumatic experiences...backed out of several suicide attempts...20 years of that bull...and Iâ€™m still here and itâ€™s a â€œhappyâ€ day of birth...birthdays are pointless just like my existence.
