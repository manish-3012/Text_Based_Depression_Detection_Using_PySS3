2020 kicked the life out of meHad a rough year like us all. Close family member died, jobless for months and living in another country with no friends. Now a 12 year relationship ended yesterday by my bf. He's going through his own stuff so I can't even be angry. It's all too much. People are asking too much for me to smile and join in this Christmas.
