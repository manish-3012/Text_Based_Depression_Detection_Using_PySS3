Feeling unworthy of help for suicidal thoughts. Or that Iâ€™m just being dramatic.My feelings ping-pong all over the place recently.

I havenâ€™t cared to be alive for a while now. Iâ€™ve been contemplating suicide a considerable amount every day for weeks. I want to talk to someone about it.

But, I feel like my life isnâ€™t bad enough to be suicidal. My life has been relatively normal. No severe abuse, no terrible family tragedy or emotional trauma. I feel like if I talk to someone and we pick apart what Iâ€™ll has gone on in my 19 years, my feelings wonâ€™t sound justified.
