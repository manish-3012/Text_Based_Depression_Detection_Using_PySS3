My 23rd Birthday and 11 year anniversary when I died insideI swore for this whole year that my b-day would be the day but again I'm such a failure I can't even kill myself properly

I just want my misery to end and there's no other way, nothing rivals and no one can ever truly grasp how much I hate myself.
