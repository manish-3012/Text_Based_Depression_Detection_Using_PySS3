I wrote suicide notes on my phone for the first timeI wrote it to my family and to my friends. Also to my favorite teacher. Iâ€™m prepared so if I die then Iâ€™ll have the notes. I should probably add more stuff to them but itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve ever done it. So I thought I would share... lol. I donâ€™t even know how Iâ€™m gonna kill myself. Carbon Monoxide is too obvious but itâ€™s a nice way to go out. Electric shock is scary. I donâ€™t know if I have any pills to overdose. Guns are a complete fuck no. Hanging myself, I donâ€™t have any rope and I donâ€™t like the idea of it. But I do know I can find a bridge or building somewhere and jump off. Iâ€™ll just have to find a place and a time. I love living and I love all the amazing happiness it brings but the pain is too much sometimes.
