This isn't big or complicated or meaningful, it's just dying.I'll die. Who gives a shit? My parents will feel sad for a while. They'll move on. Or they'll die. We'll all die, everyone I know. What does it matter? What does any of this matter? It's all so petty and stupid and pointless and I'm just another drop in the ocean.

There's nothing cosmic about me. There's nothing important about my life. There's nothing that will be changed by me disappearing. And for me, it'll get to be over, done. At least I hope.

I tried the pills. I tried everything. Maybe I didn't try hard enough? I'm tired of trying, anyway, I'm tired, so I should just end it no matter what. 

I think I will do it tonight. Get it over with. Nothing is worth it.
