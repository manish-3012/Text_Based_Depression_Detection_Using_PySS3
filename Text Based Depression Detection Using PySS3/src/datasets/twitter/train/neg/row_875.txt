Does anyone feels like you are living in autopilot mode?Since the past 3 years i've felt this way, like, i just keep on doing things in autopilot, like going to work, college and to the gym, then sleep, then rinse and repeat, and so on. Nothing really drives me to do anything more that that, and it's just i feel "obligated" to, don't know really why though. I've been in a downfall since then, and i don't really see a way up honestly.
