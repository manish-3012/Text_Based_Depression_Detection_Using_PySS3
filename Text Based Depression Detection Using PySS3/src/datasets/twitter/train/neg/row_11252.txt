The only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fact that my boyfriend's best friend died last year.I'm worried about how he would cope with my death. I have family and friends but I'm sure they'd just be relieved if I died. I've seen a therapist and I was doing well until I found out that I don't have a job for summer (I'm a student who's graduating in a month) and I'm not sure if I get to uni. I feel like I'm letting down my parents who have helped me. My sister and all my friends are working and don't understand how someone could be lazy enough to not have a job (I've applied for a few jobs but I haven't been active enough). 

My family is not rich but we've never been short of money, and my parents have basically spoiled me. It's disgusting how I always need to ask money from my parents. 

I feel that I deserve to die and it's best for everyone. I don't know any other way to make my boyfriend feel better about his friend's death than to wait and listen. Is there any other way? I don't want him to be too sad when I kill myself, but I'm not sure if I can wait much longer.
