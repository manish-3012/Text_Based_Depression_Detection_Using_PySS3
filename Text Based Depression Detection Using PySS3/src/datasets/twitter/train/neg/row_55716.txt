Can anyone give me a reason to keep going.I've tried getting help. I'm always terrified. I can't hold down a job or relationships. The world is ending. The leaders are corrupted and hateful. Everyone is divided. We're all getting sick and dying. There's nothing left. I don't know what to do. I have a suicide plan and I don't know when is the best time to act it out. I wanted to do the most good I can on Earth before I go. I don't know when enough is enough. I don't know what I should do. I need to know that everything is going to be fine but it's just not going to be, ever. I don't want to struggle on through it. I have no faith. I want to disappear. I don't want to exist. I want to die. I want to finally be without fear.
