Being rid of the need to prepareI've thought that if/when I kill myself, I would want to leave things in order for family. Make a list of pins or passwords to various accounts and whatever other details they might need but I also feel like the act of making those preparations might deter me. Maybe it's just my cowardice speaking but I feel like my suicide would have to be sudden and spontaneous before some fear and other thoughts stops me. If I was in the right mindset to end it, I know taking the time to prep would only make it harder to go through with it as the strength of the hopelessness wanes in inaction.

This should be a good thing to most people but it feels like a sick trap keeping me here. There's no point in me being here at all and I'm just rotting. How are people ever strong enough to just end it? What do I need to push me beyond the caring so I can get out of here for good? I don't want to be here!
