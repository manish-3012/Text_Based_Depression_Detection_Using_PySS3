I might kill myself over this, I don't know how to move forward from this despite the immense emotional support from my twin brother. 

I know its been three months since you posted this. I recently got caught red handed on cheating on 2 small assignments nearing the finals, I was extremely burntout and the class has like 8 test in a course of 6 weeks. The thing is I have a twin and on that day we wanted to split the work between the 2 assignments because we wanted to prepare for the final and the 8th test. It was not like us to cheat, before I promised myself to never cheat but at this instance I gave in to temptation, and before this I also forced my twin to promise me that he would never cheat as well. I felt extremely guilty and apologized to the professor to not get anything out of them but just to reassure myself that I actually tried to take full responsibility of my actions.

I got two zeroes in the gradebook, she did not email me any referal nor did she respond to the email. She only read the email.

Its been already a day now I can't get it off my mind, nothing is happening right now . Will I be able to move forward from this and will there be a more severe punishment later on?

to give more context to the sitatuation I am studying at a community college and the professor is very sweet. Nor do I buy material to get answers, like chegg or course hero because that stuff is really expensive.
