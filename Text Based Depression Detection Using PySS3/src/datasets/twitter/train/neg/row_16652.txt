Is my life taking me anywhere?I just sometimes feel like itâ€™s no hope.

My moms an alcoholic and smokes pot, my dad works constantly, my little sisters a bitch and a mommyâ€™s girl, and I feel like Iâ€™m loosing my friends. I have had thoughts of hurting myself, but... Iâ€™m just to scared. I donâ€™t want to live but Iâ€™m too afraid of dying. My older sister just tells me Iâ€™m an attention seeker. Iâ€™m always stuck in the middle, invisible, always exhausted and stressed.

Iâ€™m 13 and a female, but I just canâ€™t see the light, my only escape is red dead redemption. I watch my dad play it when heâ€™s available and doesnâ€™t hate me. And I daydream of being apart of Johns family, where they all love each other. I daydream that I am jacks best friend. I daydream that itâ€™s all happy. 

I feel that I have a mental illness, like ADHD or bipolar, and I might possibly start getting an eating disorder. But Iâ€™m never going to get that diagnosed. Itâ€™s not like my family cares. Iâ€™m practically invisible, and an attention seeker. I just want to fade away. â€œItâ€™s just a fazeâ€ they say, â€œstop acting like your actually depressed, your not actually!â€ They say â€œsometimes I feel like your just faking itâ€ they say. â€œIt will get betterâ€ they say. __is there a painless way out?__
