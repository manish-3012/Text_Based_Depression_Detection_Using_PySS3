Being committed...1. When to consider?
2. How to go about?
3. Repercussions?

I've dealt with suicide before, three years ago. But this time around, for lack of a better analogy, it's like I've built up an immunity. It was a close call then, but having seen everything I've done to progress from that point on fall flat again, it's hard to have yet another go at it. The lines, the talking, the friends, the outreach. All too far gone... what if it's time to be committed?
