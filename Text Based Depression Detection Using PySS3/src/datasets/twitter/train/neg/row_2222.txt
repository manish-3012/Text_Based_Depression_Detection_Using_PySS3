Just a small ventFeeling like shit lately. Just in a slump. Been taking my meds. Talking to friends. Walking and getting fresh air. Doing my college homework in time. Getting decent and good grades. 

Just I feel like it's for nothing. Lately I feel like even though I'm doing okay, I just am wasting everyone's time. I'm just annoying them all with how I am. 

Anyways, my issues aren't a big deal whatever, other people need more attention than me. I just needed to vent a little to people who don't know me or how to contact someone who can help me. The worst I'd do would be to cut the living hell out of my legs and waist. 

I apologize for wasting anyone's time if you read this far...
