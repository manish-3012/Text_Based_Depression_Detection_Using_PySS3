I feel trapped and alone and I have no idea what to do I've always been a loner sense I can recall. Over the last semester I've just reached a breaking point, I cant continue feeling so alone like this anymore I just want a way out a way to escape the pain. Its just gotten to be to much me I don't think I can go on with living this pseudo-life anymore. I just want a way out its not worth it anymore.
