When to go to the ER?I have suicidal thoughts on and off for several months. It intensified in late December, to the point where I wrote a suicide note, starting googling about methods to die, etc. The suicidal thoughts have slightly lifted, but I know they could return anytime and Iâ€™m still heavily heavily depressed.


The dilemma is that when Iâ€™m actively suicidal, I donâ€™t even want help anymore and I have no hope anything would help, so I donâ€™t go to the ER.

Now that I am slightly less suicidal, Iâ€™m thinking I should go, because I feel the hope that I can get better.


What Iâ€™m wondering is what will happen if I go now? Would they send be back home because Iâ€™m not posing enough of a threat to myself? If I go, I want them to keep at least for a few days, so that something is done. Should I take the risk to wait? I feel like is the time to go, but Iâ€™m afraid to waste a whole day waiting in the ER for nothing, just to be send back home, even more disappointed and hopeless.

I need advice, please.
Thanks,
