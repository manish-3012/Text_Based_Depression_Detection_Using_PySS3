Iâ€™m done with everythingThis is a throwaway just incase. Actually a quite old one. Iâ€™ve lost 4 years worth of data, life has recently went really downhill for me, every small wrong thing causes me to feel like doing it. Everything goes wrong. Only 1 good thing has happend and well yeah. I have been bullied practically for half of my life and Iâ€™ve had enough. I get random calls like everyday from someone they just laugh at me and go like â€œoiii go kysâ€ at school I get followed and get told the same thing. Theres nobody I can trust. Everyday Iâ€™ve felt like ending it, but as soon as I slowly start to actually ending myself I just feel like â€œHEYHEHEYEHEY DO NOT DO THATâ€ like every suicidal thought goes away for a second. I want to commit suicide, Iâ€™m tired of living. I want to be in peace and if god exists, please look after my friends, family and especially other mentally ill people.
