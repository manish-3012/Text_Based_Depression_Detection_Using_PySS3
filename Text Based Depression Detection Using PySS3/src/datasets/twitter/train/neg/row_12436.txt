Everything in my life is in my favor right now. So why do I feel like this?I'm getting paid to do what I love. I constantly keep writing great music that I enjoy. But it all tastes bland and feels black and white. I have a girlfriend who I love. Why do I feel so down? Why do I have to keep being pushed through different medications? Zoloft has come closest to working. I'm constantly crying. At least I can get an erection again with this medication. 

I should love my life. And sometimes I do. Until I sit down and think for a while. I try so hard to make friends but I can always tell they don't want to be my friend. It almost makes me wonder sometimes if I'm autistic or something and I just don't know it. I'm an adult but I don't feel like one. People treat things I don't know like common sense. 

I feel so isolated. The main reason I wouldn't kill myself is because I don't trust anyone else to take care of my cats. I'm sorry for the mini rant. Idk where else to put this. I think this all every night and luckily I stop myself. Any advice?
