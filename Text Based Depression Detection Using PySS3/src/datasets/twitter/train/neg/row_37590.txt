Just want to dieI can't think of a single redeeming thing about myself or my life that would warrant me keeping on with this farce any longer. The only thing stopping me from hanging myself is the fear of the pain I would have to endure in doing so. I just want it over with, the thought of a long peaceful sleep is so inviting. 

I heard Belgium has suicide clinics? do they only cater to the terminally ill or can anyone go if you have enough money? My only other option is traveling to the US and seeing if I can get hold of a gun so I can shoot myself.
