failing school, not strong enough to fight myselfI didnâ€™t turn in any of my finals, which count for 20% of my grade. I will end the semester with Câ€™s and Dâ€™s, might not even pass. Iâ€™ll lose my scholarship and once I see my dropped gpa on paper Iâ€™ll finally have a reason to give up. I worked so hard and then threw it away. Quarantine has been a nightmare for me for these reasons. I feel like I wouldnâ€™t have let myself go if I wasnâ€™t stuck at home all day. Everyone here makes me sick.

Without my academic integrity I am nothing. Nobody will care about me because Iâ€™ll seem like a lazy loser on paper. But my parents refuse to help me, I get so mad at them and sometimes I wish I could just cry it out but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been like this for years, I thought rebelling and not doing anything would get them to finally help me but they just donâ€™t care. I worked so hard for them, I slaved myself, I would get 3 hours of sleep a day. School was exceptionally hard for me for so many reasons. I feel sick just thinking about it. I would lay awake crying, everyday, at 2 in the morning, trying not to kill myself and would attend class a few hours later like nothing happened

I just canâ€™t believe it. Iâ€™m struggling to make it to my birthday in July. Living is hard. I already told myself that Iâ€™d end it on my 18th birthday next year. I donâ€™t have anybody
