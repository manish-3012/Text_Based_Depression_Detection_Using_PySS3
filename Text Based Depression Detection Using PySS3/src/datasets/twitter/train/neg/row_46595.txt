It's almost that time again (crossposted)It'll be 6 years on Sunday. I remember when your sister called me before I left for school that day. She said you were gone, and everything kinda went white. Her sobbing fading in the distance. I never cried. Everything was gone, faded from my view for hours..
Your sister and mom were waiting for me when I got home. They cried, and cried, and I could just watch. I couldn't feel what they felt. How terrible.
The last time I saw you, quite peaceful. You really did it, you made it. Here I sit, silently gazing upon your friends and family. Everyone we loved was there to send off our angel. I still can't listen to those songs.
It's been so long. I miss your ocean eyes. Often I wonder if you could see what I've done with my life. How disappointed you'd be. Each year is a little colder than the one before. How I've made it this far, I couldn't say. However, that still won't stop me from trying be with you again. I just hope you're still waiting.

R.I.P
