Iâ€™m scared of being a bad personThe world is so evil sometimes. I try so hard to be good but every time I make a mistake I can feel myself die a little more. I barely talk to people because I donâ€™t want to do or think anything wrong. I imagine hurting someoneâ€™s feelings and I want to choke myself out. I canâ€™t deal with the concept of making mistakes. My guilt complex wonâ€™t let me enjoy anything or anyone!!! Nothing is innocent and Iâ€™m too wrong to ever come close!! Fuck!!!!

I just want to die before I have the opportunity to be any worse. I canâ€™t bear to think of how people will talk about me after my death but I canâ€™t do this anymore. If angels can fall Iâ€™m never going anywhere but hell!!!
