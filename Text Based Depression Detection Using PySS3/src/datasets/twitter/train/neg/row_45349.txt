How do I get out?I feel suicidal but I canâ€™t do it.

I just want to get away. Iâ€™m too young.

I want to get away from college. I want to get away from the internet. I want to get away from toxicity.

But it always finds a way to pull me back in.

I just want to live with a peacefully and not try to connect a million dots everyday.
