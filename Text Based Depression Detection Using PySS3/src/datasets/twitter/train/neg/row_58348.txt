Constantly thinking of suicide. Decided it's inevitable.I'm 22. In my 5th year of college studying mechanical engineering.  I have 2 semesters left.  I'm constantly depressed and school just makes it worse. I don't feel smart.  It's just all to stressful and I'm just sick of life in general. I'm just.... tired. Tired of everything. I have an amazing girlfriend who means the world to me and she might be the only reason I've made it this far. All I want is to be done with school and get a job but I'm so scared of not getting a job due to my gpa. I'm scared of not graduating because I don't have a high enough gpa. My parents are paying for my school and I just feel like I'm wasting their money. I'm under constant pressure to perform, to succeed.  Getting a gun and just offing myself is always in my mind and I replay it constantly. I feel like there's no escaping it.  Life just didn't feel worth it.
