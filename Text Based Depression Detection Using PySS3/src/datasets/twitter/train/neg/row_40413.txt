Is there anyone in Los Angeles who can be a friend who is there for me?Hello I am 27/m.  I need a friend.  I don't have anyone who I can connect with.  I don't have anyone who understands me.  I don't have family who is there for me.  I am looking for someone to be my friend.  Maybe go on a hike or a walk.  Or to go out and do anything.  I want someone who I can talk to.  Please message me with any questions.  Thanks
