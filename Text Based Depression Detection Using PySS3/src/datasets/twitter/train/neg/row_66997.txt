no one really caresi donâ€™t think anyone actually cares about what iâ€™m going through. to have my entire world crushed in the palm of my hand, watching everything i held close to my heart turn to ashes. my memories becoming clouded by an evil darkness and fading with each passing day. iâ€™ve lost sight of the path through this void, which was once well defined. to lose all aspirations and goals, what left is there for me in this world. 

having my so called â€œfriends and familyâ€ practically erased from my memory, i have no where else to turn. all because of one naive mistake. causing everything i knew of this reality to break. my head feels foggy and ridden with guilt, with peace only coming once under the quilt. i donâ€™t know why iâ€™m turning this into a poem. just feels right when nothing else matters. anyway, i want to overdose to ease this pain iâ€™m faced with every waking moment of my life. everyone thinks iâ€™m over reacting and treating a paper cut like a lethal wound, only if they could see inside my mind would they realize what horrors iâ€™ve been condemned to endure. 

i know ive said some similar stuff on here in the past but iâ€™m falling deeper into the depths of depression, i might actually go through with it this time. 

goodbye everyone, i had about a year or so in my life where i can say that iâ€™ve truly been happy. at least i got to experience that before calling it quits.
