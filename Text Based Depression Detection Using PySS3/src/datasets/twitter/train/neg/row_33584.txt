The thought of me even talking to a boy and beingIâ€™ve had friends who were â€œboysâ€ before. Just not boyfriends....and my parents well I canâ€™t have a boyfriend till Iâ€™m 18 apparently. But itâ€™s my life, my choices-and Iâ€™m christian as well.Im scared...I really want to date honestly..but Iâ€™m scared as death. I havenâ€™t necessarily met any boys that I can say were â€œhot or cuteâ€ because they just donâ€™t stand out. So Iâ€™m forced to no dating and also Iâ€™m 14. I moved to where I am a few years ago and I left during middle school. My friends were given my moms number but Iâ€™ve only talked to one in recent times...I know they remember me but itâ€™s sad we never talked again after moving...itâ€™s ok I get it..we were younger then...so now I have one friend. I have adhd and pretty much was diagnosed with it in kindergarten so essentially my whole life. It makes it hard to make friends for me and I had about 4 friends in my old school. I only have friends with people like me.,.because we are similar- and bond well. Now I moved her and I have one friend my bff my life (itâ€™s a girl) sheâ€™s my bff. What do it now-I have one friend and it makes me feel sad that I do...I want to date remember? What if I did date? I never met anyone I could call cute-but Iâ€™m Iâ€™m not lesbian cuz Iâ€™m christian. So if I dated-I have adhd....why would anyone want to date me. Iâ€™m an imperfect individual and I know nobody is perfect but-Iâ€™m more so than anyone..and my friend has some similar too..thatâ€™s why we bond. We donâ€™t really care for men..we just never cared..I know I love myself because god made me hoe I am. But still the way I am-why would anyone like me? Why would anyone care? And sometimes idk when boys talk to me if they joke. Theyâ€™ll say â€œkiana wanna go to the dance?â€ But Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s a dare. Because the boys they hang with all laugh. And I know it is because why me? Why me? Of all the pretty babes? Why? Why do you gotta joke about that? What if I took it seriously? Every time they do that I reject them. I hate dancing.. sometimes theyll say â€œyour so hot or cuteâ€ or something but you know what? I donâ€™t believe them. I know they think Iâ€™m annoying because of my adhd. Iâ€™m not that hyper so I think but apparently I am...and they always ask â€œdo you have adhd?â€ I do. But I never ANWSER. Why should it matter? ðŸ˜­..why do we never get recognized as existing? They will always ask about us and our adhd or what not. Can I not just be called upon as human??? Iâ€™m human and can feel and hurt too. I feel...and behind all me and my friends uwuâ€™s were not fine you think we are but if only you knew us.. youâ€™d see we arenâ€™t, we arenâ€™t fine at all. Weâ€™re people and need to be seen as such. Iâ€™m not the girl with adhd Iâ€™m just a normal girl with normal imperfections...nobody is perfect....but then when u do this and joke about me and my friends-thatâ€™s not right. I want the truth and not a lie. I DONT WANT YO LIVE A LIE! What do I do rn? I need someone to talk to....I need a friend someone like me or not..,someone who really just cares and understands me....like my bff the only one who knows me. The true me the me whoâ€™s sad inside the one who cries at night and cries silently to sleep...Iâ€™m just-ugly on the  outside arenâ€™t i? My actions are and I guess so am I..,
