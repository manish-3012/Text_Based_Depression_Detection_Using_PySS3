I really want to kill myself this weekPurely for financial reasons I have been forced take a second job which will all but destroy any hope at a social life that I might have had. Not that I had much of a life to begin with but I could still go out with my one friend when he wanted. I guess I'm just not that thrilled about having to work 10am-8pm every day but if I wanna get out of my family's place I have to do this. And that's what is killing me right now. That I'm gonna just be basically a wage slave working for nothing.

My life is forcing me into a position where I'd rather slit my wrists than live in but I have no other choice. There aren't any full-time jobs around here that I qualify for either as this is just one big college town. Everything caters to those guys and I just feel stuck.
