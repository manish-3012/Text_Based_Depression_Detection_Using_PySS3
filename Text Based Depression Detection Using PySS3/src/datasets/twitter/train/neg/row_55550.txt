WorthlessHi,
I don't know why I'm still alive. I'm so worthless. And I don't know why I borther you with my problems. I have no right to get you down. So just don't read this. And if you do, excise my bad English.

My family doesn't need me, only my money. My boyfriend says he loves me, but he also is staying away because all my problems are too mich for him and so he often doesn't replie when I write him. I don't have close friends whom I can talk to.

All in all I think the world would be a better place without me. All others want from me is money or that I do something for them.  Of course it would hurt them at first but I don't think that it would take long for them too forget and I don't know why I should suffer more so they don't feel this little pain. I just gonna hold my promises and finish all my projects. Next weekend is going to be the last one with my family.
