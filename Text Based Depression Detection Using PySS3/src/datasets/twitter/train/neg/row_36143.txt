I almost killed myself :(Hi guys I don't normally do this opening up thing but today my anxiety was at a high state, whilst I was riding my bike, I needed to cross the road and people walking down were for some reason looking at me, I ended up going straight into the road without looking one side and was split seconds away from being seriously injured. I feel so guilty that I would be so careless about my own life and how it would have affected my family I feel like crying, the same thing happened previously when I was on my bike my thoughts got the better of me and I went in the road quickly without looking, it's like I hate myself at times, I feel like I was not in full control of my actions because of constant anxiety. Some advice or comments would be great..
