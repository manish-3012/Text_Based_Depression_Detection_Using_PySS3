Just wanna end it nowI'm actually sick of feeling this way, the thoughts of just do it never going away. I've even reached out for help telling people I don't feel safe and I'm ignored, ignored by the people who I'm keeping myself here for I want to die but I don't want to die at the same time. So I'm scared I'll hurt myself because a part of me wants to stop this pain, the last few days have shown me that I actually don't have anyone, that no one really cares about me. So at least they won't be hurt or miss me when it happens
