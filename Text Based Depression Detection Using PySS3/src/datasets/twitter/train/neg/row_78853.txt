Iâ€™m done with life.
I just wanted to put this here to make sure my parents know I loved them and it was never their fault. If I ever blamed them, or seemed like I did, Iâ€™m sorry. I wish I could make it up to them and I had plans for a future where I could, but the pandemic just took that away. Itâ€™s not in anyoneâ€™s control. Itâ€™s okay. 

I hope everyone who reads this goes on to do things that I never will. Maybe (and probably) you already have. I canâ€™t take a whole life of sitting in my room watching everything and everyone pass me by. I tried to be a part of normal life, but it just wasnâ€™t  for me. Iâ€™m sure I could have done more, said no when it mattered and maybe I would have a happy life, or just one worth living, but thereâ€™s no point to regret anymore. I never did anything bad or hurt anyone and I like to think that I made some people happy while I was here. I hope of anyone has memories of me, theyâ€™re good ones, or theyâ€™re in passing. Iâ€™d like it to be that way and I think it will be. 

If I was to weak to do the important work when it mattered the most for doing this, thatâ€™s okay. I was never a very strong person and thatâ€™s fine. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Maybe my life could have gotten better, but just understand that I couldnâ€™t let it get any worse anymore. 

If youâ€™re just reading this sub because you are curious or for disturbing content, if you still think your life is worth living, please just donâ€™t let fear stop you. Iâ€™ve ruined my life because I was so scared of everything and put myself into a situation where this is my only option. I hope youâ€™re not there, and if you arenâ€™t, go outside and put the middle finger in lifeâ€™s face. Thereâ€™s nothing worth being scared over. If youâ€™re going to live, do it fearlessly and make it worth sticking around for.
