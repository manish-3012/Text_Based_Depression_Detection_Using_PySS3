Are you guys ever struck by how pointless everything is?I work a job I don't particularly dislike but it is very stressful.  I work so I can afford a place to live and not be homeless.  Can't really save any money, can't really get ahead.


I have a low IQ and have always struggled academically so that route is not feasible considering the heavy cost and high chance of failure.  


I don't know, I just feel like my life is a constant nothing, but ocassionally is deeply stressful and tragic.  


Maybe I'm being melodramatic but I just don't really know what I'm even staying around for.
