â€œyouâ€™re so young and you have so much to live forâ€but iâ€™ve also been through so much shit. shit you couldnâ€™t even imagine to feel when you were my age. my own anxiety stops me from reaching out even though i couldnâ€™t be more desperate. iâ€™ve tried so hard to live but itâ€™s only gotten worse and i cant believe iâ€™m still here. i thought i was going to die at 12. weâ€™re all put here against our will and the world expects so much from you and more. so many things hold me back from true happiness. you either die struggling or youâ€™re lucky enough to have that ounce of strength to keep you alive. and iâ€™m in between.

 it drains everything out of me every day to keep going. iâ€™ve made like 4 posts in mental health subs with no response but this is my last cry for help. iâ€™ll find a way to do it somehow. better than trying with this anymore when iâ€™m gonna go nowhere mentally. goodbye.
