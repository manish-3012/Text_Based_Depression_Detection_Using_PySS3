miserableiâ€™m lying here googling all the possible ways i could end my life tonight. 

i keep reading &amp; rereading articles. like iâ€™m preparing for one long seminar. 
i want to know how to perform a surgical cut on my abdomen. or if i will die if i jump off a 9 storey building. or how long it would take me to learn how to tie the suicide knot. and hang myself or if i can physically asphyxiate myself. or set myself on fire. 

i want desperately to die. 
i am done. with being alive. with existing. 
everywhere on my body hurts. 
everything is on fire. 

i am miserable.
