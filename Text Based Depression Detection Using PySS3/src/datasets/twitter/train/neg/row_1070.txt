Suicide, and it's cowardice. Or is it?Much like the rest of the world, I live with the thoughts of suicide, day in and out. I hear on a regular basis (local folk, not on the internet), that suicide is a coward's method, that it is 'taking the easy way out' instead of solving the problem.

Still, I'd rather face the sweet embrace and chill of the afterlife than live with the obsessive, and quite frankly, creepy behaviour that I can't seem to be rid of.

I've driven all my friends away, save the select few I've known for years. I've distanced myself from family, and I live with the consistent guilt from an event that happened years ago that I can't let go of until I'm forgiven by whom I'd hurt. 

Suicide, and for that matter, any death, is not 'the easy way out', because it's enduring one final pain to make the rest stop. Those of us who have been driven over that border do not fear the great darkness, we embrace it. While it brings sorrow to our families, they get over it, just like the rest of the problems they face.

We're remembered for the positives, not for the negatives. And, I think that counts for something. It's not cowardice that drives is to that point. It's one final breath of courage.

Much like many other members of my family, I'm sure that one day I will join the great darkness. Fit now though, I have my obsession to keep me alive, and people I must care for.
