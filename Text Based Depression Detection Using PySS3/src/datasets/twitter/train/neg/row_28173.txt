No one actually caresHere i am once again. It seems a pitty to waste my breath. I scream and shout its all for none, but no one really gives a fuck. No matter what this times the last your all nice people but dont try and ask. I cant be helped it cant be stopped. Youve tried before but youve never stuck. You only care when im here. at my point of no return. Well here i am one last time. To end it all for good this time. Goodbye all its been fun. Thats a god damn lie. Goodbye no one.
