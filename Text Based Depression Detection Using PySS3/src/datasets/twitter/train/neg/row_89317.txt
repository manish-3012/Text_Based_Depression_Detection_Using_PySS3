I'm not in crisis and I'm not as bad as I have been in past weeks but.. I still struggle with why I'm alive and how I'm feeling. I sometimes wonder if I want to feel bad. Or something. I just know I'm a screw up and I dont feel like a good friend, relative, or anything. I sometimes think itll get better and then I eventually get pissed and feel like I cant win and everyone is better off without me and then I often end up self harming. And sometimes I really just want to get it over with and try killing myself or get halfway there and... idk. Learn something from the near death experience.

I almost resented my best friend at times for wanting me to stay alive. My parents just... I dont know. They werent as strong a reason to stay as she is.

I dont know anything. I dont know if I'm doing better or not or if I am and I'm just stupid and making things worse and harder for myself because I kind of think theres a part of me that is just out to destroy me and any possible happiness.
