I think I want to dieI've always thought about suicide. I think it's normal for most people to think about it though. For the past few months, maybe almost a year I've been thinking about it more seriously. I've spent the last few weeks planning out different ways I could do it. Debating whether it's better to leave a note so my family would know there's nothing they could have done or making it look like an accident. I've been putting a lot of thought into it anyways.

Basically I don't know why I've been like this. I eat well. I exercise.  I have a loving family and plenty of friends.  Up until the last few weeks I was sleeping relatively normally. I have lots of hobbies. I just don't feel like I enjoy life. 

 What should I do? I spoke briefly about it to a friend without trying to worry him too much. He told me to get a therapist but I can't afford it and I also have no idea what I would talk about. I know I'm a great person and I have a great life. I just feel very numb about everything. And when I spend time alone my head tells me the world would be better without me. I can't keep trying to avoid being alone and constantly trying to distract myself from these thoughts. It's tiring.
