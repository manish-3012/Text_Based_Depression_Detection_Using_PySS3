How do i stop thinking about dyingHello reddit! It's been the 3rd night in a row now where i had these very real suicidal thoughts, and while it does sound very.. easy and pleasing i kind of dont want to let all my friends down. But idk if I want to keep living anymore as well. Any suggestions on how some of you handled those thoughts or just anyone typing me in general would be highly appreciated, i dont know who to talk to about this, and i don't want my friends to get worried or sad because of me. they're great..
