I donâ€™t know how to helpThrowaway for obvious reasons. 

Someone close to me, is having a hard time and honestly? I donâ€™t know how to help them.  Weâ€™re both mentally unhealthy and are both passively suicidal. Recently this person is struggling to function in regular society (they have a full time job) and Iâ€™m worried that they might hurt themselves in the near future. I am also struggling with work (50% mh, 50% COVID) and because of the way our lives are intertwined, if they were to get hurt our quality of life would go down the drain. Iâ€™m worried that the next time I wake up, Iâ€™ll find a body or a note. Iâ€™m truly terrified of what might happen and I canâ€™t find a well paying job in order to take the pressure off of them. Weâ€™re both in therapy but, it doesnâ€™t work as well for them as it does for me. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be able to be strong enough for the both of us. I absolutely donâ€™t know how to survive without her.
