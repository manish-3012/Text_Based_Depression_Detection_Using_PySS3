Just a poemWhat is the point
Of waking up
When you can't even stay straight
And you have to duck
All those thoughts
That overwhelm
You scream inside and wish for another realm
Feeling sorry that you woke up
Wishing all of this would stop
You're exactly like a crop
That hasn't seen a ray of sun or at least a drop
You try to block all those thoughts
You feel like something inside you rotts
You know you wanna do it but don't have the guts
