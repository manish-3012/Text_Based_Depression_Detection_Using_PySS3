Tried to hang myself. againAt first I tried to strangle myself with a pair of earbuds. I wanted to see what it would feel like, if I would become lightheaded or w/e. The only thing it did was leave a painful red mark around my neck. I hope it disappears before I have to go to school tomorrow. 

Then I tried to hang myself with a leather purse strap.  It was low enough for me to barely stand, so I relaxed my body. It hurt a little bit. My head started to get hot and I felt dizzy. I stood up and got back on my stepping stool bc I panicked.  Ah, I guess I wasn't prepared. 

I dunno. I feel empty. I don't know why I decided to share this. Probably cuz i'm lonely. 

Also I feel kinda bad bc i'm really shy, sorry if I dont respond to comments, but I read everything.
