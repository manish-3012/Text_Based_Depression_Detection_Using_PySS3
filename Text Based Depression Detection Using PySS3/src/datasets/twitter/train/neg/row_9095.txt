Just venting over stupid stuffHi,

I just felt the need to vent. 

So, Iâ€™ve been feeling pretty bad lately, and my sleeping pattern is really messed up. I thought Iâ€™d have a shave and the damn shaver came apart (itâ€™s an electric one) and I couldnâ€™t find a piece that went missing. And itâ€™s the only shaver that doesnâ€™t irritate my skin much (I have really sensitive skin) and gives a close enough shave. 

So now Iâ€™ll probably have to buy another one, and itâ€™s just so frustrating.
