I just need a place to talk toI've not been feeling very good in my head I suppose. Everyday something new happens to make me feel worse about myself and my situation. But I've never thought about suicide like I have been lately. It's constantly a thought either in the back or front of my mind. The thing is, though, I don't think I'm like actively suicidal. I just think it'd be better if I just weren't here, you know? And I hate feeling the way I do, but my parents can't afford therapy, but I also desperately need it. I just feel like nobody cares and I'm not worth caring about. It's never been this strong before and I don't know what to do. I'm 17 in my senior year, you know? I should be having fun but everything feels like shit. I just can't be happy.

Anyway, I didn't know if this was the right sub for this long ass monologue, but I just needed somewhere to vent where people would see I guess. Thanks for reading anyway if you did.
