I am Atlas. For now.I am Atlas. I can hold the world up. I have to. Or sink. No swimming.  

I trained for this. When they make you be a goalie in soccer when you're little. I didn't know that had a purpose I thought they were just being assholes but through out my soccer career I learned to take it.

I love two beautiful girls. And I'm a girl too. And they love eachother. More than they love me. And it hurts. But I can be the one that hurts. For now. I can be Atlas.  Not Alice.

I grew up with Alice. She was smart and happy and pretty and could sing. And then one night she fired a test shot into the wall and then shot herself.  And I'm jealous of her because she had the gun. She had the option, the choice. But I choose being Atlas. Not Alice. I can hold the world up. I can hold their world up. One my girlfriend of 5 years. The other our new best friend. I can hold their world up and let them be happy while I hold up the pain. 

I can be the one that hurts. For how long, I don't know. I can be the one that hurts. I am Atlas.
