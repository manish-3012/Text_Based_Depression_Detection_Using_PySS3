life is leading nowherei am so done right now. i don't even know how i'm typing this post tbh. i take one step forward and five steps back. i am 20 and have had one actual job for 3 fucking months. no one will hire me, the clubs at my small lame ass college won't accept me. my friends ignore me and i don't want to be a burden to my family. i am to weak to keep going but too weak to actually end my life. i want to fast forward four years to having a job and an apartment and friends that care and who knows maybe not die a virgin like i'm on track to.

everything in my life is so fucking empty. my friends are superficial, my family doesn't really know me because i hide my anxiety and depression and basically everything about me and mirror them so they'll like me, i do well on 4 exams only to fail one that will majorly fuck up my future, and even my dog doesn't make me happy anymore.

i just want it to be over. i am so exhausted.
    and i can't ask for help because it would put a burden on my family and ruin my semester and everything would be so awkward so i have to pretend like i'm only slightly not ok at counseling what the fuck am i even do with my life?

EDIT: Thank you everyone. I am "feeling" a little bit better today (although still very numb and tired), and I plan on talking to my counselor about how I am not really getting better, and probably eventually my doctor about changing medicine, or possibly seeing a psychiatrist if that's what it comes down to. I will have to see a psychologist soon, because the counseling at my school is limited to 15 times a year. I am sure that I will be forced to talk to my dad eventually; if it goes bad I'll just hide in my room for the rest of my life ;) . Thanks so much guys! I really appreciate all of your responses, it was so helpful and nice to hear from people that really understand instead of just saying "oh you're weak" or "what about your family?!"
