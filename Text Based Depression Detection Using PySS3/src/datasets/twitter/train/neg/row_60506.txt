I gave up[trigger warning: weird/embarrassing sexual education related talk]

Today, I may have screwed things beyond repair. I couldn't see the line in the sand and now I've overstepped it and there is nothing I can do. I always had trouble sharing stuff on therapy sessions but I was lately getting much better on that part.

So, what happened was that I was telling everything I was thinking without filter to my therapist and I (for some reason) decided that it was a good idea for my "progress" to admit to my therapist that sometimes I masturbate fantasizing about various people in my life and one of them being her.. I'm so embarrassed and I regret it so much.. 

She is now afraid of any contact with me and although I know how to separate fantasies and reality.. things will never be the same. She used to give me hugs, so that very likely won't happen again. She also told me because of my talk, she couldn't sleep and that she was starting to get panic attacks every time she got an email.. I already told her that I definitely wasn't in love or obsessed with her or anything, but I'm afraid things will always feel weird after that talk..

So I decided to just email her saying that I give up because now I also feel bad talking to her about anything. I also told her that she doesn't need to worry about me anymore.
She was the closest and only person I had. All that's left now is zero.

I can now say wholeheartedly that I wish I was dead.
I'm begging you people to give me some form of support or opinion on this matter.
I know I'm an idiot to people sometimes, but this time I'll try to be better.
