Is it worth living after not taking advantage of all the opportunities our parent worked so hard for?Hi, Iâ€™m 22 soon to be 23 in four days. My life has had many great opportunities that I took for granted, while I was a child I was brought to the U.S I was given the opportunity to learn a second language witch I did but I the years pass I and my hight school days came to and end I didnâ€™t graduate and that started a set of events.  I was given the opportunity to work and study  legally but since I didnâ€™t graduate high school that door eventually close and I was left without a job now I have to lie to my family and friend putting a front so that they donâ€™t figure out Iâ€™m a joke. Now I only have regrets of the life choices I made and my future goal that I once had just banish. I only blame myself

For anyone that read this THANK YOU
No need to comment I just needed to get this out of my chest before the day ended
