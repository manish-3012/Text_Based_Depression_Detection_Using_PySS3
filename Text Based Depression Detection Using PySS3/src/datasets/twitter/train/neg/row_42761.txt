Iâ€™m hated by my friendsI become best friends with someone and a few minutes later they end up hating me. I fucking hate my life. I wish someone I my age would give me a hug. Just a fucking hug. I wish someone my age would say that they liked me and thought I was a good person. I hate my life right now
