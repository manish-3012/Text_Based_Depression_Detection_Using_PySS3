Depressive and suicidal liar looking for advice I guessHello everybody,
I am making this post because I have no idea what I should do.
My situation is that I am depressed and suicidal and next to that also an almost perfect liar. 
When I was young I was bullied because I am fat and had no single friend till I was around 13/14 years old. At that moment is was in school and got into gaming. School was easy for me and never had to learn a single thing to get a good grade. I got lazy this way. When I finished middle school I had to choose a direction of work I wanted to study for. I made a poor choice and already quit the study after a month. At this period I also got problems with my body because I was and am way to heavy. I had some surgeries and everything looked fine from the outside. However, I was feeling down all the time, I never talked with my friends anymore because they were studying and doing other stuff then gaming. I got isolated. The next year of school I started with a other study and fell in love with it. However, there were some problems. First, I am not a technical genius. To be fair, I suck at it and this study has quite some technical shit in there. So naturally, the lazy me, thought it would all be fine and didnâ€™t study at all as always. However I failed al the theoretical parts about physics, chemistry and biology. Next to that, the isolated me, wasnâ€™t able to make friends because I was completely withdrawn. I didnâ€™t want to trouble my parents with this problem and started lying about how everything was going. I also moved out of my parents place for this study by the way. This way they couldnâ€™t see what was going on, and when I was home I lied about everything. After a few months into the study I made one friend and we hit it off. But the stupid me also lied to him about almost everything. He is a great guy but I feel bad about lying to him and to my parents. I still always feel down and nowadays also started thinking about suicide a lot. I am afraid to confront my family and my friend about my lies. This is because almost everything is a lie. I wonâ€™t be the guy who they think I am and this scares the shit out of me. Next to that I am now in my second year and now I am forced of the study because I failed the tests about physics etc. So now I feel like a total dipshit, that is completely useless, a huge liar and that the persons around me would be better off without me.
I started talking to shrink but even to him I lie about a lot of stuff and it doesnâ€™t help me at all because of it. 
I just wanted someone to hear my whole story, and maybe even give me advise. I donâ€™t see a bright future for myself, and thus with other reasons ass well think I am going to commit suicide someday. I havenâ€™t done it because I donâ€™t want my family and only friend I have to go through the emotional pain.
Thank you for reading this in advance.
Sorry for my poor Engelish, it is not my native language.
