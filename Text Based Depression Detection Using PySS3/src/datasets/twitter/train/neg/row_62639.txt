I need help, fast.Let's get all of this out of the way.


I've thought about suicide weekly for about 10 months now.


I've attempted twice, never went through. I even went through getting the noose set up on the last one. I just fell asleep. I probably wouldn't be here if I hadn't chosen a late time.


No one but my doctor knows I've had the thoughts or tried. 


So the main question I bet a lot of you are asking is why. The main reason, I feel that every little thing that goes wrong is my fault. My head will come up with some crazy reason as to why it didn't go well.


Parents are fighting? You caused it because you caused stress on them when you failed Algebra. 


Someone dies? You made that happen because you weren't with them enough.


Those are just two examples of my hideous self blame. And I've grown sick and tired of sucking so bad. I'm tired of trying my hardest but not living up to expectations. I'm tired of my existence.


This is why I've decided that I'm going to kill myself before this year ends. I'm tired of being a dead weight. People don't need me anymore. I've messed up enough already.


If there's anything anyone can tell me that can make me change my mind, be my guest. I doubt it though.
