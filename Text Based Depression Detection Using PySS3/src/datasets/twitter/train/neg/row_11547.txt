I missed my shot at life and I hate it more than anything.I have come the conclusion that I peaked in high school, I was fucking smart and got great grades. Then I got to college and decided to skip multiple times to get high with my friends instead. I thought my life would have been fine once I met my now wife (ex?) We got along great yadada she cheats on me I forgive her (x3). Now I'm here friendless exactly where I was 5 years ago but with no twenties to blow and I have to figure out how to divorce but all I want is for there to be no pain, I just want to wake up in my 18 year old body and not fuck the next ten years up. How do you even make friends as an adult besides work? I gave up everything for her and she just shat on me like I was scum. I gave her my heart and my twenties and got nothing. I'm so fucking sad and ready to just end it all. I hate that I don't have a gun.
