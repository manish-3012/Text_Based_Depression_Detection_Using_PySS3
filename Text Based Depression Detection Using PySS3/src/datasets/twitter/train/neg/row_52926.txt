Story time :&lt;So, Iâ€™m getting stressed out. You see, Iâ€™m 12 yrs old right now and tomorrow is my last year of summer camp. Last year was horrible because fights just broke out. And with all the shit (and I mean shitty shit) that happened when I was younger, I feel like shit.

Part 1: The Drunken shit show

So, it was I think a Sunday when my dad went crazy and long story short, Iâ€™m hiding in my room. My mom got punched (once) and my dad just sat down. A little backstory on him, he was in an abusive relationship with his parents so that day was like his reality check. Iâ€™m not justifying his actions either because it made me feel bad. Anyways, life was going good until I think April 2016.

Part 2: Death :(

So, my mom was in a relationship with a dude that I might as well call my dad. Well he filled the empty hole from part 1 and made me feel happy. But then on April 2016, he had a heart attack and hit his head hard, causing his brain to swell. We took him off life support like a week later.

Part 3: A new school

My new school was good, nothing really special besides some very influential teachers I had. They made me happy while learning and because of them I excel in school. But the kids were so mean. This would carry on into middle school.

Part 4: Corona

All I have to say is fuck this.

Part 5: Shit fests and the Dickheads

If you donâ€™t know, the shit fests are the riots and the Dickheads are the cops beating people for no reason. This is what makes me (a white man) fear for my life. I quiver with the blacks. This helps me understand what black people feel and makes me want to make a difference. But this stress is pulling me down. 

End: 

Thanks for listening to my life story, it means a lot to me.
