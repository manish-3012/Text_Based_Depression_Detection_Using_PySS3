Therapist said, "Peace Out"I had a suicide scare. After the crisis was over, my therapist of 6 years said he wouldn't work with me anymore. By email. After several days of not responding to me.

Guess things got too real for him.

I am actually pretty devastated. It came out of nowhere. I think I am screwed.
