Iâ€™m ending it June 1stI am ending it June 1st. I think itâ€™s the perfect day to end it. I have always loved the summer and plan on going on a hike and overdosing. My family doesnâ€™t give a shit about me and I love them so much. They have a big family and I am the one who they didnâ€™t care about. Everyone lives at home and I got kicked out last year. I wanted to push it until August 17th but I donâ€™t think I can make it. I keep trying to talk about my future and make plans but thereâ€™s no point. I will eventually do it. On top of years of abuse it just is too much.
