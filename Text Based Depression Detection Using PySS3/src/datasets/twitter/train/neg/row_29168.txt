I thought my life would get better leaving the homeless shelter. Nope.I left an abusive relationship and became homeless. After a year I found a place. This is just as bad as before. He makes me feel like shit. He belittles me constantly. Does one thing to me but will then complain that I did it. 


I dont know what the fuck to do. I cant leave here... I don't know anymore. 

I cant talk to my friends about this because they hear me whine too much and they wont really care. Even then the one guy who I talk to all the time is going through his own issues right now and I can't put it on him but I am fucking falling apart...

I dont want to be alive anymore. Im just done trying.
