Thinking about killing myselfI donâ€™t know if this is the right place to post this, but I think I really will end my life if I donâ€™t say something...

Iâ€™m 30m married with two beautiful girls. However, the relationship between my wife and I has been strained for a while.

Iâ€™m living in her country, living with a language I donâ€™t know well, and living so far away from my own family.

Lately I just feel like there isnâ€™t a reason for me to live on, except for my daughters. But, Iâ€™m scared one day (and soon) that reason wonâ€™t be enough to hold me back taking my own life away.

Iâ€™m sitting outside right now in the dark, just donâ€™t know what to do with my life anymore.
