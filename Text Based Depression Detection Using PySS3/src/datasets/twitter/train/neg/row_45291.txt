My life is the same cycle over and over againI feel better for a bit, get my meds in order, and have a tiny bit of optimism that things might get better. Then I make a stupid decision or I use sex or drugs or alcohol to feel happy. And use people to get the slightest bit of validation. 

And then they leave. All of them. No one gives a fuck about me and I want to die and make this cycle end. I am alone.
