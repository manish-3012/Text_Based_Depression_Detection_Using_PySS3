He won't console meHe said, during the last fight, that he will never react to my tears or my pain anymore unless I specifically tell him "I am sad, could you please comfort me?" 

I used the template today- I tried extra hard to make my voice weepy and little-girly, which he likes- and he yelled at me, called me out for "demanding comfort", told me he doesn't feel like he should console me when I'm such a shitty person, all that crap. I feel betrayed. Why did he bait me like that? 

I can feel myself going numb. The knife accident is two days in the past. He watched as I punched myself in the head with the blade. He did nothing. His voice was calm, steady and arrogant when he told me I should be ashamed of myself. 

Then why won't you let me die? Why do you abuse me until I can't take it anymore and then call me weak for wanting to end it? I want to die. It's not "attention-seeking". I genuinely want to die. You are a cruel bastard for keeping me alive to play with.
