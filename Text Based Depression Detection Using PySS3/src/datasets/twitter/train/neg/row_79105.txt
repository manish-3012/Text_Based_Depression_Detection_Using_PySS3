My friend is suicidal. Desperately need adviceMy best friend is an online friend from a different country. Never met him in person, but I have almost no IRL friends and I feel much closer to him than any of my IRL friends. Anyways, he has been going through a lot of problems and he is suicidal. I don't know what to do. I tried everything--offering emotional support whenever he calls me to talk about his problems, giving him money to help him out with his financial problems, reaching out to him everyday to ask him if he is ok. Any advice? I'm worried that one day, I'll just stop receiving messages from him...
