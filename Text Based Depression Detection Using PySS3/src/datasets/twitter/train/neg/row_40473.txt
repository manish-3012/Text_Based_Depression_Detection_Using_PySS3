Goodbye foreverOne thing I thought joining this site will help me. I thought people will give me good advice to get me back on track. Instead people try to exploit me by giving me false sense of hoping by promising giving me money â€” which I never askâ€” only for it to be a scam or to give lousy advice. I asked the universe to give me a sign and it showed me tonight that Iâ€™m better off dead. I have 31 miles worth of gas on my car. Iâ€™m about to do some good with it. Iâ€™m going to speed as fast as I can over the railroads in my city and hopefully my life is gone tonight. Goodbye. This is hell. Humans are the real demons.
