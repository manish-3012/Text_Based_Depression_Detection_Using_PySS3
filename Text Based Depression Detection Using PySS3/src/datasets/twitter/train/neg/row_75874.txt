I accidentally added fuel to a rumor about myself by admitting it is somewhat true. I don't want to be here anymore.I was trying to apologize for what I did when I admitted to doing something really gross in class one day. I don't want to talk about what I did, if you don't mind..

The stress is too much. My therapist is shitty and my mom is judgy, so I have no one to talk to.
