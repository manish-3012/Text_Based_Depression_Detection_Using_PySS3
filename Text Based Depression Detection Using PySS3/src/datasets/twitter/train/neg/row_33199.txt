I am trying to find a reason to keep me goingBut everything is failing to give me any hope that this will get better.

I quit my job (again) I have a job starting on the 18th but I still need an income from now till then.

Yes, I've tried therapy, yes I've tried meds, yes I've tried drugs, and home remedies too. Yes my dr knows he sees me on a regular basis. 

I'm at a loss. I just can't find anything that motivates me to try something new. Mostly because I can't think of anything new to try. 

I've either tried it or it doesn't make sense, or not backed by science. If anyone has something completely out of the box to try I'm happy to hear it, and give it a shot.  At this point I would try a lobotomy if they offered it anymore.

Nothing in life interests me anymore. None of my hobbies, or even my pets! Not even the love of my life anymore. I'm just tired and done.
