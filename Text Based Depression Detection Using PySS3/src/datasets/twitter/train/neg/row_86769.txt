It came floodingMy life was never meant to be like this. I based all of my hopes on having a family. Now because of infidelity and an arrest for drugs my life has crashed because my wife wanted a divorce 2 years later.

Itâ€™s been two years since the divorce. Iâ€™ve settled into misery and let my addiction continue to control me. I canâ€™t keep a steady job so no health insurance even though my meds and therapy are essential.

Tonight, itâ€™s all come back to me. Our wedding, our honeymoon, the birth of our children. Holy shit itâ€™s so painful to see what I fucked up and then threw away. I had a job, a wife, a family. Now I have none. Instead, Iâ€™ve had to move back into my abusive parentsâ€™ house. Maybe I can get a job despite my shitty work history and background check, but Iâ€™ll never have the most important part again. My God, Iâ€™d been with my wife for half of my life at the time of her proposing divorce. I was a stay-at-home dad for 4 years. I miss my ex-wife so bad. I miss seeing my girls every day instead of occasional weekends.

I repeat that I never meant for my life to be like this. The future looks so blank and empty, especially as tears stream down my face and Juice WRLD whispers in my ear. I ruined everything I had ever been looking forward to. There is no way for my life to ever be clear and complete. Iâ€™ve only continued living because I donâ€™t want to hurt my daughters, but as they become more and more mature, I wonâ€™t be able to hide who I really am from them. Theyâ€™ll know Iâ€™m a piece of shit junkie who fucked everything up: Beyond that, Iâ€™m not sure how much longer I can keep living this miserable, pointless, and lonely life. They call suicide selfish but what if itâ€™s the only way to end the suffering. Flip it around too: isnâ€™t it selfish to demand I stay alive just because youâ€™d be sad if I was dead?

Fuck this life.
