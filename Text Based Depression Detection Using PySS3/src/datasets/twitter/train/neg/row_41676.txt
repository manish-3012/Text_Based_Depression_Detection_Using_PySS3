Currently researching guns to buyI've never bought a gun, never been a gun person, shot a gun maybe 3 times in my life, but I'm learning a lot and trying to avoid a botched attempt. Even reading medical papers and studies on self-inflicted gunshot wounds. What works what doesn't.

Lied to my therapist today when I said I'm not a danger to myself. I never lie to him.

I can't wait to be gone.
