TrappedI'm legitimately trapped. 

I can't commit suicide because of my family. I just fucking can't do that to them, I can't, and I fucking hate it. I just want to kill myself but I see my family's eyes when they find me dead, and it makes me cry even harder than what I was initially sobbing about. 

Everything's a mess and I'm so miserable. Things are so fucking hard and they're only going to get 10x harder and there's no escape.
