I don't know what to do.I posted here last night, saying that I was going to kill myself, but I chickened out. I'm such a fucking coward. I don't know what to do. I really don't want to live anymore. I don't have any friends, and the loneliness is killing me. I hate crying myself to sleep. I hate my narcissistic parents. I hate my life. I'm going to kill myself one way or another, sooner or later
