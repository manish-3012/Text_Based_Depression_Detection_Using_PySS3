I legally bought a gun to take my life when i chooseBought a 9mm handgun S&amp;W MP2  a couple years ago, as that ticket out of here when I feel its time to depart. Everyone from the outside looking at my life, wonders why Iâ€™m depressed or in emotional pain. I canâ€™t even give an answer myself. Sometimes I hurt and canâ€™t help but want to hurt myself. 
 
I tried talking to my best friend about how unhappy I was, how I feel such emotional pain (both mid 20s male) which he replied that thereâ€™s so many more people that have it worse then I do, so I shouldnâ€™t bitch about my good/comfortable life.

What he doesnâ€™t know is that mental health issues run in my family. My mom has bad depression and same with my older brother. It was once of the most hurtful things anyone said to me after honestly expressing myself in a vulnerable way. 

I know not everyone can handle others people problems. So Iâ€™m going to handle my own problem. I have been an underachiever my whole life. I might as well achieve at taking my life. 

That whole eternal resting sounds perfectâ¤ï¸

I know I have  problems like drug addiction, sex addiction amoung others, but it finally seems like the answer to everything has been siting in closet the whole time.

Time to begin a new journey in life. 

I â¤ï¸ everyone in this sub because for the first time I donâ€™t feel emotionally aloneâ¤ï¸
