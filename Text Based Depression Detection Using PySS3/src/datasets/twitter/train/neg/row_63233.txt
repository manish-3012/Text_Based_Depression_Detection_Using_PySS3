I wanted to talk to someone about my suicidal thoughts, but I have no one to speak toMy depression and suicidal thoughts have essentially made me completely isolated from people that used to consider me their friend. I would go weeks cutting people off due to me not wanting to talk to them because of the depression, and in doing so, I have essentially cut ties with a lot of great people. Today, I felt very suicidal and wanted to call and talk to someone, but realized that at this point I have absolutely no one to talk to, which just enhanced the idea that if I were to kill myself right now, I don't know how many people would notice or realize that I was gone.
