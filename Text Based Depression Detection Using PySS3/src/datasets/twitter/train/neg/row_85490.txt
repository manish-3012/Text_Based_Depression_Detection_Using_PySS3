In about 6 hours do my final exams startAnd I lay here sleepless, thinking about what happened the past time and how I am going to kill myself. Abut all the things that are dragging me down.

And I don't know if there is any use in going to the exam today, without sleep. And since I just had to put an end to everything that was good in my life and broke my own heart finally. I think it's the best to leave tonight. In under 4 hours.

It qad anyways only cruel to be here
