I'm tired of staying alive for othersI'm done living for other people. I'm too depressed to drag myself out of bed most days and the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't want to put my loved ones through the pain of losing me (not that I think I'm contributing anything good to their lives, but I do understand how devastating it would be for them). 
It's always "push through it" and "just get through this and it'll be better" but if all I'm doing in life is getting through one thing or another, what's the point? If I were less compassionate or had no friends/family I'd have been dead long ago. I can't keep putting myself through the motions and "getting through it" anymore. I'm tired of putting myself through all this miserable shit just to please others. I wish I didn't care so much and I wish I had the balls to actually do it. I just want it all to stop
