here goes 6, almost 7 years.I have been self harm clean for so long... but now I'm tempted and I know if I do it, I'm going to over do it. I can't tell my girlfriend, or any friends. I don't want to be here anymore. so here I am, staring down a knife and lighter, and I'm just... stuck. I want to be at the bottom of the ocean.
