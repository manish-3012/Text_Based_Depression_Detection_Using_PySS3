I dont know how to help my friend. Please help me.My friend has never had an really easy life. She never got along with her parents, I remember in elementary school she would always come to school with red eyes, presumably due to crying. Fast forward to when she turned 18, she had a huge fight with her parents that led to her getting kicked out of her home. She bounced around with friends before renting a place for a while. It was around this time that she starting hanging out with her girlfriend heavily, like to the point where she lived with her. All seemed to be fine until they broke up. My friend... she never 
really got over her and it has plagued her since. When everyone went off to college, she happened to end up living only a few rooms down from my friend. She saw her everyday. Saw her with new guys and girls, enjoying life without her and because we all have the same friend group, they saw each other all the time. This along withtrouble adjusting to the college life, led my friend 
over the tipping point. She has asked multiple people,
friends and acquaintances alike to end her life. The first time
this happened was last year, its now happened twice, with the last
time being 3 weeks ago. As a result, she has been also getting into harder drugs, mostly heroin. Now she isnt addicted per se but she has done it a handful of times and i dont know how long it takes to get addicted. Basically my question is how do I help my friend. I am way out of my depth, she is a very stubborn and untrusting person and its very hard to get her to like the idea of telling more people because she is worried that people with stop treating her like normal. I feel that if I betray her trust and tell people, she will close off for good and I won't be able to do anything to help.

Idk if thats too little information or too much, I am
just fucking terrified for my friend and I'm only a 
dumbass 20 year old. Please help.

TLDR: Read the whole thing, my friend's life is in danger.
