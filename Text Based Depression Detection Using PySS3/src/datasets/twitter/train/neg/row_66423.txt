I have a huge desire to attempt on my life since I'm 15. Now I'm 22I would say this feeling sucks, but I won't, because it doesn't. When I imagine me doing that, I feel kinda happy, like I'll finally stop experiencing those feelings that haunt my sanity every day.

I know I'm not doing that till I get a gun, maybe next year or so. That will be the best day of my entire life. And I'll be listening to some songs I like, while I dope myself before the act :)

I just wanted to get this off my chest.
