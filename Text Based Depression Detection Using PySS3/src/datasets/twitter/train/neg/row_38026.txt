Ive been suicidal for so long it's the only thing that gives me an identity anymore.Anyone else ever feel this way?


I try to find a personality that I can live with myself as but I've just been depressed and suicidal and a fuckin bummer since I was 13 and now that's the truth of who I am and I feel like I didn't have any control over it. 


It fucking sucks and I hate happy people who've found themselves and are comfortable with themselves. 


I don't hate them I feel so goddam happy for them I guess it just makes me hate myself more.


People just keep ghosting me and stopping contact and I don't even have enough self esteem to be mad because I know that I'm a shit person to be around. 


I've been trying to build a personality that attracts people, but I only become lonelier and lonelier and people keep moving themselves away. 


I guess I've formed into an inherently useless and shitty person, and I know this just sounds like depressed delusions but people leaving me isn't a delusion, and I'm my shitty personality isn't a delusion. 


Suicide is the only thing that makes me feel like me, and it makes me feel real. I feel like its almost my duty to kill myself now, because that's the role and identity that I apparently was fit to play out in the world. I'm a suicide. I'm one the humans who kills themselves.
