I want to give up.I just want to give up. I lay here in my bed and my mind wanders back on my life. I haven't done anything that I've wanted to do. I'm 33 years old. I don't have enough money to go to art school. I live in a broken family. My parents are bitter towards each other and they take their anger out on me. I've been very very single for the last 15 years. It hurts. I'm so damn lonely. 

I just want to give up.
