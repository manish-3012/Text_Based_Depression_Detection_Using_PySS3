Is it really living if you're doing it for the sake of othersI'm so tired of feeling emotionally blackmailed to stay alive.

The love of my life, my best friend, was crushed to death by a bus in August. The inquest found that he would've survived being hit by a bus but the driver pressed a 'down' ferry switch and crushed his skull. I am haunted by knowing he was screaming for help when he was crushed. I should've been there. This is the person I have spent most of my life with for 7 years. I'm so lost without him. Life since then has just been going through the motions, waiting to be able to bury him, waiting for the inquest. Now that's over I'm facing Christmas alone, trying to keep myself busy with volunteering but I think about dying every single day.

I feel like I'm only still here because I don't want to hurt my family even more. But fuck is that a reason to force myself through this life I don't want just to keep them 'happy'? I talk about my thoughts with family and friends and it's just brushed off as oh things will get better, we need you here. Well why is suicide such a bad thing in these circumstances? Even if I don't acutely 'kill myself' the binge drinking and not eating or sleeping is going to do it.

Why is there so much help available to prevent suicide but not to help with planning and sorting out financial matters so others don't have to deal with added shit when I'm not here?
