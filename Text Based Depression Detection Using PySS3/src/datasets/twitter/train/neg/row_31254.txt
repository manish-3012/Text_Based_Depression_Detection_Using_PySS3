Itâ€™s either losing or being tired everyday NSFW triggersA family member of mine who decides to become a nurse recently told me â€œitâ€™s all in my head, stop blaming our biological parentsâ€. I have Post Traumatic Stress, diagnosed by a doctor officially in the psych ward hospital. Fact I have been a patient yet a dumb nurse like her goes around judging not only me but other patients with mental health. 


I still want to kill myself because am sick of hearing this shit repeatedly everyday. 
I want to kill myself because sheâ€™s putting me in a spot to constantly feel low self esteem since she donâ€™t believe post traumatic stress are caused by childhood physical abuse.
