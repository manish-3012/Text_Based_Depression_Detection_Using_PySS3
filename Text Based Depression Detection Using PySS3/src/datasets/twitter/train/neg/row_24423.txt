Suicide is always therelike a thunderstorm rumbling in the background, a presence I can always feel hovering.

It's the only thing that's always there, even after everyone and everything else I want to count on has gone.

The storm is coming for me, and I have no hope left to stop it.

I only wish that somehow I could reach out for actual help, or tell the people who really know me why I am going to kill myself. But I am a coward and I know that, so I will never be able to do those things. Maybe someone who knows me will somehow see this after I'm gone. If that happens, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I'm not strong enough to weather this storm. I can't take it, and that's not your fault, it's only mine. It has overcome me.
