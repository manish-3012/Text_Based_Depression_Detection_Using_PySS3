I have that sick feeling in my stomach againIt always happens when Iâ€™m extremely overwhelmed and feel like Iâ€™m drowning in my anxieties. Itâ€™s that feeling that makes me want to relapse or just completely go through with killing myself. Every day I get closer and closer to not allowing myself to get back up after practice-hanging myself.
