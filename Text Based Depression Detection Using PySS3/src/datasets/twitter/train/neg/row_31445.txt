Anyone else just wish they were dead rnThe only reason I donâ€™t do it is because of my parents and because of religious beliefs. It feels like everyone in my life at some point finds out Iâ€™m more of a hindrance than a benefit, and Iâ€™m left alone again by people who promised they wouldnâ€™t and my heart fell for it. I donâ€™t have family outside my parents really. Iâ€™m scared once theyâ€™re gone that something will set me off and Iâ€™ll do it. And Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll always be alone because people are afraid of me/my emotional instability. Iâ€™m afraid all my friends are only my friends bc theyâ€™re afraid of what Iâ€™ll do if they arenâ€™t around. Im scared Iâ€™ll never be able to have a partner or a family. I donâ€™t want to be alone. If the problem is within me, then everyone has one less giant problem without me
