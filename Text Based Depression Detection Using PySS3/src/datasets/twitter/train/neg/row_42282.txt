I donâ€™t know how it got this badIâ€™ve been depressed ever since I was a child. I remember spending all my time thinking about how we got here, what happens after we die and if there is any meaning to life. I was a really really smart kid and had a lot of potential, but it was ruined by my psychotic Muslim family who forcibly married me off to a ugly fat abusive man when I was still in high school. Ever since then Iâ€™ve been severely depressed, but this past year Iâ€™ve started to feel like Iâ€™m just floating through life waiting to die. Iâ€™m only 23. My best years are behind me and I wasted them being locked up inside the house. I had a goal to work towards, graduating from college, and now that I have it feels like there is still nothing to look forward to except death.
