Can I help? Or can I give up?I'm a 21 year old girl dealing with depression, anxiety, insomnia and Ed's. I live with my family who refuses to acknowledge all of it and thinks I'm seeking attention. 
I've spent most of my past month solving other people's problems and getting them to put down the knives and not attempt suicide. I feel like such a fraud because I'm barly hanging on to life and my wrist is always cut under my watch. 
What do I do?
