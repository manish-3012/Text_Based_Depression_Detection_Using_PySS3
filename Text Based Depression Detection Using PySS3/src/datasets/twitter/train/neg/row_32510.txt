before suicideI read a lot of suicide note on reddit recently and I'm not sure what happened to them. I've also been thinking about suicide ever since high school. I'm 25 now, I fail college and got a dead end job as a cashier 2 hours drive from home. My father talks a lot of shit to my relatives and friends about me. Isn't a father suppose to raise his son and make him great? Please dont down talk your children. What goes in the brain never leaves the brain. I been feeling like shit since I was 18. I been holding it in but I hate showing my face in public because I know what my father tells everyone everything about me, how unfilial I am. Because of my father my oldest brother ran away from home and lives on his own and cut ties with everyone. My 2nd brother is married and lives on his own and dont talk to us anymore. I' haven't been able to since I love my family so so much but i hate myself for that also. I started smoking cig at 21 now it dont help. Smoked marijuana but the pain dont go anymore. I'm waiting for my tax return and giving it all to my younger brother. Then I'm going to kill myself. My family ignores and give me a disgusted face when I talk about my problems except my young brother. But I love them so fucking much that's why I chose to stay all these years. I tell my younger brother never to suicide because you will go to hell. Im sick of my life now. I guess what they say "Everyone loves you, but no one cares until you're dead" is true. I hope to give all my belonging to my younger brother before I die. Love you all and goodbye, dont give up, life will get better, I just choose the miserable way out. I believe in 'You reborn from the gene you pass on to your kids' so dont choose my path ever. I'll die now so I dont pass my gene to anyone, I dont want to be reincarnated. Goodbye world.
