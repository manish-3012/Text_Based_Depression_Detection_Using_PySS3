It's impressive how survival instincts completely disappear when you're suicidalA suicide attempt should make your survival instincts fire up, like when someone is about to jump off a bridge but their instincts give them vertigo and they back away.

It's quite scary when you go for your first attempt and at no point in the action you feel fear. You don't fear death, you want it. Your mind and body have internalised what's about to happen, and they don't fight against it.

Nothing stops you from taking your life, not even your primitive animal instincts, as they're not even there anymore. It's quite terrifying.
