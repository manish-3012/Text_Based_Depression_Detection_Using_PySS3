My life isnâ€™t worth fixingIn the past 48 hours my entire life has collapsed. My best friend hates me, school is ruined, I had a bad trip on acid and realized Iâ€™m a truly shitty person, my meds are off balance because of insurance problems and I canâ€™t afford the price to get the right medicine, and I can barely get out of bed. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth it to fix all of it, itâ€™s too much and itâ€™ll take too long. All Iâ€™ve been doing for the past 36 hours is taking sleeping pills whenever I wake up so I can go back to sleep and not think about all of this.
