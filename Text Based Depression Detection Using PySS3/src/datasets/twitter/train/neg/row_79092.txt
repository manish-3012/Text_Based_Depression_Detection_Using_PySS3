Iâ€™ve been having suicidal for a long time and I think I want to finally die before I turn 25 next month.I am just tired and this world genuinely makes me feel sick. I feel like Iâ€™m watching everyone around me become drugged up and as perverted as possible. I see my dad watching teen porn everyday and my ex boyfriend who is 24 cheated on me with a 17 year old, I see my friends selling their bodies for money while I did everything to protect mine from men who wanted to hurt me when I was younger. I have been physically abused by my brother and a man tried to sexually abuse me when I was 15. Nothing feels like itâ€™s getting better, I have no safe space and feel full of crippling anxiety even being here on Reddit makes me feel disgusting at some of the things I read. I canâ€™t watch my younger sisters and my nieces grow up in this world knowing what will happen to them. I canâ€™t be here anymore, I want to die remembering when I felt safe and ignorant as child and didnâ€™t know about all the twisted and sick shit that I see daily in my adult life. Iâ€™m not expecting replies I just wanted to vent.
