I hate doing this.I feel so silly asking for help. I hate doing this so much seriously. I tried to get back on my meds when I got out of the army and my VA psychiatrist told me to tough it out. I did it to myself I shouldnâ€™t have done drugs but everything hurt to much to not to. A year later I tried to kill myself finally after not being able to hold my head together through the depression and constant stare or alert. I hate being like this. I finally got back on the meds that helped me when I was in, but no I just feel so fucking cloudy. Iâ€™m supposed to be helping people but I can barely remember what I was thinking about a minute ago. I guess I just need someone to talk to right now, because nothing seems like a better option that the knife at this moment. Iâ€™m sorry for putting this on anyone, but I really just canâ€™t keep this on me tonight.
