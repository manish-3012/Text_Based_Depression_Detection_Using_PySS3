Depression comes in waves. I don't know how to continue with life.I go through these waves of being ok and then severe depression. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up again. I don't really see a point to life. I do well at work, but who fucking cares. I have no value as a person. No one cares if I'm here. No one cares about me.
