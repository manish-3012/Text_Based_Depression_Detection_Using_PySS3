I attempted suicide at 16. Nothing has seemed normal since.I attempted suicide after losing all my friends after I was falsely accused of sexual assault. Ever since then, things have gotten strange. My mental health suffered greatly. Trump got elected. I embraced 4chan. I did a lot of shit iâ€™m not proud of. Since then I have improved by a longshot, but things still havenâ€™t been the same. Iâ€™m still going to two different therapists. Iâ€™m still ranting about shit I donâ€™t even believe 100%. And now that I donâ€™t have a single friend out there, life seems like a fucking joke now. Sometimes I see something that is so awful that I donâ€™t even know if itâ€™s really happening or not. Sometimes I feel like a part of me died that day. Now that I am being brigaded by a bunch of incels, I wonder if it was my sanity that died. That would explain so much.
