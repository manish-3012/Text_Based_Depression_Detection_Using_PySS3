Close but never enoughLol, everything Iâ€™ve ever tried to do has fallen apart, no matter how hard I have tried.  Iâ€™ve done a lot from change bins at McDonaldâ€™s to drive a Lamborghini . I always wanted a purpose a career that stupid mediocre life but Iâ€™m so â€œdifferentâ€ I just wanted to be an average office worker man guy, studied accounting on and off never able to actually secure a job at all. 
 
My personality and interests have always been obscure and I usually get really in depth and nerd out about things like cars, watches, fashion, video games, technology, trivia etc. My in depth knowledge on subjects I am drawn to tend to push people away. I can even pinpoint the exact moments where they feel intimidated.

Iâ€™ve suffered from low self esteem due to acne for a majority of my life, and being â€œdifferentâ€. Somehow recently my face became â€œattractiveâ€ I developed High cheekbones and a sharp square jaw. Ironically I became so â€œbeautifulâ€ that I am constantly mistaken for homosexual (lol). My voice is very deep and I usually speak eloquently, Iâ€™ve learnt to dumb things down and be more casual, like right now, in order to fit in. But this is all contradicted by my youthful appearance, nobody takes me seriously or even takes the time to listen when I speak, so I only do so out of necessity.
 
Iâ€™ve recently had some fun, gone to various  I countries with my family, and enjoyed 5star accommodation etc. At the expense of my parents obviously. However I hide my heavy personal financial debt from everybody, I had such pride in my credit card collection and credit score, but have recently put myself in an irreversible situation due to destructive spending, (thanks depression). But I did have a lot of fun so Iâ€™m not â€œangryâ€. 

I currently I work in a run down petrol station and have given up on my dream mediocrity. Itâ€™s 6am now, my night shift is finished. Iâ€™m pretty tired, in fact, Iâ€™m very tired.
