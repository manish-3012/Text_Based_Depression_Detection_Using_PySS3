Im so tiredIm just so tired of everything, i tried being positive and just overall being nicer to people. I tried doing things the best i can and not fuck it up like i always do. I hope my sheer effort got through to some people and the fact that i still fail doesn't help me with feeling better about myself. Can I just off myself and give up? Will people miss me when im gone later on or will they actually be glad? All i know is i don't want to make my best friend sad that im gone. Recently i haven't been telling anyone really how i feel and just try to put up a front that im ok, everything is great and im happy but im really not. I just wanna end everything and hope that im remembered for the good i do(if there was any) and the person i try to become. Not remembered as a failure and useless human being my entire life.
