land minesSix years is a really long time. Iâ€™m only 20 and I donâ€™t see much of a happy future for myself. I donâ€™t know what started it all: the years of trauma from parents, bullying as a kid, lack of self worth, lack of motivation, loss. I canâ€™t point my finger at a cause. My life has been in a downward spiral these past couple months. My fractured family is about to break apart; i donâ€™t see myself getting into the Veterinary school i want to go to; i lost who i believed is the love of my life; i lost my identity after years of grinding in school only to churn out average grades; i tried heroin for the first time; fuck i tried to hang myself only to fail and eventually end up in the hospital. Therapy wonâ€™t fix this, medicine hasnâ€™t, i thought love would, but that wonâ€™t either. Itâ€™s weird. iâ€™m a privileged, somewhat attractive easy going kid. I thought that finding something to believe in would help; like Buddhism or learning more about my ethnicity and myself. Shit doesnâ€™t help. My body is burned, scarred, cut and God i hate looking at myself. i regret it. Iâ€™m not sure what the point of writing this is; maybe itâ€™s to vent at the depths of the internet. idk. iâ€™m jaded and done. giving myself a couple more months. maybe iâ€™ll make it to 21 maybe i wonâ€™t. the only thing thatâ€™s keeping me here is the guilt. i donâ€™t want anyone to be hurt from my loss. 

be strong, donâ€™t be like me.
