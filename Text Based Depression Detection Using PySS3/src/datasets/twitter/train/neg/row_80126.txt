I haven't been okay for a long timeMy anxiety and depression has gotten so bad that I can't even push suicidal thought outta my mind anymore. I dont want to get out of bed. I dont want to eat or drink. I've got a bunch of pills i can take but idk if they'll kill me. Even if they fuck up my livers or something at least i wouldn't be here much longer. Yes i know it will hurt, but I deserve the pain for all the things I've done. And I know it'll break people's hearts when I'm gone but you want to know what I've realized? Everyone dies alone someday, and no ones coming to save us. I'm not entirely sure if theres Heaven, but I hope there is. I'm scared to die but I've become so numb I cant even be bothered to speak full sentences. I dont get mad or sad, happy or depressed. I'm just numb. I dont feel. Guess it's time for some liquid courage, but I doubt that anyone will see this post so i guess this is goodbye if it kills me today, or a few months down the road. I've forgiven everyone including myself. I've accepted Him as my Lord and Savior. It's my time. Thank you for the past yeah and a half on here, you helped me hold on this long. Goodbye.
