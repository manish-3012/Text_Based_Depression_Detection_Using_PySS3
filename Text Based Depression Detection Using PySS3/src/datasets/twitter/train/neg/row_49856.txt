Can anyone even relateI am at a crossroads in my life right now. I just had a major fight with my girlfriend of 4 years tonight. I showed her my previous post about my depression and my suicidal thoughts for reasons that do not matter at all.  It is Halloween and I have no idea why I am alive.  I cannot leave my room because my girlfriends friends are sleeping outside my room in my apartment, and I am writing down my feelings.  My girlfriend said that instead of writing down all the things that makes me sad, why not write about the things that make me happy?  I have no answer for that.  I can't think of one thing right now to write down.  Sure I love to snowboard, I love to make food; I love to watch movies. But nothing makes me HAPPY.  I have no idea what that term means anymore.  I told myself and have lived with the idea that I would never kill myself because my mother has spent so many years trying to make a great life for me.  But recently I have found that even the idea of staying alive so my mom can see me in a loving relationship with a great job will make her life worth it is not even worth it for me.  Why subject my girlfriend to the disappointment of being with someone like me and sacrifice her time to waste it on someone like me? I do love her.  I love her so much that I know she should with someone else who is not broken and who can treat her right without the breakdowns that I constantly have either in my head of physically like tonight.  Sorry for the wall of text but I have recently found this subreddit and.... Well.  There is no point in anything.  Who cares if I post to you guys.  The Internet is my diary and I have no one else to spill my thoughts to because I cannot be truthful to anyone because they will...  Well who cares what they will do.  I may end it soon and I have ever had such serious thoughts about this before.
