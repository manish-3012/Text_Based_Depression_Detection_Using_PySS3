Itâ€™s crazy how few people actually ask how youâ€™re doing especially when you show obvious symptomsI donâ€™t fault people for not reaching out. But I always see in movies and tv shows where someone at least notices a mental breakdown but in real life that doesnâ€™t happen.

Iâ€™m in grad school and I am so suicidal that I canâ€™t read for more than 5 minutes. I canâ€™t read something as simple as an email. I have trouble understanding people because my body always feels so distant. Most of the time I feel like I am looking and hearing people through a fish tank. I get so sad that I feel like I could vomit at any given moment. But none of my professors have just given a â€œhey, whatâ€™s going on.â€ I donâ€™t fault them. I am not their responsibility but I find it incredibly ironic how many ppl at this university are â€œmental health advocatesâ€ but wonâ€™t do much when mental illness is right in front of them. 

And yet I could kill myself tomorrow and everyone would be â€œshocked.â€ 

*They had no idea. Nevermind the sudden decline in work performance, the forgetfulness, and sudden inability to leave my apartment...my suicide would come as a surprise.*

I am very serious when I say that I am not putting anyone at fault. But everyday  climbing a constant uphill battle and Iâ€™m doing it all alone. I donâ€™t feel good at all and I know that I am not going to ever feel better. But no one even sees me. 

I know who will be at my funeral and its a shame that my death will seem sudden when reality I was slowly dying right in front of them.
