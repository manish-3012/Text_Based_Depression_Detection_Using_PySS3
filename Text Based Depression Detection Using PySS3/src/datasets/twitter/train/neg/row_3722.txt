GoodbyeI am a coward.

So. Basically. I am not loved. I am a failure at absolutely everything.

I don't wanna be "that guy" but I met this girl a few months back. She was the light of my life but I threw it away. It was on me. Before I met her I was having having a very bad depression. She helped me out of it, she was the one. But I burnt the bridges. We lost contact. I feel very bad for it. And I am sorry about that if she reads this. When I lost her that was the nail in the coffin. I have been sober a few days since that day we lost it. My family dont love me. I have a good workplace, but it doesnt matter I dont love it. I'm drunk now. It doesnt matter. Nothing matters to me anymore. I dont have a purpose.

I am sorry, mom.

Thank you reddit.
