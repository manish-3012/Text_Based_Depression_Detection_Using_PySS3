Nobody will ever carePeople only care insofar as you're providing them something.
My favorite teacher is only kind to me because I'm good in her class, not because she enjoys my personality.
My best friend only liked me because I had money, walked her home most days, and sat next to her in class. My personality ran her off.
I've never had a boyfriend because I have nothing to offer personality-wise and my looks aren't much to speak of, so he couldn't fuck me and enjoy it.
People have used me as a punching bag or a lapdog for years, and that's partially my fault because I have the perfect character for it; anxious, weak, quiet, spineless, and self hating.... unless you're actually kind to me;then I'm a spiteful rude moody cunt.

I can't remember ever being truly happy: I've squandered all 17 years of my life becoming more and more of a reclusive freak. I have nothing going for me. I'm a failure both socially and academically. I wish I had been strangled to death by my umbilical cord and my mom had adopted like she'd planned. I'm sure that kid would have been very happy for the opportunity I wasted.

I went to my school counselor once and told her I wanted to die. She called my parents even though so begged her not to and I was dragged by the dad in tears to the car after he'd yelled her down, where he then proceeded to scream at me as I cried and ground me. He then left me at home for my mother to come find.
She just told me I was "blue" and "everyone gets blue sometimes".
I refuse to be humiliated like that again.

Nobody cares and nobody ever will. I'll never be happy. I think the only real regret I'd have would be dying a virgin, though lately that doesn't even matter to me any more. My sex-related quirks are repulsive and I doubt anybody would maintain any sympathy for me if they knew about  them.

I just hope this doesn't kill my grandparents, because I love them very much.
