Afraid it's creeping backAt least the past two weeks I've pretty much tried distracting myself from my lack and unsuccessful socializing offline. 

It's probably the recent unfortunate events that happened yesterday. I received my midterm and pretty much was on the lower scale of the curve when I though I did well (30% of my final grade), my group's PowerPoint is due today but none of my teammates were replying back their parts so I had to do two people's workload, and trying to focus studying for my midterm later on today.

My emotions have been sway in and apparently wants to have an existential panic at 2am. Heck, I was super anxious buying something online for 12 dollars. But to the point, I had suicide thoughts last semester (it was at the worst point for me since I had a place and how to kill myself), and I'm afraid it's starting to creep back.

I'm doing an exchange in a different state for school. Basically I feel like I'm wasting money continuing to stay indoors more than I should be (basically I'm allowing myself to shut away from society). I pretty much was this before my exchange. 

I feel terrible, my socializing skills suck. I feel like I don't have anyone close, or else want to talk to me as much as I start the conversations. I try having fun with myself in public and by myself and I feel like a loner. People that I could hang out with prefer to stay home. I suck talking to people, that I don't think I'll be successful in my future career. I'm even a loner at family events. After college, I feel like I'm not going to be with anyone really. I'm not going to amount in anything.

Basically, I feel like after college and essentially disconnecting myself from everyone, I could just kill myself. A long term plan for sucide, wonderful.
