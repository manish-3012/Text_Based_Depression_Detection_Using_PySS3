Please just talk to meI just need someone to talk to. Everything is getting progressively worse in my life. I don't know why I lack motivation to pursue anything. I have no aspirations or goals. I drove away the love of my life because she felt our relationship was going nowhere. I just want something to care about. I don't even know if this is what I want, to talk to someone, I just feel so empty all of the time and I have no idea how to be a normal fucking person.
