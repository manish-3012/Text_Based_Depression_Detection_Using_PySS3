The fact that we're all here tells me I'm about to make the worst decision of my life.It's not a matter of being right, wrong or even remotely justified.
It's not a matter of whether or not I'll go through with it. 
Just the fact that so many of us are here tells me I'm not the only one but I still feel so alone. Just a few weeks ago I convinced a friend not to kill himself. And yet here I am trying to convince myself.     

I would ask my family for help but they'd roll their eyes thinking, "This shit again." And they're right. It's the same shit all over again.
