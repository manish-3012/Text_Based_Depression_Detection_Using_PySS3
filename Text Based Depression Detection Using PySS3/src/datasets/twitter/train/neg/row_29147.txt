Itâ€™s a weird thing to say or think I feel...I feel like it is a weird thing to say, but I often actually depict clear midgets of suicide inside of my mind. As in some fictional character in my mind actually does the deed and the aftermath of it or what actions happened to that specific point. I imagine it over and over again when I feel really bad.
And interestingly to imagine that actually helps me in real life to not do any of self farm or more. 
But the fact, that suicide is kind of neglected in the public and especially suicide methods, makes me feel a little bit maybe insane or sick. It just feels wrong. Iâ€™m so confused.
