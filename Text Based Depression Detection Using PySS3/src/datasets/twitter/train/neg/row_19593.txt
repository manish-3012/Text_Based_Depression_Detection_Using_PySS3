WhyAll ive ever wanted is for my friends to be happy. I try everything and i do as much as i can. I just want others to be happy. To not have to go through what i do.

I feel like a selfish bitch. The smallest things set me off and i am really only here because of drugs and my family and friends. I just dont want them to feel bad. Its only a matter of time until something sets me off enough to make me end it. No matter what i do it always comes back. Something shitty always happens and i go back down. Why is it so hard to just be happy. To just care about things that are actually important. Instead i just make things worse over and over. 

Its not about what happens, its just anything. Anything that makes me sad, just makes me go back to being depressed. I dont want to end it. But i have no reason to be here.
