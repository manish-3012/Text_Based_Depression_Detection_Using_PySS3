Still holding on by a thread.Valentine's is the 2 year anniversary of being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. I was a full-time college student and I went blind in one eye and poor in the other over the course of a week and I started puking and collapsing from the pain. They did several MRIs and a spinal tap (FUCK) to confirm their suspicions. 

I was on a heavy dose of drugs for several days and they released. I'll just say that I had another traumatic incident that Saturday and I didn't trust my godfather anymore. 

I started getting MS back in '09 when I did a pretty heavy overdose on meds and was in a coma for 3 weeks. While living, I woke up paralyzed below the neck (not for too much longer, I still had muscle memory), but I had lost my photographic memory. 

I'll cut the story short and say that I've struggled with PTSD most of my life with other illnesses, along with getting somatoform disorder last year from "pseudo-seizures" (via anxiety). My MS has kepte from working and going out or socializing much. I can't even draw without triggering an episode. 

Two hours ago I got a knife and shredded the shit out of an arm and hand (shallowish, stopped bleeding, no stitches needed). I haven't cut like this since 6th grade. :/

I don't feel like I can go to anyone for help. My counselor and his agency don't deal with trauma. My best friend of Å™ years betrayed me this week. My family are the reason I have PTSD. I guess just hotlines and forums are the best outlet? :/ 

By going here I still have a slimmer of hope that maybe, maybe, things will somehow be worth it. Everyone calls me "Sparkles" for a reason. :/ *sarcastic jazz hands* *crackles*
