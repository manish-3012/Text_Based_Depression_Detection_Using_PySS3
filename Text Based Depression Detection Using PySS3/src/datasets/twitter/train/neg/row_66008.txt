Idk how to explain anything to my art/religion teacherI feel really depressed and not sure if i can hold together my sanity and feelings. Basically I'll ask the teacher if i can use the bathroom and I'll go cry there. I really seem like ive been crying or like I'm depressed this whole week and i don't really want to tell any adult about my problems. But if i can't dodge the question, does anyone have advice to help me explain my urge to die? Also I've been going to the bathroom almost every lesson she teaches, in general every other lesson i do this and the teachers are getting suspicious of why i do That
