Is this subreddit supposed to make you want to die more?Subreddits dedicated to telling me that I am a disgusting person have hundreds of thousands of more users than this subreddit. Comments telling me to kill myself with gold and over 400 upvotes surpass the amount of support that exists in a hundred of SW threads. This place even gets constant trolls telling people to kill themselves. 

Is this place just supposed to be a reminder of how little people care about helping others vs the number of people who exist solely to put people like me down?

"You shouldn't listen to what people on the internet say" is a self-refuting statement.
