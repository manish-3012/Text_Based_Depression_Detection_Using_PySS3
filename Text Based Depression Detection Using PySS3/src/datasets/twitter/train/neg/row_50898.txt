I constantly feel empty.I donâ€™t know how else to explain it. I often ask myself, â€œwhy get out of bed?â€ â€œWhy eat?â€ â€œWhy exist?â€ Iâ€™ve gotten the â€˜existâ€™ part stuck on loop, and itâ€™s hard to shake whatâ€™s going on with me.

Iâ€™ve been recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder. I find it hard to get up and do something, other than use the bathroom or get water. I canâ€™t mentally will myself to feel anything, let alone do anything.

I think to myself, â€œYou donâ€™t deserve to feel.â€
â€œWhy are you still here?â€
â€œYouâ€™re not doing anything else, you might as well just die.â€

â€œEveryone would be better off, if you were gone.â€

Every day and night, I constantly think, â€œI should have done something different.â€ Iâ€™m so lost and sad all the time. Years of bullying may or may not play a part in this, but honestly I have nothing to lose.

I hate everyone and (I feel like) everyone hates me.
