"Earn the privilege of life" Shut the fuck up.Yea, I really think life is such a fucking privilege, working, shitting, pissing, sleeping, wishing I was another animal or dead or in a coma or maybe a functional human being who was able to have experiences, motivation, didn't question the world and just did what is told. Why the hell is working 'earning the privilege of life?' I'm alive anyway, and its not even enough for anybody. I know I sound like a lazy piece of shit but im so sleep deprived and just angry I dont even care. I just get so mad when people say I gotta earn this life and its like... the system is fucked anyway, and my anxiety is so bad that I can't even just go outside and admire the birds I hear so what is the fucking point of this at all
