I might kill my self on SaturdayI hate myself and I feel so miserable and lonely. Sometimes I regret having happy moments because when the bad times come, it just hits so hard. 

I might take a Lyft and jump off a bridge. 

I am so selfish I want to care about myself instead of others, just once and this will be the only time. 

I'm not sure if I'll do it but my god, right now I hope my future self could. 

Edit: I just took 400mg of Prozac. Idk what to expect but I feel woozy
