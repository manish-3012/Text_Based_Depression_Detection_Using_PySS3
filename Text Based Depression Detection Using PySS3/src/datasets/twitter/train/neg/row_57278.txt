What even is the point of being here anymore?Lived a shitty life. Never had true friends, I'm not good at math so I failed my way through college and didn't get my degree, so now I'm out of my family and broke as shit trying to pay back my loans that were wasted. No one will ever love me, I spend 95% of my combined paychecks from 2 jobs on bills. I sleep maybe 16 hours a week if I'm lucky. It just is wearing me down. I just don't really see a point to continuing on in life.
