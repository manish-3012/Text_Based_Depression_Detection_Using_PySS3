So...My last post was 2 months ago, unsure of the exact date, I just know it was around 2 months.

And...



This is my last. I'm going to be unsubbing from here. Maybe I'll resub at a later date, once I'm definitely 100%, and I'll come back to help people, the same way people in this sub helped me. Not much has changed, but I generally feel better. I'm not sure why, but something has changed and I don't know what, but something has. And I feel slightly better. For now, I actually feel okay. I know I'm not out of the woods yet, but I'm getting there. I know there's plenty more obstacles, but I am actually looking forward to encountering them. I'm starting to relish the challenge. 

Like I said, I have no idea what has changed. I still go to work at 4:30am, come home and sit in my room, watching TV or on my phone. 

All I want to say is thank you to everyone who helped, or even tried to help. I am a difficult person to help, I know that. I've always thought I should do everything alone, that a real man never asks for help. But I was wrong. It doesn't matter if you're 14 or 40. It doesn't matter if you're Male, female, trans, or you have no idea what you are. It doesn't matter if you are hard on the exterior, or soft. We all need help sometimes. We can't do everything by ourselves. And that's okay. 

For now, I'm leaving this sub. And thank you again, to everyone who helped or at least tried. I appreciate it.


TLDR: I'm feeling better, leaving this sub for now
