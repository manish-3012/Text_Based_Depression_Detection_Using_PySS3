I'm doneI've been depressed for the last 3 and a half years of my life. I'm a 24 year old college graduate, can't find a job in my field, I'm quitting the only job I've held for the last 6 years, I've never had a girlfriend. My life is literally a fucking joke. My anxiety and depression run my life, and happiness just seems so far out of reach.

I'm reaching out for help. Why the fuck should I continue to live a life that is literally hopeless. Everything would be better if I was gone.
