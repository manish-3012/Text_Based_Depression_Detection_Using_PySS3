i just want to be doneinpatient and two months of outpatient day hospital. got moved to a therapist who doesn't give a crap about me and won't listen to me. she decided she doesn't want me, so i get shipped off to someone else soon.

partner won't make love to me or show affection anymore, even though i've been begging for her attention for a year. i want to marry her, but part of me wants to just run off and fuck somebody else for the attention.

i'm tired of fighting the depression and the stupid cognitive distortions, and i'm tired of being unloved and unheard. i gave up all my fucking coping methods in the hospital and my partner will leave me if i relapse.

i want to cut so fucking bad. i've been plucking hairs out by the root to cope since i have nothing else left. everyone's keeping an eye on my eating so i can't starve myself--not that anyone is around enough to give a fuck.

i don't even have enough psych meds in lethal doses to off myself. i just want to go to sleep and never wake up. i've been writing my will in my head so fucking long, i should just get paper and do it now
