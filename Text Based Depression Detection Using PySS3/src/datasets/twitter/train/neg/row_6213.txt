Life of a socially inept personI've suffered from depression for 4 years now and at this point it's not suffering anymore but it's my way of life. My life has been molded by depression and it has left me with an empty feeling inside and it has given me a lot of time to reflect upon my purpose here in life. The main cause of my depression comes from my social ineptitude and time spent alone. I consider myself reasonably "normal" when alone, but can never seem to express myself the way I want to when in public. I'm extremly self conscious and sensitive. After years of never having opened myself up to anyone my sensitivity has ramped up to the extreme point where any form of conflict whether it be someone being mildy upset with me or angry at me makes me tear up and blush. I barely even speak to my parents anymore. I don't have any friends   
and my life is exponentially growing ever more painful and thoughts of suicide that has lingered around me for years seem more and more tempting. Life doesn't matter anyway right? Eventually the human race will go extinct and all of humanities accomplishment will have been for nothing. The only thing keeping  me alive at this point is hope that something will make life worth living.
