It gets better.The saying â€œIt gets better.â€ Is pretty much saying to just sit around and wait for your life to just magically get better. People should instead say something like, â€œStop waiting around for your life to get better, do something about it for yourself.â€ What I mean by this, is that only you can make your life get better, your life isnâ€™t just gonna magically become super amazing, if you want your life to be amazing, do something to make it amazing. I have just been thinking about this for a bit, and I would really appreciate othersâ€™ opinions about it.

TL;DR - The phrase â€œIt gets better.â€ Is dumb, what we should say is, â€œStop waiting around for your life to get better, do something about it for yourself.â€ Iâ€™d really love to hear othersâ€™ opinions about it ðŸ’›
