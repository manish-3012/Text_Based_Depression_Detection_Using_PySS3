GuiltI feel such guilt for feeling this way. I've had suicidal thought my entire life but I always kept it a secret so my mom wouldn't get angry at me.
I'm so scared to tell someone what I'm feeling. I'm afraid they will leave me alone.
I want them all to know how I feel but I'm afraid they won't accept it, or they will just tell me eberything is okay and to stop annoying them.
Please help!
