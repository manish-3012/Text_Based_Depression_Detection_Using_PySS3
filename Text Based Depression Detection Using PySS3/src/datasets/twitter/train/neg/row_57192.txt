Having rough time at the momentMiddle of night. Lost my friend at 2a.m. 31st.  Usually wake up screaming at 2. 

It's dark outside.  The water is out there. Can see from my open window.  Have my "buddy" next to me and boots on.  Things are difficult for me as i want to go there.  Having difficulty sitting here instead, of grabbing my "buddy" and heading to the water. Been trying to hold off until the 31st.  It's this panic that hits.  I am scared at the moment.  Just need to get through this bit of time.  Pain is a bit intense at the moment. 

forgive me, sometimes my thoughts and feelings are all over the place and i have difficulty articulating.
