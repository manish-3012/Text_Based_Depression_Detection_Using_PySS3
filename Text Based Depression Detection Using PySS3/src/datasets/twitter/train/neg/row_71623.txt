iâ€™m so tired.iâ€™m tired of everything, absolutely everything. 

iâ€™m tired of being a fuck up.

 iâ€™m tired of my narcissistic mother that verbally and emotionally abuses me on the daily and has done this ever since i was very little. 

iâ€™m tired of the trauma that fucks with me everyday from when my mom used to physically abuse me when i was younger and from when i used to get beat up on the daily at my old school.

iâ€™m tired of not being a good enough son for my mom or anybody else.

iâ€™m so tired of my mental illnesses.

iâ€™m tired of being a burden.

iâ€™m tired of living.

maybe i really should fucking kill myself. for the past few days my mom has been yelling at me more than usual and sheâ€™s been telling me how much better her life would be if i was never around and how i fucked up her life so much with my mental illnesses and that iâ€™m the cause of every single bad thing in her life. maybe i am as bad as my mom tells me i am, maybe i deserve the abuse from my mom. maybe the reason why my dad left me and doesnâ€™t care about me is because he knew that i would turn out to be a disaster.

maybe one day iâ€™ll finally kill myself.
