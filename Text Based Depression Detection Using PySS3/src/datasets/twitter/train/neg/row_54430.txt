Can't find a way out of this situation, think I might end it.I'll spare you guys the details of my whole life story, but the jist of it is that I'm 20 years old and I have zero dollars to my name, live out in the middle of nowhere without a vehicle, and I'm basically trapped here because my controlling mother wants me to stay here and basically be her slave and do everything for her. I can't get a job because of having no vehicle and like I said, I'm out in the middle of nowhere so there are no places within walking distance that I could work at.

I hate this situation and want to live my life but I can't see a way out of this situation. I'm not even supposed to be on Reddit right now but I'm using a phone that my brother gave to me before he died, and my mom doesn't even know I have it. And I also have asthma so I can't join the military either. I feel so drained every day and it's like I'm some robot on auto pilot. I don't think I could go through another week of this hell so I'm going to probably find a way to end it. I just needed to get this out there in case it's the last thing I post. That's it.
