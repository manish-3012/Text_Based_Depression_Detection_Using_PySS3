My friend is pulling from friends again, and stopped responding to me.Hey...

So things aren't getting better.

Lucy is pulling from her friends again, and this time she's very serious.

I know I can talk to her and calm her into herself again.

But this time, she won't let me.

My other friend is currently talking with her, but she's not saying a thing to me.  I posted a wall in small messages in hopes of her seeing my messages, but I still have no clue.

I'm running out of options here.  I know she won't be as "okay" as she claims she'll be.  I've heard of similar stories like this.  I know how they end and I don't want it.

I need a lot of help.
