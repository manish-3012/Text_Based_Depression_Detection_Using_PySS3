I really wish to end itI feel so horrible about wanting to die, but I do. I have the best family, friends, and a stable household. But I still want to die. I feel as if I dont deserve anything I have and I feel awful about it. The only reason why I haven't taken my life is due to the fact I dont want my family to be sad
 I have nothing else. I deserve nothing. All these kids suffering in the dark and cruel worlds. There in war-torn nations. Being abused faily, have nothing else to live for and here I am, a person born in an upper-middle class family in one of the safest neighborhoods in the country, with an amazing school wanting to die. How selfish can I be.
