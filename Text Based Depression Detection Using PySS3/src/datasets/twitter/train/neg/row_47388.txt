Why is life so painfulI am a 16 year old almost 17 and I have for as long as I could remember I've wanted to be a girl on the outside like I was on the inside and I have never said anything to my parents about it or anyone else. Due to this issue I have to deal with constant depression and thoughts of suicide and i really dont know what to do. I want to say something but i know that my parents will freak out and since my family is so Christian i know I will be disowned. I know this because my brother came out as gay recently and my dad has full out disowned him. My dad isn't a bad person though, i love my dad, i actually have a better relationship with him then my mom. My mom has accepted my brother and I just want to feel that acceptance. I want someone to talk to who gets me and I want to live my life as I want to be but I know I never can. I just need advice and I just really want someone to talk to that will at least somewhat understand me and let me spill everything out to them. I know that suicide isn't something I should be thinking of but it's a serious thing I'm considering.
