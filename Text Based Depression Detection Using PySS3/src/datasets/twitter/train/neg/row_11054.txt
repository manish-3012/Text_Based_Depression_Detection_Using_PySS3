Me again!So, ive been posting on here recently, on November 10th, I took 45 pills of Effexor XR, since then I no longer take any medications, BUT my mom still takes those same pills, my parents are out currently and my mom got a refill of the meds today, I can take 29 pills if I so please right now, and damn am I ever tempted. With them gone I don't have to worry about getting sent to the hospital and getting my system cleaned. I really want to, today I had a huge fight with my mom that you can gladly see the post I made this morning, every little fucking thing is pissing me off and irritating me, I almost just shoved my desktop computer off my desk playing league, tried distractions, and nothing is helping... I don't know what to do, I'm gona break down crying soon. Fuck me.
