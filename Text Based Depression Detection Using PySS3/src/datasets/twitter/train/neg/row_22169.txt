I'm tired of livingThis whole thing sucks. I'm tired of being so unlucky and of being so sad and angry about everything. I'm unable to feel a genuine connection with anyone. It's always the same "I feel so alone" bs. 

Fuck this. Am I overreacting right now? I don't know because I'm too fucking stupid to even know how I feel. 

I'm damaged and far beyond repair. Noone can help me and I will always be just an irrelevant single digit. Come end this. Fucking end this. Blow my fucking brains out.
