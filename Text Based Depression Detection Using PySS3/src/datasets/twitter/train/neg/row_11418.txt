Been thinking about killing myself for straight consecutive days and nightsI've been mentally ill since way before i was a young girl, now i've been feeling empty and i just want to end my pain, i always keep smilling but behind that the agonizing pain inside of me just wont stop, i've been feeling depressed for long time with me having failed relationships with my family and failed grades in school i think i was just not good enough , they say life is beautiful but for people like us , we're on a different page, i've been keeping my suicide thoughts all by myself and people makes me feel im alone and whenever i'll tell them i am depressed they wont believe and listen to me either

Now im searching for painless way to die
Im alive outside but im already dead inside
If anyone has a loved one who is depressed make them feel special and loved because depression killsðŸ˜”
