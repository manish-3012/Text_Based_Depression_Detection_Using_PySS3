I really donâ€™t want to be alive anymore...should I try therapy?I have constant depression and anxiety...it was bad but last year my 17 year old baby sister committed suicide. That was the worst pain I have ever been in....Iâ€™m still trying to cope and understand but Iâ€™m dying inside...Iâ€™m 22 and married and my 21 year old sister lives with me and my husband because she has autism and canâ€™t live on her own yet and both of my parents are alcoholic psychos so I had to remove her from them...Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for a long time  but Iâ€™ve never really tried to do it...and after losing my baby sister my other sister is the only one I have...I live for her...but I still want to die...Iâ€™m considering therapy but Iâ€™m scared...what will it accomplish? At the end of the day my sister is still gone. This is swallowing me up but I want to live for myself...but I just canâ€™t...if it wasnâ€™t for caring for my other sister I would have killed myself a long time ago...I just donâ€™t know what to do...what is going through therapy like?
