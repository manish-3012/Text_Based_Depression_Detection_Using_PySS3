Itâ€™s kinda funny, actually.My life is going pretty good. I belong to a family that isnâ€™t broken, Iâ€™ve got friends who genuinely care about and depend on me, Iâ€™m passing school, I donâ€™t live in the lower bracket - so Iâ€™m not living paycheque to paycheque - and Iâ€™ve got a study abroad in Germany thing all planned out for Amy immediate future. After that, thereâ€™s a whole world full of things I could fill with things Iâ€™m passionate about. I have things to aspire to, big and small.

But Iâ€™m still here. I still hurt. And what makes it so bad is that I donâ€™t know why. I canâ€™t find the source. I canâ€™t pin down with any certainty why it is that Iâ€™m in pain, nearly every hour of every day. It comes from nothing but feels so much more dominating than every time before when Iâ€™ve had a reason. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to kill myself within the next few days, but I also donâ€™t think that Iâ€™ll wake up wanting to die on the days that I do. So thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here. I donâ€™t know what I want from you guys exactly, but itâ€™s nice to talk to somebody.
