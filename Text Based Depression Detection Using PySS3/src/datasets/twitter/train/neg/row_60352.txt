What happens to your dog after suicide?I've had major depressive disorder my entire life, and am currently unemployed and living off credit in a hotel. This isn't the first time this has happened, but I'm just so tired of fighting, so I'm seriously considering just giving up. I just can't find any good information on what happens to a dog when the owner commits suicide though, so I'm worried about what would happen to her. Does the state send a dog to a shelter for adoption? Do they ask next of kin to take it in?

I adopted this puppy from a shelter, and now she's eight, and she's the only thing in my life that is giving me pause on killing myself because I'm all she knows.
