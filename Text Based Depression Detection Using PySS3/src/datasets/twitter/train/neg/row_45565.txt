I'm ScaredSomeone I love was talking about suicide last night, and the last time we talked was at 4:00AM this morning. I haven't been able to contact this person today at all, and I'm worried she might have done something drastic. She's been considering suicide for a few weeks now, and I've been trying to stop her from doing it. If she's not at school tomorrow, I'll assume the worst. What should I do?
