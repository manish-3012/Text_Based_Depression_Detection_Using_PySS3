I am thinking of commiting suicideFirst of all, I 'm a 17 male , and I hate everything about my life . I talked to my parents but they didn't even tried to stop me . I was actively trying to get a professional to diagnose me but they did not do anything ( they are not monsters just really old , they have never physicaly abused me). Over the past month I have been finding comfort in self harm . On top of that schooled started and anxiety is taking over and it is too much . My friends aren't even bothering to ask if I'm okey , even after seeing the marks and some even told me that it is my fault .I hqve begged many people for help with no response. I have nobody and I am desperate, all this is way too much for me to handle. I have decided to end my life today night with pills but I really want to change that . I need someone to talk me out of this but I'm afraid to call suicide prevention. Please Help
