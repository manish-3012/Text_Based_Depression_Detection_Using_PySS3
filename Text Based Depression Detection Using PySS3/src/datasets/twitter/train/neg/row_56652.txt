HelpIâ€™ve had ~6 failed suicide attempts in the past two months, mostly slitting my wrist but two overdoses that didnâ€™t work. Iâ€™m still cutting constantly. My parents love me and I used to be doing well in school but now Iâ€™m failing some classes. I have a bunch of friends but yet I still always feel so alone. I hate almost everybody I know. Everyone I trust has betrayed me. People lie so much and it hurts. Constant pain, heartbreak. I used to be somebody that was able to make my friends happy, someone that seemed a little crazy but smart. Now Iâ€™ve just been somebody who ruins the mood because Iâ€™m always sad and depressed. I just make everybody feel worse. Even though I have so many people that want to help me, I still fucking hate myself. I hate so much about my life. Every second feels so painful. I want to kill myself so much itâ€™s unbearable. I canâ€™t be fixed. I canâ€™t be helped. Nothing makes me consistently happy anymore besides my best friend.  I canâ€™t do any school work anymore because I canâ€™t focus in class, my appetite is all fucked up, and I no matter what I do I just want to die. Iâ€™m still seeing a therapist, and Iâ€™ve been to a psychiatric unit for depression. I canâ€™t take it anymore. I feel so hollow inside. My personality always just switches up seemingly out of nowhere I donâ€™t even know who I am anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do.
