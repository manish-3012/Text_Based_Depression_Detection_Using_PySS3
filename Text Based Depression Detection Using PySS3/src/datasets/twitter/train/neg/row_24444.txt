No purposeI keep drifting away from friends or they keep drifting away from me I canâ€™t tell. Iâ€™m 17, a junior in high school and have no intention on making it to 18. Every girl Iâ€™ve tried to get close to has found a different guy and completely forgets I exist. My friends rarely include me in anything and talk shit about me behind my back. As for family  they are confused and more focused on other things. And recently that 12 gauge looks more tempting than usual. I donâ€™t have any reason to keep going forward and no one cares enough to stop me.
