I've had thoughts of suicide and even becoming a martyr.  I'm feeling horrible now.I just tried to catch the tail end of an AA meeting.  Two members were there and only wanted to pass me and my problems onto someone else.  This is that same thing that happened to me on the other side of the US.  They sent me somewhere where they were still supposed to have meetings at this time of night.  There weren't any.  I then called the hotline.  She wasn't capable of doing more than telling me not to drink.

Those are shortcomings of the AA system.

I just checked the link that was presented by the sidebar link, which took 20 minutes of reading and then ended up in a cyclic loop ending in the middle of where it began.

For some reason, my desire to get help doesn't coincide with "business hours."

I'm sitting here and starting to cry for the first time in about a decade.

Please help.
