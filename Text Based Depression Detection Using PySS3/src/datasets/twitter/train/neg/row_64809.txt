It's been 4 yearsLast time I self harmed was 4 years ago and a few days, but today I was fine for most of the day  but right now I'm the worst I've been since then and I'm really struggling with how to deal with it. My girlfriend has an important day tomorrow and I don't want to wake anyone up but I don't know what to do.. help...?
