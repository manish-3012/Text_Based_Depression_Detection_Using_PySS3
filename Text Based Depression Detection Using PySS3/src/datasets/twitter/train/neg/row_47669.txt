I plan on hanging myself outside the Durham VA tonight.All my life I think I felt some kind of self harm I had a shitty life my dad was a drunk marine that like to kick me in the ribs at the age of five it didnâ€™t stop until I was 15 when he had a chair and I had a knife, My mom wasnâ€™t too much of a help and whooped my ass regularly I join the Air Force and was a good airman for a while until my wing man got killed by a major in an drunken driving accident and then killed himself two days later he was a major in the medical field that couldâ€™ve saved Jerichoâ€˜s life but he chose to let him rot in a ditch for six hours Iâ€™ve had more of my friends die in the last two years from heroin then the rest of my life combined my wife has created an unlivable situation with her kids and my daughter so I hospitalized myself until I was stable and now that Iâ€™m stable and I donâ€™t have a wife and I donâ€™t have a happy family and I was at one point shooting meth up on the streets of Los Angeles at rock bottom and I donâ€™t feel like going back there... I donâ€™t blame the VA but they certainly didnâ€™t do anything to help
