Welp I think this is itI have tried. I truly have.

A little backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 19-year-old college kid. I'm definitely bright I enjoy college and my studies. I have good grades, I'm outgoing and have a social circle. However, I'm just done with life. I have a dream I want to accomplish in life but at this time in life it unlikely that I will do so. I've never had a gf I'm 19 almost 20. I've tried with relationships just had no success. I feel like life is pointless if I can't live my dream and/or have a relationship. Both seem impossible, and since this is the case I'm going to shoot myself with my dad's shotgun tomorrow after my college lectures.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a good run. Maybe I'll be back in a new life.

Thanks,
