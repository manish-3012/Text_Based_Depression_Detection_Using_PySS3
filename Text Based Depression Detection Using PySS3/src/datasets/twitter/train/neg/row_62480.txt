I have mentally parted with my life.At first what kept me going was the thought of things possibly being better one day. I no longer believe that will be the case.

Then it was my family. The thought of them having to lose me, how much pain that would cause them. I made myself imagine the worst possible outcomes of me killing myself, it was psychological torture. But I don't have the strength to keep fighting anymore. My concern for them is outweighed by my desire to die.

I've had thoughts of suicide since I can remember, but they were always just thoughts. I guess you could say I'm in the planning phase now. I've accepted that this is the way I'm going to go and the longer I wait the longer I suffer, so why not get it over with?
