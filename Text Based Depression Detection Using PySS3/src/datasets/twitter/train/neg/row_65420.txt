I can't handle the abuse anymoreI'm living with my child's mother and I can't handle her abuse anymore. I've been living here for a few months and I'm trying to scrape together as much money as I can to get away but I'm not employed anymore because I stupidly took parental leave to help out with my son.  


The past 2 days she's been constantly insulting me and berating me. Calling me a liar, piece of shit, useless, scum, worthless. Now she's telling me to leave tomorrow or else she'll call the police. I don't have enough money to rent a place. I'm living on scraps and my unemployment hasn't even kicked in yet.  


Not to mention I'm bankrupt and have no credit so good luck to me finding a place.

  
I love my son but I can't handle this abuse.  
Either I put up with the abuse or I'm homeless. Homeless for who god knows how long. I don't have family I can stay with.  


Nobody takes my claims of abuse seriously because I'm a man. They say I should just suck it up and handle it.

 I can't handle it. Once a week I get these days long enslaughts of gaslighting and insults. I need out. I can't do this anymore. I hope my son forgives me when he's old enough to understand.   


I don't want to be homeless and I don't want to put up with the abuse. I fucking just want to drive my car into a brick wall or into the lake.
