Really need a friend + too sensitive for friendsThis never works and I want to quit.

I'm in a lot of pain and really want to die and have no one to talk to. I push away anyone who tries to get close and am too helpless to actually hurt myself in any serious way so it's not important.

If I just insist over and over that I'm not important and other people matter more and I have to live in service to them and complaining is ungrateful, it's easier to stay alive since they don't get as angry at me for being defective. All I have to do is tell myself that what I want doesn't matter and look at all the evidence over the years to support that and maybe I can cope more smoothly with life until something else decides it's over.
