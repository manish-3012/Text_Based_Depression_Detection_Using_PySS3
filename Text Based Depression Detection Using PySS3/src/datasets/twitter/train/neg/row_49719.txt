Burst of energy after "suicide attempt"So a week ago I had one of those **really** bad days. Ended up cutting myself for the first time and tried to strangle myself with a scarf. I know. Really stupid method. But that's not the point.

After I ripped the scarf of my neck and the color returned to my face I had this sudden burst of energy and I actually felt better. Idk. It was so weird. Adrenaline kicked in? Or endorphins released from cutting?

Btw, I'm back to feeling like shit a week after.
