I'm not sure if I can take itI think on maybe my 3rd post I said I told my parents, now they make fun of me for it, they keep making suicide jokes and I don't know how to take it, and when I don't find humor, they get mad, my dad threw some nail clippers at me and it hit me, it had the sharp side up so it hurt, out of spite, he booked a psychiatrist appointment for tomorrow at 3:00 pm, something I was trying to avoid the whole time, I found a bottle of 100 pack extra strengtht Tylenol and am debating to take it or not, if I do it marks my 5th attempt. Please tell me how to feel, I am emotionally confused rn
