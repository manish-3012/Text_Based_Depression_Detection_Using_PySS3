Why is my depression so awful lately?I donâ€™t know what happened. Iâ€™ve had depression for over five years now, and itâ€™s never been this bad. Iâ€™m still pretty young and I feel like thereâ€™s nothing left for me

I think Iâ€™m just annoying everyone. When I talk to people I feel like they just want to get away from me. I understand why they would. I can imagine talking with me would be so boring and uninteresting I just freeze up in front of people and I never say anything because Iâ€™m scared of seeming obnoxious and stupid because my sisters always talk about how annoying and noisy I am and theyâ€™re probably right

I just hate myself so much. I wish I was pretty or confident or slimmer because maybe then Iâ€™d be happy and Iâ€™d have friends who gave a shit about me.

My heart hurts so much. I just feel so sad. I wish people at school cared about me.
