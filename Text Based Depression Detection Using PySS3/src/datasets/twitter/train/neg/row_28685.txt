Parents expect me to work so hard...I already got a job to make them happy, but in less than 36 hours they expect me to start an additional job for the week. I know in my heart that this is a bad idea, but they'll take everything away from me if I say no to them. I feel trapped in financial slavery to my parents and I don't see any escape.
