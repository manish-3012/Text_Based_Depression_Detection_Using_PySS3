SupportI'm downstairs and my wife is upstairs. I was feeling down so I was going to walk on the treadmill to try and get some energy. No luck getting started. Texted my wife that I felt like a failure. She responded "why," I told her I didn't really know, and then I got nothing. Just waiting to see if she cares.
