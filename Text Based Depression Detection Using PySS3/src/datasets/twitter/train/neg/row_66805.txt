Why are there people like that....I am just in a middle of a breakdown, so sick and tired of people in general. I had a rough breakup, slowly recovering, and finally, I felt comfortable enough with another person, just for them to treat me like shit, after giving me false hope. How am I supposed to cope with this, it's too much, I have horrible anxiety attacks, my heart can't take it
