Ex of friend says theyre killing themselves tomorrow. Advice?A friend of mines ex has recently posted a suicide not saying that theyre going to kill themselves tomorrow. Theyve attempted suicide several times before, and they have a plan this time. My friend is very concerned, but she doesnt want to reach out because their ex has been manipulative and abusive to them. Does anyone have any advice? They live in the US so i was thinking i could send them some phone numbers or websites where they can get help. Their family is very conservative and wont be any help, and im worried police involvement would make things worse.
