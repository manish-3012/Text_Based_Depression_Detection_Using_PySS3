The beginning of the end?It's been seven years since I first started on the rocky road of depression. Had my first suicidal thoughts two years after it all started. Never once thought it was a good idea. Today seems like the day where taking action is actually a plausible time to be at an end. For years I've struggled and most recently (the past two years almost) I have been through so much shit. I've pushed all my friends away. I ruined the most amazing relationship I ever had. I am forced to live in a completely different state than ever before. I'm literally all alone. I just started working and am so miserable finding out that it doesn't even take anything off my mind despite it being so much to do all the time. I've done time in jail because of bad choices I made almost two years ago and ever since the jail time I've spiraled down to the point of no recovery. Now I just want out. I've thought of this before but never acted and all the excuses I had before for not doing it are so dumb that I wish I had done it a long time ago. I thought maybe the old "things always get worse before they get better" was true but after living the last two years of my life and seeing the last thing I've ever wanted leave I just can't see myself going further.

Tl:dr Lost everything/everyone close by bad choices I made two years ago which is making me see how worthless life is. I have no reason or purpose in my life anymore and see no future.
