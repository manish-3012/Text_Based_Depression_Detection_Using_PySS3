Suicide  I am on the internet and in real life and I keep hearing things about suicide, but I know when knows how I feel.  The unstable and grey feeling while walking down halls, the anxious and tired self, the headache, and hatred and violent thoughts towards others.  Harming myself and being aggressive.  Not caring for people trying to ask why I am depressed or people trying to cheer me up.  Do I have bad depression and suicidal thoughts?
