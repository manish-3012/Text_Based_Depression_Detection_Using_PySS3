I can't sit here and tell you all I love you, no matter how much I feel it. But I can tell you this......you're all worth loving.

No, I don't know you. Never met you. You got problems. Problems that are way over my head. All I am is a fellow suicider on reddit with self-esteem issues and a penchant for trying to say something nice and having it all come out horribly wrong. All I can offer you is words of encouragement, knowledge, and wisdom of my own personal experiences. Which in the end, is nothing you don't or can't already have.

But whoever you are, you're still a human being. You have problems, and those problems are unique to you. They are a part of who you are. You also have a lot of other qualities too. What they are, I don't know. It's up to you to remind yourself of all the goodness in you. Of all the good things you bring into this world.

Because whoever you are... I can't tell you I love you. I don't know you. But I know that as a member of this human race, and a part of the suicide tribe that we all seem to have become... you're worth loving.
