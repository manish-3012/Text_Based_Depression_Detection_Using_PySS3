I have ruined all my friendships with everyone, I am actually a shitty person, I am not talented enough to be good at what I do, and Iâ€™ve already started over before so itâ€™s not like moving would help.Here is everything:

- I just got friend dumped by my best friend for being an asshole. She drank too much and then blacked out. We had gone to a party together for 45 minutes until it was clear she had to leave. She had been pregaming hard but I donâ€™t drink liquor. She failed adderall. I think she was embarrassed about puking in someone elseâ€™s car and because she blacked out, she said she thought she was roofied. Her boyfriend texted me and two people Iâ€™m dating (because even my sexuality is fucked up) and asked about it, and I said I didnâ€™t think she had been roofied but had drank too heavily. He showed her the texts, and she responded to me: â€œI literally am shaking I am so angry with you. This is the most tone deaf shit Iâ€™ve ever read. Right, because I want to feel like Iâ€™ve been roofied bc Iâ€™m totally more comfortable with that than I am with the idea that I was just a dumbass who drank too much lmao Youâ€™re manipulative and destructive and Iâ€™d be glad to never see you again. So feel free to pick up all your shit from ___, because Iâ€™m respectfully requesting that you write me out of your fucked up life-narrative in which you are the sole protagonist. Another close friend of jellicle_cats bites the dust â€” I wonder what the common denominator is?â€ This is one of my only friends and Iâ€™ve tanked our friendship.

- this stupid shit happened last year where I got hassled walking home from a bar with my other ex friend, who I guess sheâ€™s referencing. A guy catcalled us and I got in a fight with him, and I ended up getting knocked out and cracking my skull open and getting a TBI. The girl who was with me never talked to me again and I never got an explanation and I donâ€™t think I want to know.

- the attack left me $16,000 in medical debt and I did not and cannot pay it off and have no credit to get an apartment on my own, and Iâ€™m living with my parents.

- Iâ€™m in graduate school and both my thesis advisors stoped working here and have no one to work with in my next and final year. The thing I was supposed to produce this year is literally awful and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m good at the thing Iâ€™m supposed to be good at.

- I think I compulsively lie and I donâ€™t even want to be like that. Iâ€™ve cheated on everyone Iâ€™ve ever dated, sometimes with the worst people possible. I have a shoplifting problem. I tried to get better about lying and kicked my drug problem, and I mellowed out a lot, but I do it easily and compulsively and I feel trapped in it.

- I found out kind of recently that thereâ€™s a 50% that I have Huntingtonâ€™s, which is so awful that I canâ€™t even think about it and instead of getting tested, I skipped my appointment.

- I gained weight and my hair is too short and I canâ€™t find anything about myself attractive. I am covered in awful tattoos. I was having sex with someone and I think they found me repulsive and I donâ€™t really blame them. I have no idea what Iâ€™m supposed to feel like in my body, and maybe itâ€™s gender dysphoria but it is most likely because Iâ€™m just empty.

- My mom took me out of my fatherâ€™s will and sold my childhood house (in Canada, Iâ€™m in the US) behind our backs with all our stuff in it, so I canâ€™t even go home and see family and I donâ€™t know if I could ever again because seeing someone else in that house will hurt me so much.

- I have tons of grading and two enormous projects due this week and I havenâ€™t started them and now I donâ€™t want to. The girl who sent the text is my classes and her boyfriend who showed the texts to her works for my department, and I donâ€™t want to see them again. They also have a ton of dirt on me and could get me in trouble, and maybe they might.

- The only thing that is keeping me from literally killing myself right now are my three cats, because nobody will love them as much as I love them and Iâ€™ve had them since they were kittens. But I know my mom would take care of them when I die. I feel like I would get caught if I tried faking my death or running away, and that would just be more embarrassing. I donâ€™t have much savings and if I drop out of this program, my family will never talk to me again.

- I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here. I feel like if I were to tell people I was this suicidal, they would think I was attention seeking unless I actually just did it. I am really embarrassed and I donâ€™t feel like I have any options left. I know I will make it look like an accident and probably drive my car into a wall.

- I canâ€™t imagine any future for myself whatsoever. Thereâ€™s nobody I picture myself with, and there are no jobs I want. I donâ€™t know who I want to be. And Iâ€™m one of the people who thinks our planet is totally dying and that capitalism will just get worse. I feel it on this personal level and this grander level, too.

- I also have enough camping gear to just take off, and just leave school and everyone and maybe do all of this without a plan, further ruining my life. But there is nothing for me here and I am not capable of living through this. I have no medical insurance.

- I really donâ€™t know if I can go through with it. I donâ€™t have any other social media and nobody to talk to who I want to know any or all of this. I donâ€™t really care about not leaving behind any work because Iâ€™m not great anyway. I know if I went and hung out with people I would be safer and maybe feel a bit better, but I also donâ€™t know if I want to feel better.
