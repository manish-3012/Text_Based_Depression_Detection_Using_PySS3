Just need some advice.Hey. I really donâ€™t know what to say here. I guess I just need....advice. The love of my life (please donâ€™t try to say otherwise I just....I know. Iâ€™ve known since I met her.) has issues with monogamy. She did so well for so long and stayed faithful. However, sheâ€™s flirting with a girl currently and itâ€™s not the first time. Itâ€™s an exes ex, to make matters worse. It seems serious. She turns it on me to make me seem crazy -  crazy for not trusting her, crazy for reading her incriminating messages. I canâ€™t do it anymore. Sheâ€™s all I have. I know sheâ€™s not perfect but....Iâ€™ll never find another like her. I wanted to marry her. I honesty still do. Iâ€™ve been insane and depressed for years but this just feels like the right time. All I have currently is about 600mg of Valium (unfortunately hard to kick the bucket with), around 60 pills of 300mg Gabapentin, and a lot of red wine. A few scalpels. Will the meds and mix of wine do it or should I just not even bothering go straight for blood? Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™ve had chronic pain and autoimmune problems for years that just keep getting worse, Iâ€™m the most sensitive fuck alive, and just completely unstable at this point. Thanks for any help. Hope youâ€™re all doing as well as anyone on here can.
