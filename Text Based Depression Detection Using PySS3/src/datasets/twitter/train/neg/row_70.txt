It doesnâ€™t get better.I tried to kill myself three nights ago and only just woke up today. Iâ€™ve had outpourings of support from family and friends but it all seems meaningless to me, like I donâ€™t want to stay alive without being someone elseâ€™s reason to live. All I can think about is getting out of the hospital so that I can try to kill myself again and not be so foolish to call the ambulance and let myself pass out to obvliion. The thing is, if Iâ€™d have died I wouldâ€™ve been at peace, I wouldnâ€™t have known a thing more. It wouldnâ€™t have mattered in the grand scheme of things look how many of us there are. Iâ€™m just sick of this place and sick of this cruel world with no hope or release or cool down itâ€™s just full on  to the point where Iâ€™m not strong enough to take it and thatâ€™s okay. Sorry that I let all my family and friends down but they just donâ€™t get it.
