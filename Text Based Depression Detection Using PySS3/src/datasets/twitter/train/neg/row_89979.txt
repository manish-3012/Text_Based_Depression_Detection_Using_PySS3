I have nothingI am really depressed rn.I have no motivation to do college assignments and I think I am actually going to fail.I could withdraw but my parents will be angry at me.So I'm dead either way.Theyre gonna take away my scholarship and I don't know what to do if they did it.I haven't talked to anyone in the last month.I have no friends that would talk to me.I have nothing to look forward to.I don't even feel like eating anymore. I feel like my life is going to end because of this damn lockdown.My heart breaks each time they extend it.
