I donâ€™t know anymore     Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for 4 years now, and every year it gets worse and worse. Recently my suicidal tendencyâ€™s have gotten so strong that Iâ€™ve had mouthfuls of pills and decided to spit them out. My parents donâ€™t believe in medication, and we donâ€™t have the money or time for therapy. Iâ€™m afraid to talk to my school councilor about it because I donâ€™t want him to contact home, Iâ€™ve gotten into so much shit recently, I donâ€™t want to get into anymore trouble. Iâ€™m so tired of being called an attention whore in my own home just for showing even mild depression. Everyone hates me anymore too, and I donâ€™t know what I even did, everyoneâ€™s constantly mad at me and I have no one to talk too. Iâ€™m afraid that today might be my last, I donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep spitting these pills. I feel like eventually Iâ€™ll let them go down.
