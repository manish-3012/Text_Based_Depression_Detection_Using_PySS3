I don't want to do it. But I feel trapped.I'm 28f. My spouse is amazing. But I had a stroke early this year and ever since I've not been the same person. Or a person.

I only feel anxiety and guilt. No pride. No joy. No love. Except major infatuation with my friend.

I would go now but my mom is visiting from out of state and is returning because we will be going back to our home state for a week.

I have to wait almost 3 weeks until I can admit myself. But I don't think they can help me anymore.
