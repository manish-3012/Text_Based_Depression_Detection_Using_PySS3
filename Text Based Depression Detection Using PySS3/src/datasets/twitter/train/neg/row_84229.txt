Iâ€™m confused, do you guys want me to commit suicide?Ok Iâ€™m aware this makes me sound like an attention whore, but I sort of noticed that all the posts that have been up for a few hours have maaaany comments and I posted last night about how I want to die and Iâ€™ve got two and one was a joke (thank you to the person who replied in a genuine way), does your silence mean you guys do want me to die? If so Iâ€™ll think about it but I canâ€™t promise anything because I donâ€™t have a gun and Iâ€™ll have to go through a lengthy background check process.
