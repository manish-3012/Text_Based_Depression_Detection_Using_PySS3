I'm done with tryingI've tried so hard to be stable these last few months. I've tried so ridiculously hard to be okay so I would be allowed therapy. They told me I needed a month's stability before I would be allowed. I managed three. But I've been abandoned again, there is no therapist available, the mental health system in the uk is despicable and I'm done just sitting round waiting for something to happen to make me feel better. I've tried so fucking hard. 

The only thing that is delaying me dying is so fucking stupid too. My best mate bought tickets for us to go see her favourite singer on Wednesday and I don't want to let her down and for the singer to be tainted for her. But I don't want to go. I want to die and I can't even tell her. 

I'm 22. This should be my fucking peak. I'm done.
