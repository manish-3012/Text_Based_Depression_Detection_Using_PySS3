What's the point anymore?I broke up with my fiance last night, she is always cancelling our plans, i'm the last one on her list when i should be the priority. I don't know why i did it, i was just sick of feeling alone and that i didn't matter to her.

I don't see the point of living anymore, I recently acquired a 45, I think it would be the easiest way to end this.
