The date is set for April 24, 2019.Itâ€™s so liberating to have finally picked a date, to have control over my death like itâ€™s a routine surgery. Most people donâ€™t choose when theyâ€™re going to die. They die scared and unwilling and randomly and they donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening and neither do you and nobody does and thatâ€™s why I feel so free to have finally set a date.

Now I donâ€™t have to focus on finding a job or a girlfriend like Iâ€™ve been pressured to. Sure my parents sink a ton of money into college and theyâ€™ll be sad and I feel guilty about that, but nobody else will miss me. Theyâ€™re the only friends I have and I have no job or social life and Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend and I want to do this so I will. 

Now I donâ€™t need to put in any effort because in nine months, Iâ€™ll be dead :)
