I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m close to doing it but every day I warm to the idea...Guess Iâ€™m in a lesser situation than most ppl here. Any advise on how not to slide down that road? Like early prevention?
I donâ€™t think I will do it but Iâ€™m afraid the thought constantly gets more... acceptable on the back of my head...
