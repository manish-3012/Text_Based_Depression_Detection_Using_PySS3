â€œJust be happyâ€My (M23) fiancÃ©e broke off our engagement because I (F20) have been saying â€œIâ€™m over itâ€ whenever he asks how my job is going. He also told me Iâ€™m 12 for telling him that I wanted to kill myself this week. He told me that unless something significant happens in your life, you should just smile and deal with it. He referred to the movie 7 pounds as a legitimate reason whereas my depression is not related to something of that magnitude of accidentally killing 7 people. There were other things as well of course. But those two are echoing in my head back and forth and I have no one anymore. I lost my friends when I moved away to live with him. I am NC with my parents and any other family members.  I was abused emotionally and physically by my parents and I was sexually assaulted when I was 13. I am dealing with ptsd from the abuse and assault. He thinks that I should be able to flip a switch and be happy. Iâ€™m sitting in my car down a dead end road atm. Heâ€™s at the bar with god knows who. I want to end it right now. Iâ€™ve been trying to bring myself out of this fog. I canâ€™t snap out of it. I keep hoping Iâ€™ll grasp some ability to care about focusing on the future, but I hurt too much. Iâ€™m just prolonging the inevitable. We all die eventually.
