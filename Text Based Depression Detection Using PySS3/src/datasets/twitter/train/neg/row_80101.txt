I want to dieI'm 19. My life is shit.. parents kicked me out so they could still claim benefits so I've been living with my boyfriend and his family for a few months now, but I hate it. His dad doesn't speak, is rude and has called me a bitch before, his mum writes stuff on my fb and is just rude in general makes me feel like I'm always in the way and he has 2 sisters, one being 19 and she is a stuck up bitch and tells me I'm not welcome there ... his mum hides shampoo and conditioner from me then they use all my lush stuff! But my parents gave my old room to my little brother who was sharing with my little sister. So I have no room or bed or anything at my parents house. We have a tiny box room at my boyfriends house. I haven't been able to get a job for months and my partner just lost his job. We argue all the timemails, found pictures of a naked girl on his phone a week ago after 3 years of being together but he has cheated loads so.my own fault. I feel trapped . My parents said I can go back but I don't want to just stay on the couch or whatever I want my room back with my bed :"( my families shit i have a nan and grandad but they can't help me with accommodationo and neither will the council. I feel like the best thing to do is kill.myself self. I tried before I over dosed on tablets but was sick so much it didn't do anything was in hospital for 1 night .... I don't cut myself as I hate blood and would probably pass out I do punchanged myself when I'm angry tho :( I just don't know what to do anymore feel like I have no support from family and I'm living in someone's house who hates me it's just horrid :( always have bad luck literally can't remember last time something good happened :( had enough but I'm too scared of a painful death :(
