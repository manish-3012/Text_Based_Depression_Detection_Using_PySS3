Lost all hope.Hello everyone, as mentioned above I'm in the final year of high school this year and gonna give the final examinations. There's much pressure upon me, everyone just keeps telling me to study and study all the time. I've got tired of hearing the same shit over and over again. 

I used to be a bright student of my class, I used to get good grades in every subject and all the teachers along with my parents were satisfied and proud of me, but my situation started deteriorating since 9th grade. My marks started going down gradually with each exam, by the mid -session of 9th grade, I was no longer the "know -it-all kid"that I used to be. Teachers lost their faith on me my friends too, started mocking me for getting mediocre percentages. Then, the big shit happened, I didn't even get a position in the annual exams of class 9 and was able to secure a mere 79% whereas I once scored 94-98% percentage in exams. 

Now it's my final year of high school and the situation seems to be worsening further, my grades are still dropping and my image in school is going down. 
If it stays this way,I might actually fail this year and might not be able to get out of high school. 
In have got very depressed and I don't know what to do. I want to study hard and show the teachers and my parents that their bright child isn't gone but I am just unable to do that. I lose my focus and get distracted very easily. I often procrastinate. I have lost all hope and I'm thinking of killing myself please provide me some way out of this hell. 

Sorry for the long post, I wanted to speak out everything that was disturbing me. 
Thanks in advance.
