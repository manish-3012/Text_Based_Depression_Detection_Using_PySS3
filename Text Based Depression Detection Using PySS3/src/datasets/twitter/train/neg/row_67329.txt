I donâ€™t know what to doI have to make a really difficult decision. Which is absolutely impossible for me, altough it might sound stupid for others. I ve been all right for 3 months know, after about 3 years of depresion. In the last year I faild to kill myself twice. And now, I just feel like the only way out is to jump off the window.
