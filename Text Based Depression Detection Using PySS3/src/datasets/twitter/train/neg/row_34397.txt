Life is going downhill so fastMy depression is getting worse, all my coping mechanisms are gone, COVID-19 and all the isolation that comes with it is making everything worse, my gf is gone, I have a chance to kill myself now, etc etc. 

I see no reason to carry on, sure in a couple years I could make everything right again but thatâ€™s so so so long. A month feels like a century, I cannot carry on for much longer. I feel very guilty because people care and I donâ€™t wanna hurt them but my sense of guilt is fading away as the depression gets stronger. Maybe theyâ€™ll carry on and heal? I hope so. I know the death of a love one hurts like hell but I really hope they live on and choose to be what I canâ€™t be. Idfk, Iâ€™m worried but Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ll understand and forgive me and carry on. I suppose it doesnâ€™t matter, once Iâ€™m dead I canâ€™t feel anything including guilt or pain or anything.

Iâ€™m sorry to rant u guys. I love u all â¤ï¸ take care
