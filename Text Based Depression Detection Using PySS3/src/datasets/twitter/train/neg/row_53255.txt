Wishing my pain would endI made a post on r/depression today. I said I would sleep. I did not. I'm now lying on my bed and, well, I know how things work for me.

All my life, I've felt so stressed. There's no deep-rooted cause to it. The way everything scares the shit out of me while I try so hard takes a toll on me.

Of course, there's an urge in me to type up details about whatever consumer product, ideal, trend, or fad was stupid and frustrating to me. It's been a long day. The days are long, but nothing in my past had occurred a long time ago.

I'm scared of the summer approaching. My face is very red. It was a year ago that I asked her. The way she was inviting me to be with her had felt off, but I was familiar with it. It was just that this time, someone was offering to spend time with me. I was really frustrated while I had continued to hear the usual. I know she didn't mean anything wrong with all the sugarcoated psychology and self-esteem concepts. She wasn't able to understand how it all affects me.

One day, a day after spending time with her, I had cried the entire day. Was it five goes at crying? Life is torture and there I was, having asked someone with so much weight to my question. By the end of the summer, I went off my rocker with her and then, being ignored when I had seen her around had been the most painful thing. I had cried so much that night.

Yes, I would love someone to save me. It's been decades of torture and I just keep at it. I keep trying, but it's hell on me. The suicidal thoughts are around big time.
