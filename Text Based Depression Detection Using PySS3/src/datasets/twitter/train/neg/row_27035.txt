No one knows what to say to me anymoreThe only thing people say is that life gets better after high school but thatâ€™s a fuckin lie. If it somehow gets so much better then why is everyone on Reddit complaining about how much adulthood sucks. Whatever, nobody here responds anyway because they know Iâ€™m justified in wanting to die.
