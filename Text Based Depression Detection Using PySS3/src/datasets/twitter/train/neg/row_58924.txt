I really hope Iâ€™m in the wrong sub.So yeah, Iâ€™m a male, 21. And to sum up, Iâ€™ve been aware for some years now that going to therepay would be very beneficial. 
Iâ€™ve always been the sort of straight logical thinker but depressive. I consider suicide could very reasonable option in some situations. But I am sure I still got a lot of chances me cause of how young I am so Iâ€™m just coping with it.
However what happened this time has really scared me. I had a very emotional argument with a family member and we both ended up really upset. But for some reason I just just started self injuring and ended up getting naked and (not deeply) cutting from my knee to the belly and the other knee. 
I started crying and woke up next day not sure if it had been a dream. Wtf is going on? 
 TLDR: Iâ€™m scared because Iâ€™ve never thought of anything like that and one nigh sliced me self from knee to knee.
