The Truth.When making my way to school by bus, and having to suffer from the extreme sun light and heat characteristic of a country near the Equator, I constantly gaze at the clear sky and ponder whether my life is by any means meaningful or if it just is a byproduct of my stupidity, more explanation about it after. Many thoughts occur in the back of my head but one doesn't seem to fade away; should I put an end to this semieternally painful plain of existence today? Should I really try to keep trying to improve my grades in Physics, Math or Chemistry? Or should I just admit the fact that I am simply not good in such matters and I'll never be? It's quite hard to endure the routine knowing how procrastinative you are. Some of my friends clearly have more success than me and even though I'm not the most hardworking, not by far, but neither are they and they get impeccable results in exams I struggle to resolve even the simplest of the problematics. I feel numb, completely lost and driven away of focused path I should be following. Last year I accepted participating in an olympiad class and I was persuaded to sign some sort of proof that I was commited to it and which would be used in case my development in mathematics, physics and chemistry were not bright. I have been living this nightmare for the past years and after many discussions with myself I even abdicated completely of the faith I used to have in a deity in order to embrace the cold reality. When I was little I somehow had figured life was not what it seemed to be and I had realistic ideals when my classmates were daydreaming. Today I complete fifteen years of existence and I yet have to discover what is the solution of this problem, which is everything.
