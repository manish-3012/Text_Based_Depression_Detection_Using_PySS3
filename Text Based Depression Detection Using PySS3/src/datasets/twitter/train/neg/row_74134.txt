I am just so goddamn useless.I'm 21 and have been told I was gifted all my life and I know I am. But I have done nothing with it, absolutely nothing. I went to a mediocre public liberal arts college and dropped out after 2 years because it was too easy and boring, and I have no desire to go back to school. I cannot make myself work hard enough at anything to enjoy it. 

I enjoy partying and hanging out with my friends, and I'm a lot more socially competent than I was a few years ago, but it's small comfort when my friends are going all over the world and writing for magazines and blogs and starting bands that are getting big and I'm still stuck not knowing what I want to do. I have felt completely worthless as a person for over a year now. My notion of self-worth is very strongly connected to success. A person cannot be successful just by being in my opinon. I know I've always been very hard on myself but it's just getting to be impossible to bear. I know very few people who have been given as much as I am who have done so little with it. I feel kind of like I am ready to end it all.
