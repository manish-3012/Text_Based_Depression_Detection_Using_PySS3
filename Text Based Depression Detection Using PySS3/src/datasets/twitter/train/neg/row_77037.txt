Why not.I'm at a dead end. All my dreams are dead. All my prospects are dead. I failed high school. I can't get a job. The love of my life left. And it seems no one cares. All thats left is my fucking skateboard. Why not just rob a bank or some shit. All the cash there is insured anyway so no ones really at a loss. Worst case I end up dead, best case I make some cash to fund my life for another few weeks. Win win as I see it.
