One mistake completely ruined my entire lifeI was school captain, dux of my school, worked hard for a uni degree at a top university in my state and had a great job on good money. 

I took a few drugs over the last year and ended up with a life changing disorder that prevents me from driving, watching TV, working on computers, causes immense physical and psychological pain, and much more.

To be fair, I canâ€™t even look myself in the mirror anymore. I hate myself so much. You only get to live one life, and Iâ€™ve completely thrown the entire lot down the drain at the young age of 23. This wasnâ€™t supposed to be my life. 

I want to start fresh, whether it be the afterlife, reincarnation or to just vanish into complete darkness. My life is a Black Mirror episode now. I canâ€™t leave my house. Iâ€™ll never forgive myself. There are no words to describe how down I am on myself and how much I hate me.
