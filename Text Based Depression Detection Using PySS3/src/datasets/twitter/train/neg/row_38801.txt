I'm here partially because of suicide but also because I may hurt others and others may hurt themselves if I do what's right.Honestly, the last year of my life has been a living hell but it's also been very eye-opening. About a year ago, I suddenly began to develop seemingly arbitrary anxiety attacks. Nothing traumatic happened, nothing major changed in my life - my heart rate just randomly started spiking up to 140-150 BPM when I'm doing things like sitting or watching videos. After suffering with these anxiety attacks about 2-4 times a week, I reached my breaking point and I was literally ready to kill myself and take others with me. During my period of suffering I met a girl who at first seemed like the ideal girl for me but things quickly went south when her BPD started getting in the way. Her insecurities are just something I couldn't deal with. Overtime, I went from being depressed and feeling hopeless about the entire situation to angry. I didn't understand why any of this was happening to me. I was an otherwise normal guy in my mid-20's when this disease just began manifesting itself for no apparent reason. I was finished, done for, I wanted to kill myself and go out with a bang. I wanted to take others with me. I dialed the suicide helpline and I spoke to somebody for an hour straight. At the end of the call, an anxiety attack manifested itself and I called 9-11 for what seems to be the millionth time. I just couldn't take it anymore. My mind was racing. My heart was pumping faster than it ever has. I was feeling weak, dizzy. They took tests, they gave me medicine, they did everything they could and I think I've been to the ER more than anybody active in this subReddit combined. 

"It's just anxiety, you'll get it over it."

"Here's some xanax and some SSRI's, take them and you'll get better"

"You need to see a psychologist"


And so I did. I didn't get better. I had planned my suicide down to the very smallest of details, and nobody knew. Not even her. Then, I had a day of clarity. My anxiety dissipated. I felt OK for one day. Wonderful. Great. Sleep. Wake up. I feel better. I take a shower. I eat. Normally it's triggered by now. Everything is fine. Another day. No anxiety. I continued to live. Day. By. Day. I delayed suicide just one more day. Then, just one more day. Then, just one more day. Two weeks passed of blissful normalcy. Then, I started hallucinating. I started to hear voices and only for just one day. I started to see lights, I started to see shadows surrounding me. Everything got darker. I nearly passed out on the street. I called the ambulance. Checked by ER. Nothing is wrong. It's just anxiety. 

**It's just anxiety**

But no, it isn't. It can't be. Something must be wrong. The voices, the hallucinations, the colors, the darkness. I'm schizophrenic, but I couldn't be. I told myself I needed to fight this disease because I'm too good for it. I can't have schizophrenia. I just can't. I filtered the voices in my head out and I used everything in my will-power to bring myself to normalcy one more time. Just as fast as the voices and hallucinations came, they left. It's been months since.

You may reading this and thinking I'm crazy. Crazy is a broad term to me. I don't feel like you either be crazy or not. I think it's a spectrum. Some people are more crazy than others, but they may not be labelled as crazy. Did I think I was crazy? Do I think that I'm crazy now? No. But this anxiety sure is driving me crazy!

So more months passed, and my girlfriend's BPD seemingly started to get worse. And I seemingly got better. I used all the money I worked for to do a downpayment on a nice car and I've been living my life the way I've wanted to. I don't listen to others, I do whatever the fuck I want. Do I want to drive out to that sushi restaurant and order too much food and take it all to go? You bet your ass I do. Do I want to speed in residential streets and narrowly avoid the cops? Sure I fucking do. I'm in control of my life. I've always been in control of my life, it's just that my control slipped for last couple of months and when it did, I almost did the most terrible things know to man. I'd appear on news stations, guaranteed. But I was better now. I'm normal again. I started taking road trips with my girlfriend and my friends and we have had an absolute blast. I have loved every single minute of it. 

Then, my girlfriend did a shit-test on me. She asked me if I watch porn. I said yes. Ever since then, her insecurity has grown massively and she even **attempted suicide** because I wasn't willing to compromise with her. She wanted me to straight up stop watching porn. I wouldn't. 

I was initially going to talk about how all of this has fueled my anger and it has made me into a vile human being that's been wanting to selfishly kill but I decided to just stop. I texted my girlfriend right now and I broke up with her in the most terrible way possible. I'm emotionally hurting so much right now. I didn't want to do it because she might kill herself but I can't fucking handle it anymore. 

We had such a great time. 

I loved her so much.

I'm fucking crying so much and I feel so pathetic for it. Maybe this is what I needed. I've never felt so sad before. It feels wonderful to cry. I can finally feel something.
