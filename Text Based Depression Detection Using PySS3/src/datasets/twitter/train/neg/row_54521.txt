Death is the only wayI hate myself beyond any and all comprehension. Words can't begin to describe the depths of my hate and anger towards myself. My hatred and anger grow with each and every breath I take, and the only way to quell them, the only thing that will quench them is my death. I long to kill myself. I long to watch as I slowly and painfully drain the life from my eyes. I want to take anything I can wrap around my neck and slowly squeeze the air and life out of me. I want to pull harder and harder, with each breath I take, until there is nothing left. I want yo die. I need to die. I have to die, and I have to die right here tonight! I will not stop until I'm done!!
