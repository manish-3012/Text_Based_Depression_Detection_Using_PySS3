I've given up.I am 16,I want to disappear, I think it would be less effort to die than it would be to live.So many responsibilities,so little time.People have tried to help me,but it's only a stopgap  measure,I'm only here because the suicide hotline took too long.I've had my emotions stomped on enough that all I have left is sadness and the ability  to cry out.I might have more,but my depression  might as well have just made it dissapear.I've got this nagging urge in my head to do it,but my survival  reflexes kind of kick in every time I try to off myself and I get out of it.I'm on three anti depression pills a day and I still desperately want to dissapear and be alone forever. My hands were shaking so much that I had to remove extra spaces.
