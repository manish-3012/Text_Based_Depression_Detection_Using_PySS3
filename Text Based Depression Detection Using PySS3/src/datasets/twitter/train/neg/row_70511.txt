I'm exhausted. I'm struggling and the thought of another 50 years of this makes me just want to quitI have nothing but hate and guilt towards myself. I hate my job and am doing nothing of value. I make money and spend it. I don't know what I want, I think of things but I don't have the talent to achieve them. I cant suppport myself drawing pictures, and I hate myself tpo much to use my stupid fucking writing degree. My family is worried now, I feel even worse. I cant keep spending all day at that desk. I can quit and take another job doing the same, and thats a hell in and of itself. I want to paint and draw pictures and talk to people. I cant afford school. Theres no path I can take where thats possible. Either I mooch off my Dad or I continue to do meaningless work - at my current company or otherwise. I cant, Im miserable. I cant afford more school. Im too stupid to use my degree. Im not even emotional anymore, Im just tired. Im exhausted. Im really, really fucking tired you guys.
