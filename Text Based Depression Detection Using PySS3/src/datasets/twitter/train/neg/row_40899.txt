anxietyi have so much anxiety i wanted to forward a msg from this girl in my class talking abt the graduation to my dad but instead of forwarding it i spent 30 mins procrastinating completely frozen i dont know why im like this i felt like my dad is already too tired of me but putting this on him would burden him even more. eventually i was able to forward the msg to him and even msged the girl that my dad is a bit busy so ill be telling her when im available to attend but she keeps pressuring me the tone of her message seemed so cold and frustrated i dont know what to do or where this anxiety came from what am i gonna do once i go to physical school? i was doing so well but even i wasnt able to forward the msg i suddenlt felt an urge to kill myself instead of sending the message to my dad. i have so much pending stuff to do. i hve to find a therapist but i am contemplating that because im gonna kill myself anyway i gotta get started on so much work but whats the point when im gonna fail and kill myself? i need to do so many things but with what motivation when im gonna kill myself?
