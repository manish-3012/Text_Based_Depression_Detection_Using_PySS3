Last therapy session made it worseI started feeling numb again and tried to tell my therapist about it. 
You see, with the numbness come suicidal  and self harm thoughts. 
But worse, what always follows for me is that longing for it all to end. 
My therapist didn't even listen properly, always interrupted me and tried explaining me how that numbness was an improvement, while I desperately tried to tell him why this might be concerning. 

He didn't get it. He was just happy I wasn't having an other breakdown during the session and congratulatiolated me on making progress. I normally am an overly emotional person so it is very difficult to open up when all feelings are gone. Because, why bother? 

Well, the feelings returned in the way they always do, meaning, the longing and the pain returned. Nothing else. 
Drawing usually helps, but this time it isn't satisfiying this need enough. 
I rarely have any drawings to share anymore, because of how dark and triggering they are. But receiving criticism helps me keep going because improving my art skills is the last thing that matters to me right now. 

It hurts even more that now the last skill I had is beginning to fail and I am not even able to feel any kind of bond or connection anymore. I am so very lonely even though technically I am not alone.
