How long are you supposed to wait to see if things get better?A common response is "dont do it things will get better". Well I'm going on close to 3 years of giving it a chance to get better and it's not. Arguably worse.

So how long do I have to put myself through misery before everyone can agree it's time to give myself the relief I deserve
