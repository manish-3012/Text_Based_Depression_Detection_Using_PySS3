Thank you all - UPDATE: Friend in need[Original post, here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/er84e/need_some_advice_for_a_friend/)

Thank you all for the kind words, help and advice.  Finally was able to hook up with my friend yesterday afternoon, and we had a great time hanging at the pub, watching some football, eating junk food, laughing, and some crying.

She was able to talk about her husband a little more, as well as some of the pain she's been going through with remaining family members.  I gave her the name and phone# for the counselor I found through the National Hot Line (thanks to SQLwitch for suggesting that), and she said she's going to call them next week.

I'm not going to hound her, but she says she is ready and willing to seek professional help, so I will be trying to make sure she follows through.

Again.  Thank you everyone who responded, it was helpful and very well appreciated.
