I hate my body and seriously cannot cope anymoreI've struggled with my weight my entire fucking life and I'm sick of it. I'm not overweight technically but I have a gross body - love handles, belly fat, huge thighs and man boobs starting to come through. 

I just went through a really stressful six months and ate my way through it. I looked at myself for the first time in the mirror today and just cried. I can't date or have sex with anyone because I'm so ashamed of my body. It's obscene. I should be able to manage my weight but it's so difficult. I look at places like r/loseit but I get so confused about how to calculate stuff like my calorie intake or my macros that it just becomes overwhelming and I give up. 

I just don't want to spend one more single fucking day in this body. It's bad enough that I don't feel comfortable being intimate with someone but what's worse is that my body is a physical manifestation of my inability to look after myself. I'm just so fucking furious with myself and I'm at the end of my tether I cannot go on like this. It's awful.
