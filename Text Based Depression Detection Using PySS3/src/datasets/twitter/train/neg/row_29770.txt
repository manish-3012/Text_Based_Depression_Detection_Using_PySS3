I threatened to commit suicide to my parents and got hospitalized.I have been depressed and experiencing suicidal thoughts and anxiety for a while now, i've been struggling socially and i don't have friends at my school, it just hurts seeing everyone being happy and hanging out with each other. 

I was considering committing suicide but i am scared of death, if everyone hates me then i might as well kill myself, maybe the world would be blessed after my suicide. 

the only friend i know goes to a separate school and we don't hang out in person, we only text and call through our phones every now and then. 

Two days ago i had a fight with my parents and that was the time I threatened suicide in front of them, they soon called the police on me and they sent me to the hospital, i was held there for about nine hours.
