having the thoughts againive been doing so well i havenâ€™t hurt myself in months and itâ€™s been even longer since i attempted taking my own life but i just feel so numb right now. iâ€™ve barely eaten anything lately and i have no motivation to keep going anymore. i used to want to keep going for my future patients (iâ€™m premed) and my future kids but lately i feel like itâ€™s not worth it because thatâ€™s so far away and there will be other people in the world to take over. iâ€™m currently sitting on the floor in my bathroom right now just staring at my medicine cabinet because i know for a fact i have pills that will end everything and even tho iâ€™m not particularly sad right now i just have no desire to keep existing. iâ€™m pathetic and useless and if i had any hope that i actually have a purpose besides to die young i would be a moron. hoping not to wake up tomorrow because thereâ€™s nothing nice to wake up. thanks for reading this x
