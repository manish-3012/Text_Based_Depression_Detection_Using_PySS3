So if someone says"do ___ or I'll kill myself" you don't reeeeaaally have to right? My suicidal, uh, "friend" is making demands of me and I'm scared.Sorry for any mistakes/rushed post, I'm very stressed and unsure if there much time.

Not sure what to do, not sure of much, my friend, who I know self harms and is suicidal, made an attempt last night, I stayed up for hours trying to talk him out, he stopped responding and I'm feeling out. This morning I get a "hey" and was very relived. I asked if he felt better, he said no, I asked what I could do, long story short, he asked me for nudes. I refused, that's not something I'm comfortable with. Fast forward, he's having an depressive  episode, making suciside threats, I'm freaking out again, then he confesses feelings for me(??), okay cool but I'm in a relationship, he cuts his wrists, he took a bottle of pills, he's coughing up blood, I don't know where he is to call an ambulance, and he basically says hell call for help if I send him nudes??? I know its easy to think "wow the fuckbois are evolving" but I don't want to take and chances :( what am I supposed to do?
