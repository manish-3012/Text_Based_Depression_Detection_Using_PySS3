I feel like another attempt is imminent.Iâ€™ve attempted suicide four times in my life. Three of them were this year, which all landed me in hospital. Iâ€™ve been very depressed since an early age but this year has been the worst. 

I donâ€™t exactly have a specific plan, but I havenâ€™t been eating or drinking much for a couple of months and yesterday I decided I would just stop doing both altogether and see what happens. So Iâ€™m on day two of that. (which is actually really nice, eating is drinking is such a chore for me. I feel relaxed and the pain is very mild and bearable since Iâ€™ve had a lot of practice. Most of the pain is from my muscles cramping)

My psychiatric nurse is coming to see me in two days and Iâ€™d like to tell her about everything. I doubt itâ€™ll help but I want to find out, I guess. If Iâ€™m still conscious by then, that is.
