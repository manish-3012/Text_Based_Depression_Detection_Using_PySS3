Knowing that you have wasted your life is a VERY hard pillow to swallowI've been told that time heals. You delulu cunt... it doesn't. 

It's painful when everyone is talking about how many amazing things they did when they were kids or teen and feel that I'm totally out of place because I can't relate. All those amazing things are meant for people like them, not me. I am destined to be crying and die. I feel very inferior knowing that they have so muchsupport and balanced lives with good things while with me everything's a fucking jock. 

Buahhh lolÂº
