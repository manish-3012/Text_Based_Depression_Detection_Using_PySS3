there's honestly nothing left for mei don't know what to do anymore
the only person who really cared about me, my boyfriend spencer, dumped me for no fucking reason
he was the only reason i kept myself going
the only thing i can possibly think of as a reason to live is to see the ending of god of war but that's honestly a really, really pathetic reason

i'm a 17 yo autistic trans kid so it's not like i'm doing the world any favors by existing
