My end is comingI have a lot of bawled up emotions, it feels like I can't even talk to anyone about my problems, I just want to die. I was thinking about taking pills or jumping into an incoming vehicle. I just feel so angry that my life so far is hopeless, I don't think it's gonna be good in the long run. I might just end it all in a few days.
