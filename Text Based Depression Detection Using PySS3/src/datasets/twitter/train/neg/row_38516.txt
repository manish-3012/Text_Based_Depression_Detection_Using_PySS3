Has anyone heard from TrillianDA in the past hour? The user deleted their post/username. I'm hoping s/he is alright :/TRillianDA deleted his/her username and the person's last comment to me was...

&gt;It's my time. Goodbye, Sheila.. and thank you.

I'm hoping this person just deleted their throwaway and then had an epiphany and chose life, but I have a bad feeling about it.

Anyway, I just wanted to say TrillianDA, if you are still out there, and you are reading this, we barely got to talk, but if you still want to, feel free to message me, I'll be checking my mail throughout the day. And if you're no longer with us, I know you can't read this, but I just wanted to say, that I am still thinking about you, and you will be missed :/
