i need to diei'm so scared i have no other choice.

edit: a month ago i went to go vote.. mother and i got into a long argument.. it finally ended with her taking and hiding the modem for a few days... one day she called me up and she was acting like she was going to tell me where she was hiding the modem.. then she ended the call saying that she wasn't going to give it to me.. i got so frustrated that she was so in control of me and that i was feeling helpless that i ran against the wall in my bedroom and I put a huge dent in it.. the bathroom is on the other side of the wall.. now a month later, a part of the hot water heater broke and it was leaking, and they both got fixed, but you can this hear this noise of continuously running water behind the sink.. though you can't see water and i got zapped by a light switch that's by the sink last night... then today they come over to look to see what's going on.. and they say.. it's a probably with electricity maybe... i was waiting for them to finally find the dent... but they didn't... if they do, i'll be in so much trouble.. but will it be my fault when i was in mental anguish? but who will care, believe me, or take me seriously?
