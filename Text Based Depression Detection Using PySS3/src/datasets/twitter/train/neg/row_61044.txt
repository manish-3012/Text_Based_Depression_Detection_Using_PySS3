Please help meno one listens. I dont want to kill myself but if I keep living I will cause more problems. I want to be a good person and I want to help people. I want to make other peoples lives better because I like making people happy but no matter what I do I am a disappointment. why couldnâ€™t I just have been  normal.

I think Iâ€™m going insane. i like to lay in my room for hours and watch the people inside my head. in my mind I was born normal. itâ€™s not perfect because nothing is perfect but Iâ€™m allowed to try. I have people who care about me and donâ€™t try to manipulate. Itâ€™s a place where bad things happen but everyone still helps each other in the end and no one has to feel pain forever. If I die maybe Iâ€™ll be born again in a world like that. but there is also the chance that if I die I will go to hell. this is why Iâ€™m scared to kill myself.

People are telling me so many things and i dont know what to follow. I am a coward. when I try to talk to people I canâ€™t do it. people reach out to me and I push them away and i still want them to come back. why am I talking to my computer anyway? iâ€™m doing the same thing. I want people to come to me just so I can push them away. I hate myself.
