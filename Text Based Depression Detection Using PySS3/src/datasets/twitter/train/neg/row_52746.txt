LonelinessWhat do you do when loneliness has a stranglehold on you?

When you don't have the aptitude for socialization that everyone else takes for granted?

When you come home alone from a party where everyone left paired up?

When confidence and strength of character are insufficient to overcome your social deficiencies?

When the only thing that you're good at keeps you confined to a computer desk, with no regular opportunities for socialization?

When most people that you meet find your true nature and personality abhorrent?

When your friends purposefully avoid you because you make their other friends uncomfortable?

When you have to drive more than 100 miles to see your only living relative?

What do you do?  How do you stop that feeling of suffocation?
