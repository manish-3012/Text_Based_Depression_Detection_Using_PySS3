I have no right.I have no right to suicide, I have so much to be thankful for. A beautiful loving wife, amaxing kids and grandkids.
But these demons are stronger than I am anymore.
I cannot keep fighting like this, it's taking way to much out of me. Out of life. Everything is turning grey.  
I can't tell my family how I feel, they won't handle it well. I cant go to a help center, I'll get fired for mental instability.  What the fuck do I do. Do I want to die.  Fuck no.
These demons just won't stop.  Depression fucking sucks.
So many problems, so much pressure,  so much ...I don't know. 

I love my wife, my kids, my grandkids.  I love you all so very much. I wanted to be there, I really did.
