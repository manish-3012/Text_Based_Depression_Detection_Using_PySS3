Everyone is wrongEveryone says you can be what you want to be. Everyone says if you try hard enough to you get out of the dark. 

IVE TRIED IM DONE TRYING JUST LET ME DIE
I donâ€™t want to live, even if I did itâ€™s too expensive and the world is dying. The only person that will miss me is my mother.
Every time I try I just get another fucking disease or I donâ€™t have the money to do it. Life is so stupid whatâ€™s the point of living if Iâ€™m miserable all the time just let me fucking die.
