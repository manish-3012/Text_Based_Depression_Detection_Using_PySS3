I don't want to end my life, but I need someone to talk to... but I can't talk on the phone.I don't know if this is the best place to ask, but I'm going through so much stress right now that it's taking all of my energy not to end my life. I can't talk on the phone. I can't articulate myself properly. Is there a good chat alternative? All the ones I've tried have a huge wait time, and I'm feeling pretty stressed / desperate.
