I have an IQ of 147 and I'm so very very tired.I'm so exhausted from trying to explain shit to people that can't grasp concepts on the level I need them to in order to understand.  I'm so tired of people feeling stupid around me and resenting me for it.  I'm so bored of the eventual backlash I get for that resentment and the need for other people to prove me wrong so that they can convince themselves that I'm the idiot instead of them.  I'm so very tired of the lies and deceptive nature of everything that we tell each other and ourselves in order to keep on going.  I'm tired of all the social constructs that we've designed and abused in order to keep ourselves busy with the idea that anyone is "winning" anything.  I'm sick of knowing that I will never have a true connection with anyone because of my learned impatience with repetitious small talk and surface level drivel.  I'm so tired of stupid people being in charge and making really poor choices in order to keep themselves in charge and keep everyone else beneath them.  I'm so sick of seeing the system killing the weak and tired while rewarding the rich and dangerous.  I'm tired of knowing the human race will eventually fail.  I'm tired of seeing idiots get rewarded for being assholes to others.  I'm sick of knowing I could be an incredibly successful piece of shit-asshole-sociopath if only I could get over my ideals that I should always act in a manner that if everyone acted the same the world would be perfect.  I'm so tired of looking at the shotgun I bought 3 years ago for the purpose of killing myself.  I'm so tired of typing out this post.
