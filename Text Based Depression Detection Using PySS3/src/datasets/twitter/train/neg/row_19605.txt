Is suicide ever the best moral optionI struggled with addictions several years ago and ruined a lot of my current friendships when they found out about my past. I've never physically hurt anyone but definitely emotionally when I was only thinking about myself and how to get my next "fix". I take full accountability for my actions and I don't blame anyone for leaving me, but I just feel so alone. Rn i have my partner, roommate, and my immediate family- no one else. I come home every day and just wish I could disappear without hurting the few people still close to me. Is a life like this worth living? I just feel like I'm drowning in self-hatred and I don't see a way out of this. I know there are people who would love the thought of me dying and if there was a way I could go out while doing some good I would take the opportunity right away.
