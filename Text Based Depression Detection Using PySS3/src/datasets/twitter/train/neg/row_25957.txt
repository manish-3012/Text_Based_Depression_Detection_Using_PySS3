Poor choices involving school, drugs, and alcoholI've been dealing with anxiety and depression for quite a few years. Since middle school to be exact. I was able to avoid drugs and alcohol all throughout high school, but when I entered college, I stared using cannabis and alcohol several times a week. Of course because of this, my grades suffered. This led to me becoming more depressed, which caused me to use more, which caused my grades to suffer more. This vicious cycle continued on for all of freshman year and first semester of sophomore year.

Unfortunately, the first week of my second semester of sophomore year, I was caught with cannabis and alcohol in my dorm room. Campus police ransacked my room, confiscated everything, and charged me with misdemeanor possession of marijuana and alcohol. Now, I'm facing several court dates, community service, hundreds if not thousands of dollars in fines, and possibly expulsion from the university. Not only that, but if and when my parents find out, there's no way they're going to keep paying for my education or support me financially at all. 

I know many of you will think that all I have to do is complete all the things asked of me from my school and the law and to stop using, but it's more than I can handle. I'm already flunking out due to my poor choices, and now I'm going to have community service and drug education classes piled on. Also, the added weight of all the people I've let down and hurt is just too much. I physically and emotionally cannot handle the guilt and shame I've brought onto myself. I've completely ruined my life and I guess now I'll have to pay the price. I can't believe it's come to this...

There are plenty of tall buildings on campus. I guess all I have to do is pick one.
