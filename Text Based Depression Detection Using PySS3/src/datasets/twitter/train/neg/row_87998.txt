im trying to find the perfect date to kill myself.im sorry this post wont be formal, i really dont care at this point. theres not much to know about me other than the fact ive been depressed for 2 years. im 17. thats about all that matters. im a disappointment to my family, my friends have all fucked me over, the boy i love will find someone better, etc.

i want to kill myself this month. the 27th to be exact. the only thing preventing me from doing it is that my littlest brother has been really excited to buy a halloween costume. i dont want to ruin that shit for him with my fucking death. so i want to reschedule. i was thinking november, but my dad wants to see his mother (shes from another country) before she passes. and if i kill myself he wouldnt want to go. do you see my fucking issue? if i had the choice, id be gone by today. despite being suicidal, im still a fucking people-pleaser. I live my life trying to make everyone happy and i never get that in return. im literally RESCHEDULING MY SUICIDE so other people, who dont even care about my happiness, can be happy.

i just hope the perfect day comes soon. i want to fucking die already. im sick of living this horrible life.
