Healthcare got denied, any more options for someone out of options?I was hoping that healthcare would get approved so that I could get on antidepressants and seek out a psychiatrist - and of course it got denied. I guess my best bet is to try getting back home and applying for whatever Florida healthcare there is when  I can but I dont know if I can make it much longer, everyday is getting worse than the last. Does anyone have any ideas? Or does anyone at least know how much it would be for antidepressants without healthcare? I don't have much money but this is my last hope.
