Advice wantedI ingested like 600 mg oxybutynin on 12/9 at 3:00 AM, right now itâ€™s 12/11 1:00 PM. Immediately prior to ingesting the tablets I drank a bottle of beer, and the evening before I had two bottles of beer and some wine. A few questions

Does it really count as a suicide attempt if there was no chance of me dying? If I tried to overdose on milk would that count? Iâ€™m fairly certain you canâ€™t die from oxybutynin, it said â€œdonâ€™t mix with alcoholâ€ so I did but I just ended up hallucinating and stumbling around like an idiot

Also, what should I do? I donâ€™t really want to call poison control. The hallucinations and memory problems are gone but itâ€™s still hard to focus my vision and I have some coordination problems.

Above all though Iâ€™m happy to be alive
