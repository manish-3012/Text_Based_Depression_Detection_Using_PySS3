I don't know how I could do it, but I've written the noteI wrote to my friends (those that I might still have), and previous friends, my dad, my mom. I haven't planned it yet, I'm not sure I'm even capable of it, but I wrote my note anyways. I'm not going to share all of it, but I feel like sharing the bit to my mother.

*To my mom. I'm sorry, I'm just sorry. I can't live on this planet any longer. All I feel is pain, there is no happyness for me. I have nothing to live for, and no desire to find something to live for either. There is no objective meaning to life other than that which we create ourselves, but I have no desire to create it, and no strength to execute any plans I could make out anyways. I can't keep going on like this.*

*What I do is not because you didn't love me, its despite the fact you love me. Unfortunately I'm incapable of feeling happyness anylonger, beause nothing can bring me happyness, nothing can bring me hope, nothing can bring me meaning, or purpose. And when you remvoe these things and all that is left is pain, it becomes a rather one sided decision. My death is a reprieve from the pain and suffereing that I have and would have endured otherwise. I can't live the path of least resistance, it hurts to many people, and I do not have the strength to do anything more.*

I'm just tired. I'm tired of fighting.
