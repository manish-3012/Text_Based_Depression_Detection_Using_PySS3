Valentines day today.33 years of loneliness, 33 years alive. 

Porn, porn, porn, that's it, I wanted to lose virginity by paying, but the idea of doing it like some sort of machine disgusts me, the fact that some vaginas have a milage so big, they could literally circle the earth couple times is another thing. In general I have very negative approach to sex, since if not sex I wouldn't be alive, even though "you were planned", but nothing else was when it comes to my birth, and life, "we'll figure something out" didn't work.

I'll never bang anyone attractive, unless I pay, I'm unable to form any relation with other people, I'm unsuitable for relationship. 

Forever alone.

Happy jerking off to porn on valentines day, it's my daily routine anyway.
