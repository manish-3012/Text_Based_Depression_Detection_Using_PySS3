I think I'm done.For about a year, I've been trying to find a reason to not go through with it. But I haven't. I feel alienated from everyone around me. I have no motivation or inspiration to do anything anymore. There's nothing I want to do and have no passion for anything. I got a brother I hate since he's a racist and has always made me feel alone. I don't really have much going for me, so why carry this weight?
