I can remember considering and talking about suicide, but not whyFirst of all, if this is the wrong sub to ask this; please feel free to remove the post, but it would've been nice with a PM from a human mod if so.

And as the title states I can remember considering and talking about suicide to some of my childhood friends when I was between 10-13, but I can't remember why because my memory of the past is really blurry. I can think of a few things on the top of my head (ex. my alcoholic, manipulating dad), but it kind of "annoys" me that I can't pinpoint an exact reason.

Is this common? 

And as I'm typing this I realize that I really have to go visit a psychologist. I have never been to one. I'm 25 now, so I guess it's time to get some help to process my past...
