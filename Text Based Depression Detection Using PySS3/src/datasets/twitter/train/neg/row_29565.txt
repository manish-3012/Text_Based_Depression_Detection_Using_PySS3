I Just Want To Be DeadI'm just tired of this life. I'm a disappointment to my parents especially my mom she yells at me, calls me stupid and how much she regrets having me. I know I suffer from depression and literally can't get therapy from where I am located but enough is enough. Why should my life be in pain? I never asked to be alive at all. I never asked to be born. My life has been full of mystery since I stepped into this earth. I'm tired of crying and being hurt. Whoever lied saying that what can't kill you makes you stronger is a liar. I'm breaking down little by little.  I understand that I'm the only child and she is aging so she's on the edge about everything. My dad messed up his finances and I have mental health problems. I just want to die. I just want to obey the universe's order since it wants me gone. I hate myself,  I hate my life, I hate everything
