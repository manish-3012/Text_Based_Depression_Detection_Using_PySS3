This fucking loopThis school year will be my last from the beginning it was easy no problem or trouble then it got harder I started to panic getting worse mark which makes me more depressed and stressed getting worse marks and repeat which makes me get even worse marks.last month was my online finals it was very bad I cheated and did a lot of this that would increase my grade but I am a Muslim and in Islam if u got something without effort and cheated and took shortcut and it happened before I am afraid god will get me a bad grades but in the end. I cheat and did a lot of shady shit but god will never let anyone take more than he have done I am so worried
