Iâ€™ve been suicidal for the first time in my life over these past few months and Iâ€™m scared. I want it to stopIâ€™m 22 and I have been on a 4 year â€œjourneyâ€ with my therapist in finding out that I was actually verbally/emotionally abused VERY regularly by my mother growing up. Sheâ€™s still overbearing to this day. Iâ€™m still in the mourning phase: I cry all the time. I feel so sad for myself as a child. She isolated me from my family so i canâ€™t talk to any of them. 

I have a boyfriend that Iâ€™ve been dating for over a year but Iâ€™m not the same person I was when we met. Iâ€™m mourning that too. A good bit of trauma has happened to me over the course of my life and I havenâ€™t dealt with any of it because I donâ€™t know how to process my emotions. Iâ€™m very defensive and think everyone hates me. My boyfriend FOR SURE is getting real sick of me. I was supposed to be on new medication but my insurance sucks. All my friends left because they donâ€™t want to deal with me anymore. 

I have NOBODY to talk to... ive tried posting on some subreddits here (this isnâ€™t my main account) but it didnâ€™t really work. Iâ€™m so tired and angry and sad and anxious all the time... this isnâ€™t living. 

These past 5 months have genuinely been the WORST time of my entire 22 years of living but people just think Iâ€™m just being dramatic when I say that. I was supposed to graduate university in May, I didnâ€™t. I lost my internship because I had a panic attack in the office. My family is pressuring me hard to get another office job but I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t go 4 hours without having something trigger me into a crying fit that usually lasts HOURS. 

Iâ€™m too broke to go to therapy more often than once a week. I feel the same every morning when I wake up all the way until I go to bed that night. 

I canâ€™t just get over it. I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t. Please just stop telling me that.
