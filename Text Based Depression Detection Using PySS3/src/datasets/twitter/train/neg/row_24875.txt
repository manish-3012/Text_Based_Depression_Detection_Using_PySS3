i really think iâ€™m gonna do itiâ€™m always exhausted. i am a tormented soul, my days feel numbered. iâ€™m not cut out for this world, for this society. my closest people turn their backs on me. i canâ€™t do this without help, i just canâ€™t. iâ€™m going to end it to end my pain. i donâ€™t want to transfer my pain but iâ€™m tired of being in anguish.
