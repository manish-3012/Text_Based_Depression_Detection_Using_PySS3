â€œIâ€™m trapped in a vile world, where the endgame is the same as every other; weâ€™re only here to die...â€Iâ€™m posting this on my main account because Iâ€™ve lost all will to hide how truly unhappy I am from everyone I know. Itâ€™s exhausting to wake up every new day and put on a false facade, to act like Iâ€™m perfectly fine and that everything is fine.


Iâ€™m not *fine*. Iâ€™m not *okay*. Iâ€™m fucking miserable. I am so miserable, I want to claw my eyes out with my bare hands and scream until my throat goes hoarse and gives out. I want to punch a wall until my knuckles are obliterated, perhaps then I would actually feel something. 


I donâ€™t feel anything but anger, anxiety, sadness, and exhaustion. Unending anger at the life Iâ€™ve been given, what Iâ€™ve had to endure, and the way Iâ€™ve been treated by people and their mindless games. The anxiety is *relentless*, I shake inside more than I fucking breathe, a cold shivering that never ends. Sadness for the waste of a life I am, my dreams Iâ€™ll never achieve, and the fact that one day everyone I love and cherish will probably have to wake up to the news that I killed myself. 


But I just canâ€™t take this anymore. Itâ€™s like being at sub zero at the bottom of the ocean; light canâ€™t penetrate the darkness below. Every day is the same, yesterday was the same as today and tomorrow will be the same as today, thereâ€™s no end to this fucking cruel, vicious cycle. Itâ€™s just beating into my soul, the glass cracks just a bit more every day. 


Iâ€™m undesirable. Iâ€™ve had several hook ups just for validation, just to feel desired in the moment. I donâ€™t want sex or a relationship, I just want to feel like someone actually desires me for *me*. Someone who would be there for me, someone who actually cares about me and would hold me in their arms. Someone to save me. But if I canâ€™t love myself, who else can love me?


Iâ€™m too damaged to ever crawl out of this dark. A broken husk of my former self, but I donâ€™t even know who I was, everything has been twisted and distorted past distinguishing anything. Thereâ€™s nothing left but empty aspirations and dreams, compassion and kindness for anyone but me; I donâ€™t deserve that much. All I deserve is a bullet to the brain, something to put me out of my misery. 


I still ponder why my friends stick around and why my family puts up with me; Who the fuck am I? What have I accomplished? What do I bring to the table? Iâ€™m nothing, Iâ€™ve come from nothing and Iâ€™ll be nothing for the rest of my fucked up life. Why does anyone give a fuck about me, Iâ€™m a fucking depressed piece of shit loser whose no one. 


It says something when I have to come *here* to vent, to a bunch of strangers on the internet. Despite how quiet and shy I am, I do have a voice; I have words I want to let out, but no one wants to listen. No one understands just how fucking miserable I am, no matter how much I try to put it into perspective. â€œYou need to get out more, Life has just begun, Things get better, You just need to hold on, You just need to push yourself, Youâ€™re too young to be depressed, You need to do this and that, etc.â€


Iâ€™M UNHAPPY, Iâ€™M TIRED OF CRAWLING IN MY SKIN FOR EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY, Iâ€™M TIRED OF LIVING LIFE FOR OTHERS AND NOT FOR MYSELF, Iâ€™M TIRED OF FUCKING LIVING LIKE THIS, WHY WONâ€™T YOU JUST LISTEN TO ME AND BE THERE FOR ME INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING WHAT YOU THINK WILL HELP ME? WHY WONâ€™T ANYONE SAVE ME OR LET ME SET MYSELF FREE? WHY CANâ€™T I CRY OR RELEASE ALL OF THIS, WHY DOES IT HAVE TO FESTER AND ROT INSIDE ME? WHY IS MY LIFE LIKE THIS, WHY AM I LIKE THIS, WHY CANâ€™T I JUST FUCKING BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE? WHY? 


Fuck me.
