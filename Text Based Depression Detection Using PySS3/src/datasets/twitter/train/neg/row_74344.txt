22years old and $20k in debt with no hopeTitle gets it across pretty well. I'm at work right now 4th day no sleep so it'll be a short post. Also sorry im on mobile. 
So basically step dad died 3 years ago step brother took everything and sold mine and my mom's home to us because step grandma let him(it's a long story and I can't remember it well enough this tired) for $15000. It's a mobile home worth maybe $10k plus it's in really bad shape so maybe even $8k. My friend loaned me the money and I havent been able to pay him back more than $500 in about 3 years. Had to max out 2 credit cards to barely be able to keep up with rent and my moms medical expenses. Shes crippled physically and mentally and no one else in the family wants to handle her so I'm stuck doing it as her kid. I work 2 jobs and my bank account is still overdrawn by over $200 every month. I've asked for promotions and been turned down looked for better jobs but I havent been able to even go to college to learn a trade or anything so most of the better jobs are locked out to me. I've tried my best and it's not working. Honestly I fight to keep all of my friends happy I talk to the depressed ones constantly so they are never alone and try to always be there for the others but I know in my gut at the end I'll be dead long before all of us are supposed to be. I dunno if I'm just venting but I dont know how to ask for help so i guess this is my shot in the dark. Thanks for reading idk what I'm doing.
