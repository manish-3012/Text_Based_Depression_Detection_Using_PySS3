Having another episode after things went south.Im not sure if i am just using or acting as if i have an anxiety or depression a way so she would talk to me again  since weâ€™re not okay, she doesnâ€™t want to talk to me. Sheâ€™s one of the reason why i am still trying to get through and she makes everything better wherein pain doesnâ€™t really goes away, it just gets easier to carry whenever sheâ€™s around. I even didnâ€™t know that i was already suicidal before, not until i opened up and it was the first time that i told someone about it because it felt comfortable telling it to her. 

I wanna talk to her so bad but I donâ€™t want to bother her or to tell her what i am going through right now, she might want to talk to me again but i canâ€™t think of any reason other than out of pity and i donâ€™t like the thought of it. I donâ€™t want to draw any attention to my friends and i am really good in hiding what i feel. I can make them happy, comfort them, fix their problems whilst I cannot do it for myself. 

Now i feel like just ending it by driving somewhere where thereâ€™s no other people or that i can harm and hit off a tree. Its sucks to have this feeling itâ€™s not just about her but various reasons from my past that i cannot explain with my own words. I cannot see the point or purpose of life. I tried ending it last night, but sadly I still woke up and ending up writing this.
