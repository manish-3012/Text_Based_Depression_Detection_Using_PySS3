No matter how hard I work on something, itâ€™ll never have any value, just like my existence! :DItâ€™s stupid. As the big sis, I should be the one being looked up to. I shouldnâ€™t be a fucking shut-in while the younger ones are out there performing or getting high grades. I want be out there, supporting them instead of feeling jealous and inferior. The one thing Iâ€™m good at doesnâ€™t even impress anyone, not even my family. I fucking know the compliments they give me are fake. Any form of reassurance or advice I give is always ignored but when someone else says the same thing, suddenly their word is absolute?

I try to be a good big sis despite the fact I have a strong urge to ram a knife into my arm every second. I try to be a good friend even though my good for nothing brain is constantly screeching at me that Iâ€™m never gonna be good enough and everyone hates me.

Will getting a university degree finally make me good enough (even though art or design degrees are almost useless and being successful in that industry is near-impossible)? Will getting a boyfriend (as many fucking ask and I have nothing to say because Iâ€™m a fucking abomination) make me seem approachable? Will grinning 24/7 get me a better response than an awkward smile or silence when I try to socialise?

Maybe they can smell my bitterness and self-loathing from a mile away, who knows. Itâ€™s not like thinking about it or doing anything will change. Every time I try to be happier or step outside my comfort zone to improve myself, the fucking universe just kicks me back to square one.

Conveniently enough, I live near a train station.
