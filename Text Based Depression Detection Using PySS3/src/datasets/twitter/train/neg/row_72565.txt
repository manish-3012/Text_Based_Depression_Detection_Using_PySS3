What is the point of lifeI dont even know why I'm alive. what is the point of me being here, alive?? I'm no one. nobody. below average in all aspects of life. 

so it doesn't matter if i kill myself tomorrow. i just want to tie a noose around my neck, step off a stool, helplessly choke and then just die. peace. darkness. i wont exist. i wont be anything. 

which is great. being nothing is so much better than almost being 18, and an ugly person inside and out.

i dont know why im posting this. thanks for reading
