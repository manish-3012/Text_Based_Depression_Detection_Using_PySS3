It's impossible to defeat itJust wanna die.

Been on psycho and anti depressant meds for 5 years.

Having a wife and a new baby only makes it worse.

I thought that when I have my kid I would find the will to live. Nope... didn't change anything.

Got a mortgage and a car and a wife and a baby I can barely afford.

No money. Can't do anything nice. No trips on holidays.

Even bought courses to learn to make games. Barely touched them. No motivation or energy.

All I wanna do is tie a belt round my neck and hang off a doorknob in my garage.

I really hate my mind and my illness. I find it so hard to just walk and live everyday like everyone else.
