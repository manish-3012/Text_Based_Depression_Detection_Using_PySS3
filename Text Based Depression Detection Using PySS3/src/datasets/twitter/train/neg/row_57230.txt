Barely Holding OnJust getting through the day today was a struggle, and I really don't know what I am even doing anymore. I wish I could undo so many choices in my life, so many things said and done, but it all lead to this place where I can never undo the damage I did to myself from being an idiot for so long. I just wish that I would never wake up one day, I exhausted myself to sleep every night to try and avoid the nightmares, but every night they still come, and every morning I am just a bit more worn out.

All the old buffers and security I built just has been worn down, so the point now that just about anything drags me down into pure misery again. It cannot be normal that I want to kill myself over every little thing in my life, where even strangers being passive aggressive is enough to send my mind straight back to ending my life. My tank is on empty, and there is no changes or end to that in sight. I just need a way out, but I cannot get it without hurting so many others. I just don't know how much longer that will even mean anything to me, given that all other drives have been exhausted.

I don't know... I am rambling again. I just wish I knew a way out of my misery, that didn't hurt others from me hurting myself. I just wish I could stop caring, about them, and about everything. I know I don't care about myself, and haven't for a very long time.
