This is goodbye.After me and my wife lost our baby dye to a miscarry, my life went completely down hill. I manage to ruin the best things in my life over and over and over again. 
I don't feel emotions anymore. 
No, I'm not sad. Im not depressed. I'm not worried or tired of what my life has become. 

I just exist. But with my existence, it brings pain and disappointment, along with suffering and questionability of who you are just because of who I am. 

So if you're wondering what this post is about. It's about my last 5mins of life. Sitting alone in a dark empty apartment where no one knows where I am. 
The 4 people I have in my life,  they will be upset I'm sure. But in the grand scheme of things? 
You are all better off. 
Well my phones at 3% and I have a flight to catch. 

Hailee, if you ever see this. You're perfect


Take care everyone. Until next time.
