I Think im going to overdose?Im just feeling so empty inside, and i just want to get f..ed up. Im tired of walking this earth, im worth NOTHING! .... Im a self harmer and depressed for over 5 years (im 19 now) Talking doesnt help going outside doesnt help and i refuse anti depressants because i deserve to suffer... 

Sorry back to my real question, Just so i can forget about my life for a bit... Running away from my problems like the coward i am. What would happen if i took about 50 mg of benzos (diazepam) im not asking if i should do it, no matter what u guys say my mind is made up. Just wondering will i die, just fall asleep, trip balls, or something else? Thanks for ur time!
