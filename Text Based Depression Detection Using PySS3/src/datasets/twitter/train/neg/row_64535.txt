Shitty parents, feeling lost and lonely, not sure if staying around is worth it.
Hereâ€™s the shitty situation. My dad upâ€™d and left when I was 10, he was an alcoholic. He came back years later only to treat me like a kid even though Iâ€™m 20, calls me his baby and doesnâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m studying at university, etc. At age 16 my mum remarried and the fuckwit of a stepfather ended up becoming verbally, and then physically abusive before she finally kicked him out. Months before she did kick him out I mentioned to her I didnâ€™t like him heâ€™s abusive yada yada, she said he wasnâ€™t that bad, look where they ended up now. 
Around that time at 17 I was going through so problems, anxiety depression that kind of thing. A lot of my friends started to leave school because of apprenticeships. When I was 18 my mum found another boyfriend and I remember I had a friend over once and we heard them fucking. I heard the friend laughing  as I was in the room next to where he was sleeping. obviously I wasnâ€™t comfortable in inviting anyone else over after that point. It wasnâ€™t the first or last time, I could be on the couch, all the way in my room or going to brush my teeth and hear them doing it. I think itâ€™s selfish but idk, they were very loud and mustâ€™ve heard them about a dozen or so times now. 
One time my father stumbled into the house, unannounced, loud and drunk at 10pm at night. Imagine if I had a girl or friend over?!
At age 19 I attempted suicide, Iâ€™ve got another 2 years at uni and I canâ€™t move out because I donâ€™t have the money. So, 2 years, no friends, no love life, nothing. Just stuck at home (especially with COVID and how everything is online). I think I might kill myself instead I donâ€™t know if I can last that long and even then, if I finish and do move out, Iâ€™m all alone. Im also heart broken, I had this girl who liked me, I wasnâ€™t interest at the time. We used to talk but months goes by and I realised what I had done, I shouldâ€™ve loved her, god forbidden Iâ€™m such a fucking idiot, one of the worst feelings in the world. Woe is me, what the fuck should I do people of reddit :(
