I have a planI clean up my apartment. I put my clothes and valuables in totes and take them to the closest donation site. I throw everything else in the dumpster. I hop in an uber and go as far as the money in my bank account can handle. I call out of work with a "stomach ache" and apologize for the trouble. I walk until I can't walk anymore... then, through a mixture of opiates, sleeping pills, and, if necessary, a noose, I'm good.

I keep playing it over and over and over again in my head and its so fucking painful. My skin burns with the thought of it. I'm so tired...
