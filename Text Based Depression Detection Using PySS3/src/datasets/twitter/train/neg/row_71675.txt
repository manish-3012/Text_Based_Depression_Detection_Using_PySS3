ER CRISIS worker told me Iâ€™m a waste of time and I should never come backI told her I was suicidal and that I was gonna kill myself, I had a plan and everything, and she word-for-word said, â€œWell, while coming to the ER was technically the right thing to do, youâ€™re really just wasting our time here, and youâ€™d be better off never coming back. You  canâ€™t just use the ER as a safe space, you know?â€

I want to cry that made me more suicidal than I was when I went in what the fuck. If I go home iâ€™m gonna kill myself idk what to do, since she wonâ€™t take me seriously
