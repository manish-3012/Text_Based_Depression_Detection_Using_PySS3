No real details here, just finally giving upLove is a beautiful lie I'd like to believe and happiness is a wonderful illusion I'd like to embrace.

But because I believed in such a disgusting lie I have lost everything I thought I would never have. Now I can't go back to living without it.
Because I embraced such a ludicrous illusion I can barely go 5 minutes without wondering why I have to be alive.

It's not the only lie or the only illusion though, everything is.

I want to die, I silently scream and beg from the moment I wake until the moment I finally find sleep.

My nightmares are sweet dreams and waking is the true nightmare.

No one will let me die without feelings of guilt and now it's just festered to bitterness. If I can't die, then how about all of you die and take away my guilt with yourselves.

I hate everything. I would take down the world in flames and screams with me, but I have no power.

My life isn't even my own in this world.

If I try and I fail I'll be delivered to and even worse hell. I'm not privileged enough to live in a country where I can just buy a gun. An overdose might fail and I have nowhere to hang myself or anything to throw myself into the way of.

I'm trapped in this cage called life.

Please I just want to free...

Please...

This pain no one can hear or see is unbearable...

I can't take anymore...

Please...
