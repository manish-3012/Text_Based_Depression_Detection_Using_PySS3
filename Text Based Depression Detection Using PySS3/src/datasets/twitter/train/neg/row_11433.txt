I need help. Please... 19 and scaredI've been suicidal for about 5 years. I had a brief period of 'normal life.' I was on antidepressants, school was going well, and I got married. Everything has fallen apart. I'm so alone. I became addicted to IV drugs, and now my husband is in jail because he is too. 

My mom berated me last night about how terrible I've become.  

Twice in the last two days, I've taken a lot of drugs, not caring if I'd ever wake up or not.
