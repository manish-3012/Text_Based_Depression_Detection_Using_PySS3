Can you blame me for feeling this way after what happened to me? Nobody cares.Aged 10 my older sister moved away.

Aged 11 my mother's emotional abuse began. She dragged me by my hair, smacked me in the face, and picked me up by my hair.

Aged 12 my father was brutally murdered.

Aged 13 I watched somebody die. Held them as they died

Aged 13 my boyfriend sexually assaulted me. Forced himself. I still dream about the bleeding.

Aged 15 I was kicked out of my home.


Nobody cares. I was diagnosed at 17 with borderline personality disorder. I escaped with sexting, drinking, drugs, fast food, self harm.

Can you blame me for wanting to die. I've got nothing. Im too ill to even get out of bed. Nevermind work. I get up every morning at 6. Get my boyfriend up. Take some pills and go to bed again.

Nobody cares
