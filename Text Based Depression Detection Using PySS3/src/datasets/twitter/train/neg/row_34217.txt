I hate everything i doI hate everything, my studies, my everything, i am living in Egypt, studying Actuarial Science at Cairo University.

I hate actuarial science, i do not want to study it, in my third year, but my family won't let me change majors, i wanted to study philosophy, but i am poor to enroll in the AUC.

I am visiting a psychologist, i was told to visit a psychiatrist to take medications, i do not even have money to go to a psychiatrist, my family WILL NOT approve even me going to either psychologist nor psychiatrist, i am visiting the psychologist behind their back.

I am not even sure, i feel suicidal every day, yesterday, i played with the knife the skin of my hand, felt very good.

Can anyone here help me? i do not know what to do, not even sure if i can request for money to be able to continue my medications, i am not sure how long i'll live, the doctor is worried about me and she called my friend who will be sticking with me even more, but i just don't know, is there some place i can request some donations from? a $100 can literally fund my medications of the psychiatrist AND psychologist.

I am typing horribly, i am not even sure if i want to continue living in my country, yet, i can not leave it.
This post sucks.
