I don't want to die. But I don't want to live. My experience says to add trigger warnings. Medication and amounts mentioned. Sorry.400mg sertraline, 4000mg omeprazole, 200mg codeine phosphate, 3000mg pregabalin. 
I have more but this is the majority,
What will this do to me? Will it end it?
I just want everything to be done.
