Okay I think I'm going to kill myself because I feel like I was born on the wrong planet.I was just thinking, I really don't think I should be here. Even if I wasn't _literally_ born on the wrong planet, people don't like people like me. I'm sort of just set up to fail, I can't function in a world like this, and why should I deal with that? Why should I be forced to feel unhappy just because I got unlucky? Is life so unfair that even when you find a solution you're not allowed to use it because everyone else says "No"? It would be less of a pain for myself, for others, for everyone. I wish I didn't have to die, I wish I could just stop existing, like I was never here to begin with. But at this point I'm okay with that too. And I can't think about anything that I'd miss either. It's an escape. Forever. I'm tired.

And speaking of escape, earlier this morning I was thinking that every time I've ever been happy it's because I'm _not_ in this world. I'm somewhere else. My own world. Places nobody likes or wants me to be in. Places where I don't have to pay attention to the world, where no matter how I'm feeling it's always a billion times better than this fuckery. Imagine living your whole life feeling like you shouldn't be here, and every time you try to go where you feel better you're shamed or punished for it.

The only reason why I'd ever consider not killing myself is because I won't get to be in my world anymore. I'll be dead. But I don't care if that means I get to leave this awful one. I don't care if it means that nobody will criticize me for just being me, or telling me somethings wrong with me, that I'm broken, without ever even listening to me. Nobody hears me. When I'm dead I won't be happy, but I won't be sad either. I'm perfectly okay with just being and feeling nothing. I truly cannot think of a reason to not kill myself.


I think I might try tonight, I'm not sure how it will go. I'm so tired. Goodbye for now I guess.
