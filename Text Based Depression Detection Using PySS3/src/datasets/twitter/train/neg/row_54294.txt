why does every therapy session leave me feeling suicidalwhy does hurting make me suicidal. anything. anger, embarrassment, sadness, fear, anxiety. i feel like i should be stronger than this but it's like a reflex i can't control. why was i cursed to be this way? why do the people in my life a blindingly bright sense of self-confidence like they've never been suicidal in their life? like they couldn't understand my pain? why am i made to be so spineless? why was i born so weak and feeble? why is it so hard to understand that i'm hurting? it's not a hard thing to grasp. i don't want to be pitied, i just want to be understood. but i don't even get that curtesy. i guess it's a privilege to be understood.
