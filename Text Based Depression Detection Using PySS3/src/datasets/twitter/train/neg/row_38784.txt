Question about psychologists.This must sound a bit silly. How is that relationship supposed to work?

I've had over 6 in the past well, 6 years. I don't even remember most of their names. I haven't had one in over a year and a half. I don't remember much about my first one but that my parents set us up and I lied out of my ass because I was paranoid and kept it going for an entire year before I dropped her, faking a recovery.

Generally it goes and I call the place up, schedule an intake appointment, overload the therapist with information because I become so nervous and leave paranoid. I attend a few more times and then stop going. OR they try to medicate me and I suspect they're trying to control me and I sabotage the relationship. How can I fix this? I think I'm doing something wrong but no matter what ideas I have to try with a new one, I end up freaking out and making everything worse. I've been in a gradual downward spiral so the sooner I get help, the better. I'd rather get help. Honestly, I'm surprised I haven't given up yet.
