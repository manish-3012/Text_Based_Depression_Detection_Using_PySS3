I'm sorry.Im sorry to everyone reading this. I'm sorry dad. I'm sorry Ted. I'm sorry, even to you, mom. I love you, Amy. I don't know if you'll miss me at all. 

I plan on doing it tonight, in 1 hour. It makes me happy knowing that everyone I know is better off without me. I'm sorry. The pain is too much. I love you, Amy.
