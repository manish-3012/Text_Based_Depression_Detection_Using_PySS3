I'm losing myself to something that's trivial. Please help.Hello. I'm looking for some advice regarding a problem which I think is a cause of something that is wrong with me. I know I am being selfish and I wouldn't have asked anyone this but I seem to not be able to stop thinking about this.

My family is from Sri Lanka and I was born in Siberia. We moved to the Uk about 10 years ago (I'm 19 now). I don't have much family here at all; only my parents, siblings and some distant cousins. Most are in Sri Lanka. The last time I was there was about 4 months ago (Stayed for 1 month). Before that I was there about 6 years prior. 

I enjoyed it the first time but this time not at all for some reason. The people there were amazing and I got on with almost every one (apart from 1 or two people). Everybody was really nice to me but now I don't understand myself. 

After I got back, I started University and moved to another city. For some odd and baffling cause I don't wish to talk to any of my family back in Sri Lanka and have deleted Whatsapp, Messenger and Viber as a result. The thought of going back, even for only two weeks, makes me feel really really stressed. At the smallest mention of the place, I start getting a faster heartbeat and sweating. My parents don't know I feel like this (we've never discussed mental feelings and I had to deal with problems by myself generally) but I don't know how long it is until they find out. I can't just say no directly as that will hurt them a lot.

This has got so bad that I am feeling suicidal. I know; a very very bad feeling to have to something that seems not a problem at all.I took 10 paracetamol before, on two occasions in September, with a lot of tummy pain but immediately felt bad about this. 

I'm in a dissaray and don't know what to do. I feel like taking the pills again at least once every week. Please help. I don't know why I'm feeling like this.
