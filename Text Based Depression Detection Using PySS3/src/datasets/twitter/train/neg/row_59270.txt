Hi everyone! I want to help, what would be the best way?I want to fix this. I understand the mental health community isnâ€™t helping people and the hotlines arenâ€™t very good. What ideas do you guys have that might help?

So for example. What if I started an Airbnb type facility in a major city exclusives for people going through a hard time? Do you guys think a place to feel safe and loved and part of a family would help? I donâ€™t know but I want to do something. If I have to start dressing up as Batman and beating the people who hurt you lol 

The mental health community needs change.
