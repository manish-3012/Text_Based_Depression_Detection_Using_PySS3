hi , im unsure about lifeFor the past few months i've been terribly ' stuck '. I've been in a 
non-stopping rotation of negative feelings. I feel like shit at one point , feel angry the next , briefly ' happy ' and then shit again.

My relationship with my dad has never been good. never had a conversation last for more than two minutes before a fight broke out. he always preferred my siblings over me. im the youngest , unsuccessful unmotivated one. hes always hypocritical , always lying in order to prove his point against me. to a point where i break.   " have u tried talking to ur dad ?!?!??!!! " . yes , nothing can happen.

im   ~~hopelessly~~ obsessively in love with someone who will never love me back. I talk to him everyday. I wouldnt say we're close but we still talk everyday regardless. For the times we do talk im happy , but when he says a single negative thing about me I break , leaving me in a spiral of feelings wanting him to love me.

anyway , im broken , im in this spiral and the only way for me to get out is to leave. i'm stuck. getting rid of my self would be the only answer. but im afraid. i think of thousands of ways to do it when im alone but when i talk to him im in this ' what if ' zone and i think he could finally love me leaving me strength to stay.

im not sure if anything i said made any sense ,
sorry
