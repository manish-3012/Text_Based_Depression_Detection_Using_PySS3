iâ€™m really on the edge, because of what bullshit sheâ€™s saying and how much she doesnâ€™t know or understand. that i have major problems with telling her why iâ€™m the way i am. itâ€™s like sheâ€™s playing victim, but i would get the blame for saying that.iâ€™m sorry for the vent haha,

i donâ€™t want to end it all just because of this person doing this thing. that would be a bit, bit, bit senseless. but itâ€™s pushing me closer to ending everything right now, and i was already close to my method.

she makes me feel miserable.

she says things to other people online about me, that isnâ€™t true, or is incorrect, or she makes herself look like the one whoâ€™s going through it and that sheâ€™s the victim and iâ€™m the one whoâ€™s in the wrong and needs to sort myself out.

the people sheâ€™s telling this to, know nothing about what sheâ€™s making the deal about, or who i am at all, which makes it very, very one sided. they only know from her point of view. and iâ€™m unable to share mine to these people, or to her, because she somehow makes it too hard for me.

she isnâ€™t realising that i have problems, too.

iâ€™m so close to doing something dangerous. iâ€™m not there, but iâ€™m almost. maybe i just need somebody to tell me â€œhey, it isnâ€™t going to be like this forever.â€œ and donâ€™t worry, because i just did it for myself, haha.

i want stability.
