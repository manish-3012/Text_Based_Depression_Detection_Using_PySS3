Its hard to look forward to life because I feel like I'll kill myself when I'm olderFirst time posting in this sub, sorry if it's not appropriate. 

I've felt for a long time that I'll probably kill myself after my parents die. I think many people who commit have the thought process "they'll be better off without me"  but I know that's not true. It would crush the people around me, especially my parents.

This mind set has really made me afraid of getting into a serious relationship and having kids one day. And how the hell am I supposed to express to a potential partner "don't anticipate a future with me unless you're prepared to find me dead one day"

I'd like to think a family would fulfil me and negate these suicidal thoughts.. but the fear of being a suicidal mother one day is really getting to me.
