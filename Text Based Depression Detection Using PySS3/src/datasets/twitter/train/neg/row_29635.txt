I haven't felt like cutting in a minuteBut I do now. I hate how reliant it is on how other people see me. Its pathetic. I really do wish humans weren't social creatures so I could just properly isolate myself. I don't want to deal with people anymore. Or myself. Especially myself. I thought I was making good progress and it just came crashing down on me again. So what's the point in even trying if it always comes crashing down, honestly? Fuck all that shit.
