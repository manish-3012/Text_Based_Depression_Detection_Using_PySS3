ok heres my storyill try to keep it brief here. The jist of it is that i don't really feel the need to live anymore. its been 8 days since i split with my girlfriend of 6 years. it was totally my fault what happened and i feel like the biggest shit to ever walk the planet right now. Im 25.

so in maybe october time a friend of mines girlfriend called AL was having a 21st birthday party. i went but my girlfriend was busy with a concert that night i think. i was drunk and ended up sleeping with the girls 55 year old mother. it didnt stop there. this continued for months. im young and stupid and she had NO boundries. its safe to say i had fun. fast forward to 3 weeks ago my friend splits with AL. now this girl mayb one of the hottest girls ive ever seen but has the attitude of the devil himself. shes selfish, self centered and has to absoutlly be the centre of attention all the fucking time. me being the scumbag that i am decide to start messaging each other alot!! we arrange to meet up as she is completely unaware i have been banging her mother for the last 6months. the mother finds out tells  AL we have been banging. AL finds 2 pictures on her mothers phone of me fully naked and tags me and my girlfriend in them on facebook. that is how my girlfriend found. 

i feel like i have no reason for living anymore. i feel absoutly terrible for what  i did to my girlfriend. my brain keeps telling me to just end it all. ill check back after work in hours
