How do I break the cycleHi my names well say Poncho. I'm 22 years young and I have a really good life. Im successful and everything is good...Or so it seems.. I have had loads of problems when it comes to dealing with my emotions. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to express them in the right way. Rather it me blowing up on somebody, breaking things, or threatening suicide. I've "attempted" 2 times because I think so low of myself and whenever I try to change I make the same mistakes over and over. Hung myself in high school the rope wasnt sturdy enough and broke. Took that as a "sign" fast forward years still am "good" but dont know how to properly handle my emotions still out of high school now. Find a girl whom gets pregnant immediately and we try making it work. Babys born I loved him for nearly a year and then it comes out he is not mine. [Its a loooooong stary] Obviously hurt I slit my wrist, the blade went at an angle now I'm left with this big ass scar down my left arm. I forgive her we get back together to have a family and 5 years later with my emotional and physical toxicity she leaves. I know what I do, understand why I do it. But no matter how hard I try I cannot control my emotions. Currently feeling like it would be easy to give up, more now than ever that I don't have my family. How do I change or how can I let her go I know she doesn't want me anymore and she actually made alot of progress in me. Sorry if it dont make sense I've been depressed not eating right and it's all just taking a toll. I'm ready. Been ready so why am I still here
