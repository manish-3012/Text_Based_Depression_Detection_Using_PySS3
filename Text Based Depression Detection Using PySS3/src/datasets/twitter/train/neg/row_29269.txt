If I killed myself no one would care because i have no friendsI'm bipolar. Medication has worked for me, but not extremely. I have tried a lot but they all give me terrible side effects. I keep coming back to this pit of incredible loneliness and despair. I'm failing in college, disappointing my parents, All of my close friends have left me and the few acquaintances I had I pushed out of my life.

I have chronic pain which makes it hard to get out of bed some days, and some days i have to completely stop what im doing and lay in bed because of it. There seems no end in sight to it.

The main thing, though, that makes me want to kill myself, is that I have no friends. I am horrible at making friends. I just want someone to talk to and hang out with a few times a week. I used to have friends like that, but like i said they all left me for reasons not relating to me. But i am horrible at making friends, i'm very shy and have social anxiety and I don't connect deeply with people well. 

I'm just desperately looking for a fulfilling human connection
