I'm losing myself.Every passing day the light of my mind grows dimmer as my memory fades, intelligence gradually gets reduced, even my personality the one thing which has remained constant is going too. It's getting more and more difficult to read,  look for jobs and plan for the future. Everything is going to shit.
