My friend attempted suicide today, and I worry he might try it again soon.My friend has been struggling with depression, and his parents are very judgemental. From what he's told me, they let him do whatever he wants, but they also mock him for everything he does, which has taken a toll on him. He wanted to join the army to escape them, but in the end he was guilt tripped into staying. He also dropped out from college and has had no luck  finding a job.  
  
Today, he told me he almost shot himself. I want to do something for him, I've been trying to convince him that he's depressed and he needs to seek help, but he always either deflects it or says his parents say he has no reason to be depressed.   
  
He went to a therapist once, but he just said some bullshit and left, never to come back again. His reasoning was that it felt 'fake' to say he had depressive thoughts.  
  
I don't know what else to add. I don't know him IRL- we're online friends, but still it is devastating to see someone I care about going through this. The formatting and flow of this post will probably be extremely shitty as I'm typing this out in a hurry, but I'm really desperate. What should I do?
