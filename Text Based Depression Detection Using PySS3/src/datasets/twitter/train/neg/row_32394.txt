Do you want me to stay alive or not?!Whenever I tell my mother or grandmother I'm depressed/having suicidal thoughts/having a panic attack, either one of them will just assume that I "saw something on the internet that made me upset", and then they'll tell me to grow up, but when I actually attempt suicide, they'll act as if they never saw this coming, and get angry with me.
