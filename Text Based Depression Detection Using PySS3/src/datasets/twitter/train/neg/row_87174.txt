I am trapped...Hey there,

I dont know if you are familiar where you want to do something with your life but the universe works against me. 

I dont mind doing what I already do but since yesterday something changed and now I feel trapped in doing something.

It is not as if doing that something is bad for me but because I have the feeling that I cannot leave it just makes things worse and more specifically makes me nervous and full of worries.
