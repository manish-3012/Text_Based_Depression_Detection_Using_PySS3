I fantasize about suicide if i wont be richim not poor but I truly believe I Deserve wealth,at least much more than certain people who are rich.

I havent decided any method,just a time window(by the time im 30. im 23 now),but the urge might come sooner.

I have a plan to become rich but if it fails i dont what i'll do, I will become truly desperate.

my life is literally riding on this single idea.
