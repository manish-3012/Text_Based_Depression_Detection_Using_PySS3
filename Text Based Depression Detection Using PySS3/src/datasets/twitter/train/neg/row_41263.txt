I wrote a suicide note, and I want you guys to hear it.

For everyone:

What a fucking year. Â 

This year has pushed me past my breaking point many times. But let itÂ be known that this has been a long time coming. Â 

If you are reading this, I've become a past tense. I know that this isÂ going to hurt people, but I've been hurting for years, and I couldn'tÂ see it ever getting better. Â 

Living that way is terrible. Living like the uphill's are mountains,Â and the downhills, cliffs. Â 

My whole life I've found comfort in Chaos. I have never found comfortÂ in being safe, in being secure. When things are calm, I canâ€™t help butÂ be on edge. I was in a constant state of waiting for the next badÂ thing to happen instead of enjoying the good parts. Â 

And yes, there was so much good. Â 


This wasnâ€™t an easy choice, but itâ€™s the one I've decided I'll act on.Â To all the people this will hurt: thank you. Thank you for trying,Â even if I didnâ€™t see it, or it didnâ€™t work. Thank you. Â 

I will miss things, if you can still miss things after your gone. I'llÂ miss nights by the fire with my family and doing stupid things with myÂ friends. Â 

But I won't miss the pain. Waking up every day not wanting to move.Â Having flash backs of failed suicide attempts or sexual assault pasts. Pushing people away,Â because I feared letting people in. Having to harm myself just to feel.Â Having this sinking emptiness inside of me. That I will not miss. Â 

Please, donâ€™t let this put your life on hold. Continue to doÂ everything you love. I hope you can pick up all the happiness I had inÂ my life, and you can use it in a way I never could. Â 

Take care of yourself. Make me proud. Â 

In my final moments, I ask the following:

Â· Tell my internet friends, without them this would have happened aÂ long time ago. Â 

Â· Give my instruments too people who will play them, keep the musicÂ alive. Â 

Â· Move on. Please. I'm gone, but remember when I was here, use thatÂ to help you grow. Â 

Please respect my wishes. Â 

I'm sorry. Â
