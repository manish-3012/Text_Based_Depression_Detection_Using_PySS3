Tired of living, but i dont wanna die this youngIm only 14 and i want to die, nobody likes me except my mom and my dad makes me pay for living at his house (something like 100$ for a week) and if i dont pay hes beating and shouting me. I really dont understand why am i living and i always did nothing bad, im a quiet guy who has no opinions. People treat me like shit. Kids from my settlement and kids from my grade talk always so much and when i talk theyre just making som sighs and get back to talking. I have to work like a donkey and i have to get earn my money for my dad. If not hes just beating me all night if i dont get money. Please, why isnt there just a way to die without pain, and mental pain, that if you die, nobody would even care...
