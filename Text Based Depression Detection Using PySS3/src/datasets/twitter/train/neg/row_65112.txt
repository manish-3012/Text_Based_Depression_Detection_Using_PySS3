Work, relationship and life is just to much.I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to have someone constantly disappointed in me. I try my best at everything and it's just never enough for anyone at all. Everyone is constantly disappointed or upset in what I do. In never happy. I don't even remember the last time I had true happiness. I can't focus on anything, I have no hobbies, I have no life outside of working and sitting at home with my girlfriend. I have nothing to live for anymore. I have tried changing my life style and it all ends up worse then before...
