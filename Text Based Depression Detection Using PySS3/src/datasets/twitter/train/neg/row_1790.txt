No one can help meAfter a disfiguring accident I canâ€™t go on like this anymore. Doctors have done all they can.  Inpatient has failed 3 times. Iâ€™m 26 and had to move back in with my parents. They ignore me and leave me alone all day after I repeatedly tell them that I canâ€™t do this anymore. I have no friends. I tried confiding in someone but he canâ€™t be bothered with my problems and just tells me to be strong. I canâ€™t live with myself. The world I awful and biting and at war. I really just hope ww3 actually happened and we all just die so my family doesnâ€™t have to be sad when Iâ€™m gone. I pray every single night that I donâ€™t wake up. Iâ€™m in to much physical and mental pain to go on any longer. I tried really hard but it did knot work. Iâ€™ve pretty much stopped eating maybe that will work if I donâ€™t get the balls to do it myself.
