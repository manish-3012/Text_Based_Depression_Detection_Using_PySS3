Im done with everythingNobody gives a shit about me nobody could care less about me or ask about me the only time someone actually talks to me is when he needs something 
The only time i was loved by a girl for real she ended up killing herself because of her abusive parents and every other girl i dated just played with my heart and kept me around until they felt like they didnt need me anymore 
Im not ugly or anything i even got a good shape because i have been hitting gym for years but i dont know what the fuck is wrong with me im too fucking boring for everyone i find nothing that could make me happy anymore everything i do just turns out to be a fucking mess in the end and nobody would ever give the slightest fuck they would just hate me for no reason even at college everyone is making friends and being cared about while im always being left behind even though i have done nothing wrong please i just want to feel loved for one time PLEASE why did you have to kill yourself and leave me to suffer with those monsters? Why i dont seem to enjoy anything or have any goals anymore why nobody just checks on me to ask how am i doing and actually care why nobody wants to be my friend? They dont even try to befriend me its just hate at the first sight and i swear i treat them as good as i can and do nothing wrong..i wish i was dead i wish someone would just come out and stab me to death to end my misery i even wished i could get coronavirus so i can just fucking die i have done cutting multible times cause i fucking hate myself they all made me hate myself for no reason i just wanted to know why..please i just want it all to stop please..i just want to feel wanted i need to feel loved
Im just one step away of committing suicide so i thought maybe i would write this as a last resort
