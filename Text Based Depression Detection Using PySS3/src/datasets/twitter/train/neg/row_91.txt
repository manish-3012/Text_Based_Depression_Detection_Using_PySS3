I need inputLast time I am asking for help. I don't want to be told anything else. 
Is there ANY apps or programs that will trigger a phone call and said time that's reliable.
I'm planning suicide by partial hanging however I want to be a organ donner. Ambulance response time is less than 3 minutes upon 911 getting a notification. I need 15 minutes... I want adequate time for my organs to be harvested at the very least but I need suffient time where my brain won't be getting oxygen and or blood for at least 15 minutes. (At least by then I will be brain dead). 

And also I can't have a person call 911 because: 
A) You could notify 911 earlier thus causing my plan to fall apart.
B) You would be the subject to a criminal investigation relating to my death. So it has to be automated call or program/software.
