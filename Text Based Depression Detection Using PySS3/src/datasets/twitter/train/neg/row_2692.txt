Thanks for sharing your stories on this subreddit. I think yâ€˜all saved me.It might sound kind of strange but thank you guys for reaching out on this subreddit. I just read some post here and left a lot of comments trying to help a bit.

Now why am Iâ€˜m grateful for you sharing your stories? I felt like crying the whole day. I cried like 10-15 times in school and started reading this sub on my way home. I read a lot of sad stories and post of people wanting to kill themselfs but I also realized something. My urge to cry it a lot less because I know Iâ€˜m not alone with these feelings. So thanks. You made my day.
