I've been thinking about someone who probably has forgotten I exist for three yearsI was in a ldr with someone I loved very much, to the point where fiction I make up for other people could not be as good. And after a couple years together she left me and I have no idea why. I had asked but she only ever told me she didn't know. So i, obsessive, have not been able to do much in my head for very long without thinking of reasons and blaming myself or feeling hurt for any reason possible for her to leave. And it's been fucking a long time to the point where when she decided she would never see me again she probably has stopped thinking about me now.

And I've gotten much more pathetic and incapable. And no attempts at other happiness work. I don't even know why I post here. I hate all redditor and the words they say and how they say them.
