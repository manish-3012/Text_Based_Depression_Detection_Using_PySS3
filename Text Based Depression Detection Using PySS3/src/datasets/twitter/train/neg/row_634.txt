First time posting...I'm not even mad, or sad, or happy anymore. Just feel......bored? Filled with dread thinking of living a full life. I have nothing to contribute anymore. Burned so many bridges because of my mental health struggles. Now I'm a SAHM and I love my kids but can't help but think my issues will only hurt them. Seeing a therapist and psychiatrist and started new meds. I dunno, just thought I'd reach out?
