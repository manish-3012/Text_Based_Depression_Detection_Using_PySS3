I don't think I'm gonna make it much longer.I'm just not strong enough. Depression is worse than it's been in 5+ years, maybe ever. Hard to remember. My only irl friend and support system is going through his own shit, his grandmother just died. He's my rock, it makes it so much worse that I feel like I can't talk with him about this. I've never felt like I needed to. I'm such a bad support and friend. I hurt so much, I just need it to stop
