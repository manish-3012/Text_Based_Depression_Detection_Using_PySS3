Maybe I'm just a human wreckageMaybe I was born a loser and will forever stay that way. It's okay I guess, I'm a loser. Get it. I'm not special. Get it. I'm not gonna achieve my big dreams, so I'll only achieve some plan B. I'm a failure. A big failure. And it'll stay that way.

I'm considering running away from my mom's house. I don't know where I'll go, maybe at the other side of the country, maybe in the closest big city (about 2 hours from where I live) to see some old friends, maybe I'll hide in the fields of my best friends' mom. I don't really know. I just want to kill myself, I'm tired of being bored and depressed and doing nothing with my life except smoking pots all day. I just hate myself you know. I hate that boring life. I even miss suffering. I miss the pain. It made me feel alive. It became a port of me. Now I'm just numb. So fucking numb. It's like my brain is slowly dying. I'm so scared. It's almost 9pm here. My mom's not home. I want to run in the woods with all my anti-psychotics, my bottle of vodka and a rope. I'm having pulses and flashes right now. I don't know if I can make it. I'm just so tired you know. It'd be my 4th attempt. Everytime, someone finds me before I die, but this time I will be alone in the dark forest. I'm tired. Please help.
