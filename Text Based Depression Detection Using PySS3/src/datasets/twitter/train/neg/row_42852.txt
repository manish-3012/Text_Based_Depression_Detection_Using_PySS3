Lost my girlfriend, dog and job and charged with a felony.I got fired from my job, my dog died, my girlfriend dumped me.

I got drunk and allegedly said that I wanted to go kill my boss.  I have no recollection as I was blacked out on 8 beers and a bottle of cough syrup. The police found me after I had driven home and I had my licensed pistol on me.

So far, I've lost 50,000 dollars, everything i love and now will be flipping burgers for life.

So far the court will not give me a plea deal or mental health court, even though I have diagnosed bipolar polar and borderline personality disorder.  I have zero criminal record.

If I get a felony, I will be ending my life.
