Having a bad nightUnfortunately it's me again, im having dark thoughts again, i've realized everytime this happens it's when i have a problem in my life, apparently i can't handle big emotions like a normal human being.

I honestly can't think of the future when something big and bad happens in the future and i won't be able to take it.

Right now in trying to cope with this by thinking about all the things i would miss if i decided to do it. I think about my sister who's coming back home after almost ten years, i think about her sons who i have yet to personaly meet, i think about my dogs who i love more than anything and what would happen to them if im gone.

It's working very well.

I know it's really sad and terrible, but im not sure if i can imagine a future where i won't do a stupid thing like killing myself, im very nervious and my anxiety goes off very easily, like i said, im not good with big emotions, i can't really take them.

Im trying so hard here but there's always days like this when the dark thoughts come back at night, im handling them for now, but what about in a month? A year? Will i still be fighting them or will i give up? I wish i didn't have them anymore but i don't know how to get rid of them.
