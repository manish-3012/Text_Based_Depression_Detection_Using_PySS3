Lost and TiredI don't know who I am anymore. The jokes about how depressed and suicidal I am have become more often and apparent just to cope. I can't afford professional help. i no longer know who to actually go to in person because I'll feel selfish. I'm afraid to admit myself because I don't know what to expect and then again, money. So I won't reach out to a helpline. I guess here I am finding myself once more on this subreddit with others who can relate in some way or another. I've relapsed into self-harm again, I've turned to drinking to feel numb. I've lost one of my good friends but I don't even feel remorse. I'm suppose to host a little Halloween get together but I jardly want to get out of bed anymore. I want to call into work most days, co-workers are noticing changes and how exhausted I look. I'm stressed about how I'm not comfortable in my own skin and I don't have guidamce to find who I am. But I also fear that in doing that I could get bashed at work especially. Most days I want to just lie in bed and cry, and some days I physically can't even when I want to. I'm lost, I'm tired, I'm irritable, and I'm sick of being here to the point I would rather walk end everything.
