Nothing to live forI've had suicidal thoughts since I was little. My only attempt was in second grade. Since then I've been delaying till I could do it without bothering anybody. I'm 23 now and I still think of killing myself every day.

I'm turning bitter. I'm starting to not care. I just want it to be over. I've dealt with this shit all my life, and I'm thinking more along the lines that any selfish asshole that wants me to stay alive should just deal with it.

I'm becoming a horrible person and I'm starting to care less and less. I'd have rather died with some dignity but I just want it to end.
