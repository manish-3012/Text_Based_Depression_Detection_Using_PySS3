I doubt I ever couldI don't think I ever could. I've had to deal with my mum threatening or trying too many times to put others through that. But the lower I get the more it loiters in my mind. I don't know how to be happy anymore. Don't even remember what it feels like. After returning to work I now see I'm not happy. Just a little less sad. I lie in bed every night wondering if I'll be able to get up the next day. Excruciating lower back pain and self-loathing make me just want to give up. I've sought help and am trying to be more responsible for fixing things but they're the wrong things. I have no idea how to care for myself. No idea how to break the cycle of misery. I've spoken to as many people as I can which has helped straighten some things out but I still feel trapped in a hole without any equipment to get out. Everyone says I just need to ask for help and I agree but I just seem to be terrified of speaking up and asking people to support me just like I support them.
