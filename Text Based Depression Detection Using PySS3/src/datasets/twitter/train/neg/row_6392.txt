I can't...Everything is so damn numb... my grades are dropping, I've disappointed my parents, I've lost the only friends I had, and my boyfriend (who was in this same place a week ago... its our one month anniversary today and yet... the only thing I can give him is a suicide note) is currently texting me trying to keep me going but... I cannot.  I can't...

3 years.  Want to know something?  It's been like this for three years...  and I just can't keep faking a smile...
