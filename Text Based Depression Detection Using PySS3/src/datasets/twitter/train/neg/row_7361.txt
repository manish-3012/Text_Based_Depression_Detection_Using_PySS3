I'm fucking doneI could take the divorce of my parents, easy.

I could take my brother leaving me alone to deal with my bipolar drunk mother, not so easy

I could take my mother getting drunk, hitting me and kicking me out of the house, hard. 

But tonight I just confirmed even my father does not give a fuck about me, neither does anyone else in my sad life. 

I have no interests, no objectives, nothing and nobody to look forward to. I am ending this pathetic existance of mine, no point in even going on another week.
