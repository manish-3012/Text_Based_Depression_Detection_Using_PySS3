My life has no perspectiveI have had people tell me that it will get better for so long but it has been 6 years and it has only gotten so much worse. I'm tired of people telling me that I will be okay again, when they don't even know me. They don't know about my life. They don't know how little perspective my life has. They don't know how hard everything is for me. All I can see in my future is failure and misery. There is nothing life has to offer me. I'm too dull to have true friends, too distant to have a relationship, too dumb to get a job I'd enjoy. So tell me, when am I going to be okay? I'm so tired. I can't do this anymore
