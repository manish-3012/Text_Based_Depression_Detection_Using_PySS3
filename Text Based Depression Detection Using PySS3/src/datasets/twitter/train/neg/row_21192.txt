Nobody knows how close I amI read the bit assessing how at risk a person is, and I would score a lot of points on that one, but nobody knows.

My husband just broke up with me and I feel trapped, don't have a full time job, feel very insecure with my work, and I will need to move out of the high cost of living area and do not know where to go. 

I have texted 2 friends, and texted a couple crisis text lines (very thankful for those). 

The second one gave me some referral information and I found there's an abusive relationships support group in my area. I have to call on the phone to sign up, but I'm willing to do it. (obviously I dread phones).

I try to encourage others because I've been to the lowest point before, and it's somehow really easy to drop down very low. I am trying to hang in there. It's pretty low but I'm getting out for walks and being in nature as much as I can. It's hard.
