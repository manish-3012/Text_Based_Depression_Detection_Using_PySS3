Help. PleaseI just had the worst weekend of my life. Friday, a girl who I really like, and who I was going to tell my feelings, asked me to set her up with a guy that I swim with. We've been good friends for a pretty long time, but now it's over and I'm emotionally drained. I didn't eat for a day and I still don't have an appetite. I know that sounds dramatic, but I really can't help it. 

The next day, a girl who I've been working with(who I really thought liked me) informed me that she wants me to help set her up with another guy. It felt like a punch to the stomach. The exact same thing two days in a row. 

I don't know what they don't see in me. I know that I'm not ugly, I have a good social life, I'm not a douche, I try to be as nice as I can, etc. I really don't know what to do. I've been taking depression medication for almost a year now and everything was going well, but this really set me over the edge. I'm really scared for myself, honestly. I haven't felt this terrible in a long time. I'm a senior in high school and I've never been any sort of relationship, nor have even come close. I don't know what to do anymore. I have no motivation.
