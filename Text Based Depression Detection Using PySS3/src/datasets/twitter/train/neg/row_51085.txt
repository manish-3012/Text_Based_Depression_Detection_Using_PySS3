No Reasons LeftI have tried before and am seriously going to try again soon. I think it would nice to go, the only thing holding me back is not knowing whats is on the other side after death, scientifically, pure nothingness, our mind seises to exist. The past few years of my life I have given up on everything. My grades started dropping, no hope for college. I am never happy with my appearance, everything I do socially is a facade. Everything I ever wanted to pursue or love I realized there is no hope in obtaining it. Nothing motivates me anymore, not even music, which stopped me from killing myself several times. My parents and teachers have even given up on me. I am constantly cursed out, threatened, and publicly humiliated. Even my brother hates me. I find no reason to stay alive and burden anyone anymore, I see no point in living for a future that I have no part in. I have constantly let down others and myself.

sorry if it was rambly, don't really care about form right now.
