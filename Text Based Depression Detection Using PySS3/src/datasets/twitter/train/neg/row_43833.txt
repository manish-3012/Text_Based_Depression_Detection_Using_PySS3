My Long Term PlanI will soon be 37, which means I have three years to "fix" my problems as I see them or I kill myself.  I do not want to be a 40 year old virgin, I don't want to be a 37 year old virgin.....but I do realize things take time.  I'm just not going to keep giving it time and being miserable while people keep telling me "Someday it'll happen!"

I feel like I missed out completely on my 20s, so I have no basic experience to make decisions in my 30s.  And I really don't want to make it to my 40s.

Why not hire a prostitute?  Because that means my only value is money.  

I have my main account on Reddit, and I was half tempted to post this on it.  But I don't want people to feel sorry for me or afraid to talk to me because I might off myself if they say the wrong thing.  It comes off like a threat when you talk about suicide, I'm not threatening to kill myself because of any one action by one person.  I am just tired of being unhappy, and try as I might to find someone or some people to talk to...I just can't manage to keep people interested.  Which means the fault lies with me, and I am unable to identify what needs fixed.

I ask myself everyday if I really want to wade through another three years in hopes of something changing just to find out I suffered another handful of years for nothing, if I shouldn't just do it a little sooner so I feel like less of a cosmic fool when the time comes.

Like the only way to "win" is to not to play.  That scares me, but I think it gets a little truer every day.
