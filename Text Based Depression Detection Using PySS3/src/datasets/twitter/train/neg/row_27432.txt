Just wanted to vent before I dieIdk what to say anymore. I have been venting half the week on reddit. But it won't change anything. Mental hospital got canceled. And my parents won't take me to the urgent hospital. I said I fucking needed it. 

Not as revenge, but yep now I'm indeed about to kms. Have the razorblades here. Lying on the ground. 

Idk why I'm on reddit. I've given life sooo many chances. But then something happens again. I can't take it anymore. Life isn't worth it anymore. Living to keep my friends happy is what I've been doing this whole year. Making them happy. Listening to them. So I guess it's about time I do something egocentric by fucking dying. I guess I sort of still want to be saved cuz I'm still typing. But at the same time its too much. too late. Too painfull. 

I'm sorry for triggering people. 

Parents say urgent intake into a hospital isn't safe as I still can run away or hurt mysef. But guess what. I can run away here too. I have razorblades and can iseasly kill myself here. My wrist has so much scar tissue that it won't even hurt if I slit my wrist. The urgent hospital could've at least been a little safer and maybe they would help me learn how to survive until this fucking virus stops ruining everything. I mean my apointment for a good mental hospital has been moved to NOVEMBER. So after 7 months of waiting for help against suicidal feelings, I hav to wait another 8 months. Nope. That was the last negative thing that happened to me.
