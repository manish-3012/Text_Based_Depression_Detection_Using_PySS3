I have no valueIm sick of my life, sick of myself. I excel at nothing, I fail everything I try. I'm lonely, everyone I've ever asked out has rejected me, and who can blame them I'm just a weak chin fuck up who deserves nothing. I don't want to live but I have to beacuse I care about my parents and for some reason they love me. I've never made anyone's life better or contributed to the world in any positive way. I wish I didn't exist. Like if I never happened at all I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have to be this useless peice of shit. Completely devoid of any virtue. 
I have one friend, and even he's just my cousin. I hear him talk about all his other friends and all the stuff they do together and the places they go. And it hurts because I'll never have any of that. I wish I could have friends and make memories to. But I can't because I'm me. 
One of my biggest fantasies is cuddling with a girl. Not even sex, just being able to be intimate with someone.
I just want to die, I don't have a reason to cary on in this world.
