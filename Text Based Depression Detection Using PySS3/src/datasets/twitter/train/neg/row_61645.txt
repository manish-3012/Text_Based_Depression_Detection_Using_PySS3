Fucky.I keep seeing this person who continually takes photos of me through windows at night. This was the 3rd time Iâ€™ve seen them, I heard a truck outside and a short while later I saw someone staring at me through the kitchen window. A part of me wants to just take a bunch of pills to get them to stop because if Iâ€™m gone they canâ€™t do it anymore. 

I turned 20 yesterday and things have spiraled a bit since then. I think I may be hallucinating (my mom definitely agrees) but ....why? why do these people have to fuck up my life. I donâ€™t know where the photos are being posted, what theyâ€™re doing with them and if theyâ€™ve done it without me noticing.

Obviously this isnâ€™t the sole reason I want to commit die but the increasing paranoia is making it hard to do anything but lay on the floor, away from windows alongside my bed. Forever. I donâ€™t like this. I want to die.
