I just need some reassurance.Iâ€™m at the lowest Iâ€™ve been in months. My head is fucking cooked. Iâ€™m struggling and Iâ€™ve been having a lot of suicidal thoughts, I try to be happy I really do. Iâ€™m 16 and a closeted cross dresser. Iâ€™ve overcome serious abuse throughout my life and itâ€™s just been a shitty ride. I know other people are worse off and Iâ€™m grateful for everything good Iâ€™ve got. It just gets so fucking depressing I canâ€™t help but want to end it. I just need somebody to talk to me cause I feel so alone right now.
