I don't know why I want to kill myselfThings seem okay... At least, things are better than they used to be, but I still want to kill myself. Today, I saw a GP, and he was really nice. He prescribed me Lexapro, and I'm going to start on it in about two weeks. I just... I don't know. I feel like things might be so much better when I start receiving treatment and trying to better myself, but I just don't know what it feels like to not be depressed. What a weird thought, right? I feel like depression is a safe haven, and my suicidal thoughts are a fucking blanket. It's nice, it's cozy, and I'm not caught by any surprises. I know I am horrible. To me, it's not a surprise. Although, if I try to better myself, what if I'm still horrible? What if I'm still worthless to my standards and everyone else's? What a fucked up thought process.

I'm also really tired to the point where I just want to not do anything. I can't even enjoy things anymore because of how tired I am.
