Advice?Struggled with gender identity for forever. Someone went down on me today and it was amazing. Iâ€™m born female I was on testosterone for a year and sorta ruined my life and stuff Iâ€™ve been with a therapist and just got my first letter for a hysterectomy but sheâ€™s making me still keep seeing her my parents are the ones who provide me insurance and they donâ€™t even though Iâ€™ve gotten the letter. Iâ€™m freaked out theyâ€™ll find out and idk what to do if Iâ€™m honest. I have another appointment with the therapist tomorrow and I absolutely dread talking to her. I hate the appointments theyâ€™re over the phone and they suck and she always reverts the conversation back to whatever she has to say instead of just letting me freely speak and stuff about my life oof.
