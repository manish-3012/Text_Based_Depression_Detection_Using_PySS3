goodbye for now subafter my emotional burnout and attempt last night iâ€™ve decided to see if i can be okay or better for once. i have so much sympathy for all of you and what youâ€™re going through. i'm only 14 and iâ€™ve been through a lot for only being here such a short time. please be careful with your choices. iâ€™ve noticed a lot of you philosophise a lot and i think that says a lot about being great thinkers. goodbye for now. i think youâ€™re all brave and beautiful and i admire every one of you that can get up and face the world for another day. thanks so much. be careful.
