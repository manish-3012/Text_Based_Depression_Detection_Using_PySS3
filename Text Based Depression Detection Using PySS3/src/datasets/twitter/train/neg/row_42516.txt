Honestly? I. Don't. Know.I don't know how to talk in an open setting about suicide and depression. Especially with my family. They believe in god, but I do not. Every argument they make for not killing yourself is the same jist. "YOU'LL GO TO HELL" It feels as if I am closer to people online than the people who raised me. I don't know what to do.
