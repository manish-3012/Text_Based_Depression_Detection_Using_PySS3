This isnâ€™t about me but I didnâ€™t know anywhere else to postI was with a girl the other night and she seemed perfectly normal to me and didnâ€™t seem to have many signs of depression. We ended up casually hooking up not giving ages but Iâ€™m on the younger side of things and I noticed scars all up and down her thighs and lower butt. Some looked to be very old but they were very deep. I just feel horrible and I donâ€™t know what to do. We ended up just making out and cuddling because she has not done many things with a guy. I just rubbed her legs as she fell asleep but I could not sleep because of how sorry I felt for her. I know this isnâ€™t based around suicide but these cuts were DEEP and if any of them were cut at the same time she would have been losing major blood. Iâ€™d like to bring it up but I feel like it would make her uncomfortable as we are friends but not to the point where I could bring that up.
