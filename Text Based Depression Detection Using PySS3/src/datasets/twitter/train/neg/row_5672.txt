so fucking stupidim just done everythings so retarded. I literally have three phases that are like stuck in a cycle and have been stuck for the past 10 years and nothings working nothings fixing it. I'll be happy (shortest period of time), Numb (longest) and then Depressed as fuck (2nd ;longest) and it just keeps repeating over and over.

if you wanna read my life story you can see that in /depression/ and i seriously don't see any point of why not to kill myself tonight. Yea a lot of people would care but I don't give a single fuck nobody understands what living like this is like. It doesn't end it never has and i'm pretty sure it never will. I don't wanna keep going "one more day" I've said that for 5 years. Everythings so fucking stupid.
