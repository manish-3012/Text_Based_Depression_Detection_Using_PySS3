I wish I could take it all backIm not one to post stuff on internet boards. This is my first post to be honest with you. I guess i just need to get stuff off my chest. My ex left me 2 years ago for a new guy. Theyâ€™re getting engaged in a couple of months. I blew my friendships because of my alcohol issues, and I feel like Iâ€™m all alone. I canâ€™t get her out of my head, she was the best thing to ever happen to me. We talked about having kids together and making a family, then I turn my back and she cheats on me for 6 months. I forgive her and would take her back in a heartbeat. I need help, my alcoholism is getting out of hand and Iâ€™m trying my hardest to see the good things in life but there is none. â€œYou have a familyâ€ is the only thing Iâ€™ve ever heard as to why I shouldnâ€™t end it. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to die alone and everyone will be happy because I was just some alcoholic that had no life worth. I feel like Iâ€™ve been robbed of my life and I would do anything to take it back. I donâ€™t know what to do..
