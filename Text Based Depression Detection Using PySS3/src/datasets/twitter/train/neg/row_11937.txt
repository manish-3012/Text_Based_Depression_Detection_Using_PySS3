It's 6am. I'm going to the emergency room in a few hours. I'm so scared. What should I expect?I had what I call an "episode" last night and I can't take it anymore. I self harm, and last night, it was bad. I've decided its time I go to the hospital. I've been putting it off for the last 6 months. Im seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. They were supposed to give me medication, but they forgot to do the paper work. For three months. Three. Fucking. Months. 
I'm fucking terrified, excuse my language. Who has been through this? What are they going to do? I live in New York city, I'm 20, so I'm still pediatric. Will they call my guardians? Any info will help.
