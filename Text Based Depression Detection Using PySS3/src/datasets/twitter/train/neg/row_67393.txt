Iâ€™m not sure thereâ€™s much more to live forTo put it plain and simple, I currently donâ€™t see any path for my life at all at the moment seeing how things are going and itâ€™s ironic considering Iâ€™m about to become a highschool senior this should be a time of exploring my passions but Iâ€™m not sure I have any and I donâ€™t know what I want to study Im aware I probably sound lazy but I genuinely have no motivation and am not sure what to do, itâ€™s all incredibly overwhelming and I would honestly rather end it all than be a failure and disappoint my parents even more
