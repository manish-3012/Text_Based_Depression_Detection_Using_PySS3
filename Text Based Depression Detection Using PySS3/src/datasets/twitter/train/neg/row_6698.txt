I just dont know what to do anymoreI just cried coming home from work. I dont even know where to begin with this. This is going to be all over the place. I've had undiagnosed depression since I was about 14. My mom passed when I was 16 the depression got diagnosed around that time, I'm 22 now. So I take medicine for it. I just dont know how to go on anymore. I dont really wanna die but Its so hard to go on anymore. I honestly dont think I have the strength to actually go through with anything I've thought about different ways but I know I wouldnt be able to, or I'd be scared I wouldnt get the job done. I'm worried that I'm not even suicidal but just want attention and i know how bad that seems. 
What's pushed me over recently is so fucking stupid. The guy I like doesnt like me back because I'm still in the closet, he now has a bf and hardly talks to me I told him I had to stop talking to him for now until I can fix myself. But we work together.
 I've always been told I was the golden child because I never caused any problems I was the happy go lucky child who couldnt do any wrong. I feel like I've been conditioned to put others happiness before mine. That's how I've lived my whole life. School was always easy until 11th grade and then I just didnt know what to do. I've got a couple friends but I always feel as though I'm bothering them no one every talks to me first, I feel as though they have better people they would rather hang out with or talk to. 
About a month before my mom passed I promised her I would never drink or do drugs and i know you dont need to do those to be happy but it seems like that's how the world is. My job really isn't that bad I just work retail stocking. I started back in july after not having a job for a year. I could go on and on I dont even know what else to put I feel like I just need to get this out. I'm sorry for the wall of text, gonna head to bed now idk if anyone will even read this but I'll reply in the morning if anyone does.
