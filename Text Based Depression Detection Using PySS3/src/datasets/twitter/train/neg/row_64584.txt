Exhausted.Iâ€™m so tired of being here. Iâ€™m such a failure. I donâ€™t know why I was born, and I wish I wasnâ€™t. Iâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m suffering from PTSD and trauma is incredibly hard to live with. I canâ€™t look after myself right now, I canâ€™t eat right, Iâ€™m always anxious, it takes me hours to get out of bed. Everything is so pointless, I canâ€™t stand it anymore. Iâ€™ve never even had a job despite turning 21 this weekend, I keep trying and getting rejected, I didnâ€™t even finish college because I was struggling with alcohol abuse, I feel so guilty for living at home and being a waste of space. I take up too much space and I just want to be gone already. It feels like nobody loves or needs me, like nobody would even miss me anyway. All of this sounds pathetic but Iâ€™m struggling so much and I canâ€™t take it anymore. I just feel like a horrible person and I want to vanish. Iâ€™m planning my suicide and I plan to hang myself in my closet. Looking forward to being gone.
