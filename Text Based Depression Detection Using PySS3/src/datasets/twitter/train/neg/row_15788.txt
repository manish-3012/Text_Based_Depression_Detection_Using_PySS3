Reddit I need more advice now..that I ever have in my life.PLEASE HELP ME!

Today, my friend (and I swear it is my friend and not myself) who has had about three years of non-diagnosed mental health issues finally acted on them. He is in his mid-20's and lives with his family. He has shown to me a couple times that he is "losing grips with reality" in terms of paranoia/government watching you type beliefs.

So earlier today, in a verbal argument with his sibling who is a minor, he acted out and physically harmed her. Following her trip to the ER, they sent the police after him and he was arrested. He was just released from court and he is currently at an acquaintance's home. He refuses to contact his family, and I'm fearful that he may hit rock bottom if the acquaintance asks him to leave. 

I really don't even know what I'm asking you Reddit, but he is in a VERY vulnerable state and I do not know what to do. He has been my friend my whole life and I refuse to abandon him in this time of need.

He was not charged with a felony and he needs to seek court-ordered counseling . Now the tough part about this is that he doesn't know I know any of this. I talked to a  member of his family today and I just don't know how I can "bring this up" or even begin discussing this issue with him. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO!?
