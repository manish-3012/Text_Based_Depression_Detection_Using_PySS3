How many again?Three handfuls of sleeping pills and half a jug of rum won't get me there will it? I wish it could. I wish it would.

I'll never be enough
I'll never be loved
I'll never know happiness

I should have hung myself when I was raped at nine. I should have cut my wrists at fourteen when my father had had enough of my depression and told me to just do them all the favor and end it. I should have walked into traffic when my husband told me he had never been faithful... As in ever.

I yearn to be done with the heartache. Yet I can never seem to cut deep enough.
