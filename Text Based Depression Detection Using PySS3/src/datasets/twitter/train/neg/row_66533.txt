I am indifferent to kindnessI am rich, I drive a Mercedes, I live in a 5-story private estate and no matter what I do I still feel empty inside.Sex, drugs, alcohol, and violence. I've tried to save myself but I keep prolonging my suffering. I own a beautiful 500 magnum revolver and am holding it in my right hand. I'm done with this. I am a bad person and I deserve this.
