I hate myself.Life, objectively, is... *fine*, I suppose. Mediocre. Nothing special. I don't really care about it. 

But *myself*... well, that's a whole other story. I hate myself so thoroughly. I don't want to be alive at all, if it has to be as me... I don't think it would even matter what kind of life I were living, it would all be ruined by the piece of garbage I am. 

I just want to die, but I'm too much of a coward to even make that happen, which makes me hate me even more. 

Just wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading.
