i've a plan to end it when i'm overseashey i've been feeling really terrible lately and i can't even begin to explain why. but i'm leaving for another country in two days and it's starting to scare me that i've actually a plan to end my life when i am abroad. no one knows about it. in my sense saying goodbye is the easiest this way because i'm literally flying off. idk what to do. i'm so so tired of being here i just want to pain to end. i just want hugs and i just want someone to hold my hand and tell me that i'll be ok. but it's like no one is ever bloody there and i'm so tired i'm so tired please i'm so tired i can't go on and a part of me doesn't want to go on anymore
