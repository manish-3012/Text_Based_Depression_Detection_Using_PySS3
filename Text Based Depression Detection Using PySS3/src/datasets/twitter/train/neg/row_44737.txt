I hate everythingSo, this year had been pretty meh... I [m14] started liking this girl [f 16] who liked me back, but her parents didnâ€™t like the age gap and told her that we couldnâ€™t date, so that sucked... then whenever her and I had moved on, and school started, I met this incredible girl [f 15] and I almost fell in love instantly... we dated for about two months before she dumped me... itâ€™s not the fact that she dumped me that makes me sad and mad and just... ugh, but rather how and why... she randomly texted me, â€œhey... so whenever you asked me out, you said that no matter what happened to us you wouldnâ€™t let it ruin our friendship... does that still standâ€... I immediately could tell what was happening, I started to have a panic attack and... well I cut myself... whenever I responded she proceeded to text me about how sheâ€™s come to the realization that she doesnâ€™t love me in a romantic way, and that she never did... I really loved her... I looked to having a future with her and every time I mentioned it seeing that smile on her face... there wasnâ€™t a doubt in my mind that she loved me back... when she ended things I didnâ€™t want life to go on... I wanted it all to just stop... she broke up with me 16 days ago...  I havenâ€™t cut in a week, and I donâ€™t think I will anytime soon... but I donâ€™t want to be here, in a world where I canâ€™t be happy
