I'm scared.Not for me. I've come to terms with the fact that my life might be destined to come to a halt at the end of a barrel. No I'm scared because it's no longer just my life in the balance. I'm scared because up until this point it would have been okay for me to lose the battle. Now it's not. My dad has cancer. He has treated me like garbage my whole life. Walked over me like a piece of trash but for some stupid fucking reason I love him. I'm taking care of him. And in some demented way he loves me. If I were to lose my battle now, I feel it might cause him to lose his. I'm trapped. How poetic.
