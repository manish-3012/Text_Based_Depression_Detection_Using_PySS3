BirthdayItâ€™s my birthday tomorrow. Iâ€™ll be 33 and I donâ€™t even want my family to celebrate it for me Iâ€™ve never actually liked to celebrate it. Mostly because Iâ€™v never wanted to be here anymore so why celebrate the day I was born. At least thatâ€™s how I see it. As I said recently I have bought a plane ticket and a hotel for the last two nights of 2020. Then on New years day itâ€™s happening Iâ€™m done Iâ€™m not going through another year of endless pain and not being able to truly talk about my issue. Also doesnâ€™t help my family keeps telling me Iâ€™m making it all up in my head and that I need to grow up and act like a man. I know they mean well and they just donâ€™t want me to leave but itâ€™s so aggravating to hear them say this over and over again. I have spent the past 10 to 12 years infatuated with this sick attraction I have towards younger girls. And it doesnâ€™t stop it hasnâ€™t since it started. And I have confessed it to them and every time I mention it they tell me Iâ€™m wrong and that Iâ€™m just being over dramatic from my wife leaving me just about a year ago. That I canâ€™t handle it because Iâ€™m just not man enough or donâ€™t have the balls to fight through it and forget her. But yes Iâ€™m hurt that she left me and has found someone new and looks happier in the few months sheâ€™s been with him than the almost 10 years we were together. Even our daughters have a better time when he visits them or takes them to his house. Yes it hurts to see this and it hurts to know sheâ€™s happier without me and that sheâ€™s forgotten me and the only reason she still communicates with me is for the girls. And it hurts but at the same time I understand her and I donâ€™t blame her. What was she supposed to do when I told her I had an attraction to younger girls and I liked to cross dress and Iâ€™m addicted to porn. Iâ€™m lucky she didnâ€™t call the cops on me and that I can still see my girls even if itâ€™s only two days of the week. But I know she only lets me see them because I live with my parents and Iâ€™m never alone with them I know she doesnâ€™t trust me. I never asked to be like this I was not abused as a child I did not grow up in an abusive household or had any type of drama that involved an adult molesting me or touch me. Why did I develop this why am I like this Iâ€™m a good person I didnâ€™t deserve this. Iâ€™m ashamed Iâ€™m disgusted at myself. I sometimes want to cut my face to reveal the true monster underneath. I canâ€™t live with this anymore I just canâ€™t. It gets harder everyday and every time I mention it to my family they just deny it over and over again. But I know the truth and I know what I am and it sickens me so much. But I want to stop this now before I no longer see this is wrong and I accept it as just a part of me. I donâ€™t want to accept this I donâ€™t want to be like the millions of individuals in the world that believe thereâ€™s nothing wrong with them. I rather die then ever believe that. This has to end and the day canâ€™t get here sooner.
