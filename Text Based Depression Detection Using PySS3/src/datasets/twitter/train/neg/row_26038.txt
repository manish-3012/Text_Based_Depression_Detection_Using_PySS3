Idk how to voice how i feelThereâ€™s just so much bottled up inside rn, i donâ€™t even know how to express it. if i try and get help from my family or a school counselor i feel like iâ€™m going to be hospitalized. i just want to implode. i havenâ€™t cried in so ducking long, itâ€™s just like i feel numb. i get so agitated at the smallest things and i just canâ€™t voice to anyone why thatâ€™s the case. i even hate writing about it because when i open up over text it doesnâ€™t feel right. but i feel like if i donâ€™t iâ€™m gonna do something dumb. i havenâ€™t cut in so long but i feel so close to relapsing
