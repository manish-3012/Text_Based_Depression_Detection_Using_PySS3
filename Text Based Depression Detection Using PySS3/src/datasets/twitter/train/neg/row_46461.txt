"Stop crying like a baby!" "Get over it!"Those were the words my mum used today when I finally cracked under all of the pressure and had a mental breakdown.

It just sums it all up perfectly, doesn't it? You're expected to just get over everything, doesn't matter if something makes you upset or angry, or feel that it's unfair or a complete injustice, you just have to live with it. Your problems will never go away.

If this is the attitude people have... is it any fucking wonder suicide is one of the biggest causes of death in the world?! If this is how my life is going to be for the rest of my existence, then quite frankly I don't want to continue. I'm not happy, I'm miserable, I'm stressed. I'm dealing with depression, anxiety and PTSD. I have more enemies than friends, everyone I put my trust into eventually hurt me. One can only handle all of that for so long before they snap!

Anti-depressants do nothing for me, counseling or therapy helps, the suicide hotline, if I can actually reach someone, and someone whose voice doesn't creep me out, is useless.

I'm totally convinced now that the people who say life is great and just lying to themselves to make themselves feel better about living. Maybe hoping that if they say it enough, it will actually become true.
