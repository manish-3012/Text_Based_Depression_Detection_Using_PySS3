My partner may end his life tonight. If he goes, I go.[I made this post earlier.](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/115xze/i_nearly_destroyed_a_7year_relationship_i_feel/) I cheated on my partner of 7 years, several times. We were doing alright last night, and he was doing well today, but I wasn't. After talking to him tonight, I started to feel better, but he started to feel worse. I found out he stole valium and potassium from work, and he is contemplating ending his life by overdosing on both and not waking up. I don't know what to do without him. I love him, and despite how badly I've fucked up, I want to stay with him, and I thought he wanted to stay with me. If he takes his life, I most likely will too.

I'm numb and scared and a whole ton of emotions right now. Please help.
