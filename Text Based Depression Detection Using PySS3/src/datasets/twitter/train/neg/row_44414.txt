2017 has seen the worst of me. Hopefully 2018 wonâ€™t have to see me at all.Not long ago, I would have told you that suicide is never the answer. That things get better, there are things to live for, and a greater future you could never predict. But here I am, drowning in a depression that I swear is turning my body to stone, calcifying in m lungs. Itâ€™s like, whatâ€™s the point of dying when youâ€™re already dead inside? 

With the end of the year approaching, Iâ€™ve realised my thoughts have been escalating. From â€œhey itâ€™s just depression and anxiety, you can beat this!â€ To â€œcutting will distract you. Youâ€™ll get better...â€ to â€œfuck everything, I have nothing left hereâ€. 

It pains me to know that Iâ€™m not the same person I was a year or two ago. The old me is gone. As much as I want her back, I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m strong enough anymore. Or if thereâ€™s any reason to fight for her. 

If Iâ€™m lucky, I wonâ€™t have to wake up tomorrow. 

Iâ€™m sorry that anyone had to read this, or be on this subreddit at all. My heart goes out to you, and I hope that through and through, you find the help and peace you need. 

But I donâ€™t see anything better for me now than for everything to stop. I really donâ€™t.
