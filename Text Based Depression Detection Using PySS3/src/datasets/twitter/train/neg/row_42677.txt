Suicide idealization brings me comfort?When I get super overwhelmed with negative thoughts &amp; anxiety, it brings me a lot of comfort having the knowledge on how to obtain pure inert gases &amp; how to use it to go out painlessly. Iâ€™m buying the tank today &amp; will keep it in my closet until I feel like itâ€™s time. Iâ€™ll make sure Iâ€™ve checked all my boxes, maxed out all my credit cards, &amp; am sure my younger sister will get to keep everything (including my car) &amp; not debt collectors
