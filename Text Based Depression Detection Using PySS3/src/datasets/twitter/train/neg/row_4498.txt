I just can't bear to imagine the reaction of my family and friends.But I can't do it anymore. 
I live in Boston, and after seeing the videos of the marathon bombings, I couldn't bring myself to see any happiness left in the world.  Unfortunately, I was so fucked up on Xanax yesterday, that I only found out about the bombings this morning. I went to the hospital, apparently I almost OD'd.  

I hate hiding in the closet. I don't want to have "gay pride". I want a wife and kids, but I know I physically can't do it.

I can't even rant any longer. I wish I was right next to that bomb when it went off. Then I wouldn't have anything to explain. Then I wouldn't have to make my family look/feel like they did something wrong.

I want someone to convince me that there is a point to being alive.  I won't have a family to love unconditionally. I can't solve world peace. I have no skills to practice to keep myself occupied.  

I am turning to you because I need to vent before I do something drastic. I hate living, it is a curse.
