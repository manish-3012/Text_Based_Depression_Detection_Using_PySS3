I'm too afraid to actually do it.I've been contemplating it for awhile now, and I've just been afraid of it. I'm not sure why though. I'm atheist so I don't think I'll go to hell or anything. Honestly I'd prefer if my consciousness was eradicated from the face of the universe. I guess I just don't want it to hurt? That's what I keep telling myself. I'd prefer to slip away quietly, but have no means of doing so. Its probably the only reason I'm still alive at this point.
