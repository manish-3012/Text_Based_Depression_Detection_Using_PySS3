2 weeks...Everything hurts. I can't sleep because all I can think about is all the pain I'm in. I just want to disappear and not deal with this anymore. I am pretty sure I will be kicked out of school next semester. I have no where else to go, I have no more money left and I am alone. The military has already told me multiple times they do not want me and I can't find a job anywhere because I have no experience. My SO abuses me emotionally everyday and I don't know how to make it stop. I keep thinking back to my 3rd attempt when I stepped infront of an oncoming ambulence. Everyday I regret stepping back more and more. I should have died that day. I shouldn't be here dealing with all this bullshit. I just want to be happy. I can't even remember the last time I was happy. I've made up my mind and have no reason to stay here anymore. I have it all planned out. For the next 2 weeks I'll put on a smile and take care of my things, then I'm going.  This is more of a vent post than a plea for help.
