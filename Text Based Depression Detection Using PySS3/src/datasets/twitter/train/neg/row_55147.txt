pffI feel i have been ignored my entire life. Sure i have some friends but they never really care for any serious problems i may have. In my teenager years I very rarely showed how badly i was feeling but in the end no one really cared all that much, from that i learned its best not to share it at all. I have this craving for revenge sometimes and i'm afraid that eventually i'll end up somewhere on the news for going on a murder spree. Work is ok but its basicly just me going trough the motions, love life has been ignored completely, family i mean they are nice but never really talk about anything serious i just seem to pretend everything is fine. I know i'll never kill myself(to big of a coward for that, tried once but didn't go through with it sadly) but i fear what i might do maybe not today, maybe not tomorow but say within today and say 10 years i dunno anymore
