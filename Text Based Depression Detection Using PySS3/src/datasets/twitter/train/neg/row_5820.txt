I think I'm extremely oddI don't go to hospital when I'm sick. I took an overdose on analgesic paracetomol, I took about 40 and I didn't bother going to hospital or more like need to go to hospital. I did vomit though, but still. I cut my wrist so deeply that I saw something white, maybe it was the bone or cartilage - I don't know. My wrist bled a bit (although I wish it bled a lot) but I just wore a long jumper and went on freakin holiday. Is that normal? To not get stitches for that? It's healed now but do I act normal? The fact that I'm not normal makes me want to kill myself.
