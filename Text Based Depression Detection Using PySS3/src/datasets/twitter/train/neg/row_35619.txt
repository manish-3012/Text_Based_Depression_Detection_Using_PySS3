I dont even knowI'm not evenfeeling anything, no joy, no sadness, like living didnt made any diffrence at this point, like i'm living for something i dont even know, that doesnt care about me, i just want to grab a knife and hold it by the blade, let it slowly sink in and make me bleed, so i can feel something, anything


I'm sorry
