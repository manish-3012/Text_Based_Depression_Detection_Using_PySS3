When the lady on the national suicide hotline very aggressively says â€œbyeâ€ then hangs up on you.My shit is so fucked rn. Iâ€™m so isolated and alone , Iâ€™ll be spending Christmas Day by myself. I might be losing all my financial aid and not be able to get back into college next semester.I broke up w my girl right before finals and she was my life partner for a year and a half, I would be spending Christmas w her. But the relationship got so unhealthy we had to end it, it was so perfect at first and Iâ€™m missing having her by my side. My roommates are gone for Christmas and so are all my friends. I lost my job and Iâ€™m fucking struggling. Iâ€™m cut off from my family because they are bad people and weâ€™re bud Iâ€™ve to me growing up, I donâ€™t have a family to see on Christmas, my gfâ€™s family was more family than they were and I wonâ€™t be seeing them. I didnâ€™t want to live anymore so I called the hotline and the woman was aggressive and rude w me not really trying to listen or understand, and hung the phone up. Like does she realize some of the people who call her are barely holding on for their life? That really made me feel like Iâ€™m alone
