I am making progress but my mind keeps seeking suicidal ideation.I am in my mid late 30s. I have been working to change myself and get beyond depression, anxiety and losses of love along with paths not taken. I don't make enough st my job and it's really not healthy for me.

I find it hard to connect with people. Friends I do have are not that close it feels like. I'm tired of trying to force things that aren't meant to be.  And I don't attract women at all it seems. 

I'm tired of being so alone.  I have some wins in the Fitness realm just not enough to warrant attention yet it seems.  

That is assuming my emotional/ mental challenges, bad habits and basically not having a life  would allow for anything to happen....


I have looked for means but it's not that I want to die just that this existential pain and impatient that the changes will take or lack of a concrete plan..

Tldr  frustrated
