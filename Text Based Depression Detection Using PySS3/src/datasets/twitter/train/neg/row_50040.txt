Cross Posting For More Info*It was suggested I post here as well. I'm hoping there is more help here than other places I've posted.*


I'm lost here. I'm turning 29 in October and I've never even been close to having a girlfriend. The women I have been with were only ever flings ; There were hard expiration dates when they were moving and so they decided to pity fuck me. I long ago came to the conclusion that I'm going to be alone forever and that the least painful thing to happen in my life would be to kill myself. I'm ready to make that leap now. 

The point of my post is to try and help determine the best way to do this. The preferred method would be the least painful to all involved; I don't care about feeling pain myself but I'm hoping there will be some largely painless ways to do this.

Let me know your ideas;I'm hoping to figure something out before the weekend.

**tl;dr What's the least painful way to die?**


**Edit :** I'm really just looking for suggestions on what would be least painful for an individual if someone died. I don't care about my own pain; I want to end it in a way that's least painful for others.
