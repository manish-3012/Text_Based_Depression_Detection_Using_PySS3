I want to end my life but my ex is pregnantSorry for my bad grammar for this post.

Yes, that's right! The title is right. I was so very happy during our relationship. I was very emotional when she wants to break up with me. But now, I've realized that she gave me problems in life. I just want to leave her then one day she informed me that she's pregnant and I'm the father. Another problem, right? She is forcing me to face her parents and forcing me to tell my parents about the pregnancy. I'm asking her for help how to face them but she said "I don't know!! Just tell them!!" I don't know what to do. I'm about to end my life but this another problem came up.
