Haven't slept in 60 hours or more.I'm tired. Not just from insomnia, just in general. Never have energy. Never have drive. I'm tired of my mind. I'm tired of living inside of it. 

I tried, I really did. I made efforts to change aspects of my life. I fought the anxiety and depression. I'll be 32 tomorrow and I've been dealing with this shit since I was 15. Always got to watch everyone around me be happy. Gave people the best of me and I always got burned. I'm just there, nobody gives a fuck anyway. 

Tired of the substance abuse. That's how I've been coping, as a functional abuser. Cycles and breaks for years, teetering the line of rock bottom but somehow always got out. The bait and switch. Trading, bargaining. Killing myself slowly. 

Tired of not being able to fit in or make friends. Tired of always trying and then being burned. Tired of having to play games with people. Tired of my mind. My memory. It's amazing how I'm the only one who remembers shit. People just say what you want to hear, and that's it, they don't give a flying fuck.

I'm exhausted of living. My tank is dry. There's nothing left of me, that has been ensured. Tired of people taking. And taking. And taking. And I'm tired of my fucking mind, constantly living in expectation that maybe this time it'll be different. It never is. The constant disappointment is an absolutely disastrous depression loop. And people never remember. I do. I never forget. 

I'm tired.

I recently bought a research chemical online and I bought fentanyl test strips to test it. Obviously since everything is shit it was positive. But at least now I have a plan.
