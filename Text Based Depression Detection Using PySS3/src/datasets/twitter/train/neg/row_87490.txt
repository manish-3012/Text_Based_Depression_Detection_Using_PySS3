Coated in bloodSo last night I felt like self harming. But the kind of self harm that tells you to go try and dig for a vein. So I reached out to a crisis line I use and thy didnâ€™t help do I stopped and went out. My partner rang the police and they came and talked to me for a bit then left. I then rung them a couple of hours later needing help because I felt suicidal. When they were finally leaving they said if I rung the police again then I would be locked up for wasting police time. So that was it. I went and found myself a quiet spot away from everyone and everything and went to town with a razor blade on my arm and on my neck. So yadadada. Police turn up again, lock me in the back of their van and drive me to hospital. I get checked out and patched up with a few stitches along side it. I come home and nothing more put in place and still an possibility of me getting charged with wasting police time. 
Iâ€™ve always been frightened of jumping off bridges into water or fast moving traffic but after tonight I really arenâ€™t. 
I think that every service in my area has resigned me to turning up dead or killing myself and itâ€™s just a waiting game. So Iâ€™m gonna get some sleep and when I can get some time on my own Iâ€™m going to go find myself a bridge. 

Goodbye if this actually works this time and hope you all do well in this life, but for me I hope I do better in the next.
