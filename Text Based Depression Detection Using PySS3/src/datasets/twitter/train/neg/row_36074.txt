Midnight LibraryMidnight Library

I donâ€™t know if anyoneâ€™s familiar with the book, but (spoiler) basically the premise is that the main character tries to kill herself after experiencing heavy regrets and she does, but before she actually dies she gets to the â€œmidnight library.â€ And essentially there are an infinite number of books and each book has a different life where you made different decisions and youâ€™re allowed to stay in the one that you feel is â€œright.â€

Iâ€™m young (late teens) but man. Do I relate to the main character. I wish SO badly I could go to my own midnight library. I have many regrets that I wish I could change but itâ€™s too late to go back. I canâ€™t undo them. I struggle with basic decisions and I think the further I go in life the worse itâ€™ll get. I want to kill myself, but before I do Iâ€™d like to know what my life may have been like if I had done things differently. Maybe Iâ€™d be happier? Maybe Iâ€™d already be dead? Itâ€™d be great to just live in someone elseâ€™s life yet my own life, even if just for a bit.

Donâ€™t know if anyone else feels the same


side note: I wrote this before I had finished the book and I just finished it. I know that how Iâ€™m feeling isnâ€™t what the author intended but this desire is what really struck me. Itâ€™s a good book btw, I liked it.
