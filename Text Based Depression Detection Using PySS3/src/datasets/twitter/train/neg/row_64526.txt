I'm useless as a womanI'm 31 and I'm really tired of being alive and I just don't think I can do it anymore. My sister is younger than me and she just had a baby and he's very cute and good. I've been married for about ten years and we have been trying to have a child but I guess we can't. I'm tired of living I suck at being a person I should just kill myself already.
Then I live in the United States which is falling apart and even if I did have a child I don't have insurance and I guess that's not very responsible... But I mean crack whores and teenagers have children they don't even want and put them in toilets and dumpsters. I would never do that. I just want a real family. I hate myself now though and I wish I could just cut out all if the broken part of me. I'm so sad.
