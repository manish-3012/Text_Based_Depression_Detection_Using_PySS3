I'm really not okI cant think of a title right now, but I'm not doing too good. So for some context, I'm a 14 year old closeted trans male, and for a really long time, I've been thinking of lobbing myself over the head with a shovel. In the past, I cut myself over being trans. I've been in therapy for a little over a year, and it was helping, until I relapsed about a month ago. I haven't hurt myself yet, but I'm really fucking close. My mom just barged into my room, and started talking about the scars on my wrist. That really fucking triggers bad memories of when I did them, so I walked away and got yelled at for "trying to bury the past" and "being rude to my mother." I'm just so fucking sick of it, I'm sick of being the only problem my parents have, I just want them to be happy and no matter what I do everything I do is shit. Why the fuxk do I have to be the issue. If I was cis this shit wouldn't have happened. I want this to end. I'm seriously thinking about taking the blade out of a pencil sharpener and just getting it over with. I know I'm just being a whiny bitch but I want something, anything to live for. I'm so fucking tired.
