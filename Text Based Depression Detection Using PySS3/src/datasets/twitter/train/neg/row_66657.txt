It's Time to Stop ThisI've decided I am going to end my life next week. All my life I've felt the touch of that dark hand of depression on my shoulder and now I am submitting to it. The last 12 months have been horrific and this has all been brought on by myself so I've no one else to blame. I am going to enjoy the time with my little boy, I am going to a gig with a person very dear to me and once I return I am going to end this pain and sadness once and for all. I cannot see a way out of this pain and torture. I've been to counselling, I take the medication and I have tried to speak to family but they are incredibly angry at me and don't want to listen. I have 3 people who I can speak to and one of them is the counsellor. I've no friends to talk to. I love my little boy so so much but he doesn't deserve a dad like me. He needs stability with him mom and me out of the picture. I haven't a clue why I'm writing this here but I need to write down something in a public space as my brain is crying out to tell somebody, anybody.
