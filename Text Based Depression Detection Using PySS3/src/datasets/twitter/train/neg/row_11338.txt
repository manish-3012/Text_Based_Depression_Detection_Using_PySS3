My parents are driving me into suicide.I'm not an innocent little angel of a son, but every time we fight, they always manage to sour my mood, drop every bit of hope for a nice future and make me consider killing myself on the spot. 

Fuck you, you unfair pieces of shit. Let my voice be heard and listen to my side of the story before assuming shit.
