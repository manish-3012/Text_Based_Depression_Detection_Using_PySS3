Almost thereNear the end of school i was thinking of how i was gonna kill myself my mind became calm strangely enough after all the horrible thoughts. I started to think 'today im gonna do it im gonna take some pills lay on the couch and never get up again and everyone will think i was taking a nap' it was the closest I've gotten to doing it i felt too guilty to speak of it to my friend since i feel like ive bothered her enough and i dont want to make her feel guilty. Theres not enough pills
