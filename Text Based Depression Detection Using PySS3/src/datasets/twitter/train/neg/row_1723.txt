What do I have?What do I have... a question that keeps going through my mind. I have no friends, which seems dramatic to say but every time Iâ€™ve tried to make a connection it goes nowhere. Iâ€™ve had  medical bills looming over me for as long as I can remember, I am super broke no matter how hard I work. Paycheck to fucking paycheck and bill collectors on my ass always.

I hate my job, which who doesnâ€™t but this sucks the soul out of me and gives me endless anxiety.  I canâ€™t get over a break up that ended a while ago. No support. It seems Iâ€™m on my own always, Iâ€™m always there for people because I know the pain, but they never want to hear me out. Art is the only hobby Iâ€™ve ever loved but I feel nothing for it now. Nobodyâ€™s ever cared about my work anyways. 

Iâ€™m so tired guys, Iâ€™m so so so so very tired.

Iâ€™ve been thinking about ending it for a long time. The new decade is approaching and I feel nothing. No excitement, no goals to reach. Nobody to hold close, nobody to talk to, no money. I wish I wasnâ€™t such a fucking coward. Soon Iâ€™ll finally have some courage.
