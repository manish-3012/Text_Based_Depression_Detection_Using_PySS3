She's Lost Control AgainI can't believe it almost happened again so quickly. People always say "trust me, I'm just doing this as a friend." From my experience, people always lie when they say that. I try to be open minded &amp; forgiving, but why should I when my instincts are always proven right?

Here's what happened: I trusted an older man because I'm in a really bad spot. I used to be a heavy stoner &amp; he said he could get me some marijuana. Honestly I just wanted to feel that couch lock, ya know? 

Everyone says weed causes depression, but *not smoking* hasn't been curing my depression...so...I really just was hoping a couple hits would set my mind right.

(*Feels like I started cutting myself precisely because I haven't been high...but whatever.*)

Anyways. Of course, I ended up looking like a jack ass because I'm an idiotic, weak stoner.

I don't even want to talk about it. We didn't have sex-sex, but it was bad &amp; very easily could have been even worse.

I've cut myself 4 times already. And my brain is telling me to keep going. Because my pain hasn't fully materialized yet.

I feel so ashamed for trusting him. I really feel like I can't show my face around town now.

**I look forward to killing myself once camp is over.**

**None of you will stop me from killing myself, but I appreciate that you're giving me a place to vent while I wait in line for my chance.**

**For privacy reasons, I can't tell my full reasons for not being able to commit suicide right now...I'm sure some of you think I sound stupid for thinking I can't kill myself because of "camp"...but trust me, I can't until camp is over.**
