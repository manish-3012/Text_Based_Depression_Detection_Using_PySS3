Pain is the most relative thing there isI used to be a very happy person. As a kid, I didn't really have any issues. My parents were great and I had lots of friends. When I was 15, something happened that would eventually lead to depression and anxiety. It's really emberrasing so I won't get into it, but now I hate my self for giving a shit about it. So I was depressed, anxious and slightly suicidal  for about 2 years, until in November where my brain just.. changed. I was smoking weed and got a bad trip. From that moment I've not been the same person at all. It's like my depression and anxiety morphed into a thought, that I constantly have to think about. I can't enjoy a movie, and listening to music while doing other things is just tiring. Now I long for the days where I was "just" depressed and anxious. It felt really fucking great compared to this. But the funny thing is that what I'm feeling now is probably awesome compared to what someone else is feeling. I don't know if this helps anyone, but it's something to think about.
