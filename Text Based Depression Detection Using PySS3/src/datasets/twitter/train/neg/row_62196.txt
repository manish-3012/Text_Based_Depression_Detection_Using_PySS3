It's overI have nothing to live for or look forward too, I have no one, no talent, no use, and no hobbies. I don't enjoy anything and killing myself is all I think about. My future isn't bright so why should I even go on. I'm too much of a coward to cut myself so I'll probably just down a ton of meds. I wish their was another solution but this is all I have left. I hope whoever sees this can find joy in their life and not do what I'm gonna do
