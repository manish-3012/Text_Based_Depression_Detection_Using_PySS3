They make it look so easy...Living, you know? It's like... I don't know how normal people do it. I mean, it's a struggle to get myself out of bed and dressed every goddamned day; how do other people just breeze through a normal routine? I swear... I consider it a good day if I manage to get out of bed before noon, shower, dress, and eat at least one meal (using the term "meal" rather loosely) before I curl up in bed again and sleep for another 12 hours. 
And that's not even challenging stuff! If I have to make a phone call or fill out a form or something, I'm screwed. But other people just don't even think about it, like it's second nature. Why do I fail so miserably at just functioning on a base level?!
Like, I know I'm depressed and all that and I'm fatigued and can't concentrate, but it still feels like I missed out on my copy of "How to be a Functioning Adult, New Millennium Edition". What the hell?!
It drives me crazy that I don't even know how to handle boring, mundane, everyday life. It just makes even bothering to get out of bed even less and less worth it. I just want to sleep forever.
