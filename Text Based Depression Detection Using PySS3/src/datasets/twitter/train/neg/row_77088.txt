I quit seeking for help and even ranting about my state.Im writing this with this little mental strength I could find, I got tired of this. I quit seeking for solution to my situation, quit ranting due to just being tired. Cant leave because my mom would be sad if I did (Heh, I tried discussing this on r/AmITheAsshole but too tired). I am literally out of road. I can freely fucking kms now.

Quality of this post will get me 0 comments I assure you. 

Guess im going on another raiding spree - calling people cunts and nig*** across various subreddits. Its fun. (I dont blame anyone for my loss, its all more-less my fault)
