I will never be in a happy relationship.I have an awkward sexual orientation; I'm homoromantic-heterosexual. As the name implies, I basically only fall in love with guys, but only have sexual feelings for women. There are some exceptions; I can "like" a girl, and I am somewhat attracted to guys (just not below the waist).

So, I don't think that a long-term relationship is realistic for me. If I commit to a women, I will never love her. And, if I commit to a man, I will never be able to have a sex life.

I'd be ok with falling in love with a man, living together, and just rarely or never having sex. But, I know that no one else would be ok with that kind of life.

So, without love, is life worth living? I don't think so...
