i can never feel goodmy house is dirty,bug infested, dont even feel comfortable sleeping. im so sick of not feeling good in hygiene, health, wealth, etc. All I want is to win the lottery so I can help me, my family and maybe other families, if i had enough money. I know winning the lottery is next to impossible but  it's all I can count on. I have no energy and I work a shit job, I can never relax in this disgusting house. I'm just thinking of ending it, I bought a ton of lottery tickets and I don't even want to check if I won because I will just want to kill myself even more, i just want to keep fantasizing, but I can't keep fantasizing for long because I still feel depressed because of my surroundings. I just want to be happy. I want my bank to say 50+ million and I wanna get up to jeff bezos level and help the earth/people, unlike him.
