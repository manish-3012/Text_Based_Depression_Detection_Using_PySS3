I hope they report it as an accidental deathI dont think theres a single other person in the world who deserves this; i dont want anyone to copy me or to read it in the news and think this is okay.

I don't want any other to person to ever have to think of suicide as their only escape.

I don't want anyone to feel this trapped, this helpless, or to feel emotional pain that punctures your chest and lungs and heart, until it feels exactly like a physical bruising.

All I want is for a few people who know me to see that this is what their actions pead to, and I want them to know that so that they change--I don't want them to feel sad or anything.

But i've given up explaining and i dont know if theres anything i can do except this.

I have to teach them. I have to show them, they need to know. And i think, really, the only thing powerful enough to send them the message, would be my corpse.

Aside from them, though, i hope everyone else thinks it was an accidental death.
