received a bad call, now I'm contemplating againI am crushed. Just crushed right now. I want to stay alive inside, but I also want to sleep forever. I want to never wake up, and never hurt anyone again.

I relapsed today, I used the safety blade to cut myself. I dont even feel it anymore. Too much scar tissue, which makes it easy to accidently go too deep.

I just can't take this anymore. I can't take the guilt and the pain and the suffering, I can't get out of my head long enough to make it easier to want to live. I am currently very ill, I used black market THC carts and now have an acute lung injury that requires bed rest and oxygen, and steriods. All I can do is lay in bed and try and make myself want to stay here. But I dont know how I can do it.
