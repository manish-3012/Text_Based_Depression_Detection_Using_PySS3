Does anyone else feel this hopeless?Does anyone else feel the same way that I do? I am as lonely as they come. I have never felt in my life, like I fit in with anyone. Everywhere Iâ€™ve went, thereâ€™s always been someone(s) that didnâ€™t like me. I feel like I am a bit on the ditzy side and lack competence. Iâ€™ve always had issues with my weight and have always been invisible. Iâ€™ve never had true friends, even when I attempted to put myself out there and be friendly. As a result, I am completely alone. I donâ€™t get along with my family and live with my dog. I donâ€™t ever get asked out my guys and when I have, they were guys that I did not find attractive. What about me is so undesirable? Why am I so hopeless? It doesnâ€™t feel nice knowing that youâ€™re better off dead on a daily basis, contemplating and wondering â€œwhat ifâ€. Even after trying medication and counseling, I only end up feeling frustrated and as if I wasted my time. Anyone else relate?
