I was shadowbanned and then unbanned and I was really upset about it. I was sad and worried that I wouldn't be able to post here anymore or anywhere.Well I was shadowbanned from reddit but they fixed it for me because I guess I was caught by spam filters or something but now I'm back. I've been unbanned. I thought maybe I did something wrong but I guess I didn't. The reason I wanted to talk about it was because it actually made me really upset and I got pretty emotional over it. I was afraid that I would lose the place I come to and try to find support which just happens to be reddit for me. I have a lot of suicidal thoughts and other emotional issues and maybe this might not be the best place to come to but it's a place where I feel like I can come to and find people who understand how I feel. So I just wanted to share that because seriously I don't know what I would do if I lost a place of support. Sorry but that's just how I feel. So I'm glad I was able to get unbanned. I try to follow the rules and be a good person on here and not do anything bad because I wouldn't want to not be able to post here. So I just wanted to share how I feel because I already feel lonely and isolated enough from the world as is. Everything's just really hard man so I need people in my life who are understanding.
