I'm a 15 year old male with good grades, friends, and a stable family. I want to kill myself. On June 10, my History class is taking a field trip where there is a 300 ft drop. I am unsure as to whether or not I'll end up jumping, but I probably will. 
 I had some very strange ideas in my head as a younger kid, and I was more than likely schizophrenic. It hasn't bothered me in a long time, but now that I've started thinking about the future, I remember how I had always feared that things would get frustrating.
 Stress, expectations, and drama are all things that I fear about my later years in life. Death itself, which to me isn't scary,; as nothingness is not unpleasant; sounds a lot better. The worst part is how I feel as a self aware being.
 I feel as if I'm acting out a machine. Nothing really phases me like it used to, meaning I am constantly thinking about how I am flesh, a brain, floating on a rock in space; I was scared of the dark up until this all started happening.
 I figured I might as well post here, just in case.
