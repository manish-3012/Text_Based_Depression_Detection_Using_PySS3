16M depressed and lonelyBeen at home (only going out to theraphy) for the past 9 months after my 4th suicide attempt, after trying to slice my arm open, i spent about a month at a psychiatric (heavily medicated), none of my friends bothered while i suddenly dissapeared (i am the kind of guy that always asks to go out and hangout at night), after i told them a couple months after they seem to just leave me out of their  plans, i've been so depressed this last months and all this quarantine thing its making everything worse, i just wanna end it all... but i know that if i fail i'll end a couple of months in a psyquiatric... i dont know how much i'll last spiralling out of control... i've relapsed back to selfharming, these suicidal ideas are consuming me...
