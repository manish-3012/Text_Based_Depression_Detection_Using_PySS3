I loath my mother, and yet I must keep her in my lifeI loath my mother. She has betrayed me many times, yet I must keep her in my life because I have no money because I'm a shit human. My existence is not fulfilling. I prefer death to homelessness. I am a useless retard, she has made that clear. If only the government allowed death with dignity, then I wouldn't have to suffer. I only would live for about 100 years or so max anyway.
