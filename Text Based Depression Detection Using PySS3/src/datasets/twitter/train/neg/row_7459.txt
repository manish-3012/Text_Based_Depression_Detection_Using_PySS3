I don't know why I had such a bad dayRight about lunchtime I just got a dark, looming aura and I couldn't find a way to shake it. At first I thought it was anger, then maybe sadness, but it's just gotten worse and worse and I've realized it's not a specific emotion so much as an overwhelming negative sensation. It's gotten to the point where I just want to die. I got home and my mom yelled at me for being dramatic and not talking to her and acting sad, and asked me why the hell I wasn't walking the dog right now. My friends are mostly oblivious and the ones who aren't don't know what to do anyway.

If I had a certain way to kill myself, without the room to fuck it up, I'd take it. But my resources where I live are limited.

I'm sorry for rambling, I don't want to be a burden to anyone. I'm sure there are other people here who need help more than I do, but I just don't know where else to turn.

I feel like I haven't explained myself properly, either. I don't know how. I'm sorry.
