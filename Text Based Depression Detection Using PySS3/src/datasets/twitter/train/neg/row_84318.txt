Reasonable death (TRIGGER WARNING: child abuse)Please donâ€™t read this if you cannot handle the themes of child sexual abuse. 

There is a sickness inside of me, I have known about it for too long without having the courage to deal with it. No one would really suspect this kind of sickness from an adult woman that just reached her 20â€™s but unfortunately it has come down to it.

From a little girl it was pretty clear that I had thoughts of pedophilia and rape, it was hard to be around children younger than myself and even worse growing up, they just remind me of abuse. I must die, though I would never/have never hurt a child or have any inclination or desire to, the thoughts are still there and itâ€™s terrifying. I infantilise myself with men because that is normal to me and yet sex is very uncomfortable. My porn addiction had worsened around the age of 9-10? and by then it was already too late. Iâ€™m worried that Iâ€™m one of them, one of those monsters, too tainted for redemption.

I cannot count the amount of failed life attempts nor the pleas of death that have followed them. There is no one to go to and no one that could possibly understand. Iâ€™ll never be normal and to live such a life doesnâ€™t seem worth it. If you or anyone you know spots signs of child sexual abuse PLEASE report it, please do anything to protect that child because their suffering will know no bounds, there is too much suffering in this world and sometimes a victim can become the perpetrator.
