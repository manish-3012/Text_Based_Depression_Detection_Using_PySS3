I almost did it.I had the gun in my hand. But I was too much of a coward to do it. I just want a relief from the constant feelings of worthlessness and emptiness. The only reason I even try to keep going on is for my parents. I wish they were shit so I didn't care. I'm just a waste of space &amp; I hope when I close my eyes tonight, I won't wake up tomorrow. Sadly, I know I will. I just needed to write something out, because there's no one else I can talk to. Thought I had people who cared....they're no different than strangers.
