This weekend is it for me.Everything hurts and won't get better. Writing the notes, so people remember me, life won't ever be good, so why bother fighting? I'm sick of fighting. I'm tired. I'm scared of dying but god damn I'm not living either and that scares me more. For anyone who tried to help me, thank you, but I was always a god damn waste of time. Its over. It will finally be over.
