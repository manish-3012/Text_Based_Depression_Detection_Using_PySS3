Iâ€™m sorry.First of all, sorry for bad formatting and grammar. Iâ€™m on mobile and English isnâ€™t my first language.

I donâ€™t know where to start. I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 13. Started doing drugs, coke, Xanax, ketamine. You name it, I probably did it. And it worked, sometimes.

Fast forward to now. I turned 18 a couple of months ago. I no longer talk to anyone from my family. Lost my job 2 days prior to my birthday, and getting kicked out of my apartment in a couple days. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore, Iâ€™m so tired and lost. I donâ€™t want to live anymore, Iâ€™m such a worthless piece of sh*t. 
My days consist of constant panic attacks over nothing, even when my best friend comes over I start shaking and crying. Either that, or laying in bed all day long.

I canâ€™t take this anymore. I donâ€™t want to wake up to another day, to have to face another day of this. I donâ€™t think I can even remember last time I went a full day without crying. Iâ€™m so tired.

My friends donâ€™t even know. I try to tell them, but they donâ€™t listen or maybe they donâ€™t care. But then again, why should they..

I just want it to end so bad, I canâ€™t stop thinking about cutting again. Or maybe finally cut deep enough, actually finish something for once. I donâ€™t deserve to live. I have lived 18 long years and have nothing to show for it.
Please just let it end..
