I am so tired of short in tall countryI hate being 165, I live in the country where average height is 182. So tired of trying to be happy and positive while I am so jealous of my tall friends. Even the shortest girl in my class is about my height. I am ashamed that I hate my life and stressing about height, but I cant this anymore. To be even worse I am 17, Im going to stop growing soon. I always wanted to be all and happy now I know i cant be any of those.
