No specific reasonI have clinical depression (mdd) and I'm currently on medications because I thought it would lessen the impulse to do something reckless. It did. But honestly I feel suicide isn't that bad. I tried to think of a reason to be dramatic, loss of a family member, or a lover, but I don't love anyone to that extent. (I'm aroace btw, stands for aromantic asexual) Not sure if i'm going mad or just neurotic, idk. I want to end my life someday. I like to search up ways to kill myself. One fine day....
