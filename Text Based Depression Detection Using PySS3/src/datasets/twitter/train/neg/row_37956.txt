How are you all handling these news about the Corona Virus?I really wonder. I am worried over the possibility of my loved ones be afflicted by it.

This is something that is impacting strongly my job, and I also see the news and it is clear that the Chinese government are hiding way more casualties than they are letting transpire to the news media. By itself this is really a depressing thing to witness, from where I am standing, and I am seeing this all unfold beyond my eyes.

This allied with the lack of time I had to just socialize with my family and SO is really hitting me hard. I allways had suicidal thoughts from time to time, but now seeing that something that lurks on the air we breath, the people we meet, and so on, it is scary. I don't fear for me, honestly, but I fear for others. And I am powerless to do anything, I just stand-by and witness how such plague just spreads it's grasp over everything and anyone.

People, I know life is hard, but just stay safe. Not just for your own sake, but for the sake of all who you love.

A warm hug to you all.
