I don't want to be alone anymore and I just want to die.I've been alone for seven years now. I've been ostracized by my family since I was 11. I live alone by myself. I've been bullied ever since then. I recently broke up with my girlfriend and ever since then shes been spreading rumors about me. I've been trying to say they are false but the bullying has increased. I just want it all to stop. I just want to die.
