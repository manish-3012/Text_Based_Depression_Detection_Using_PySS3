I've been contemplating it for a while nowI don't really have many friends. I try to meet new people, experience new things. But nobody's ever interested in meeting me. Or learning anything about me. I've basically given up on love, which, before I "found" it, thought it would be the thing that brought me out of this, but it turned out like everything else in my life, too good to be true. I'm not an interesting person. My day consist of playing video games and watching videos. I try to get away from it. Tried working out, hanging out with people. But nothing really works. Hell, i'm even too boring for people on the internet to want to talk to. I have no motivation to do anything. All the people around me asking me what I want to do with my life, and if I'm going to college, etc etc. But I don't evem know.

I'm sick of not having someone to talk to. I'm sick of getting an hour or two of sleep every night. I'm sick of staying in bed all day because I don't know. I've already tried calling the suicide hotline. I've been to a psychiatrist. And now my suicidal thoughts are worse than ever. Only thing keeping me from offing myself is that my family would miss me. I'm just tired.
