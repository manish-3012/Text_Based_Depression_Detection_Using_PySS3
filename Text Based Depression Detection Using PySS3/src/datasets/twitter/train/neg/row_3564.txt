Nearing the end of the road...So...  


  
I've been battling with depression for quite some time...  


I feel like I am at loss for what i can do..  


  
Cant get a job which means i dont have any economy at all... which means im basically homeless...  


I dont live in US, and wont tell where im from... As im not looking for help... Im just saying that..  


im 20... been depressed since i was 9... 11 years with depresson... i feel like i should be allowed to let the rope go...  


Ill stay alive for another week... just walking, untill i hit the perfect spot to jump...  


  
Ive already tried to take my life 3 times...   


Profesional help gets me more depressed..  


Out of options redditors... so wish you all the best onwards!  


Could of written better.. but whats the reason? Just felt like writing this somewhere...
