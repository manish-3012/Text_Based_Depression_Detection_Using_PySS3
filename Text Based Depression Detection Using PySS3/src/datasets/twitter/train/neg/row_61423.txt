I'm a failure at lifeI'm 27, and I think about how I want to kill myself daily.

You can say I have unrealistic expectations. I wanted to go to college despite being poor. My family made around $120k a year on paper when I was young and filling out the FAFSA, but they were living paycheck to paycheck and didn't have a cent for me. In their income bracket, there was no financial aid available for me other than heaps of private loans. I was so stressed out about how much I owed in student debt that I missed the big picture. I just went with an easy major so I could get out faster. And now I'm stuck with a degree that qualifies me for bullshit jobs along with the debt.

I wish I had a way to turn my brain off and stop feeling like there should or could be something more for me. Under different circumstances, I would have become some kind of researcher, maybe even a doctor. I know loads about medicine and studies that have been done in social psychology.

It's easy to say I should just go back to school when you're rich and/or have the connections needed to do so, which I am not and do not have. And it's also easy to say, "Congratulations, you realized what it's like to be an adult. Now shut up and live in misery until you can retire like everyone else."

I really just want to die and make it look like an accident somehow. Life is just not worth living. I don't care about having a relationship, any material goods, a house, a nice car, or anything else that keeps people motivated. I'm just ready to accept my losses and mistakes and check out for good.
