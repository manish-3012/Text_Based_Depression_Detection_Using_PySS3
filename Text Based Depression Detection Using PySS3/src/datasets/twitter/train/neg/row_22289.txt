Suicidal Thoughts becoming more frequentI've had a battle with depression before, now the demons are revisiting me. I've been thinking about suicide more frequently lately again and it's becoming increasingly scary. 

I'll just do something normal and suddenly I'll be contemplating suicide, just to shake it off again. Not often, but increasing in frequency over the past 2 months.
It's not like I'm actually planning it, it's just a silent thought that immediately disappears again.


I feel like it's time to get help.
