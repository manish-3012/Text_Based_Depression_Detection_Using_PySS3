Thank yâ€™all for keeping my ass aliveYâ€™all mfs really care. Iâ€™m 14M (nearin 15) and just started really getting better and happier or at least less suicidal and depressed and stopped cutting after being in a really dark place. I tried to stab myself to death but passed out before I could finish it and I always said I would never regret suicide (or attempting it) and I donâ€™t, necessarily, but I am glad Iâ€™m still here bc even though it wasnâ€™t worth the suffering, Iâ€™m better now. My parents donâ€™t give a fuck. My girl dumped my ass. I woke up in a pool of sticky, brownish blood and no one had even bothered to open the goddamn door to my room and see why I hadnâ€™t left my room by 2pm and it didnâ€™t get better right away. It never will, especially not all at once, but it could always get better (as well as worse). I was lucky I guess but I think I owe my survival mostly to my few real ass friends and yâ€™all here on r/SuicideWatch. Thank yâ€™all for keeping my sorry ass alive long enough to get better. Even though it wasnâ€™t worth it to have suffered all that shit just to be happy ish now and maybe even happy fo real in my future (that I have thanks to yâ€™all and my friends), i am glad Iâ€™m here and pretty happy now. So quarantine has been a crazy motherfuckin ride. Thank yâ€™all again for helping me out. Iâ€™ve finally started the path to recovery and I hope to have some updates on my mental health and possibly self harm (and hopefully lack thereof) if anything worth posting happens
