I know its the meds, but I don't careI started the antidepressant Russian roulette when I was 15 years old. I was cutting, suicidal and in a relationship that was emotionally and sexually abusive. That relationship ended when I was 17. At that point I had been on and off several medications. I was hospitalized in 2010 after planning my suicide and cutting my arm pretty bad, was groped/ assaulted earlier that year. Started Zoloft. Got up to 250mg. Stayed. 

I was okay for a while and then I started feeling dead again.

Talked to a psychiatrist, okay, we will switch meds. Go down to 150mg immediately, be off in two weeks. 

I'm either crying or throwing up or wishing I could kill myself. I can't keep doing this. I know med changes fuck you up but I feel exactly like I did in 2010. The exact same. Is this just who I am if I'm not pumped with meds? Can I keep living like this?

I hate talking. I hate therapy. I just want to disappear.
