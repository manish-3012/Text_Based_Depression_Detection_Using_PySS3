I just wanted to belong.I can't even kill myself, I lost the strength to cut, my hand goes weak everytime I hold the blade, I can't find the pills, and those are the two thing I tried over and over but didn't die(damaged my liver though).


Whomever I talk to, says I need attention, I am doing this for attention. Well, they're not wrong but they're not right either. I used to do this for attention, if I still did, I would have cut myself and wouldn't try to hide the scars, but I don't care about attention anymore, I don't want the temporary thing. The reason I haven't cut yet because I know I can't cut deep enough, my body's anti-self destruct mode is stronger.


I just want this to end now, no drama, I don't wanna put myself through the torture of trying to brutally murder myself, I don't wanna live either, don't wanna put myself through endless torture for 50 more years.
Just wish there was some assisted way that could help me end this. Assisted death, guess I am not lucky enough for a terminal physical disease to get that opportunity. 


This is just pure torture by the 'normal' people. Making me go through this while they fit in and actually have a life. While I, binge-watch one thing after another, play some games, lock myself in my parents house for years, trying to forget about my existence as much as I can throughout the day, switching to and from those activities. Literally, this is my 'life'. I need that escape, please help me get that escape.
