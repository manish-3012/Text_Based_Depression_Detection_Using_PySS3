Will I do it or am I all talk?I don't know anymore, going through the endless cycle of depression and thoughts of ending it all. But lately I keep thinking about if I could actually do it, actually do something to harm myself permanently.  Is suicide couragous or cowardly? Fuck it I guess....I don't matter anyhow
