i haven't eaten for 14 daysi feel okay i just don't want to eat anymore. no one has noticed i'm not eating and i don't really want to say anything. after so long with nothing i think if i ate anything now it'd make me sick so it's scaring me if i were to eat something.

i've researched into starvation and your body eats your fat to live. i'm kinda chunky so i guess i have longer than someone skinny. i don't feel weak or anything and the weight loss is nice. i want to tell someone but i don't want to be forced into eating so i just keep quiet and so far no one has noticed.

i just needed to tell someone...
