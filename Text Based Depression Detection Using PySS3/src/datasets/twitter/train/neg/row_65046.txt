Can anyone help or give advise? Please, anyone. Thank you for reading.I am a 46 year old male and i do not want to carry on living. I have lived with Bipolar Depression all my life and I am now living day to day with no home, no job, no friends, no family, in so much pain with moles appearing on my body which I suspect are cancerous as cancer runs in the family. I have attempted suicide by overdose several times but have been unsuccessful. I don't have much money left and am just day to day struggling, really tired, in pain, extremely depressed and just living a pointless solitary life which is interminable now and I just want to die without it causing trauma to anyone who might find me or have to clear up my body. I don't know what I can do. I have safe accommodation for the next three days in Nottingham City Centre but after that I don't have anywhere to go, anyone to talk to or any reason to live. Can anyone talk?
