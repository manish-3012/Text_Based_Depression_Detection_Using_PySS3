I don't deserve to liveHey SW... I kinda feel dumb just writing this. Sorry for any grammatical errors and typos. Not a native speaker and I'm shaking all over rn.

Okay I don't even know where to begin. I'm a Transgirl (born male) and I'm 19 years old. I've always been a social punchbag for all the "cool kids" in school and I've developed a strong hate against myself and almost every person ever. I can't stop feeling uncomfortable around other people. I wanna be the not-quiet type of person but I just can't do it. I can do it with people I know well but not just a normal stranger or whatever... I fucking hate myself for this, because I haven't felt "love" in years and I feel like I never will... I always feel like I don't have any chance at all. I'm a fat piece of shit, who looks disgusting, too. And now that I've outed myself as trans I get even more hate. Also I can't get myself to lose weight, because I'm eating like a black hole when I'm depressed. My room looks like shit, because I can't get myself to clean it. I don't have any friends irl whatsoever and I even can't do the things that I liked once. Like drawing or making music. When I start drawing I throw away the sheet in anger and the same with my instruments. I feel like the only way to continue now is killing myself. I tried it three times in a different way and it never worked (either bc i was too dumb or just because i was hesitating or i had luck) but this time everything is planned through perfectly. I'm still hesitating a little bit, but the more i think about how my life was up until now and how my life is probably gonna be, I'm getting more ready. I'm just a big fat piece of shit who doesn't deserve to live at all.
