My life is in danger and nobody fucking knows.I honestly don't know how I'm going to make it through today. I'm at work and feel like I'm about to crash and lose my shit and have a total breakdown in front of everyone. I feel the urge to scream and hide and cry and stab myself all at the same time. I have an appointment with my psychologist set up for tonight, the only person who knows about this, but that feels so far away from right now.

&amp;nbsp;

Suicide is weird. Some days I'm overwhelmed with the need to murder myself, other days I just need it to end and want to die. I never realized before that there is a huge difference between wanting your pain to stop by any means, and wanting to murder yourself. It keeps going back and forth and gets all mixed up, I think I'm losing my mind.

&amp;nbsp;

Even typing this feels like trying to walk through a wall of rushing water. I just need it to end. It has to end. I can't hold on any more.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I wrote the stuff below when my mind was more sound. Feels relevant.

&amp;nbsp;

NO ONE KNOWS how awful I'm doing because I can't talk about it without risking my relationships/job/etc. So instead I lie and just say I'm sick, the kind of sick that they understand, and sometimes I even start to believe it. I would way rather be sick, sick is simple. People get that sick people can't do everything healthy people can. I hate not being able to convincingly tell people that I can't handle anything outside of my bedroom today without lying.

&amp;nbsp;

Like, if I have a migraine, I can just say "sorry I have a migraine :(" and that's it, no questions asked. Don't get me wrong, I've had lots of migraines, and they are awful, I wouldn't wish them on anyone, but I would still take chronic migraines over this any day.

&amp;nbsp;

If I have a migraine, people don't get mad and confused and expect me to explain further, or think I'm up to something or being passive aggressive or snotty. "I just can't go. Wish I could, but I have a migraine." Simple as that.

&amp;nbsp;

People feel compassionate and understand your pain when you have migraines. They bring you food and worry about you and hope you feel better soon. I wish there was something I could say that would incite that level of understanding with people when I'm having a bad day because of mental health reasons.

&amp;nbsp;

With this, at best they get uncomfortable and quiet. More likely they get confused and put off and start to distance themselves from you unless you make it up to them somehow. You owe them if you unload this shit on them.

&amp;nbsp;

It's not fucking fair.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:** Slipping and don't know what to do, need help.
