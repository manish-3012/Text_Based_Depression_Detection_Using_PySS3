I want to die, but I donâ€™t want to be remembered this way.Itâ€™s been so many years of depression and PTSD, and it just hurts every day to keep on going. But I donâ€™t want to leave everyone behind, and have them think of me as this messy wreck thatâ€™s taken my place. I donâ€™t even remember who I am.
