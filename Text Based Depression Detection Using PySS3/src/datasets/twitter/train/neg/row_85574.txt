It's been 3 years...3 years ago today, almost to the time, my best friend committed suicide. Losing him was absolutely the worst thing I've had to deal with in life. I've learned on this sub, and I've tried offering support to others in this sub. No single life goes unnoticed. Every single life will be missed. Even if you think it wont. There aren't problems that cannot be fixed, or helped. If you need help, reach out and find it. I love you all. 

Â â€œOne day youâ€™ll wake up and things wonâ€™t hurt as bad. Youâ€™ll be able to remember the good things about your friend and not just the end. For me, thatâ€™s when I knew I was finally able to move on.â€Â
