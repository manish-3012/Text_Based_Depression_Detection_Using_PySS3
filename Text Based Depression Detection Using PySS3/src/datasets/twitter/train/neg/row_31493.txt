I will do it.I have already tried but rope has been torn apart and survived when i hang myself. My family tried to help me through this phase but the problem was them. They always opressed my thoughts, my feelings and my aims. They always obliged myself to be a person they want, not what i want. When i tried to leave and make my own life bymyself they just started to use my feelings to my mother who has done a lot to save us from financial and emotinal bad situtations. 

I just don't like the feeling of living anymore. After some certain point I have started to lie to make them happy, make the people around me happy about me but I haven't felt that feeling more than 5 years. Now my lies gone out, I am feeling nothing. I can't find myself, I just don't have anything live through this life anymore. All i wanted to do was get out, make a life of my own and try. But that was just too much for people around me and i cannot stay when i make people sad. At this point, i won't make them sad. I will just be gone. 
There is rant. There is rage. I have already tried it and felt nothing. No regret, no missing. Nothing. 

I will just do it and get rid of everything.
