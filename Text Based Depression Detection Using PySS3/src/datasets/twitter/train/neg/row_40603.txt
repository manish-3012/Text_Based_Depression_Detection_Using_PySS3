im scared of myself. i don't think im in control anymore.I'm trans. I'm 18 and still go to high school.

The last year has been absolute hell for me. I did get my surgery out of the way but other than that im a mess. I can't function anymore. All my "friends" never bother to talk to me or even remotely care about me. I'm more of an afterthought for people. I do not have anyone around me who I could consider a friend that actually cares. Maybe I think like this because I have trust issues and my bpd makes me think everyone hates me whenever im in a slump. I'm so incredibly lonely. My pyscholgist isn't exactly there for me whenever I want to do something fun. Although she is the only one I can open up to without worrying about the emotional weight I'm putting on someone.

People make roumers about me. People don't really act authentic towards me. I'm tired of the stares and hate. 

I have been bipolar ever since my early teens. However, for the past two weeks I can't get out of this slump. My suicidal thoughts have increased and I'm honestly scared I might do something that I'll regret. I'm to scared to tell anyone because I do not want to bother anyone with this. I feel like if I do I would lose a friend because everyone would stop talking to me due to me being depressed all the time. Nobody wants to constantly talk, be friends or hang out with a depressed person.
