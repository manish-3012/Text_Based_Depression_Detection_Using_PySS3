I Give Up.I just can't do this anymore.

Since August, I've been struggling with the job search from *hell*. Day in and day out, 100's of resumes but only 2 interviews. I'm down to the last little bit of money ($100 tucked away in the pocket of my phone case) and I don't want to spend it on anything.

I've sold almost everything I own just to stay afloat, but I'm running out of possessions. I'm down to my TV, my hockey equipment, and my Xbox One. Those are all the things I have left in the world.

I'm unable to cry, but I feel sadness. I'm beyond desperation - that's for people who still have hope. I have none left.

This, combined with the miserable failure that I've become and every other garbage thing that has happened this year, is starting to weigh on me.

I sleep most of the day, I don't eat well any more and it's a miracle I haven't burned my way through the remaining supply of alcohol I have in the cabinet or started smoking again.

I'm struggling to find a reason to bother continuing with anything. Normally, I'd think of my wife and kids, but even that isn't doing it for me anymore.

That I've made it to the gym twice this week or am still somewhat interested in hockey is a miracle, but given that I'll be unable to meet my financial obligations by the new year, that will change quickly once I've hit rock bottom.

I care so little about everything at this point that I just want it all to end. I haven't the slightest care about the fallout or what I'm leaving behind, which is nothing to be proud of anyways, so that part doesn't  bother me so much any more.

I just can't do this anymore. I don't want to. I have no more fight left in me.

I want out.
