She would have been 21 todaySomeone who I cared about a lot killed themselves this January. It affected me more that it should have. I had to drop out of school. I was in and out of programs and therapy, all sorts of meds. I thought I was getting better but in March I went to the place I heard about her death and everything came back at once. I donâ€™t remember much but I know I tried to kill myself and spend several days in ICU. Iâ€™ve been doing so much better. But today is going to be hard. I feel so stupid letting this affect me so much, after all the work Iâ€™ve gone through to get through my trauma. I know attempting again wonâ€™t help anything but I just want to stop having to relive those three months of torture. I miss you Maya.
