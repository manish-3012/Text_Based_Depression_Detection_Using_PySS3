I don't know how to help my friend.I have been friends with this guy for a couple of months, and I wouldn't have picked him to be.. well, the way he is. He came across as a normal, happy person. After getting to know him more, he confided in me that he has had suicidal thoughts before. 
He also has bouts of depression which I didn't think much of until they happened more and more, and I started to read more about clinical depression, which rings close to home when I think about the way he acts. Sometimes he can't be bothered doing anything. His logic is that nothing matters in the end, so he may as well die now or not bother with life at all. 

I've tried to talk to him about this, but it's hard to bring up as it's a sensitive thing to talk about. I've told him that I take this very seriously, and will be willing to help him in whatever way I can, and that he is not a burden. I've made myself open for him to talk to, and I don't think he tells many other people, if any, the stuff he tells me so that must mean he trusts me in some way. Most of the time he doesn't talk about it though, and I don't know if it's a good thing or not. I understand that he needs time to himself to think about things, but most of the time this means skipping university and spending the day alone, which just worries me even more. I want him to be able to socialise more and not be burdened with the thoughts that he thinks, but I don't know how to go about it. I don't know if I should be more assertive, or if I should leave it completely up to him.
