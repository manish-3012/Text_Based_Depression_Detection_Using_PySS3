I want to kill myselfI donâ€™t know what to do or who to ask for help. I work about 70 hours a week and spend basically all my off time drinking and binging/purging (Iâ€™m Bulimic). 

Iâ€™m really depressed and have gained some weight. Iâ€™m currently fasting and decided that if I end this fast and donâ€™t feel better or if I gain even one more pound, Iâ€™m going to kill myself. 

I guess thereâ€™s no point. I just at least want to be thinner again so I can be happy about one thing in my stupid life.
