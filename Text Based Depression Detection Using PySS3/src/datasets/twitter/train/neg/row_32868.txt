My friend jokes that he wants to kill himself and I donâ€™t know it heâ€™s serious, and if he is I need to know how to be there for him to get him away from this precipice.My friend and I have been quarantined together for about two months now. We are very close, he is like a brother to me. 
Some history: He has been on antidepressants for a while now and regularly has meetings with his therapist once in two weeks. He has anxiety and whenever I can, I try to get him to calm doen if he is having an anxiety attack. I have not met anyone else with anxiety and I sometimes feel I donâ€™t know how to handle a situation to make it better for him. 
A few weeks ago he made a suicide joke. I laughed with him but let it slip that if he ever needs to talk I am here. He told his therapist that heâ€™s been getting suicidal thoughts and then he gave me his pills, so I could give them to him , once a day, which is prescribed to him. 
Lately, heâ€™s been making more suicidal jokes and when I get serious, he does not answer straight. 
I have not dealt with this ever and I want to do everything to help him. I am willing to put other things on hold for a while if it means getting him better. But I donâ€™t want him to close up if I talk about this. 
I need advice on how to broach this topic with him and what to do if he brings it up. Even if he is really just joking, i want him to know that I am there and that suicide is not an out. I am open to advice and helpful tips to help someone going through this. 

TL:DR - Friend is having suicidal thoughts and makes jokes about suicide, need advice on how to handle it in a healthy way without making him feel victimised.
