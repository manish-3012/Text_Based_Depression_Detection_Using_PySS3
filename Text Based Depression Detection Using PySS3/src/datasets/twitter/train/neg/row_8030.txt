I can't live up to my own standards and it's killing me.I just don't know what to do. I have a semester long project that I worked on, got the data, but as I write it up, I hate it too much to finish it. I see it as not useful, not well done enough, not as good as other peoples' likely are. I feel like I am a sham by turning this in and its terrible. I keep rushing on these final assignments in classes I have gotten **A'S ALL SEMESTER IN**. I feel like a sham and a failure and I can't bear the thought of getting a poor grade. Why can't I just get this shit done? Why do I keep getting worse? If I can't keep consistently improving, no grad program will want me, no job will want me, no one will want me. I am too damaged to make anything good out of my life! If I feel bad for myself I hold myself back, if I move forward I get exhausted and can barely continue. 

I feel like if I am anything less than outstanding, I am useless and I *DESERVED* every little bit of hell I went through as a child. All the times I was put down, ignored, beaten, I deserved every last fucking bit of it. I feel like I am trying to finish graduate level work while combating FUCKING PTSD. I just can't take it! Nothing I ever do feels like it'll ever be enough. Why can't I just get better? Why can't I have the time to recover? 

I wish I had offed myself like another student at my school did. I can't accept myself as being a waste, I would rather die.
