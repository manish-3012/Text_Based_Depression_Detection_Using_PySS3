it doesnti hear it all the time. youre not saying anything groundbreaking. ive thought it over so many times. ive been in this spot so many times. ive already convinced myself that it doesnt get better. i was never ok in the first place. abusive parents for forever, molested age 8, selfharm ages 13-current, eating disorders ages 7-current, manipulative relationships ages 8-13, suicidal thoughts ages 10-current, anxiety and panic attacks ages 10-current... must i go on? it doesnt. i wasnt meant to be okay and i am suffering. i will never have friends again. i will never have personality again, i will never. this is no way to live. i cant i cant i cant i cant i peaked at age 14 and im killing myself age 16. its ok! i can admit it! i can move on! fucking bye 

fuck you jamie
