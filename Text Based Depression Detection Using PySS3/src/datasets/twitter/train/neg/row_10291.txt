I'm (25f) depressed as hell right now. I need it to stop.The only person I want to talk to about this is someone I can't contact at this time of night, and I probably shouldn't put the responsibility of talking to a depressive on this person. 

I just don't know who the fuck to talk to, or what the fuck to do.
