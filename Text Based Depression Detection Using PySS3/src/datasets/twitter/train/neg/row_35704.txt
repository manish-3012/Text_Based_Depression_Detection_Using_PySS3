Ready to give upI'm a junior in college and completely miserable. I had depression and anxiety since high school. My parents never understood my problems and are helicopter/tiger parents. I've been through therapy, medication, and recently I went to one of the best mental hospitals in my state with no luck. I used to be such an ambitious person that did really well in school, and now I'm failing all of my courses with no motivation to continue. I'm in a major chosen by my parents that I hate and don't feel motivated to start all over again. I have no friends and all my other resources (therapists/psychiatrists) are incredibly booked for me to get an appointment soon. I want to withdraw from school, but I don't know what I'll do, especially if I have to go live with my parents. I hate everything about myself and my life and can't picture myself getting better in the future. So many people have told me almost every year that it gets better, but it's only gotten worse for me. I don't know if I want to live with depression/anxiety anymore, especially having no one to talk to. The only reason I haven't attempted suicide yet is because I'm too scared for it to fail. Just don't know what to do anymore
