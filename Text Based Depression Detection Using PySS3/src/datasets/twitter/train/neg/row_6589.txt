How do I disappear without leaving any traces to my body?I've decided when and how I'm going to kill myself. Next weekend when everyone is busy I'm going to disappear into the mountains near the Columbia River Gorge and shoot myself. What's the best way to leave zero trace and no clues as to where my body might be?
