Something's wrong if so many people feel the same...I need help explaining. I cant do it alone. But theres something wrong if we all feel like this. And it feels like theres no end. There is no more happiness, wasn't built to understand that feeling or something. I'm not suicidal, but I feel so helpless, to myself and everyone who needs help who are just like me. I'm sorry I can't help. Its hard for me to understand in the first place.....
