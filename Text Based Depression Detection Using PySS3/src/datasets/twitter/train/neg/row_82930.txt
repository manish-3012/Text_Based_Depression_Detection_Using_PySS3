I donâ€™t want to live, but Iâ€™m too afraid to die.I have a family, and I love them, theyâ€™re honestly the only thing that keeps me going sometimes.


But I will eventually have to watch them all die. Am I just delaying the inevitable? I know that I donâ€™t honestly think I could survive the pain knowing theyâ€™re gone.
