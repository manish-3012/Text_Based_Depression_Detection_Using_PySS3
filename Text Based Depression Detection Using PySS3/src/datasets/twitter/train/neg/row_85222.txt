Most Days I try to be Positive but at the end I regret that I didn't Kill Myself Years Ago.To be honest right now I know I am stuck in my ways and I am a useless worthless wretch of a human. 

I have become unfit, dumb, dulled, and an irritable mess of a person. Every single thing I tried to make myself happy or succeed in  or  Most days I just want someone to kill me or to just disappear as I have no use to this world or anyone around me. I should go to where I belong, dead or in a grave as it is not like I have a future. Any talents or skills I had I have lost and it seems I destroy or annoy and ruin all the things around me.

I cannot even bring myself to focus mentally for my own job and I just feel worse and more tired. I am just so tired of being utterly worthless and useless at my job and at my home and it feels like everyone around just despises me and it keeps me around out of pathetic pity.

&amp;#x200B;

There are days I try to tell myself I can redeem myself, that I have a future, that I can get good at something and be productive, but deep down I know that is all a lie that I just cannot believe anymore as I am just too dumb to become good at anything.   


Most days I just play video games and watch YouTube even at work as that is the only thing that keeps the bad thoughts or from just walking off and trying to jump off a building again. Heck I walked out of work and spent minutes almost 30 minutes in my car debating whether to try to jump off something again or quit my job.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the time I don't know how to deal with this or sort this out or even try to cope anymore. I just feel tired, lost, and mostly defeated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have felt all these feelings before but nowhere near as bad, each time I get through it I don't feel accomplished or stronger at all, just more tired and most times I just wished I killed myself earlier so I at least feel like I died feeling like a human.

I know this is all just a bunch of incoherent rambling, I think I am just trying to just vent before I either die or decline further mentally although I don't feel like much of a real person anymore more like a dulled, psychopathic shell.
