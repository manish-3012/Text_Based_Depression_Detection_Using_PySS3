Feeling too lonelyI have couple friends but we never hang out maybe once a month, thats the only time we talk. For me its important to talk to friends but if they dont want what can i do. I stay most of my days alone in my room, i live with my parents and thats problem that cant be solved. I feel so much anger at everything every day and it stacks inside  of me thats the only feeling i feel these days i think. Im emotionless exept for anger and living like that is not life cuz i just dont live. During night i dreamed about killing myself, it was not bad dream. When i woke up i started thinking about that and it looks like fucking good idea almost no negative side. I wanted to hear other pupils opinions on suicide and loneliness and how could i overcome that anger's domination in my head?
