I can't stop thinking about suicidal thoughtsI'm going through an extremely dark time in my life right now. I'm having visions of killing myself. I was never like this and I normally guide others through their dark times. I feel like there is no way out except this. Everytime I hope things would get good, they don't. I'm tired of being optimistic only to have it crushed again and again. 

I can't really go out for therapy right now. I need help or a hug anything will do .
