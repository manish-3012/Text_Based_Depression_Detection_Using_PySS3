I'm starting to lose hope and feeling scared about my future.I was really happy today that my wife emailed me saying she and my daughter loved me, that brought my spirits up.

But it is so difficult to pay for them, I need a well paying job as soon as possible. 

I have a BA in Economics a Masters in Business, and I am living off 20k from when I got stabbed. But I live in a halfway house and life is so stressful. I have two dismissed charges that always pop up in background checks and I feel I will never get enough money to pay for my family. I do not understand why my life needs to be so difficult. I keep hoping and I keep trying.  It is going to be sad but I feel if I don't start making money soon I will be out of the game come Spring/Summer. I don't know what to do. My life is so difficult I am 28 and they don't make it easy to live in USA. I don't understand why I have so much difficulty. I don't understand why no one ever wants to hire me. Why no one ever wants to take care of me. Why no one ever wants to be friends with me. 

Why am I such a worthless person in the eyes of everyone I interview with.  Why does this have to be so difficult.
