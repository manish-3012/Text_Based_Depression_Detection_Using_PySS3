Why not?Seriously, just why not? I've tried twice and just got out of 9 days of inpatient because I was going to try again. I was feeling better in the hospital but now I'm out and everything seems even worse and now I have no privacy either. I've tried therapy and medication and now hospitalization, so what am I supposed to do now that everything still sucks? It's not fair that people won't let me just do it.
