Tried killing myself and it ruined my lifeI tried killing myself almost three weeks ago. I agreed to inpatient treatment and then while I was in the hospital, my fiance left me and took one of our dogs, I've been off work for three weeks and I'm losing the house and now I have to have ECTs three times a week until my doctor says different. 

I should of just killed myself.
