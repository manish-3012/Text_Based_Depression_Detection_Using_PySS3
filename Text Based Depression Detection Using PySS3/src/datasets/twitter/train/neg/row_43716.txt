Should I call a hotline ?I am consistently at the conclusion that I should kms and am capable and I have a plan to do it but am not currently in a situation where I am in an emergency so to speak. Thereâ€™s nothing really for me to calm down from itâ€™s more just like a philosophy or a state of mind than a feeling and i donâ€™t want to waste their time when they deal with people who are in more urgent situations so should I still call?
