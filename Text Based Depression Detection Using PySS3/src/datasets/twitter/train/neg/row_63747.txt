fuck the world&gt;I can be a warm sun

&gt;Let my rays only shine on your grace

.

&gt;I can be untiring bedrock


&gt;Let you stand on my spine all your days

.

&gt;I can be an expansive ocean


&gt;Gently shallow or brutally deep

.

&gt;Loyal devotion


&gt;Let me drown in all that you need


&gt;But I can't connect with nothing real

.

&gt;My love, so sweet, it keeps me innocent and blind


&gt;My heart, it beats but it can't find somewhere to be at peace

.

&gt;I got the feels

.

&gt;I just want to be your moon


&gt;Glint your eye when the heavens are dark


&gt;but this distant satellite 


&gt;wont receive your transmissions at all


&gt;and I can't connect with nothing real

.

&gt;My love, so sweet, it keeps me innocent and blind


&gt;My heart, it beats but it can't find somewhere to be at peace

.

&gt;I got the feels

.

&gt;This morning's sun is stepping on my head


&gt;and I know better than to fuck with it

.

&gt;I should take this rope off from around my neck


&gt;but in this moment my spirit has never felt so free

.

&gt;Fuck the world, I got the feels
