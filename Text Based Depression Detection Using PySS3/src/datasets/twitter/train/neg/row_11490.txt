Friends?I'm in a pretty dark place right now and I was wondering if anyone has tips on making friends? I keep losing them and I fear that I will end up alone in life and I get very upset when I'm alone. My imagination has been acting up and I see a lot of dark shadows and feel watched. I feel like something wants me to die. I know that sounds crazy. I think I just need to make more friends but I'm incredibly shy to approach people by myself. I've also kind of lost any drive to live, it's become nihilistic almost. I just don't see the point in living when I won't impact the world when I die. I won't leave anything behind so why keep living with pain? I have had chronic abdominal pain and I've seen a few doctors for it but they don't find anything wrong so I don't know how to fix it. I'm just not really sure why I should spend the next thirty or whatever years in a job that makes money for me to survive. I will spend my whole life trying to make money to survive and then die. What's the point of it all?
