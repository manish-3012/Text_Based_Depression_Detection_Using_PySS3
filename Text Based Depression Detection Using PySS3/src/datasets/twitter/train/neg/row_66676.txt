Finally decided how and whenSome context: my boyfriend left me out of the blue a month ago and soon after made every effort to ignore my existence. He was my best friend before we got together. He literally made life better by existing, even when we argued. He made life feel more exciting. I don't have much support. I tried talking to a friend about it who only told me to stop moaning and get over it. 
I've cried everyday since he left. I hate how my existence made him miserable. I hate how I ruin everything good by just existing. I don't expect anything more good to come out of my life and if it did I'd probably just ruin it again. My life has been a lot of loss and pain and I don't want to do it anymore. 

I've decided on the best time to do it and how.

I know people might think it was just a man but honestly I've never ever felt so right... Like it felt like everything had aligned itself for true happiness when I met him. And now he's gone and despite him saying he still loves me and wants to be friends decided soon after I wasn't even worth talking to at all. And I agree. I'm shit. He and everyone else is better off without me. 

I just really want to try and have some comforting connection before I leave here so I thought it might be worth posting here just to talk. I'm sorry I'm being selfish by letting you know I exist. I just want to at least try and leave here with a good memory.
