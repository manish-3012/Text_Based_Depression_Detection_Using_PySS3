I am going die tonightI am a worthless 40 year-old failure that has been repeatedly bullied and rejected by the world around me since I was a child.

I worked hard through school, got a top notch college education, and busted my ass daily as a professional. Yet each of my career endeavors over the last 20 years have stalled at the entry level while virtually everyone around me were allowed to move forward with their lives. In one three-year span, I was turned down for over 250 jobs in my field.

As a result, I decided to go back to graduate school... a place I am made to feel unwelcome every day. My cohorts shout me down whenever I speak, and constantly remind me how much I don't belong.

Since beginning school, all five of the jobs I carried last year have let me go. With one year left, I'm no closer to finding employment. If anything, I'm getting further away.

Im broke. My family and friends no longer speak to me because I am a worthless failure. My wife's life will never be what it can be because I'm a part of it.

Further supporting the case for my demise is that everything improves when I'm gone... past jobs, my ex wife's life, past groups of friends, etc.

My existence in a nutshell: One day, before middle school algebra class, a group of classmates stodd around me and took turns punching me to see who could be the first to make me cry. When the teacher arrived, I was the one reprimanded because if I hadn't deserved to be punched in the first place, there would have been no disturbance.

I've put all the effort I can into this life, and have received nothing but rejection, humiliation, and defeat in return.

I will never own a home, or be able to raise a family. I will never achieve even the most basic adult affordances.

I write this as an argument FOR suicide. The truth is that some people are unwanted houseguests on this planet. 

I'm doing society a favor.
