Failing in everythingI have an essay due for Monday. I don't understand the readings. I spoke to my prof and he thinks I'm doing fine. He probably just wanted to get rid of me. I have exams in the summer that I am going to fail. I don't understand the material. I'm not intelligent enough for this clearly. I work and work and work and work and I get nowhere. I'm nearly 20. Not a teenager anymore, I can't afford to make dumb mistakes like this. I tried to do everything right but it's all going wrong. I don't know what to do now. I feel like a dumb idiot child. I'll have to go back to my shitty little hometown and live with my parents and let time pass by. Soon I'll be 30 in the same position... 40, 50, 60, 70... dead. It's all pointless. Life is too hard for me to make something of myself. I feel like everyone else knows the secret to life and I don't. How do people have such fulfilled lives with friends, good grades, good diets, workouts, hobbies etc? I can't do one of those things. God how I've tried. I'm at the end of the road. Rock bottom. I don't see a way up. Death seems like a sweet relief. I'd go jump in front of a tube train but I don't want to traumatise the driver. I don't know what to do.
