I am going to starve myself because I'm a fatassI am 14 years old and I weigh 140 LBS, now that may not seem like much but most of it is fat! I grew up with very little weight on my body and my abusive father thought that the best way for me to gain weight is by forcing me to eat tons of junk food. He has since left and I have gained about seventy pounds mostly fat! I want to be like myself again and the best way and the quickest way to get rid of it is by drinking tons and water and eating no food. And if I die from this, well, goodbye!
