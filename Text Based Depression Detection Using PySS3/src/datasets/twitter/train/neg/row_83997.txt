All my family members and friends are extremely successful, yet I feel like a waste of air.To give some context about my situation: My parents are both engineers, father is a VP in a big tech company. Both my sisters are in an ivy league med school doing great. 2 of my best friends just started at MIT and TU Delft (In the Netherlands).

I was supposed to start university a couple weeks ago, but due to my autism I got set back a couple months in highschool. When I'm done with HS I will start working on my SAT's to be able to apply for next year. But things are looking very grim. My grades are terrible and I don't really have any other qualities, and my motivation has sunk to an all time low.

Due to all of this, I feel like a massive loser who is inferior to everybody I know. I'm deeply ashamed that I'm not meeting their expectations, even tho they've never expressed any expectations towards me. Sometimes I feel I should just rid myself of this world as to not be a burden to them. I really don't know what to do ...
