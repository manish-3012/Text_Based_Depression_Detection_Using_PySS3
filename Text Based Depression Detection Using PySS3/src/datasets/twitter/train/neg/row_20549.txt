Moral supportI feel bad for taking up space here. I am suicidal but through fear of death and pain I canâ€™t ever reach that point. But the level of despair Iâ€™m in daily is at a critical point. And I donâ€™t have anyone else to listen. 
Itâ€™s my last year of college. Iâ€™m in a major no one cares about (isnâ€™t considered â€œsmartâ€). I have no friends at school. I have to wait years to transition. My roommates donâ€™t talk to me. My depression and anxiety keep me from speaking, and the only thing i like to do (draw), Iâ€™m fucking shit at. Depression gave me goddamn memory issues so now I sound like a moron trying to remember anything past 2 days. My girlfriend of 7 years broke up with me because Iâ€™m trans (non-binary) but started dating my friend who is also non-binary. 
I know itâ€™s nothing. I know itâ€™s a lot of bullshit and Iâ€™m sorry for not being as much in crisis mode as other people. I just need someone to tell me that itâ€™s worth it to keep living this half life. Because every year gets worse.
