I just donâ€™t get itIâ€™m so fucking depressed and just so so sad 

Iâ€™m finally out of an emotionally abusive house hold, and in a much better environment, but yet itâ€™s like the depression has gotten worse 

I have money, I have a loving family, I have a beautiful Gf and wonderful friends 

But yet I cant shake this depression, Iâ€™ve been seeing a counselor, and plan on trying light therapy. I feel like the way I feel isnâ€™t valid, like I shouldnâ€™t be like this. I have no reason to be this so sad and suicidal. I know friends and other people who are in way worse situations... I shouldnâ€™t be sad yet I am.

Iâ€™ve had a history with depression and anxiety, but I feel like I should be getting better, not going 200 steps back....

Iâ€™m just so sad...I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore...
