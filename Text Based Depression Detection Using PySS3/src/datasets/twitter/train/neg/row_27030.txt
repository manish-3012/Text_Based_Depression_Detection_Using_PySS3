Iâ€™m so sorry that I failed you.My best friend died today due to suicide. I shouldâ€™ve seen how much pain you were in. I wish I appreciated you more while you were here. I shouldnâ€™t have taken you for granted. I never told you, but I was secretly in love with you. Everything about you. You gave the best advice, had the best jokes, and were always there for me. I wish I returned the favor. I shouldâ€™ve seen the signs....Fuck, you had such a bright future ahead. You were ranked fifth in our class and were headed to a prestigious private school. I was dreaming about our future and Iâ€™m just devastated youâ€™re gone. Every time I go back to the park, I just think of you and the memories we had there. I hope you finally find your peace and Iâ€™m so sorry. Iâ€™ll always think of you. And honestly, I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do without you.
