Want to go to hospital but can't risk jobSo I feel like killing myself over all the stress in my life right now. I really just want to check myself into a hospital, but Ive missed 3 days of work for calling in 2 for depression and 1 for sickness in the last couple months and know Id get fired.

I just dont know what to do honestly.

I have a therapist and my parents know but no one takes it seriously I just get told "suck it up and be an adult like us" I need serious help, I scare myself and just want somewhere to cool down without the chance of relapsing on self harm or suicide attempts. I need a hospital, but I dont want to ruin my life and commit social suicide doing so....
