if I can't make my dreams a reality why should I continue on?there are zero benefits to being a late bloomer and graduating late, especially if you chose the wrong field. 

marriage statistics show that the best time to get married is between 28-32. https://ifstudies.org/blog/want-to-avoid-divorce-wait-to-get-married-but-not-too-long/

problem is no woman wants to marry a man who doesn't make any money. yes money is the most important thing in the world. 

almost 28 and I still don't have a solid career direction as my engineering degree is useless since I haven't worked as an engineer for almost 2 years and that was an internship. if i couldnt find an engineering position after graduation what makes you think i can find one 2 years later when they have fresh graduates? 

even if I went into more debt for a graduate degree I will be 30 by the time I graduate and since it takes a lot of time to find the right woman it will be far too late. that's if it's a good field that didn't get saturated. 

I have semblance of some hope that a miracle will happen and someone will give me a chance but at the same time I realize I could easily fail to achieve my dream of a beautiful wife in a suburban neighborhood full of caring and loving people.
