9 months in hell just to end up worse off.9 months ago i received a job offer half way across the country. After talking over the opportunity with my friends, I decided to do it. Turns out, It was the biggest mistake of my life. For 9 months i was stuck in a house unable to leave for 8 hours a day. when i could leave, it was dark and the local businesses wouldn't allow a minor in, so there was basically nothing to do.

 I never made a friend while there, i never saved any money because my boss fucked me over, i didnt get to do a single fun activity in one of the most "exciting" cities in the US, I was stuck in a house with minimal human contact for 9 months. I even tried to kill myself on my birthday after I didnt get one call or text from anyone. I spent my birthday crying and alone. But I kept telling myself "it'll all be worth it when you get home" and "all your friends are waiting for you, it'll be great when i get home." And i even had a female friend i had been texting while away that i thought things might get more serious with. things were genuinely looking good when i got back.

 So my 9 months in hell ends. i come home so excited for change, and everything is worse. My friends are all gone or busy, Things with my lady friend turned into an utter disaster, My family sold my car while i was gone and now i have to get another job to buy a new one, my paranoia is worse than ever. Basically im worse off than when i left and now i have nobody to turn to while im super down. I dont know what to do now. i have so much shit in front of me i can't motivate myself to do anything. I'm going nowhere in life. my life is just a stagnant pool of disappointment and failure and i dont see any reason to keep trying.
