Why does every person disappoint any idea on what we hadPlease only positive responses 

Why does every person I love end up stop loving me back, or saying they only liked how well I listened? 

Iâ€™m constantly fucked over by those around me. I AM ALONE and will be forever. Or at least it feels like I canâ€™t trust anyone else to care about me long term. My family is shit, my life is shit. 

I just want some kind words to remind me that  I can be loved forever by someone and that Iâ€™m not just either a disgusting asshole or a â€œuseful emotional spongeâ€.
