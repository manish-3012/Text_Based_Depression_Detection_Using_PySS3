My life has only been depressionMy life has been torture. I was depressed at 5 years old. My first attempt was at 9. People always say it gets better but my whole life has been pain. I've been to almost all therapists in my area and tried like all the antidepressants under the sun. Nothing has worked. I can't handle it anymore. I can't remember anything besides depression and suicide. I have to do something to end it.
