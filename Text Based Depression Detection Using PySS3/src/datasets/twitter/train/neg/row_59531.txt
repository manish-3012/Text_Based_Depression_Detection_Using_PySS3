It's getting in my headI used to have alot of suicidal thoughts but surrounding my self with people that i love and appreciate and trying to ease my mind away from the dark stuff helped a lot but i have to admit it they are coming back faster than ever and I don't think i can stop them this time with all the shit going in my life even tho i try to hide it or turn it into sarcasm I can't help but feel like I'm better off dead
