Life is a cruel joke.And I don't mean my life specifically, but ours in general.

I'm sure many people here have lost loved ones. People you cared about - often through circumstances that didn't involve old age.

I am the single biggest piece of shit the human race has after shat out, and here I am alive, while someone that you cared for, and was loved... had to die. I read these headlines every day. A child that drowned. A plane goes down. An earthquake creates a new batch of orphans.

Seriously? And I'm still alive? Why? What is the fucking point of me being alive, while contributing, loved members of society have to die? That's not even remotely fair. I'd give anything to save even one person who was loved by someone, anyone, at the expense of my own life.

I don't deserve to be here.
