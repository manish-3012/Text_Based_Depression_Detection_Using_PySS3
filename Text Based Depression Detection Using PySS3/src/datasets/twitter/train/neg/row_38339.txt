Trying this againBefore you go any farther know I have no living family or friends. I am homeless and have been for some time and only own what I carry on my person. I am physically and mentally broken in too many ways to miss.

So do not tell me about how it could be worse or people will miss me. No one would notice if I was dead and it really can not get worse.

No one will respond to this as is the norm with these things. Hopefully this time I will be able to successfully kill myself.
