What is wrong with me???Iâ€™m recently 18 and just graduated high school. I was very sexually active when I was in my sophomore and junior years and it happens that when I was doing something with someone over Snapchat they may have posted it on their story. Itâ€™s not my fault and Iâ€™ve had those kinds of relationships with multiple people but people are turning those into rumors about me that are totally false and people are actually believing them and some that Iâ€™m a pedophile even though I literally just turned 18 a month ago? Itâ€™s ruining my reputation and I honestly just want to kill myself. I already have almost no one to talk to and now my name is being dragged through the dirt even more. Iâ€™m sick and tired of being the worst person alive. I might as well end it so I donâ€™t have to go through this.
