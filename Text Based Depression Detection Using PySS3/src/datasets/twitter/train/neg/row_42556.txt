Worried about my dadSo my grandad died the other day, and while most of us are taking it as well as one can because we knew it was a long time coming, my dad is really really not taking it well at all (it doesn't help matters that his mother/my grandma also now only has a couple of months left because of cancer) and long story short, he keeps getting really drunk and telling my mum that after both his parents die there's no point in him living anymore. 

Anyway, my mum and dad don't exactly get on (they see each other only because my mum worked as a carer for elderly people for many years, so has been looking after my grandparents because my dad's side of the family are pretty clueless on this stuff) so she's being a pretty dismissive of it all, saying he's just doing it for the attention and while I'd agree my dad is a massive exhibitionist to say the very least, this isn't his style of attention seeking at all.

My dad is a pretty volatile character though - he's been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember but the last couple of months (as my grandparents have got sicker) he's gotten A LOT worse, and I'm worried that now one of his parents has died this is going to cause him to go completely off the handle. 

We aren't exactly close (as in honestly, I dislike him a lot but he is my dad at the end of it all) so I have no idea how to approach my concern/what to do? Any advice would be appreciated &lt;3
