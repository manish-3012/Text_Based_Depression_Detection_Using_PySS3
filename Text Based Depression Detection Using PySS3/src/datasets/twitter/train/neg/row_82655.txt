i cant keep putting it off anymorewhen i was 16 i told myself to at least finish school, then it was finish college, then university, and then i told myself to get a little job, my first job ever mind you, just to contribute to the house and not be a complete waste of space who stays in bed all day, and after one day on the job i already want to quit. 

iâ€™m a uni graduate with crippling and i mean crippling social anxiety, who canâ€™t hack a menial job in a post office. if i canâ€™t do a job like that that literally has no pressure at all, how can i hack a grad scheme? a career job? i cant. and more importantly, i donâ€™t want to. i donâ€™t want to do anything, i just want to die. 

i wish thereâ€™s was an easy way to do it, at this point i might just take some sleeping pills and drink bleach before it kicks in
