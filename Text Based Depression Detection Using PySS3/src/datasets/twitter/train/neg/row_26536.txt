I want to kill myselfI want to kill myself

This all happened a while back when my parents started showing more attention to my siblings than me, not that bad but gradually I disconnected, I started staying in my room all day and playing video games, they started going out without me and when I did come my oldest younger sister started hurting me eg: kicking me, punching me and pinching me but when I complained my parents did nothing, so one day she kicked me as hard as she possibly could so I complained, they did jack shit so hit her back, now they were hitting me and shouting at me and screaming shit like boys shouldnâ€™t hit girls so I asked what to do if she hit me and they said â€œtake it like a manâ€ so this game my sister the idea that she could hurt me and get away with it so just continued and it was the most horrible thing I have experienced, a couple weeks ago she a full bottle of mine and my motherâ€™s body wash into the sink and some fucking mixture with it AT 10 FUCKING YEARS OLD, she laughed at me when our parents left and said she wasnâ€™t paying for it and no she didnâ€™t. So yeah I donâ€™t want to be in this shitty family. Iâ€™ve had some assholes in general annoy me at school and the Time my â€œfriendâ€ slammed a football at my face on purpose, laughed and called me weird when I blocked him. Thereâ€™s a ton more of shit but I could barely write this without breaking apart. I need advice because I want to kill myself badly right now
