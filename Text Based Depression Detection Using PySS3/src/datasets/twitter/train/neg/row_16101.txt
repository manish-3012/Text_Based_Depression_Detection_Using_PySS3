I'm worried I did something wrongI heard someone in my gym class who I barely know, say "that's it I'm killing myself tomorrow" I was slightly worried but the tone sounded joking.  So I did nothing even though I was still worried. They aren't at school today. Have I  done something morally wrong and should I report it. Also I have minor self diagnosed ocd which I obsess over things.
