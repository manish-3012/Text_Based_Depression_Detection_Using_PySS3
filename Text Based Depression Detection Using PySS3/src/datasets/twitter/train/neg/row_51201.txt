I can't be alone right now. I need someone to talk to.Preferably a girl. Please don't judge. I'm just a guy who's really lonely right now and I could use someone to talk to. If we could use a voice chat like on snapchat or kik or talk over the phone that would be great. I would like to hear someone's voice. I just want to talk before the night ends. I don't know how much more of this I can take. Please help me.
