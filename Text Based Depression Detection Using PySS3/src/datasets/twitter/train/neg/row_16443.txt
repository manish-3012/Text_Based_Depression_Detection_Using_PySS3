don't tell me i'm wrong for wanting to kill myself.there is nothing unique or special about it, but i am ready to die. there is nothing to explain or understand. i am simply ready.

why do we insist other humans stay alive? why do we insist that others around us live in unspeakable pain for all their days? what is the point of me staying alive?  


There is no point. there is no reason. any reason there is, is a made-up one by another human. many humans are afraid of their own deaths so they think saving someone else will make them less mortal.

i am ready to go.
