SoonHonestly Iâ€™m at my limit. Iâ€™ve tried keeping myself distracted, looking at ac shit or picking up new hobbies, Iâ€™ve tried self reflecting and reaching out to apologize for what Iâ€™ve done wrong, Iâ€™ve tried making new connections and spending more time with my family, hell Iâ€™ve even tried praying to big man and Iâ€™m not even religious. It just never ends. My brain just never shuts up, and as soon as thereâ€™s a lull in conversation or Iâ€™m by myself all I can think about is how badly I want to die. I just canâ€™t do this anymore
