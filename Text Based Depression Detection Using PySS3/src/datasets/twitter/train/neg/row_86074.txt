Thereâ€™s Just no reason to go onI finally came to the realization that Iâ€™m not special, or unique, or funny or interesting or attractive. Everyone I know just pities me and I just want to free them from the burden that I am. The depressing vibes I give off. The only reason Iâ€™m still around right now is my dog but even sheâ€™s got my roommate to spoil her. Sheâ€™ll be fine. 
I canâ€™t believe I ever thought this dude would ever be into me, how stupid and naive I am, and once again I have essentially catfished another dude because I take decent face pics and now I have to go meet him and see that look on his face when he sees what my body is. I fucking hate living. Just endless suffering and awkwardness and anxiety. Why continue? Iâ€™m almost 30 it was supposed to be better by now.
