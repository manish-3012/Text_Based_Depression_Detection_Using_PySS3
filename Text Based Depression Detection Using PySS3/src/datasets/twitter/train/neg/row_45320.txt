I shouldn't exist. Why do I continue living?I want to be happy, lively, friendly, positive, and rise above the kind of life my parents fell into, the kind of life I was forced into until I became 17. I'm just so tired this uphill struggle, though.

I'm tired of people depending on me, including my own family. I'm tired of all my sexuality and gender issues, and having to keep them a secret. I'm tired of jobs constantly taking advantage of me. I'm tired of people avoiding me, and me being incapable of connecting with others no matter how hard I try. I'm tired of not being able to get over the past, even with therapy. I'm tired of never having anyone to look up to. I'm tired of being surrounded by perpetual pessimism. I'm tired of getting older and yet still not having any achievements under my belt. I'm tired of trying to do something to make myself happy, only for someone else to ruin it or prevent it from ever happening. I'm tired of all this pain I constantly bear.

I'm just so tired.
