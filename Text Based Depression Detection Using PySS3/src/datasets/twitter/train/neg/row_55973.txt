I am scaredI donâ€™t want to live anymore, life seems so dull and I donâ€™t think I will do any good to the following years. School sucks, I can barely understand the material and keep myself focused on classs, being kind of inisible to the teachers doesnâ€™t help either.
Iâ€™m only 14 but the concept of dying feels so welcoming that I would be surprised if I donâ€™t make and attempt until 2 am.
