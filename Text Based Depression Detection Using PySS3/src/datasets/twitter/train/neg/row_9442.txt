I can't keep going on with the hate about meMy life these past two weeks have been a struggle to make it through. I have never felt so disgusted and sick towards myself. 

My friend group has about 5 people in it. I got into a fight with 3 out of the 5 people and they have since ghosted me and cut me out of their life. I haven't seen them in about 3 months and every text ends up in a huge brawl that I end up sobbing over. 

The two other people in the friend group are my best friends however, and I see that they feel uncomfortable associating themselves with me because the majority of the group hates me. 

The people who hate me are the ones that would usually host the hangouts and therefore I'm unable to see my two best friends anymore. I'm not so upset about the three other people who hate me but I can't stand seeing my best friend have a good time without me. 

I have had some terrible thoughts these past few days and there's no way to win the other three people back. Every weekend is painful to see them all have fun with no regard to me. 

I can't keep living as a thrown away object.
