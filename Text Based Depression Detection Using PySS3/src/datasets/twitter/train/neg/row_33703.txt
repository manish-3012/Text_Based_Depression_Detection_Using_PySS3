Well seems like itâ€™s my timeIâ€™ve honestly known for a long time this has been coming. I donâ€™t really feel sorry for myself, I would say I would feel sorry for my friends but I donâ€™t have any. The only victim here will be my mom. Sheâ€™s devoted so much to me just for me to end it soon. I really wouldnâ€™t be surprised if she took her own life too. 

My entire life Iâ€™ve always wanted to know whatâ€™s out there, like after dying and whatâ€™s outside of of our universe. Where do we go? like 98% of humans that have ever lived have died and not one has come back to tell us what itâ€™s like or whatâ€™s out there. Hell, we all are just evolved monkeys on a rock in the universe and weâ€™ve become intelligent enough to kill ourselves, completely ruining the point of our evolution.

Well, I really wish I could tell you guys what itâ€™s like out there and how it is after the very ending of our existence. Stay safe guys. Goodbye
