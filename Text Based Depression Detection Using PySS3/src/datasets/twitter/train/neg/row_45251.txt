It would be easier to dieI suffer from mental illness(bpd), it sucks but itâ€™s not too much for me to handle. Iâ€™m recovering and getting better Iâ€™m proud of myself. Iâ€™m not suicidal over small things anymore but this has been a recurring issue and the cause of two past suicide attempts.

All this recovery seems pointless because when my older brother comes into my life I just want to kill myself. I live in fear around him, Iâ€™m tired of his threats, Iâ€™m tired of him stalking me online, Iâ€™m tired of him harassing anyone I get close to. I canâ€™t leave my house because I need to be moms caretaker but as long as I live with mom heâ€™ll know where I am. Iâ€™m afraid heâ€™ll find my bf and hurt him, Iâ€™m afraid if I move on and become happy and healthy heâ€™ll find me and threaten me. 

The only thing Iâ€™ve ever asked from him is to leave me alone and he canâ€™t give me that. If he hates me so much why canâ€™t he just ignore my existence.

I feel like seriously doing it. I canâ€™t handle a lifetime of harassment from him anymore. 

I would hurt people in my life so badly though. I canâ€™t stand the thought of my moms heart breaking over me killing myself. Fuck though for the first time in years Iâ€™ve actually got a plan and the urge to do it.
