I Honestly Need HelpIve gotten to the point that I'm looking up methods of suicide to find the one that would hurt the least for me. For details, I'm a 25 year old junior in college still trying to get my undergrad. As of two months ago I quit a heavy daily weed use habit and am struggling against addiction with alcohol too. I've realized yesterday I've lost all my friends as they all moved on to finding new ones and left me reaching out to no response. I can't meet new people because after trying to connect in a conversation, the next day they pretend I'm not there even after a flowing convo for a bit. At this point I'm already heavily medicated by my psychiatrist and the changes they've been making are having no improvement. I've read the best method for ending it is overdose and I'm nearly 50/50 on the idea of doing it at this point. Has anyone ever come back from the brink like this?
