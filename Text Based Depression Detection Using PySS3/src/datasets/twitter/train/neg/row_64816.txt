Can someone help me please?I know it sounds really pathetic. I'm not sure if these kind of posts are ok or annoying on here, but I need support. I'm losing friends quickly. recently my two best friends since elementary school  (I'm 17) got angry at me and told me I was annoying. they said I make people feel stupid because despite some anxiety problems, I can be very opinionated.

they're annoyed at how much of a piece of shit I am, I can tell. after the fight, they completely stopped talking to me. at school they ignore me. they talk to each other and act like I'm not there, when I'm right in front of them. they don't reply when I ask them to hang out or anything.

I still have my boyfriend, who's amazing, but I'm scared he'll get to that point too. I won't be able to live without people in my life, but I'm such a useless fuck up that I'll ruin every relationship I have. things have been getting tougher than they've ever been. I'm annoyed and apathetic at everything. I used to love eating food, I don't care anymore, it's just something I do now. I'm tired all the time, I can't sleep, when I do sleep it's sporadic and terrifying. I wake up after 12 hours feeling like I slept for 4. I feel like I'll never be happy again. I'm constantly disconnected from everything, and that's on top of dysphoria I feel separate from being sad.

I don't know what to do. I'm getting closer and closer to killing myself, and the scary thing is that I know I would make everyone's lives better. nobody needs useless transgender freaks in their life, I'd be helping all the people around me by killing myself. they wouldn't have to waste time trying to help me.
