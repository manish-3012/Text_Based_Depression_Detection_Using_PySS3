LostHello all,

Yesterday I had the first panic attack in my life. And the worst part about it wasn't even the panic attack but that I could not talk to anyone about it. I thought I had a friend but I think she starts to dislike me a lot. Our friendship (almost more) seems to be ending. I never met this person in real life and so it's kind of weird. But i think I'm not someone that people can get along well for a long period of time. I never had a good friend because I always drifted far away from those that I am close with. Now lulling myself seems like the best idea. If I do then I'll make my moms life like hell which I am really worried about but I don't know what else to do? I can't keep living like this. I moved out of my home country searching for something but it didn't work out. I am just feeling even worse then ever. I am not mature. I can't put others feeling in front of my own. I am not a good person. I hurt the ones I love. I am just a failure who should just not be in this planet. It would do a great service to humanity.
