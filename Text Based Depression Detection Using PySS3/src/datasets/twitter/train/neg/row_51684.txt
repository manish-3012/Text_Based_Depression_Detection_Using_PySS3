I wish I were deadMy mom doesnâ€™t believe when I say Iâ€™m sick. She thinks I wanted to skip work today because I feel exhausted. But in reality I threw up and a coworker walked in on it. Thereâ€™s proof. And when I told her she ended the conversation because she hates being wrong. She told me if I get fired from work sheâ€™ll send me back to school. She knows I tried killing myself multiple times and knows I had severe depression. I think she hates me. I feel guilty for being sick. Iâ€™m so fucking pissed of people not believing me in general and I wish I were dead.

This is the feather on the camels back. I canâ€™t. I want to just die.
