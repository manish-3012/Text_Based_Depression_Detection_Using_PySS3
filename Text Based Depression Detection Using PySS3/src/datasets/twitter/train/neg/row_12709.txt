I almost lost a friendHe is still with me thankfully, but please love everyone.
Watch over the people close to you and see if they need anything and dont ignore when things go wrong or they ask for help even in little subtle ways.
Show the people that matter to you that you care, and please spread love and positivity. The world reallyyy needs more of this right now.
Thank you. â¤
