Not depressed or sad or unhappy. But don't wanna do anything and don't enjoy anyone or anything. Find life meaningless.Like the title - I'm not really sad about anything and have no particular hardships in life. But, I do have an extreme case of apathy and "nothing really matters anyway". Didn't used to be like this. I just went for a physical and the blood work results are fine. What the hell is wrong with me? I don't wanna see people, don't really enjoy any activity or hobby anymore, don't wanna do anything at all really - and it's starting to affect personal life and work. And then at the first sign my boss or girlfriend or friends are disappointed at me, I begrudgingly do the minimum to back "on track" - have dinner with them, get my work done well, and then right after they're ok with me, I don't care anymore and just go back to not wanting to do anything.

I think I wanna play this game - I play it and don't find any of it new or exciting.   I see a movie I've been wanting to see for a while - meh it's unoriginal.  I see a good friend - meh he can do without me and vice versa.  I do enjoy the shit out of listening to music but that's it really.

Again, I still find funny things funny, I don't feel sad or depressed about anything, I just DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AND DON'T ENJOY ANYONE OR ANYTHING. I'm in great shape, am well-off and have no financial stresses. Used to love making music and playing music, not any more cuz that's pointless intellectually speaking just like everything else in the grand scheme of things.

1) What the hell is wrong with me and 2) What do I do?
