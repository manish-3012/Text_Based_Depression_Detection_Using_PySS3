I'm feeling tired. I'm feeling weak.I feel bad for Mom. If she knew what I'm feeling these days, she would get super sad. She loves me. She gets extremely concerned when I'm even a bit upset. And I feel bad for acting so optimistic in front of her, when in reality all I see these days is darkness. What did I do to feel this way? Things aren't that bad, so why am I feeling this bad? 
Now, I don't even have negative thoughts, I just sit there and start crying. Exhaustion is taking over. 
I haven't really accomplished anything. I haven't done anything to make my parents proud. 
I drowned myself in that positivity stuff for the last four years, but suddenly nothing works. No level of "hope" that people give seems to get to me in reality. I smile in front of them so they don't get to burden themselves with my sadness. But in reality I can't feel it. I love my parents. I love my Best friends. I love my boyfriend. I love these people so much. But I really feel stuck. I am afraid of my thoughts. It's just darkness.
