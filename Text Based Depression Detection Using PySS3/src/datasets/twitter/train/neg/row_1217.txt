I plan to kill myself on my birthday. Itâ€™s a week away. I donâ€™t think I can wait that long.I figure this way my family only needs to mourn one day out of the year. And my neurotic self does love the idea of matching dates on my grave. But nothing is worth this. This world crushes people to fucking dust.
