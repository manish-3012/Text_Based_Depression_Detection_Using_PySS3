Everything slowly crashing down around me, nothing is looking up, want to end it allOver the past two months, my entire business I've been running has been failing.

I have no skills that could be used for a job, and I couldn't even get one a month ago when I tried.

I have less than $1000 in the bank, and I owe $2000 to people that need it this week, and I'm under contracts to pay them.

Every thing that was good in my life has turned bad: my job is failing, my money is gone, my friends have deserted me, my family hates me, and I dont know what to do.

There's a five foot drop right outside my window, and I just want to jump.

I really don't know what's keeping me here at all, I can't even go a day without crying, and I don't know the last time I smiled.
