Iâ€™m giving upSigh, I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting on here when no one really gives a flying f*ck. Iâ€™ve lost my girlfriend, she made me happy, vibrant and positive about the future, she was my happiness, but she left me because of long distance. Yea yea I heard of â€œjust wait youâ€™ll find someone newâ€ but I donâ€™t want anyone else, I know that for sure, she was the one that stopped me one night from killing myself, she was the only one keeping me alive, now I can barely hang on, I had really bad depression and anxiety for 6+ years, and now Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, I donâ€™t see a reason for trying anymore, Iâ€™ve attempted a few times, I feel completely worthless, I dread every morning that Iâ€™m alive, I wish I could sleep and never wake up again, my ex is always on my mind and with the amount of times I want to scream when I think of everything weâ€™ve been through..Iâ€™m going insane. I donâ€™t think I can live another year, my depression is getting worse, Iâ€™ve been cutting every night now, I sleep most of the day, I have little care about anything anymore, I just wanna die, the urge is getting stronger and I donâ€™t think I can keep fighting..Iâ€™m not a fighter anyways..
