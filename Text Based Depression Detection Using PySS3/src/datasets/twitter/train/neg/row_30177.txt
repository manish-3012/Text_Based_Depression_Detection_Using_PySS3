i donâ€™t know how much longer i can do thisiâ€™m so stressed out all the time. i try so hard to keep motivated but i canâ€™t. iâ€™m so close to taking a bottle of pills or cutting a vein open. i donâ€™t know what to do, i havenâ€™t had much motivation to do anything and i just want to lay in bed all day. i almost killed myself last night but i didnâ€™t. it gets harder every single day. i donâ€™t want to leave my friends and family hurt but iâ€™m suffering so much. i donâ€™t really have a reason not to kill myself except for my friends but i donâ€™t know how much more i can take. iâ€™m sorry if this is repetitive i just am really bad with words. iâ€™ll probably cut myself for a little while and try to sleep it off but god knows iâ€™ll only be worse tomorrow
