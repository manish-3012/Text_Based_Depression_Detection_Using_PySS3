I donâ€™t know what to do anymore...Iâ€™m 17 I dropped out of high school last year (my dad doesnâ€™t know yet) I canâ€™t find a job because my last 2 I didnâ€™t stay longer than 3 months. I have no money I do have a girlfriend of almost 8 months but sheâ€™s suicidal too and I have to worry and stress about everything and make sure sheâ€™s happy.  All I do is play video games and sit at my girlfriends house not doing anything because I have no money. My account is even in the negative and my father keeps getting mad at me for it. Iâ€™ve considered suicide so many times but Iâ€™m too scared to do it. And I promised myself as a little kid when my brother commit suicide Iâ€™d never do that because I know how bad it destroyed me. But I canâ€™t keep going on like this. I get treated like shit at home because my dads girlfriend doesnâ€™t like my mom ( heâ€™s who my dad left her for then got back with this current girlfriend 12 years later ) Please help. I donâ€™t know what else to do other than talk...
