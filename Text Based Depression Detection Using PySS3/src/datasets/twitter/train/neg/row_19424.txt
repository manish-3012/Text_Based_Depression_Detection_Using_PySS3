Struggling to see a reason to carry onDonâ€™t know where to begin, had the worst year ever. At the start of the year I was in a similar mindset and tried ending it where a close friend did it a few years earlier. Got pulled back over the bridge by a friend and got anti depressants and all that. 
I honestly went into the new year thinking you know what this is going to be my year.. Iâ€™ll turn my life around and be a better person for it, but looking back now.. itâ€™s just worse. My grandparents both got diagnosed with horrible illnesses, grandma cancer and grandad Parkinsonâ€™s and Iâ€™m struggling to come to terms with whats going to happen and I donâ€™t think I can cope. The one person I can trust to talk to about how my head is keeps telling me to find the happy points but I just canâ€™t see any. I feel like Iâ€™m losing my mind, my anxiety has come back so bad and Iâ€™m pushing away the people I care about because my stupid head keeps thinking things that just arenâ€™t there. 
No matter what happens Iâ€™ve always got this same voice in my head saying â€˜Iâ€™ll be dead before the end of the yearâ€™ and it never goes away.. everyday Iâ€™m try to fight that voice but Iâ€™m just struggling to see a reason to carry on. I canâ€™t get rid of the urge to just end it because I just donâ€™t see a reason to carry on. All I want is to just pop pills till itâ€™s over.
