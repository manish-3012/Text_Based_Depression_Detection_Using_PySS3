So tired.I don't know what to say anymore. I have given up, I can't do this anymore. Wake up wanting to die, go to sleep wanting the pain to end. I've been prescribed another anidepressant since the first one I tried didn't work. I don't know why I wanted them, maybe to overdose. Or look at the choice to try getting better but turning it down because I deserve to suffer. The past 2 months I've been having panic attacks every day, sometimes more than once. My insomnia is getting worse. People don't care, my parents don't care. Anyone I used to talk to has forgotten me.
Even my boyfriend, he just stopped talking to me, I don't know why I am so hard to love. I tried, I tried being worthy of love, but I can't. I am useless, unlovable little disgusting creature. First time in a while I haven't cut, I made a promise to stop. But what is a promise if the person I made it to dosent give a shit? 
I don't want to cryy eyes out every since day anymore.
Seconds away from overdosing all my pills in a deadly cocktail. I am just starring at it, not knowing what to do. The world will be better without me. I have always been useless. What difference would it make if I disappeared now?
