I might be suffering from something bad I'm going to get an mri and see results of the ct scan then go to an ent and demand testsAs well as go to the er and demand other tests I'm pretty bad off I've been in this sub a while thinking about this and that but lately it's gotten really bad if I just sit around I'm suffering so badly so I just wanted to say everybody keep your head up your all amazing. I hope I can be saved if not it is what it is and I have to do something unless I hopefully die from whatever is basically attacking me. Thanks everybody if I somehow get out of this then it's a miracle. Just wanted to vent and say no matter how bad it gets try to tough it out and use me as an example. For 2 months I was fighting and it's gotten so bad idk how I ended up with these medical conditions( not mental ) I would give me arms and legs as a trade off and that would be a dream to me. I just wanted to leave this behind if I don't make it. Thanks everybody it's been a wild ride if I somehow get help or I don't ether way it's relief, thanks a lot.
