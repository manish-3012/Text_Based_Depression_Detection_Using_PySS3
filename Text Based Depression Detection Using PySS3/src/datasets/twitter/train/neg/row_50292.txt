Quick ways out?I didnâ€™t even think i would be posting on here. Iâ€™ve never felt suicidal. Iâ€™ve always been in a shitty place reaching new rock bottoms. I cut and have been for a while, it doesnâ€™t help at all I hate this life. There is nothing here. I have absolutely no one and no one gives a shit about me and what I do for them. They just expect more and get mad if I donâ€™t do shit for them. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of it. I always try to help people but all there problems affect me and are starting to weigh down on me on top of my problems, depression, and anxiety. It would be a situation where I had nothing to do with it and now because I didnâ€™t get them somthing they are blaming all tehre problems on me. I hate this blullshit, I canâ€™t stand it always being the one to take the blame for shit I didnâ€™t do or being treated by shit by others. I canâ€™t do anything or go anywhere I have really bad anxiety and nothing helps with it. I canâ€™t do it. I like drugs so maybe I would want to go out ODâ€™ing but I want to take enough so I die and not just throw up or somthing. Iâ€™m in so much fucking pain all the time I donâ€™t know what to do. Before I wanted to die but not kill my self, now I want to I feel ready to leave. No one gives a fuck even if they say I do when Iâ€™m dead. Everyone uses me and never does anything in return or shows any appreciation. I canâ€™t think right now I have some pills but definitely not enough to OD. I canâ€™t think at all right now, Iâ€™m 15 I live with my parents who drug test me right now I donâ€™t care Ima do drugs hopfully it helps probably not. If u have any ideas for quick easy ways out pease let me know.
