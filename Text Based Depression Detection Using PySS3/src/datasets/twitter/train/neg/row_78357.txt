How do you deal with life after an attempted suicide? I don't know what to feel.I tried overdosing, but boyfriend found me and called the ambulance. It's been about five days since getting out of the hospital and I don't know what to feel - how to process everything. I guess you could say that I'm really numb about it, as if it never really happened.

I don't regret what I did, not one bit. It feels like nothing has changed, and it's strange how I'm back to doing regular things in daily life when 5 days ago I tried to end my life. 

How do you deal with this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.
