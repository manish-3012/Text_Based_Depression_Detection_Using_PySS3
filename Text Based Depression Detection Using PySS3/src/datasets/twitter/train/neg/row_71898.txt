How can I help her?Hi everyone. I'm extremely concerned about a Redditor.
I was on r/SeriousConversation, when someone mentions that she's going to kill herself. I pled with her not to, I told her please get help, she can PM me to vent any time she likes, life is precious. It's all true but she is resolute. She says she's going to end it all in December or maybe sooner. She says she's not afraid to die, she thinks "suicide is beautiful". I am very scared that she's going to do it and I need to help her. She says she doesn't want help, but of course she needs it. Please help me help her.
