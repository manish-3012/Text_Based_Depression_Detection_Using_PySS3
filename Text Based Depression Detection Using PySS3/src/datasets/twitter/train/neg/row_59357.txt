How to tell someone I keep trying to kill myself?So, I'm 16 and I have tried or come close to killing myself every day for the last week and a half. I took an od last night and then got scared and threw it up. I don't know if I will do something tonight, I probably will try or come close to it. I feel so helpless.
If I had left the house in the last 9 days I would have jumped off the bridge very close to me or just ran off. I can't go outside because of my eating disorder, as I am so ashamed of how I look currently that I avoid all my mirrors, and can't stand the thought of someone seeing me. This means I might not go to therapy next week and I am scared something bad will happen, or if I do, I will likely end up lying. 

Someone knows, and has been there every time I have said things like this, and refuses to leave,but I'm finally pushing them away as I feel them getting more frustrated that I know nobody cares about me or something of the same variation. 

I don't know what I am supposed to do. If I talk about this I will probably end up sectioned and I cannot miss school and I haven't been revising for my gcses in a month. I am scared I will be forced to eat or open up about my ED (not an option) and my parents will be told and have a conversation (not so supportive) and I can't stand that.
I can't go on pretending I am not a risk to myself, but I don't know how to start the conversation. Any help greatly appreciated.
