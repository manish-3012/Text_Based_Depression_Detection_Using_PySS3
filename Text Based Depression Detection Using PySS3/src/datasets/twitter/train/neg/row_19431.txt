idk anymoreBeen thinking of jumping off the ledge since last night. My platoon commander spoke to us last night, he mentioned about the consequence of trying to fake a headache and anxiety issues.

Anyone with such sensitive personal issues will be sent to the Institute of Mental Health(IMH). Since I was already registered as an IMH patient, I tried my best to pay a listening ear. He then started to mention that those whose ID is registered with IMH will have their medical records registered for the rest of their lives. I will have a low chance of working in many government sectors after my 2 years stay in here(ORD), or even studying in a Local University.

Iâ€™m completely at a lost here. Even though I knew that, way before I even enlisted, my mind just went wild with thoughts about how my life has went to shit.

The only thought thatâ€™s keeping me from throwing myself of the ledge and parapet, is that I need to complete this course and how devastated my sergeants, bunk mates and family will be.

But, life will go on for them right? Itâ€™ll just be a fact to them that someone from their platoon committed suicide, a story for them to tell. As for my family... im the eldest of the 5 off-springs my parents have, it should be fine then

and of course the thought of falling to my death is petrifying. but researched taught me that the most scary part of the few seconds of falling, after that itâ€™s almost no pain at all.
