I feel like a burden.To everyone. My friends, my family, e.t.c. I feel like I have failed at being a woman because of how ugly I am. I feel like I have failed at being a daughter because of how stupid I am. I feel like I have failed at being a friend because I can't stop pushing people away. I think I am just going to end it soon. I don't have any place in this world, and I have nothing to offer to society. I am just too broken and worthless. I don't think I am deserving of anything good in life. I am just a waste of oxygen and space.

Wanted to leave something behind before I leave.
