I feel like clocking out right nowI'm pretty much finished. It's a 24/7 cycle of misery at this point. I can't find any relief anymore and I'm fucking tired of staying up all night drunk on self pity. There's winners and there's losers in this life and I was a god damn fucking loser and I spend my whole life in denial. No more.
