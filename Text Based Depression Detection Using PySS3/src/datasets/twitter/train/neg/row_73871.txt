I just don't want to feel this anymoreI don't know where to turn anymore. I tried getting urgent counseling from my school today but it turns out they don't offer it anymore, so I'm turning to here to say what I need to say. "On paper" I feel like I should be happy about my life, that I have things "going for me". Yet, I can't help but feel like I'm the most worthless piece of shit. Every day I walk around burdened with self-loathing, and I constantly have to fight off the urge to self-mutilate. 

I've felt this way for a long time, but it wasn't until this year I left the safety bubble of my home and moved away for school. I started to deal with the pain with drinking, but nothing too crazy yet. Then I found out I was being led on by a guy in a relationship for 2 months and in that same weekend found out my formally abusive father is terminally ill. So I coped with it by drinking until I blacked out and ended up having sex with a "friend" of mine, the first person I was intimate with since I left my abusive ex-boyfriend (and first ever boyfriend). 

I don't know how to cope with how worthless I feel. I grew up in an abusive household and have had issues with self-mutilation and eating disorders in the past. I've never idealized suicide so much than I do right now, because then I wouldn't have to feel this. Not just with the pain of the mistakes I've made recently, but the pain of growing up with abusive parents and being the product of that.
