Why continue on?Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m posting. Iâ€™m scared and alone. I want to die because of all this emotional pain. Iâ€™m laying in bed crying my eyes out. All because I hate myself and I can forgive myself for hurting my ex gf. I donâ€™t feel wanted. I donâ€™t feel like I even deserve to be wanted. Though I crave for someone to care for me. To hear those sweet words â€œI love youâ€ again. I live in this lonely world and Iâ€™m honestly tired of trying to fight to be happy again. Been going to therapy since July and Iâ€™m on celexa. They help but they donâ€™t solve my problems. Iâ€™m only 22 and I know I have many years ahead of me where I could turn my life around. I just donâ€™t feel like I can even make it through tonight though.
