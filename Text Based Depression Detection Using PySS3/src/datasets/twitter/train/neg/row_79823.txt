I feel like depression will never fadeIâ€™m young and already tired of this life, living itself just seems like a burden. Went through therapy and pills and Iâ€™m still at the point where I started. Again one of those nights during which Iâ€™m considering to just end myself. Got everything I need to finish this available, just need some more courage. Iâ€™m not afraid of death but Iâ€™m afraid of dying.
