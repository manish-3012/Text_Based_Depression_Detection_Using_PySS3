Not even a girlfriend would save me.Yeah this is another generic post. 
Nothing will make me happy. Not a girlfriend. Not friends. Not money. Not adventures. Not family. Not travelling the world.Iâ€™m seriously considering offing myself soon... maybe Iâ€™ll do something to make my mark before I leave forever
