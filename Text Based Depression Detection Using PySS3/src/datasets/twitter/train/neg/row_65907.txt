So full of remorseFucked up my marriage by being a self-centered asshole. I am so full of regret. I am also Christian and know I wasn't being the kind of husband God wanted me to be. My wife and I are on a "break"...  any rebuilding of a romantic relationship is on hold while we concentrate on being parents to our son.

I am so full of regret. I don't know how I got to the point where I was causing damage and didn't see it. She knows I still love her. She knows I'm sorry. There's nothing more I can say there. I feel like I am a horrible person, and she's right to have left me, and she's better off without me. But I also want to make it right and give her good memories to replace the bad. I know I can be a better husband and father. I lost the best thing that ever happened to me, and I hate myself for it.

Right now she's said she wants to focus on parenting. I can't push myself on her, I know that. That would just destroy any chance whatsoever. It's so hard, especially since this is pretty much all my fault. What the hell is wrong with me?
