The feeling just keeps coming backI'm 4 months out from an awfully abusive relationship. Doing pretty well but the first half of almost every day, I just want it to stop. The intrusive thoughts where he pops in. The thoughts that I'll never find love again because I'm getting too old and everyone is either taken or unwilling to be alone and stuck in a relationship that they don't want to be in, which is not someone that I want. I'm not unattractive. I'm not a terrible person. So why the hell can't I find someone that isn't cruel or unable to be an adult? Everyone else seems to have a partner. What the fuck is going on?

I feel like my life has been wasted. I want to go back to school but what's the point? So I can fail again? I want to pursue my life-long dream again but it feels so much like a joke. To publicly put myself out there and fall on my face...

I just want this feeling of uselessness to stop and there's only one way for that to happen.
