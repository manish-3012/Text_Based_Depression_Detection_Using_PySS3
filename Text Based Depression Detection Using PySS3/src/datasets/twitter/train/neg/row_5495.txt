Iâ€™m going to kill myself tonightThis has come 18 years too late but Iâ€™ve finally committed to doing it. Iâ€™ve written my farewells to the few people in my life and Iâ€™m just waiting to send them. Iâ€™m hoping my balcony is high up enough but even if itâ€™s not, this just needs to be done. Iâ€™ll probably try to run away from it like I do everything else but I just need to do something good for everybody in my life just this one time

Iâ€™m such an anomaly in life and I shouldâ€™ve had this happen a long time ago. Iâ€™m sick of putting this off but now that Iâ€™ve truly reached the end of the road, itâ€™s time for some course correction. I have no ways forward in life and no hopes to be crushed, this has really just been my only path in life and I just need to own up to my life and walk it

I donâ€™t even really know why Iâ€™m making this post. Maybe I want some extra encouragement to push me over the ledge. Maybe I need to lock this in to myself so I actually do it. Maybe Iâ€™m just a piece of shit who wants to spread my suffering to more people. I donâ€™t know, I just need this to end
