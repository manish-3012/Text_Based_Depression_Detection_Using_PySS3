master procrastination.I've been putting off all of my responsibilities for about a week now and it's really fucking me. it's just hard to do anything when i spend most of my time hating myself. i can sit for hours and just think about how much i want to end it all. then i just fall asleep and start thinking about it again when i wake up. i can't even remember most of what happened today. i can just remember all of the reasons i came up with for why i should kill myself. i don't want to live anymore if this is just going to be the rest of my life. I'm fucked.
