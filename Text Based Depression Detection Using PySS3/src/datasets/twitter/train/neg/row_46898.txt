Joining the military was a mistakeA little bit about me; Iâ€™m enlisted in the Marine Corp as an 0311. Before this, I was a high school student with a history of ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression. All three of which I thought I grew out of, but I was terribly wrong. Since I joined, I feel like a complete failure, and incompetent moron. For the last 2 years I have botched even the simplest of tasks and shut myself off from others most of the time. Iâ€™ve even turned to drinking and am slowly getting worse each day with it. Iâ€™ve had thoughts of suicide a few times a week and anxiety attacks that creep up on me.

 Iâ€™ve been doing this for two years and now Iâ€™m certain that Iâ€™m not meant for the military. I snapped the other day and told the docs at medical everything: The incompetence, the illnesses, the suicide thoughts, and now Iâ€™m sure that theyâ€™ll stick me on suicide watch which I hear is absolute Hell. Iâ€™m dealing with all of this poorly,l. Iâ€™m barley eating, Iâ€™m overusing melatonin and NyQuil out of desperation to sleep at night as sleep gives me a brief break from all of this. I can only hope I donâ€™t do something stupid from here to later that I may or may not live to regret.
