I may have COVID and want to kill myselfI havenâ€™t been feeling the best this past week. I called my doctor and they said I should get a COVID test. Iâ€™ve been so careful I see so many people be so reckless and donâ€™t get it and here I am I may have it. Literally everything bad always happens to me. Whenever I try to advance my life forward the worlds just like FUCK NO and has to make a problem for me. Now I may actually die. And I just finally got a job and now Iâ€™m going to have to take the week off till I get my test results. But Iâ€™m worried if I tell them the reason Iâ€™m not in they may fire me. And if I have it Iâ€™ll be out of work for two weeks at the least and this is a short term position so they may just say FUCK YOU and get rid of me. And I live at home and my family doesnâ€™t want me to get a COVID test they think something weird may be in it. They donâ€™t even know Iâ€™m going to get a test I havenâ€™t told them Iâ€™ve been feeling weird because if they find out theyâ€™ll blame my job and make me quit. But I have no license so someone from my household will have to drive me. And I donâ€™t even want to get the test because now Iâ€™m weary it may be a false positive. Iâ€™ve had health problems for the last three years so Iâ€™m wondering is any of this related to that but I donâ€™t know!!!!! You go on all these COVID tested positive sites and everybody has every different symptom for every different disease known to man so how are you supposed to know if you have some other health issue or COVID. I was planning to kill myself earlier this year but changed my mind. Now I regret it. Iâ€™m thinking I may just do it this weekend. This is too much of a struggle and no matter what thereâ€™s going to be a bad outcome. Iâ€™m sick of year after year thinking my life would get better if I just TRIED to no avail and now this. I think this is a sign I should just forfeit.
