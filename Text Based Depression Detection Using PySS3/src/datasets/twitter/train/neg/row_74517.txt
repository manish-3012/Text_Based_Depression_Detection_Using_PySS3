Where am I supposed to go? What am I supposed to do?My options come down to constant pain and struggle, and death. 




I'm getting kicked out of the house (probably rightfully so) and I have nowhere to go. I have nobody. I'm severely depressed and I have legitimately crippling anxiety so finding a job is unlikely at the moment. I have no money for food or meds. I have no car. No possessions to sell. 




Death makes everything meaningless anyway. I guess it's time to kill myself
