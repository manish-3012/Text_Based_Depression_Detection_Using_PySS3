Bipolar and thinking itI have Bipolar II, I often think about commiting suicide, and all the technical's behind the other side of it. Not the doing it, but the sorting things out like leaving notes for people and logistics of my things and stuff. Everything goes through my mind, I think about it alot. 

I dont think I will do it, not sure, but I do think it alot. 

I feel bad for thinking of doing it, I dont want to leave my family and people I love. But I just naturally think it alot. I dont particularly want to live anymore, I dont enjoy my life apart from when I am with the people I love. I dont like the world, the people in it or the way it is. 

I mod a sub on reddit where I have many many amazing people but I wanted to come here to discuss it. I dont want those over there worrying about me, I like to set an example and I have to be strong for them. But I feel so weak. 

I found a piece of paper in my mums study with a song written on. I had previously told her I'd like it at my funeral - she must have written it straight down. Kinda hit reality that people think I may actually do it. I dont want to hurt her, or anyone, but I dont want to live. Awful, sorry for rambling. Anyone free to chat :(
