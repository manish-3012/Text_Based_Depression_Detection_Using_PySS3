I was at such a low, I was actually going to go through with it.To anyone who it may concern,

I think that the time has come to end this wretched existence. If I had done this a lot sooner, I would have saved a lot of people a lot of pain and trouble. But trouble is all I can seem to cause people. Trouble, pain and inconvenience. I have never been anything short of a waste of space; something to be laughed at, abused and scorned. Iâ€™ve heard that people love me and I would like to know who the hell these people are. From what Iâ€™ve seen, love is just a word casually thrown around for the simple sake of boredom or entertainment. There is no love in this world. Just lust and fleeting urges. Like the ones that â€˜makeâ€™ people do horrible things to children. 

The day I realized it all, I was contemplating where I wanted to go with my life. By my familyâ€™s standards, Iâ€™ve accomplished the greatest of feats; Iâ€™m not pregnant, nor do I have kids or have I had sex. I graduated high school and was going to college. Of course that ended abruptly as most good things do and now Iâ€™m left without a passion for art, nor any care about anything else. I donâ€™t care about anything anymore. Before I could think of everything I wanted to do in my life like as in traveling, falling in love, getting married, living off my art or even just owning a small cafÃ©. But now, it doesnâ€™t matter. Iâ€™m too broken to ever be good enough for someone. And since Iâ€™m not a loose whore, I will never be with anyone. And I guess not ever now anywayâ€¦

If anyone is even reading this at all, I just want you to know Iâ€™m sorry you found me like this. Iâ€™m sorry you even had to scrape any part of me off of whatever or had to put up with me at all. I just wish that I had never been an accident in the first place and that I never wasted anyoneâ€™s time. I wish my siblings had never known I existed. I wish my parents didnâ€™t have a failure such as I as offspring. I wish my parents all the best and that they can find someone to replace me as a better child. I wish my two best friends hadnâ€™t had to put up with my antics. I wish that I hadnâ€™t made them pay attention to me when I knew they were better off not bothering with me. I wish that I had died the day I fell down the flight of stairs or when I was little. I wish I never hurt anyone by knowing me. I wish I had drowned that day I fell into the ocean.

Iâ€™m sorry [female friend] for being so depressed all the time and making you listen to me when you had to study. Iâ€™m sorry that I was always so inconsiderate of what you had to do. Iâ€™ve always thought of you as the big sister I always wanted.

Iâ€™m sorry [male friend] for being so embarrassing to be around. I know you resent me for not being what I was supposed to be. Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™m always taking up the time you could be using to be around people who are more important. Thanks for being my big brother.

Iâ€™m sorry everyone else I didnâ€™t name. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m so forgetful that I canâ€™t even remember people who wasted their time on trying to help me. I never had a chance to go anywhere in this world I was given and Iâ€™m so, so sorry you were forced to help me along the way. I appreciated it so much.

To [both friends]: You two get 25% each of what I owned if you want it. Money included. My mother gets 50% for funeral expense. And as an added bonus, you can burn all of my art. It was crap and I donâ€™t know why I pursued it.

I donâ€™t know what comes next. But whatever it is, I deserved it. Be happy with that.
