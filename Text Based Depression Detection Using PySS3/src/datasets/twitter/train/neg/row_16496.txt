I donâ€™t know what to doI feel like I wasnâ€™t made for life on earth. Like I was put here by mistake or as a punishment for something. I donâ€™t belong here and Iâ€™ll never fit in or really adapt to being here. I could get into the ins and outs of why I think my life sucks, but honestly I donâ€™t even think it matters. Itâ€™s basically the same with everyone, isnâ€™t it? Abusive household, mental illness, blah blah blah. I barely remember any of it anyways.

Everything just feels sort of like a void and thereâ€™s an ache in my chest and a voice in my head telling me to go back to a home that doesnâ€™t exist. Anything has got to be better than here. 
Surely I have time for my life to get better but Iâ€™m too scared to take the risk. What if it doesnâ€™t? It hasnâ€™t yet. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because my first attempt was unsuccessful and I havenâ€™t had the chance to try again. I donâ€™t want anyone to be able to find me. I donâ€™t want anyone to have to deal with my body and as much as me and my mother donâ€™t get along, I donâ€™t think I could put her through the stress of coming home to the dead body of her child that took their own life. (I also donâ€™t think I could deal with knowing that my dog wouldnâ€™t know why I havenâ€™t come home yet either). 
Everything here feels so fuzzy. Iâ€™m always tired and sometimes Iâ€™ll look into the mirror and not recognize my reflection. Yesterday I thought I was staring at a whole other person and when I realized it was me I actually jumped back. I just feel disconnected with my body, with the people around me, with everything. I canâ€™t shake the feeling that Iâ€™m just not supposed to be here. I donâ€™t belong here, I know I donâ€™t. And I donâ€™t know what to do about it. 
Iâ€™ve been planning doing the deed for a while now because I want to go home. I should just kill myself and get it over with, because I already feel like a ghost in my own life, haunting the people who are walking around. I should just fucking die. Truth be told, I donâ€™t think my mother, or anyone in my family, would be that broken up about it. 
I think Iâ€™ve repeated myself two times over so Iâ€™ll stop now. I just wanted a place to vent and Iâ€™m new here so Iâ€™m not quite sure how this works. Thanks in advance I guess? I donâ€™t know.
