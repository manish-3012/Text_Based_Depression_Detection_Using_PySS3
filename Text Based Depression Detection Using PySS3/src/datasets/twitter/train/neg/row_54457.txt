Wrote out my will, and set out notesHello all. I am so deeply frustrated with myself. I am a freshman in college and I donâ€™t know why but the suicidal ideation that Iâ€™ve had for a few years has turned into something else. 
While my will and testament and advanced directive is short and unofficial, I think it will suffice as I have a small fund set aside to cover my estimated costs as well as having a plan of what I want done with my body post death. I have all of the specifics. 
I sent out a few â€œI love youâ€ postcards today without any context to a few distant friends. 
While I do feel incredibly guilty about going, I donâ€™t think I will leave much of a hole. I wish I could just not exist. I donâ€™t want attention and I donâ€™t want anyone to make a big deal about me being gone, I have specifics outlines in my will about that. 
I just feel like a burden, and I just want to be not here. Iâ€™ve been nothing but a waste of resources, time and money to all. I have been incredibly self serving, entitled and overall just a garbage human being for forever. 
I never contributed anything interesting to society and I donâ€™t think I will make a lasting impression even 10 years from now. The earth will turn without me.
