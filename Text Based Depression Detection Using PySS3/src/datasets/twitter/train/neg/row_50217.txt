Thank-you, from the bottom of my heart, to everyone who replied to my last post.I almost hit the bottom of that deep dark pit, so close to my sweet release. I didn't want to write a  physical suicide note, but I didn't want to leave this world without some form of last worlds. And I found this place... That night almost, almost, played out how I wanted it to. But for a reason beyond me, I woke up in the hospital almost a full week later after being in a medically induced coma. I didn't throw up the things I had taken, but I remember uncontrollably puking stomach acid, shaking so bad it was almost like I was having a seizure, and the worst pain - throughout my entire body. IT WAS SO PAINFUL YOU GUYS. By that time, I was stumbling around my place where I found my SO sleeping in the spare bedroom. Almost 4 hours had passed since I took everything. And somewhere from shaking him awake to and getting to the emergency room is all one big blur. I was almost there... But I'm happy it didn't workout... It's not my time to leave yet. So to cut this short, thank-you, to everyone who helplessly tried helping me. I'm okay, and everything will be okay.
