Am I just complaining?I have problems I think I could solve, but no one seems to be able or willing to help. When I explain them, the person listening just hears a litany of complaints. But they're not just complaints. I think the specific issues I talk about sum up to a pattern, and one that I could fix if I knew what to do. Instead, they say they'll let me "vent." I don't just need to get things out: I need to figure out how to prevent them from happening again.

When you're sinking and trying to get yourself out, you don't need to be heard. You need help fixing things. I am completely out of control and have lost so much of what I worked for that I will NEVER get back. I can't just put it behind me. I've lost a lot, and it's not as if I was irresponsible. I just wasn't actually capable of doing what I needed to. But no one sees that. they tell me to just move on. I can't.
