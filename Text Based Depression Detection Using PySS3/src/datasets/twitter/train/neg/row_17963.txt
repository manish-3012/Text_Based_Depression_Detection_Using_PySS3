Even Logic's 1-800 can't save me nowI've finally decided that I want to die.

When I got diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder for a second time and was prescribed medication, I really researched about the effects of what was given to me and what would happen if it was mixed with another choice medication that I took for a certain amount of time due to crippling PTSD. Turns out, even a small dosage of both can put me in a self-induced coma or death. This has been on my mind for a while and today, I've decided to push through with it.

I'm done being a burden to the people around me, especially my ex-boyfriend. Of all the people, he's the one who deserves to live in a world where I'm nothing but an awful memory. God knows how much I tried to prove that I've changed, that I can be a better me for us, that I wasn't going to let the past repeat itself, but it's really over now. Our pact to see if we still have a future in October? That's gone. He already erased all his memories that included me.

So, I'm going to give him the best gift that I can give to someone that I've put in so much pain - my death.
