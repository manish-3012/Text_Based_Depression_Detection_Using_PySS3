Feeling suicidal when you don't want to dieIt's so ironic. I've seen what my absolute lows are-- being abused by my family and terrorized by my brother. 3 years have passed since I've escaped, I've been living in the fucking light at the end of the tunnel... I've come so far in my healing and in my life... I know there's hope. But why cant I feel it?
