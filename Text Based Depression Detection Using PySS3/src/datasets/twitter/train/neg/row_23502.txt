Utterly Defeated...Anyone else just feel completely defeated, broken and lost? I'm 33, my life is shit, I have no life experiences and I'm too fucked up to do anything about it. I have 0 self confidence and 0 desirability and only one real friend. I have extreme social anxiety and can't be around a large number of people or even know what to say or how to behave.

I don't think I can go on like this anymore, I have achieved almost nothing in my life. Tonights plan is to lie here in bed and cry until either no more tears come out or I fall asleep, only to start the same shit cycle again tomorrow. I can't fucking don't this anymore.

I've tried to turn my life around, believe me I have tried but I've just become a burden to myself and everyone around me. I am extremely self destructive, have trouble controlling my feelings and emotions and I am really really struggling mentally. My head is fucking killing me right now.

I'm at my wits end, I just can't do this anymore, I fucking hate myself, my life, I'm so lost and broken and I just can't fucking do it anymore, I just want to give up :(
