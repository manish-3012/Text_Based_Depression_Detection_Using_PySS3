It's just not worth itI'm 32 years old, and I'm fucking nothing. I was badly abused and neglected as a child, then I was bullied all through school, which I left as soon as I could when I was 16.

Those early experiences made me have a huge mistrust of people in general. I never really had a job at all, even to this day. I've been trying for the past few years to get my life together, make something worth living. 

When people see my CV though, all they see is an almost middle aged man who's done nothing his whole life. No jobs, no relationships, no experience. No wonder I don't get call backs, not even for minimum wage bullshit work.

I've been trying, really trying for 4 or 5 years to get something, anything, but it's always no or maybe, and maybe never call you back. You know how it is.

I'm done. I refuse to fight so hard for the scraps, and not even get those. I refuse to live my life on benefits with no friends, just because the whole world has given up on me.

The biggest lie about all these thoughts, about this mental illness, is that it gets easier with age. That it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. It's not. Not for me.

I wish I could say it's been fun, but that'd be a lie. I'm out.
