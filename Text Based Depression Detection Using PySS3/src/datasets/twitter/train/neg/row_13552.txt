Why is life so cruel?Why do I have to deal with life? Everyone I meet has an incredible capacity for meanness. Everyone enjoys sizing one another up, grandiosely proclaiming who's smarter or who's more attractive or who's "better."

I am sick of being judged on a daily basis (in fact every minute, it seems). People criticize you for the smallest mistakes. My family, friends, etc. are irritatingly mean. I wish I could just relax, and not worry about what I see as their pettiness. I graduate high school in a few weeks yet I hate the endless rat race that is life. And yet, I would like to rise to the top. I have to study hard, I have to unctuously please people I hate. I want to succeed but I fucking hate the path to success.

I understand my perspective is warped as a result of my middle class comforts. I am a hypersensitive person, and my family brings this up often. In a sense, I am disabled because of this. But why is my hypersensitivity trivial? Why is it not important that my feelings are hurt more easily? I feel like a failure. I feel like I will never find love. I feel like life consists of me futilely working hard for achievements that constantly escape me.

What's the point? I'm not yet suicidal, I just am disillusioned with life. I hate everyone and everything. Help.
