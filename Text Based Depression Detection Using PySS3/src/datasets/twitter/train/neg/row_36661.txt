No one will care if I dieEveryday I have a super down period, I just get super depressed, thinking about my sad lonely life which I cant do nothing about but jump off a cliff. I don't know what to do, I'm not good at anything in this world, practically useless. I most likely cause more harm then good. I dont know if I was a bad person to deserve this, I dont think I was bad but seems like I did something bad in life. And I'm getting punished. So many suicidal thoughts I have to hid all the time in my head, its killing me on the inside.
