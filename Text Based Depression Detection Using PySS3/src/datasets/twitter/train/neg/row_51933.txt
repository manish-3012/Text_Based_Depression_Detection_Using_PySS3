Iâ€™m at my crisis point, yet again, but I am still struggling to find providersI posted on here maybe about a month ago, about how I had been homeless for the past 7 months, living alone with a dog, and Iâ€™ve since deleted that post. I want to thank the people that reached out to that post.

Iâ€™m no longer homeless! Iâ€™ve reached a crisis point though. I feel worse than the last time, and Iâ€™m so f*cking frustrated. The area I live in doesnâ€™t have a lot of providers, and the ones they do have either arenâ€™t taking new patients or theyâ€™ll only take one of my insurances. Itâ€™s frustrating, and itâ€™s an issue I keep running into, I think partially because of COVID-19. I understand, but that doesnâ€™t make it any less frustrating.

Iâ€™m so close to quitting. Iâ€™m so close to just giving up entirely. Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to just find somebody that will take me as a patient. I havenâ€™t been able to get my meds prescribed for two months now. I havenâ€™t been able to speak to a psychologist for even longer. I feel like the only way that I can be taken seriously, and to get my foot in the door, is to admit myself into the hospital again. But I live alone with my dog. Itâ€™s hard. I wish I could take him with me, but I canâ€™t.

Why is it so hard to get help? It shouldnâ€™t be so hard, that a person feels like suicide is the only option to be taken seriously.

Iâ€™m hurting. Iâ€™m struggling. Iâ€™m broke. The only thing I can do right is take care of my dog, who is the only life in my life thatâ€™s keeping me going.
