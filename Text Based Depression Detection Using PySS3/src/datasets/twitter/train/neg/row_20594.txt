Why does my mind always come back here?I post on this subreddit often. Usually when I am thinking about killing myself. 
I feel like I must not want to do it because Iâ€™m writing about it in hopes that people will remind me of the reasons worth living. Tell me itâ€™ll get better...or remind me who I will hurt. 
I guess this only works temporarily though because every other day, sometimes more, I feel this way. 
Being suicidal is a pain unlike others. Itâ€™s in my throat. It makes my vision fuzzy...it makes me forget things.. I often feel like Iâ€™m actually not awake. 
I can feel it in my stomach and sometimes in my bones. Almost like my body is giving up with my mind. 
I can feel the tears behind my eyes. I can feel the stress and sadness all the way from my stomach to my mouth. 
I lose my appetite most times but other times I binge eat. Last night I had an entire bag of chips and dip to myself. All of them. Like all of it. 
I would give anything not to feel this way...but I feel like the part of me that is holding on to life doesnâ€™t have control. Because the suicidal part of me is so strong that Iâ€™m literally doing nothing to help myself. 

How can I save myself when for the most part I donâ€™t want to be saved? I just want it to end.
