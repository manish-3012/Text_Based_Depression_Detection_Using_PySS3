How can this happen to me?I don't think i'm a bad person, I don't have any enemies and I don't hurt anybody. I was somebody in high school who was ready to go off to college. I was in the top 5%, started a club, was an officer of another, member of many, etc. I was so ready to move-in to my dorm, until I found out I couldn't go. 

My dad promised me so many things. I considered other options since I saw it wasn't feasible awhile ago, but he promised. We ended up going to orientation, I met a lot of great people and met my roommate in person. I fell in love with the school and had a plan to work my ass off to cover the other 3 years. And now its all taken away from me because of $7,630. That fucking number.

I honestly don't know what i'm going to do with my life. I don't wanna be a nobody and sit at home. I want to do something with my life. And the thing is, my parents are making it even worse. I've had to deal with their fucking fighting ever since I was little and I honestly don't think I can make it through some more years.

I cried my eyes out calling the national hotline, and I haven't cried in years. It helped alleviate some anxiety, but now I have this raging headache and feeling that nothing is gonna get better. I don't wanna do anything drastic but I honestly do not know what to do. I did everything I could, everything. It upsets me that i've worked so hard just to live this summer in anxiety and depression. 

But, I guess life isn't fair, right?
