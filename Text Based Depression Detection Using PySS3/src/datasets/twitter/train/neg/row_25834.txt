SOS: Suicide plan moved up, squeezed on time!My school intends to be the first college to open its doors in the states perhaps. I feel like studying at harvard would have been much easier than this (if only i could afford it)..

Theyâ€™re starting waaaaaay early in august and i have less than three weeks to commit suicide!

I have taken summer courses because my parents forced me to but now â€˜summerâ€™ vacation is less than a month!

Iâ€™m not a machine, I cannot study all year round. Because iâ€™m a fucking immigrant itâ€™s either this or be deported!

Iâ€™d rather die in some peace with whatever is left of my dignity (if any)

Since u know some background, I cannot buy a gun like other people die and I donâ€™t know anyone who has one otherwise I woulda â€˜borrowedâ€™ it to finish myself off.

I really just wanna end my life and i know no one will help make me get one so i guess i have to commit a crime and run from the cops to be shot at or just take all the pills i have and see what happens?

If u have any humanity left in u or this pinche world, shoot me! :)
