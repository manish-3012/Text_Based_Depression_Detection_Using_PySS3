I am so sadI don't know. I'm in a fraternity. I was literally just at a party. But I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I just want to cry. Why am I here? I never feel happy. I can fake happiness. That is easy. Boone ever knows. But I hate my life. I broke up with a girl I love because she want right for me. And yet she keeps showing up in my life. She isn't right for me. I know she isn't. So I can't talk to her. But that area of my life has a big whole in it. And it makes me so sad. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense but I'm drunk and if I wasn't I wouldn't be posting this. I just am staring to drink and smoke more. And I don't know what else I can do.
