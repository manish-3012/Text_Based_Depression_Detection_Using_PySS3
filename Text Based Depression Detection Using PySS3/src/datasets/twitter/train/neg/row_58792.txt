i guess i need advicei'm going to end my life, that much is definite. please don't try to dissuade me, nothing you can say will change my mind. i don't know what to do about my friends, though. they've never really cared about me, but i'm still worried that my death might affect them. should i tell them, or just do it? i don't want anyone to be hurt, and hurting someone is the only thing that scares me. i'm not worrying about my family, though. they've told me to kill myself several times, and this would be the only time i've ever pleased them.
