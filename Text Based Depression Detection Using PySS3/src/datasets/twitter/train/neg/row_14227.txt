just want the waves to finally take me one dayIt always comes back, every night, if not every few weeks, months- end of the day, itâ€™s always there. In waves. Just wish itâ€™d be enough to one day take me by whatever natural means for a person to squeamish and fearful to do it himself. 
Then I wouldnâ€™t have to fight every fucking night, and all to please who? Fair-weather friends and family who only pretend to care when the timeâ€™s just right so they donâ€™t have guilt or blood on their hands? No one deserves me, no one wants me.
Just wish for life to take me out itself on one of these many lonely, quiet nights.
