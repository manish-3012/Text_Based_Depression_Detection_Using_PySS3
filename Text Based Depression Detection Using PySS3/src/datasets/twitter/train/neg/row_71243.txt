Making plans to end thisI'm tired. Lately nothing seems to go my way. My car broke down and now my boss is treating me like shit. I try to request a day off to rest since working 3rd shift is giving me terrible sleep deprivation, I get the run around before finding out it's been rejected. I have to commute on the bus and that further takes away sleep. I've asked for consideration about making time to actually live my life but I get pissy and caustic remarks about commitment back. I'm tired. Tired of this dead-end job and it's overblown sense of importance. Tired of struggling with money. Tired. Every moment of happiness is so fleeting. I don't want to spend the rest of my days waking up and working and sleeping and getting yelled at by a man who thinks a contract is more important than his employees well-being.

I've been making plans while at work. I work in high-rises and it would be easy to just walk off the roof or have a similar accident.

I'm saving money to pay for my funeral but everyone thinks its for a car. I'm planning on packing my apartment up and donating things under the pretense of spring cleaning. I haven't decided how I'll end things but I'm planning on making it easier for everyone when i do go.

I just can't dealing with people or myself anymore. I'm so depressed it hurts.


UPDATE: Im alive. I'm gonna make changes. I can do this. Thank you all.
