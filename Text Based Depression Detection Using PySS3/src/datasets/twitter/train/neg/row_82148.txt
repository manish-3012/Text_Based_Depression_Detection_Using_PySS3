A Poem I WroteHey guys. I wrote this poem last night, and I just now stumbled upon this sub. I thought the poem might help some of you who are considering suicide. Here it is:


"They say ink is permanent

But a blind father will never glimpse the light of his daughter's smile


They say diamonds are forever

But the hands of widow and lover spend eternity cold and apart


They say no one lives forever

That you can't avoid the tolling of the bell


They say you only get one life

I pray to God I live mine welI"


Death is permanent. It's one of the only things that is truly forever. Even the Earth and the stars around us will crumble and fall. Yes, death is inevitable, but you've been given a gift beyond compare: your life. You have the chance to live it long, and to live it well. There may not be people out there who care about you now, but there are people out there who will care about you in the future. Don't waste the life you've been given because things seem bleak right now. Once it's gone, you can't take it back.

Feel free to reach out to me if you need anything. You are loved, and you are valued.
