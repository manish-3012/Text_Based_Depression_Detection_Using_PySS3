Should I be scared to help?Hi SW, I have a question.

I've seen a lot of posts lately by Redditors who converse with suicidal individuals and are sometimes able to help. I would like to be on those individuals, but fear the outcome of any mistakes on my behalf far too much. Is this fear unreasonable?? What should I know to overcome this fear of making things worse for a suicidal person?
