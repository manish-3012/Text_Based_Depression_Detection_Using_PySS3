I tied the noose and wrote the noteBut like I expected, I'm too scared. I don't think it's a lingering desire to live or anything. If I could push a button and be dead right now I think I would. I had always had plans to use an exit bag and I was so at peace with that, but now that the time has come I could not get the gas tank to do it. I don't want any pain. I dug some alcohol out of the cupboard because I thought maybe it could give me the courage. I haven't had any of it yet. I hate drinking and the idea of it having to be one of the last things I do is upsetting to me. But maybe I will give in. 

I told my boyfriend not to come today. I don't want to tell him that I'm planning on doing it. I don't feel like it's fair to him to have to deal with that and he doesn't know how. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow to adjust my meds but I'm so tired. I'm so so so tired. I don't want to try anymore. I want to be done. When I think of the idea of being alive in five years, I break down. I'm not meant to be here. I want to leave. I don't want to tell him that but part of me wishes he knew because I know he would come. I want to send him the note and get it over with but I am too scared. If I send him the note and then chicken out or it doesn't work, I'll have to face him. Maybe he'll call the police. I don't want them to come. I just want to be gone.
