This pales to some of the posts on this subreddit, but I felt like I needed someone to talk to.Hello everyone.

Today at school, I was putting up my cello in orchestra class, and someone was blocking my locker. I asked him to move, but he didn't respond, so I poked him. However, after I poked him, he (much bigger guy than me) came over and attempted to poke me back. In an attempt to protect myself, I curled up, and when doing so, punched a large hole in the side of my cello (in the ribs). I looked up the cost of repairing such a hole, and I nearly fainted from it - it is around $800! When I came home from school, I told my parents, and both of them absolutely blew it. They told me "it's only been the first 5 weeks of school and you already have caused so many problems! You first forget to turn in a homework, then you get bullied on the bus, and I had to write an email to the principal, and now you punch a hole in your cello? Why can't you ever consider the consequences of anything? Why didn't you just take the poke? Why did you try to curl up? What is wrong with you?" My dad later told me that "our family tries to save so much money, and now, you blow all the money that we saved by a huge accident? What the hell is wrong with you?" 

I have told them a few times in the past that I have felt sometimes that if I was gone, the world would be much happier, but then they tell me that I shouldn't use the word "depression" and suicide is the most selfish thing one can perform and then they yell at me for like an hour. 


Please help!
