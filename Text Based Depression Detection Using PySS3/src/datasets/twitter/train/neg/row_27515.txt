I feel like Iâ€™m at the endI canâ€™t really even remember when I last felt happy. I watched my boyfriend commit suicide &amp; I was left to pick up the pieces. I ask myself why everyday. Five years have passed &amp; it replays in my head so much. I was literally picking up pieces to â€˜fixâ€™ him. This has made me an anxious piece of crap. I have since married and had a child. Those five years flew by yet I still feel empty. I feel like I canâ€™t be fixed. I can tell my husband is unhappy with me. He use to constantly show me off, post me to social media. Now itâ€™s like I donâ€™t exist. Other shit is going on with us &amp; itâ€™s just killing me more and more. I donâ€™t think he loves me anymore. I canâ€™t take another heartbreak. I really do love him with everything in me. But I think he doesnâ€™t want to be with me anymore. He just does more and more and more to push me away. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up. My son is the only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself.
