I think Iâ€™m going to do it tomorrowI donâ€™t know if I ever wanted to die as much as it just hurts to be alive. I sustain an almost happy feeling with sex and compliments on my intelligence (never my face or body or personality), but I just canâ€™t do it. My ex will blame himself and I donâ€™t want to hurt him any more than I already have, but Iâ€™ve hurt him so much just being myself. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this really, I guess I just donâ€™t want to talk to anyone I know about it. If it blindsides people then theyâ€™ll have an easier time realizing itâ€™s not their fault.
