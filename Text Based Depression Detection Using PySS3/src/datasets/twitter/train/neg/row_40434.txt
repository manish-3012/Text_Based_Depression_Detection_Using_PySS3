I have never wanted to kill myself as much as I do right now.Before you say, "Well you came here for help so that means you don't really want to." I know. I know that what I really want is so be able to be saved. But then there's the problem that is just really hard to put into words.

I guess I will just start with some basic things about me. I'm 14. Listen, I know I'm young. But please, I am begging you, please don't look over this because of that. This isn't some teenage girl "Omg I hate my life" bullshit. I'm not suicidal because "My mom wouldn't let me get a new phone!" or because of a guy. Being young shouldn't have anything to do with this.

The amount of anxiety I have over everything is causing me to feel this way. I'm not sure if my depression caused my anxiety, if my anxiety causes my depression, or if they have nothing to do with each other. All I know is that what they are both doing to me is ruining my life. Like I said before, the problem is extremely hard to put into words.

I'm not even sure what i'm trying to get at right now. I'm just so sorry. I don't know. I'm feeling like this is my only option. I've always had the thoughts, but I have never wanted to do it as much as I do now. Please, someone talk me out of it. I need help, and this is the only place I can think of getting it quickly.
