feeling suicidal, think i would like some helpI've attempted suicide twice before, roughly 7 years ago. Not too long ago, my girlfriend, the girl I was saving up to buy an engagement ring for, broke up with me. We lived together for over five years. The last year or so, felt like nothing more than a friendship though. So the break-up was hard, but it could have been worse.
I now have a new girlfriend. She really seemed to like me for the first few days. Then she started pushing me away, and telling me not to touch her. We spent tons of time together at first. We even spent the nights with each other. But now, I'm back here at my mom's apartment, in my mid twenties, no job, no drivers license, no money. I'm drinking right now, which I'm sure isn't the greatest idea. But oddly enough, it seems to help somehow. My girlfriend didn't want to be with me tonight. I don't mean to sound whiny. I just don't know what to do. If I were to think of an easy way to commit suicide, I'd do it. I don't have anyone to talk to right now. So hopefully, you can help, reddit. Thank you.
