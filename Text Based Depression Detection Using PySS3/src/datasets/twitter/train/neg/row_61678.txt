i hate everything about myselftrigger warning for self harm shit 

i know i shouldn't compare myself to other people but it sucks. they always say don't judge your life off someone else's social media, they just post the highlights. okay??? at least they have highlights. shit worthy to post somewhere. shit worthy of talking about.

i can't do shit. i'm below average (at best) at everything i do and am, no matter how fucking hard i try. i'm taking the same fucking math class for the third time now because i'm so fucking stupid. my 12 year old sister and 15 y/o brother are helping me with my fucking math homework.

i can't even say i'm doing anything productive ever because i don't even have a fucking job. my parents are paying for my math class, they're paying my probation officer, my court fees, everything. i owe them almost $1500 already and this shit JUST started. i can't even drive because i lost my license so i'm fully dependent on everyone. i hate it. i had more freedom in high school than i did now because i fucked up one night and it sent me into a fucking spiraling depression

i hate being sober. i hate it. i hurt myself so i can feel something. it gives me a high. i love it. my boyfriend hates it. i've made him cry because i do it. i hate that. all i do is disappoint him and everyone else who knows me . i've been trying desperately to talk to people i went to high school with and i was friends wit and none of them want to talk to me. i'm trying so hard to find reasons to not fucking off myself but i can't. i'm a leech i'm a disappointment i barely fucki g exist as it is i want it to be over with
