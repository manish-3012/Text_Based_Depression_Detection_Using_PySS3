I been trying to convince myself to kill myselfI been trying to convince myself to kill myself because I don't what my gender is (I'm trans btw) like I don't want to be a man because having a thought of a deep voice, masculine face and hair makes me sick but I couldn't ever understand how it feels like to be a woman I believe all women hate me even my "friends" dysphoria isn't the only thing I struggle but I have autism (pathological demand avoidance) and all the stress I go through is unbearable people always say to me 'Oh he is 17 and he'll get over it' the fact is I know I will keep going through shit no where to go I don't believe my family really loves me and been considering doing drugs for a while but now I want to end my life been hitting, cutting or anything to harm myself if I can be a man or (trans) woman then what is the point of my existance I can't be a drag or transvestites because they are all gross as hell idk what to do with my life anymore I hate myself, I hate being a man a feminine one at that I don't want to be gay or general just don't want to be a part of this cruel world so if anyone can tell me ways to kill myself that would be great
