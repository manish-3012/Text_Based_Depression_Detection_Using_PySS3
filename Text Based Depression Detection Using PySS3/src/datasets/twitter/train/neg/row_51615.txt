I don't want to be here anymoreI've never really enjoyed my life. Its always been full of pain, suffering and disappointment. I've always been cast away in life, no one has ever really paid any attention to me. I've gone 19 years, few friends, no relationships. Only one person knows how i feel but i think even she has had enough of me as she has blocked my number and ceased contact with me. I always knew i was a loser and that few people really care if I live or die. I know my family will miss me and i don't want to hurt them but they'll get over it right? I don't talk a lot so its almost like i wasn't even here anyway. I think maybe being dead i can finally be at peace but i'm scared. What should I do?
