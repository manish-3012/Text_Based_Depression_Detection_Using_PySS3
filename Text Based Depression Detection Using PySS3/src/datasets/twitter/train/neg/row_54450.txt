What valid reason is there for me to not kill myself?The world is garbage. The entire design of our society is broken and all of the broken parts are entrenched so deeply that they are autonomous at this point. These systems only validate themselves. Humanity will never have the ability to abolish and rebuild. Homogeneity is our eventual demise. The time of the individual is gone.

Money, social class, the ruling elite. All predetermined and self perpetuating.


I do not want to play this game. I want to be at peace. Everyone is at eachother's throats. There is no such thing as goodness. People are inherently awful.

This place isn't worth it, and there's almost nothing left to salvage.

80% of all species wiped out. Poverty everywhere. Community dissolved. There is nothing. I've tried to take part, I've tried to be a part of this, it isn't happening. And I'm fucking fed up.
