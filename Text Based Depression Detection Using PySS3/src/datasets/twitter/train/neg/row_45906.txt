I'm so lost right now...So, I'm currently struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. I'm seeing a therapist and am trying out my second type of anti-depressant (first one didn't work). 

It honestly feels like this is going to be my life for the rest of however long I can keep going. I don't see myself making it to 30 (currently 21) and I regret not ending it all back in February, back when I didn't care how everyone would be impacted by my sudden departure. 

I guess what I want to ask is... how do I keep going? I have no motivation, I want to stop my part time job, drop out of uni and just stop stressing about everything. The problem is that I can't do any of these things, I'd be a huge disappointment to all my family and friends. They expect better. 

Not gonna lie, its easy typing here, the only people who know about all this are my therapist, gp and best friend of 16 years. I do and don't want to die, but the thought of it brings me this absolute relief. 

What do I do???

P.s. sorry about formatting, I'm on mobile
