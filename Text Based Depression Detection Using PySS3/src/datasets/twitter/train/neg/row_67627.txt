will someone please just say somethingi seriously cant even get up out of my bed today. its so nice out and my entire fraternity is having a free bbq for my college and i cant even get out of bed. im president of the fucking fraternity and im not even there. i have so much homework theres no way im going to finish it. ive gotten straight A's my whole life and i have like all C's and a B this semester. i fucking relapsed last night on coke and now all i can think about is my drug of choice (heroin). i seriously just want to hang myself. ive already looked up ways to do it. i seriously need help. i dont even care enough to use any sort of grammar whatsoever. someone please, just say something, anything.

EDIT:Thank you guys for the kind and distracting words. I never went to the BBQ but I got lots of work done. It's refreshing to see people i dont even know say supportive words. Today feels like a good day.
