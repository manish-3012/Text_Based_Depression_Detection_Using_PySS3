Going to the doctor tomorrowI've been wanting to go to the doctors for awhile to get professional help because my depression has gotten worse throughout the months. I'm honestly scared for tomorrow... I don't know what's going to happen at the doctors office. Anyone who have gone to the doctors for depression, what do they normally do during the visit?
