I'm such a mess I needed to tell someoneI've been wanting to die since I was ten. I remember trying to choke myself and trying to figure out how to tie up then when I became a teenager I used to take pills to know how much time could I take it. I feel very embarrassed I have a good life, I have a place to sleep, I did two degrees, I have a job and my friends are warm and lovely people but I still feel I'm disappointing everyone even me. I'm 27 and i'm such a mess.

I'm in my room all the time after work and sometimes I like to keep myself quiet while I'm lying on bed pretending I do not exist. I love that feeling. I enjoy when nobody notices me. I had some relief hurting myself time ago when my anxiety did not leave me to go out of bed, I was not able to see myself in a mirror and used to eat in the dark and waiting until midnight to go to the bathroom. I do not want to go back to that dark place.

I've been thinking a lot about how my parents can use the money I've been saving for the funeral so they would not have to spend money on that.

Nobody knows how sad I am and I'm not sure if that makes me feel worse. You know with people "I'm happy" I laugh ...

I don't have enough money to go for therapy and I don't really think i can fix myself (i don't have nothing broke in my life) and my family truly rejects stuff about mental health.

I would like to know how to be happy and avoid those thoughts about kill myself. I mean I do not even have a good motive to do it

I'm sorry english is not my first language and I'm rambling in my thoughts
