i have nothing left to live for nowi just lost my best friend, for good. he said my depression is making him feel bad and that it's best for him to stop talking to me.

we were on shaky grounds for a long time, but now it's really over.

i don't feel like i can go on now. every friendship i had, and they were all online, ended similarly.

i'm too big of a screwup. so i will end it. things will never get better

i want to scream and shout and hurt people

but what difference will that make

i have no one now and it's all my fault

downvote this you hate me anyway everyone does i'm a bad person and i should be killed
