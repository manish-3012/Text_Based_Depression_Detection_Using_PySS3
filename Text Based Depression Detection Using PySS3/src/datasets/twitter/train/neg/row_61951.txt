I want to do it so, so badlyThis grief isn't something that will ever go away. I see no hope, no prospect of joy, just the rest of my life...and that's a long fucking time...miserably stuck in this hell, missing him, wishing it was me instead. 

I'm unable to lie to myself anymore..this is my life. Alcohol and drugs can only do so much...so now what? 

I just wanna die. by gunshot, by single car accident, I don't care, I just want to be gone from here and in his arms again. 

This hell isnt survivable.
