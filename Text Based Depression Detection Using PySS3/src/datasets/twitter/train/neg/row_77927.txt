ReflectionI fucking hate looking in the mirror. I want to jump off a bridge.i hate my appearance. I work out and be healthy so my body can look better. If my body looks good I can distract from my face. I wish I was good looking at least. Maybe people would notice my pain. This life is so painful for me. I despise most things now. Every time I try, life finds a way to tell me to give up. No matter what I do, I can never be happy. I know â€œlooks donâ€™t matterâ€ but when you only see good looking people being cared about, it starts to matter. I just hate seeing that I am who I am. I want this nightmare to end. I wish I could cut and heal quickly so my scars could be gone by morning. Then, I could finally feel with no consequence.
