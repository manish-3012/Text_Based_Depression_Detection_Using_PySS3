About meIâ€™ve been really suicidal for the past month-ish, and every day that goes by, I find less and less light to keep me alive. Iâ€™ve written down the plan on how Iâ€™ll do it, it includes me driving far from where I live, and being alone for a few days, and seeing if I feel better or if I still canâ€™t handle my suicidal self. Iâ€™d get a new cheap phone so no one would be able to contact me, and I could just try to be at peace with myself.

College classes have been rough this quarter, I have tons of homework and Iâ€™m just barely staying on top of it, but I donâ€™t really care about registration next quarter because it matters less and less to me every day.

My girlfriend is great, but sheâ€™s also suicidal, and we canâ€™t talk to each other about much without it really hurting both of us. Sheâ€™s honestly the only reason Iâ€™m still here right now, but all of our recent fighting is damaging the connection I have to her, and thatâ€™s just fueling my suicidal feelings.

I wish I could just end it all. I want it just to stop

I just needed to say this. Thanks for reading
