My unborn daughter is the only thing keeping me aliveI donâ€™t have the energy to type out why I want to end it. Thereâ€™s a few of reasons. If it werenâ€™t for my fiancÃ©e being 16 weeks pregnant Iâ€™d end it already. She may be better off without me anyways. My daughter will never know I existed so itâ€™ll all be the same.
