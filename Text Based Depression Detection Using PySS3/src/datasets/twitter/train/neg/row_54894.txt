I'm tired... of being alive.I've posted here before but never mind that, who cares anyway. No one cares, at least of me, that I know of. Maybe this is just me venting out, as if anyone cared. What I remind myself is that no one cared about me. I'm tired.
When I said that I feel like I wanna die etc. etc. , people then said I should tell them, let it out. But no, as stupid as I am, I always decide to keep it to myself. But when I really need help and asked them of it, they ignored me. I don't know why but I guess because that I'm nothing, I'm just a ridiculous piece of crap that no one really cares. Just be alive, only to mourn over if I die. Meh, I don't think anyone would even care if I'm gone.
Why am I alive? Why don't my mom just followed my dad's order and abort me before I was born? People don't even cared about me, I'M SICK OF THIS!!!
Yea this can be like a post where I'm being useless, venting out stuffs, being an attention whore (other people deserves more attention, of what I care). But no, I'm tired being alive and I wanna end all this. NO ONE CARES, of me at least, what I know of.
Sorry for taking your time, sorry for disturbing you, sorry for being alive.
