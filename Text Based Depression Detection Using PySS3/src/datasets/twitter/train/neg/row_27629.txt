i should be happy but Iâ€™m notItâ€™s like embarrassing. Iâ€™m on two antidepressants, just got a new job, have a great SO and we just moved into a place of our own. 

I havenâ€™t been able to help out with bills and things but heâ€™s been more than happy to help. I just feel so guilty. Every time something goes wrong I break down and cry because I feel like itâ€™s all my fault and I should be punished for it but heâ€™s just so nice. I canâ€™t even imagine him raising his voice or anything but somehow in my life I always need someone to be angry at me and if thereâ€™s not someone then I have to make it. What the fuck is that about. 

anyway I wish I didnâ€™t exist whatever.  I just want to go away. Iâ€™m so fucjing stupid and ugly nothing matters anymore. I am just done.
