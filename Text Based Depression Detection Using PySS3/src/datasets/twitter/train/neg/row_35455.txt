AloneIâ€™m alone. No matter how hard I try, my friends donâ€™t care when Iâ€™m depressed. They only want to be around me when Iâ€™m happy. And I donâ€™t want to burden them either. My only friend I could talk to is on a trip and I donâ€™t want to break their happiness by talking about how bad I am right now. I just donâ€™t know what to do. No one in my life understands more or cares enough to try. Iâ€™m really tired of this life.
