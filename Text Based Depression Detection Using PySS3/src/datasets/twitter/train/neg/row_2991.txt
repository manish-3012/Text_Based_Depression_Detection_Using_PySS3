I've abused my girlfriend to the point of being suicidal.Long story short, I cheated on my girlfriend and made her upset. I didn't treat it very seriously and basically treated it like she should get over it. I hurt her multiple times because of this, got arrested, she's now in physical therapy, but her doctors are incompetent. I promised her I'd learn to drive to get her somewhere better but I've dragged my feet. Her neck and back aren't getting better and she can't do anything without hurting. She's now begging me to buy a gun so she can kill herself. 

Everything is falling apart, and I'm not sure what to do. I didn't mean to really hurt her, I just wanted the fighting to stop. I want to fix everything. Can somebody please tell me there's hope for her? Can somebody give me advice on what to do? I have to fix this. I can't let her life be ruined because of me. Is it too late for her to get better? Please help.
