nothing makes me happy anymorenothing in life makes me happy anymore,  I just feel so empty like I'm just going through life as a ghost. It's not just that I can't be happy, but I just feel so empty and nothing seems to make me feel anything. I used to be angry all the time but now I just feel nothing at all, not even anger or sadness anymore. I cant tell my parents because there approach to this sort of stuff is just to 'get over it' kind of thing. It's getting to the point where I wake up and severely dread the days, I wish I could just sleep instead because nothing seems to make me feel anything and it feels like there is no hope for me to get through this. I feel so alone like this, does anyone else feel like this? I just don't know what to do anymore.
