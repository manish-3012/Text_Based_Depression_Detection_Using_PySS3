what's r/sw/'s stance on suicide notes?
tonight i'm considering whether or not to leave one. 

do people who don't know need to know? will it help or just make them feel worse? 

i'm alone in my apartment and pondering things.

everything is a mess. i need to get my shit together and do this.

please don't judge me.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the kind words. When I am super upset it's hard to accept support/advise so please forgive me if i have been difficult. Today I have been thinking a lot and I decided to make a list of things that are causing me trouble.

1) depression and anxiety. taking meds for it and they help but for some reason i have a hard time taking them every day.

2) money problems. I had to cancel 2 therapy appointments in a row because my account is overdrawn i have no money to feed it right now.

3)My job is very stressful but I am afraid to go somewhere else.

4)Tl;dr: family problems. Crazy mother that refuses to go away. Uggh.
