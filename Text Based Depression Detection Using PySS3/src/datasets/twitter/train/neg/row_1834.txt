Im doneI'm only 18 and yet I feel I should just end my life, I will never accomplish anything. I'm trying my hardest to study but it just seems like I'm too fucking stupid.

I do have friends, howevee I get extreme anxiety around them ti the point where I always leave and go home to cut myself.

I'm just fucking lost, I don't know what to do or who to tell but I'm on the brink of just ending it all.
