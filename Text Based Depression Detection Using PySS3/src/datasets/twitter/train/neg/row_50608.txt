Numb and ready to dieI have been suicidal since I was a young teen and I'm 20 now. The only reason I haven't blown my head off with a shotgun is a lack of money to purchase the gun. Socializing is like trying to hold a mountain up on my back like I'm the fucking Hulk because I have autism. I hate that it had to be me. Why me? Sometimes I wonder if this is hell and I'm paying for sins I committed in a past life. I hear how I'm "socially blind" and "not hardwired to be social" like 99% of the fucking human race is and it makes me want to fucking die. I can't talk normally. I can't walk normally. I can't do anything normally because I'm not fucking NORMAL! Whatever...I don't even care anymore. One day my body will be discovered without a head with my guts splattered across the floor and walls.
