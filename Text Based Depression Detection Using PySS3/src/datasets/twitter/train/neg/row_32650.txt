What to do?Hi everyone, 

I have a new friend that I was just starting to get to know before the pandemic hit. She and I had been in touch regularly and then as we all started to work from home and get locked in we drifted a part. 

She reached out to me about a week ago and said she was looking for a change and thinking about moving to a new place. I didn't find this alarming at all. 

Yesterday I sent her a message to ask her how she was and she said she is bad. She was giving short responses and something about it was very alarming to me. I asked her if I could call her tomorrow and she said maybe. But then she went completely silent and stopped responding to my messages. 

I called her this morning and a few other times throughout the day and sent her several messages to ask if she is okay, and I got no responses. I don't know her well, but I know she lives alone. She works in healthcare and so I think she would likely understand my concern and send a text back to let me know she is okay. But maybe she is just embarrassed or something and is ignoring me for other reasons. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't know her address, or her last name, I only have her first name and her phone number. I don't know anyone that knows her so I don't know who to reach out to. I am in the US. 

I am worried if she is fine that I may just be really annoying her. But if she is not, what if she needs help and its not too late? 

If there are any tips or advice here on what to do, please let me know.
