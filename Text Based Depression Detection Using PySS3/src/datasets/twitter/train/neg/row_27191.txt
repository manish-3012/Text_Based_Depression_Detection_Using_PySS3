depressed contemplating life issuesso here goes... I'm 53, no kids,  no relationships.  without purpose in life.  Feel as if I am all alone. researching ways to commit suicide on reddit and came across this forum.  as life progresses feel more isolated and realize it's all my own doing.  do not know how to break the cycle of self sabotaging behaviors... and self destruction.  thought about getting a dog for companionship.. just have this empty feeling inside of me.. no self worth.  have been seriously thinking about ending it this week.  don't know what to do.   thanks for listening
