Out of OptionsAfter tuesday, i donâ€™t know what to do anymore. whenever i feel suicidal i change things. left town for a month, made it worse. came back, worse. was productive at home etc, still worse. my family wonâ€™t listen to me no matter what i talk about. iâ€™m either yelled at or ignored completely like i never said anything to begin with. iâ€™m genuinely completely alone for the first time i think. tuesday is my first therapy appointment since last month. i finally get to talk to someone- my whole month has been fixated on this day. if iâ€™m still suicidal after that i just genuinely donâ€™t think i can keep going. its just a fact at this point, iâ€™ve almost accepted it. itâ€™s not that i want to die really. i want a good life. iâ€™ve just never had one and i really donâ€™t think i ever will so my only choice is to die. iâ€™m out of options i cant live like this. not even a cry for help i donâ€™t want to burden strangers i just want this out there. maybe someone understands.
