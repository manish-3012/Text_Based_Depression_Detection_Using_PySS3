Why do I always feel alone?I have one IRL friend and a couple of relatives. Plus a handful of online friends that come and go. I've been comfortable like this. Stable. 

But its all coming apart and I don't understand. I've always been introverted, being alone never bothered me, but now I feel alone and insecure even when I am getting the attention I've begun to crave. I've never had a romantic relationship but I felt okay without one most of the time. 

I've become incredibly envious of people I know that do have an active social life. People that are in relationships. I've never felt like this until lately. I don't understand why lately that changed. 

I'm sad, I'm scared, and I don't like this. I had made peace with the fact that I'll never have those things, and I felt okay most of the time. But I don't feel okay now and I don't understand. Something broke. 

I'm autistic or something, I don't really late to other people, so its always been VERY VERY hard for me to maintain any kind of relationship with people - and even harder to start one. I made peace. I accepted that my dead social life wasn't so bad. Why do I not feel that way now?

Something broke. I don't like it. I know I'm being illogical but I'm freaking the hell out. My comfort has been disrupted. 

I can't stand this. I guess I'm feeling a bunch of emotions that I kept pent up for my entire teenage and adult life. I'm considering suicide.
