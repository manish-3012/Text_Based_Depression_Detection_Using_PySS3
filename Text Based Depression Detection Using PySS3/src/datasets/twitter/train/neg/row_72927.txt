only 15 and tired of life already.I am suffering with extreme bullimia, depression, and two personality disorders..
on an average day I'll wake up at 1 in the afternoon I will start to eat in my bed and then puke it in a bucket , till I am exhausted of all that food and vomiting till 9 in the evening, then at 10 in the evening I'll cry and overthink or disguise of my behavior earlier that day..

I only come out of my bed to eat but for the rest of day I'm laying in my bed doing nothing

then I'll sleep at 5 and the circle will continue 

I don't go to school, I don't meet with friends, I don't have a purpose in my life..
I don't do the things a normal teenage should 


currently iam waiting to be admitted into a 
psychiatric hospital, it will be my third time that I'm going to a psychiatric hospital, it'll be my last hope 

it's been 2 year like this for now, I've did 6 other suicide attempts before and got in the hospital 2 times too, I have no idea what I should do now... 
I'm desperate.... antidepressants doesn't work neither for me... I feel hopeless
