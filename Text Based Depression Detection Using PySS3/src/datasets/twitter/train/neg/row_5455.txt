Scared and tired. Out-options. I think I've come to the end of trying anymore. 
I'm tired of it all. 

I feel haunted by fear and anxious thoughts. 

It feels like I'm unable to go on with my life. I've tried holding everything together, but I'm falling apart. 

I tried professional help. It was the worst experience of my life. I get different and good help now, but I can't really see a better future in any way. I feel ruined by my first encounter with "help". I don' really think anything can mend how hurt I've become by how horrible it was.

Is there anyone here who were able to get over truly poor "help" and, to put it not-so-lightly, betrayal in a therapy setting? Anyone who got worse by the "help" but managed to get better afterwards?  

I don't know what to do. Sometimes I dream of running away and giving it a try to start over again. Most of the time I simply want to disappear though. 

I've never attempted suicide before. If I do attempt, in the US, what could I reasonably expect if I fail? Will I be locked up? If I'm unsuccsesfull and get brain damage or other injuries and don't have ID on me, what's likely to happen then?
