I'll never forget about my exShe fills my every thought still. With every action I take I'm always considering how it will make her feel and what I can do to make her happy. She took control of my life for a year and a half and now I don't feel like I exist on my own.

Whenever I think about the future, I still imagine the two of us together having a family with two kids. We're all just having an amazing time together, we all love each other more than anything in the world.

Then I wake up and it's all just a cruel fantasy. I can't keep having these thoughts. She decided to have a single life yet I'm trapped feeling like I'm still in the same controlling relationship, still suffering the same abuse.

My mind can't handle this any longer.
