Just your typical suicidal teenager post.Hey. I don't know why I'm posting but thanks for clicking. I'm probably going to delete this.

My life's pretty shit. I'm 16, I don't go to school, I sleep all day and I play video games all night.

I wake up and I cry, I go to sleep and I cry some more. Amazing, right?

My dad's an emotional abusive asshole.

I'm pretty sure I have depression and anxiety but when I brought it up with my mom, she said something that made me self-conscious and I dropped it.

I used to be a cutter.

This is like one of those lame youtube videos. The one with the pretty girls who hold up index cards.

It's six in the morning and I'm thinking about killing myself tomorrow. It's not that I wanna die, it's just that I don't want this anymore.
That's stupid, isn't it? I mean, there are people with actually problems and here I am, being a whiny emotional teenager.

Anyway, any one wanna talk?

Sorry if I'm breaking any rules.
