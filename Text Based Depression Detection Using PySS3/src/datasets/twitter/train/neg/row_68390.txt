My life storyGood but at the same time here's my story I told to a suicide hotline a few weeks ago bc ive typed it so many times  I've self harmed. My Dad is an addict so is his sister. My friend tried to kill himself right in front of me. My cousin's father passed and I wasn't close but seeing him and his siblings the way they were hit hard. I've lost 1 person to suicide, and 2 to addiction in the past 2 years. Well that's my story my friend literally tried to kill himself right in front of my eyes he tried to take 13 lithium that he was prescribed from his psychologist My mom but I've been suffering depression and suicidal thoughts since 9yo and I've seen countless therapists before and after all of this because of anger and attention and all they have done is more meds And I'm 13 my friend tried to kill himself right in front of me at all of this the drugs therapists suicidal friends and addicts i have only just experienced between the age of 12-13. And I have 3 friends who self harm or selfharmed but I only talk to 2 of them on a regular basis and 1 of them moved 2 Mississippi No I mean athiest or my gay friends and my dad he straight up tried to tell my mom whenever she told him that I cut myself straight up trying to say was cuz I was listening to Lil peep even though I've been listening to it before I started to actually 2 selfharm you know and and he straight-up sent me a playlist full of will people than six nine my grandpa say we should be afraid of the gays and I about knocked him out on the spot.
