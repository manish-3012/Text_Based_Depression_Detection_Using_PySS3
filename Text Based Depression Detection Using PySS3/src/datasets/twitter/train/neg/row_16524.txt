i have the house to myself for a day or two and i finally found where my dad keeps his guni cant buy my own until i turn 21 but then i think my involuntary last march would get in the way. ive been fighting this since 2013 but its only gotten harder since i left high school cause i cant keep a job and depression gets in the way of literally everything. i think about suicide everyday and i dont think ill get another opportunity like this in a long time, maybe never again. i think its time for me to go.
