My father attempted suicide yesterdayYesterday my uncle got a very long email/suicide note from my father detailing out last wishes and things of that nature. My father lives alone in a different state so my uncle called the local PD to do a welfare check on the house and they found my dad in his car in the garage OD'd from pills. He is currently in the ICU - 'critical yet stable' the nurse told me.
Ironically, my brother and I are with our wives on weeklong beach vacation this week. It is nice that we are together for this, but none of us know what to do. 
This morning I received an email from my dad (he scheduled it to be sent ) that simply said "I don't want this to ruin your vacation". From my understanding of the email that my dad sent my uncle, there are attachments included that were meant to be sent to me and my brothers. Life feels significantly stranger now that I know somewhere out there there is a suicide note addressed to me.
I do not know what to do. I would end this vacation in a heartbeat and book a flight to see him if I thought it would do any good. I know part of the reason he attempted was that he feels like a burden to the rest of us so I believe going down there to see him would intensify those feelings. I don't even know what I would say to him. 
This is just a shitty situation and I wanted to vent it out.
