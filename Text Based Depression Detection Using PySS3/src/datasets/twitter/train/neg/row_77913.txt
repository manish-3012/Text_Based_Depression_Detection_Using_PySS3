i'm 14 and have already lost any sorta purpose in lifehi, i'm a 14 year old girl and lately haven't been feeling the best.

back in september i went through a bit of a breakdown and for a while i was doing better. i didn't feel depressed, i started making friends, my grades went up and i had a generally optimistic attitude. 

lately though i've been kiiinda miserable. 

for one, i'm fuckin ugly. i look like what many would describe as a school shooter, i'm overweight, disgustingly pale and my face is pocked with acne. 

everything's been going downhill for me. a guy i've been 'chatting' with just suddenly cut me off, and none of my friends talk to me anymore. i'm homeschooled so there's not much for me to do. i'm also broke, so i can't go spend away the sadness or whatever. 

my parents blame my feelings on teenage angst. i don't think it's that tho.

I've been trying to numb it with cheap weed i bum off of my parents but it's not enough. 

I'm not really scared of death anymore. i feel like i'd be perfectly fine if a car just kinda plowed into me while i was crossing the street or if i took too much of my allergy medication. 

not really sure where i'm going with this or why i'm even posting. i can't get a job because i've never had any sorta work experience and i'm a stoner. i don't have purpose. i just feel alone.
