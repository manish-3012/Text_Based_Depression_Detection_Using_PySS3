TalkIâ€™m suicidal and I self harm on a regular basis, I feel most of the time like I canâ€™t cope and there is no one there so it makes me worse however if anyone feels the need to talk about their problems then I donâ€™t mind because we likely go through the same stuff and perhaps we could help each other. Just a thought.
