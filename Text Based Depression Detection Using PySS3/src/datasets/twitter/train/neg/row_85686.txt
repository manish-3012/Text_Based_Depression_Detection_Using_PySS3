friend has been posting here, is killing himself right nowhi, i dont really use reddit so i hope this works, my friend has been posting here talking about killing himself, and I've been monitoring it. he just posted a while ago about jumping off of a building while on vacation and i have no idea what to do, seems like some of you might have experience with this stuff. he drugged himself up yesterday and wants to jump but he definitely won't get to the building. i think he might have a weapon. i dont want to call anyone and make this worse than it already is. what do i do??
