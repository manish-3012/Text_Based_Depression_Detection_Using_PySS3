My mind is spiralling out of control...I'm having quite a bad mental health day.  I have previously attempted suicide (20 years ago), and I can't get the thoughts out of my head right now.  I messaged everyone I could think of in my phone looking for support, a conversation, and no-one is getting back to me.  I live in a different country to my parents (who aren't the most supportive anyway).

I don't know what I hope to achieve by posting here, but if anyone can offer me any virtual support, I could really use some.   Thank you for reading, and sorry for the ramble.
