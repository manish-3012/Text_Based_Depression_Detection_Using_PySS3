I just want to be able to pull the trigger.I donâ€™t know why I can do it.  I have nothing to look forward to and every day is the same on repeat.  My wife and everyone I used to know have left me alone and I enjoy nothing.  Iâ€™ve had anxiety and depression almost all my life and now itâ€™s worse than ever.  Iâ€™m about to turn 31 and this is not the life I want to continue living any longer.  

all I do is go back and forth between tears and anger and resentment.  Every day, alone back from work again and again. I just want out and yet I canâ€™t do it.  Why?  Just why?
