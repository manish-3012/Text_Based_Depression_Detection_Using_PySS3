I just figured something outAll my life and all the missed opportunities thanks to social phobia, mental issues, and most importantly me.
I will never get this back, I won't be reborn in a better life, I am stuck with my shitty dealt hand and I can't do anything.
I'm only 17 but it feels like all these years have been wasted.
Everything I do goes wrong and I'm losing interest in everything including life.
