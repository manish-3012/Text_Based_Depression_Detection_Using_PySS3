this is a cry for help. delete itHey, so, I guess I just really haven't had much motivation lately. Nothing has really had much meaning. I hate myself for saying this, as well. I think I've let down everyone I know by giving up. That or I will let them down eventually. 

So I'm probably going to be an alcoholic, I think I'm slipping into that.

I'm not a bad friend, am I? I think so.

I'm a terrible person.

So, that's it I guess. Writing is the best medicine. You don't have to respond to this if you don't want to, don't feel pressured. Do mods delete posts?

Terrible.

The worst there is.

I'm just that one that comes along every now and again. The failure.

There are no good choices.
