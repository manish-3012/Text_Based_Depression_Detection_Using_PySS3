I can't do this anymoreI can't keep living this way. I've lost hope. I just don't have the energy to overcome anything anymore. I used to. But as I age I see how much harder it gets to bounce back.

I don't foresee things ever getting better; I'm too old now. I'm at the age where it's cemented that I'm a loser - a failure, given too many chances and failing at all of them. I'm too poor, too uneducated, too depressed to find a decent job, financial stability, a love interest. 

I want peace. The only thing stopping me from doing it is the knowledge of how much it would hurt my mom. 

Once she's gone, I'll have nothing holding me back. My father already died two years ago. He died depressed. He died in a situation that lacked justice. 

There are no happy endings. There is no karmic or spiritual force of mercy. The world is chaotic and meaningless and cruel. 

I'm weak. I am only alive because of momentum. 

May the people fighting for their lives right now get what they need. I wish I could trade my life to save another's.
