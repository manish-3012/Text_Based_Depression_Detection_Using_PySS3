There is a feeling of dread taking over me.Hi SW,

It has been a ground for me to not only vent but begin to confront my problems. But somehow I am not able to pick myself up and and carry on. I have tried to sort out a lot of the past problems but I am still unable to cope. I am not even able to just go up to my academic advisor and tell her that everyday I am dying a little inside.

About 2 months back I confided in a friend. She really helped me a lot and took me in. But I have to find somewhere to live next week. I have been sending out my CV and applying for internships but have not even had an email back. I received an mail from school asking me why I have not registered my internship with them. How do I tell them that I am a failure!!

I failed the 3 courses but my advisor said that I could repeat them next year as I still have potential. But I need to have a 4 month internship, and since it is already end september it is no longer possible. I need just a document saying that I have an internship with something in the domain of International Affairs (human rights).

The internships that are available are with UN agencies or other NGOs that offer unpaid positions. I am homeless, I have  no phone, how can I contribute 40 hrs a week to work and dress a certain way. 

I feel like such a failure and think that I am regressing to that place of comfort that an end could provide. I feel worthless and that years of studying are useless in my case. I feel truly at a loss. I hoped that doing an internship and working in an area of human rights would remind me of the gift of life. But the very path to finding that is pushing me closer to the cliff. 

I am too poor to even afford to go to the therapist who asks for 50 euros a session. Ah, it is difficult. I can feel all the motivation being sucked down and along with it my hopes and dreams for the future, down in the chasm of failure and fatigue.

Sorry for rambling on but I needed to tell someone.
