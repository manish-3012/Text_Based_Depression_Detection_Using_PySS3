I can't stop the thoughts.I'm pushing 40.  I've been  on and off employed for the the last 3 years.  I know that I have  roof over my head and food in my stomach, but the utter failure of being able to get a job has struck me.   I've had to sell things, and they are just that, things...but they were dear to me.  I don't want to be a parasite to my parents and friends any longer.  I put out multiple resumes to potential employers every day.  But the feeling that I am not supposed to be here at this time weighs heavily on my mind.  I have my health.  I have good friends.  But I cannot be here feeling useless.  Being useless.  I think it's time to end.  But I cannot do it knowing that it would hurt those so close to me.  I constantly hope for an accident.  Or faking an accident.  This reality should have been completely different.  I am so sorry.
