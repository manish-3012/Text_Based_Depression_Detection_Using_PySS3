It's almost time.I'm 31 years old. Female. A mother and wife. I've always known I wasn't meant for this world. I'm an outsider. I don't handle the normal ups and downs of life like most people do. I've been seriously considering suicide for the last 3 months, although I've thought about it for years. I read websites to find the least painful ways, the fastest ways. None of them seem like a sure bet, so I keep putting it off. But today I realized that I'm done. It's not a cry for help. I want to die. 

I think my animals know. They won't leave my side. But my husband knows for sure, and he is sleeping soundly in the other room. I feel very alone. I'm tired of being a burden to my family. Anytime I call one of my parents or sisters, they assume something is wrong. I'm depressed, I'm suicidal, etc. All I do is take, and give nothing back in return.

Tonight I stabbed an Exacto knife into my stomach. I wanted to see what the pain would be like if I were to try and cut my femoral artery. I know that is a slow, painful way to die, but I'm ready. The initial pain was sharp, but once I got below the dermis it was nothing. I just need to get the placement right when I do it. 

I have seen psychiatrists and therapists off and on for the last 10 years. Even knowing that this feeling will pass brings me no comfort. I have Bipolar and Borderline PD. After every high comes a horrible debilitating down. I'm done.
