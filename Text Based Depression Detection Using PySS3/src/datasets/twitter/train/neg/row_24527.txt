I can't take this anymoreI'm on my lunch break from work.  I work at a multiple story hotel with an open atrium area.  I've genuinely considered leaping from the railing on the top floor - the fall should be stout enough to take me out.

I can't take this anymore.  If I hear one more [guyname], one more sir, one more he in reference to me. I just started this job three days ago after transferring from another hotel in another city for college (starting at almost 30, but starting).  I'm transgender, been on hormones almost 3 months....but I got this job as [guymode], and even with my voice and hair (sans wig) still being visibly male, being seen male just feels like a betrayal at this point.

Throw it in with your usual hotel drama and the frustration at being new all over again after being the seniormost front desk agent before, and...I can't deal with this all right now.

I don't know if I should jump (convenience), or go play in traffic (though I feel guilty about that), or just go jump in a lake (yay, can't swim).  I can't handle this.
