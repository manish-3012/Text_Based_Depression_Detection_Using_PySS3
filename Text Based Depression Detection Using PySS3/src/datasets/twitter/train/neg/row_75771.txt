i want to start off the new year by dyingi am a very bad person who deserves to die. genuinely. i feel like every time i get someone as a friend i fuck it all up because i donâ€™t know how to stop talking and lying. my white lies just never stop. 
i tried to kill myself last new years. i failed. it led to the most strained my relationship with my family has ever been. at least i had good friends to talk to, right?
i thought things were going really well with them. i really did. then we got in a minor argument. they said i was too sad to be around and was too emotionally heavy. i mean i canâ€™t argue with them on that. theyâ€™re right. i was so angry and i outed one of them. it was so horrible of me. i didnâ€™t even think about it. 
i really love this guy i know too. i think heâ€™s clueless about it, but his girlfriend of 2 years has picked up on it. she told him to stop being friends with me because it jeopardizes their relationship. sheâ€™s right though. i tried to get him to cheat on her with me so many times. so now i donâ€™t have him either. 
i think it all clicked on me this month when one of my last remaining close friends decided she didnâ€™t want to be my friend. i had told someone her boyfriend had a drug problem. i did do that. i couldnâ€™t even get her to listen to me apologize. 
none of these people will listen to me try to make up for what i did. 
but even i know i would just do it again. i think i am just naturally a bad person. i donâ€™t think there is anyone who really wants me still in there lives. 

i donâ€™t even have anyone to write a letter to. 

i think it would be fitting for me to finally finish last years new years resolution and lull myself before i ruin anyone elseâ€™s life with the dumpster fire that is my own. i know when and where and how iâ€™m going to do it. i just needed to put it out into the world that i knew how bad of a person i was and i wasnâ€™t just trying to be a victim. i am the real
perpetrator in every bad part of my life. 

my sincerest goodbye
