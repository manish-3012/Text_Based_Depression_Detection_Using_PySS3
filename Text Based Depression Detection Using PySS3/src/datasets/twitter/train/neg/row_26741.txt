Tomorrow I come back to the collegeAnd I'm scared, I think it will be my last period, after finishing I intend to commit suicide. The pain and the sadness will become very strong, I do not have many friends there and I feel like a great encumbrance in my family I think it is better that I withdraw from this life. The girl that I like will be there too and well we do not talk anymore she rejected me and it's okay that she did, it only served me to realize that I will never be able to fulfill the things that I always crave as a child. Classes have never been a problem for me so I would like my family to see what I could have been able to do. I think my final trip starts tomorrow, I just hope I can accomplish this in the end.
