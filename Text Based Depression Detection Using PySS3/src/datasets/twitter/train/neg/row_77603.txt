Iâ€™m so sorry I was never worth anything. No one will ever know meI spent eighteen years begging for a family, I tried to Hug my parents and I was hit and knocked over as they asked me what I wanted. I tried to escape the abuse and was told I was lucky where I was and then was beaten to a point where I never asked for help again. Every night I prayed that maybe Iâ€™d wake up and itâ€™d be a bad dream but I was never to wake up. Every day I begged it would end differently than the day before. One day I hope Iâ€™ll wake up and itâ€™ll be all a bad dream, Iâ€™ll have a loving family, not a messed up childhood. Some sort of light even if itâ€™s only for five seconds.
I got a dent in my head because I was
To â€œnaggingâ€ to want to be loved at five years old.
I would trade my entire life for ten seconds of a normal one.
