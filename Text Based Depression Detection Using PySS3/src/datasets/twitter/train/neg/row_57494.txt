This is my last resortI honestly dont know where to begin with. When I started my freshman year of high school, I thought I could make new friends and get greeted to alot of good people. I'm generally the type of person that doesn't hang around the wrong crowd. During this year, I did however meet some really nice people to stick around with. They invited to things, they talked to me, etc.

Soon after, my sophomore year started, I thought, "this year should be easier than last time". I thought I could just hang out with them again, however, that didnt happen. They started talking to me less, they did stuff with everyone but me, and I could tell from afar that they were purposely trying to avoid me.

It made me feel really bad I started wondering if i did anything wrong to them. I was wondering if I said something hurtful to anyone, wondered if it was my appearance, etc. When I tried talking about it to someone that I've helped before, they said "I don't think I can help, this more of a you problem". It honestly really hurt me to see that I spent countless hours with them, spent money with them, and even go to there place's, just for them to throw me away as if I'm nothing.

I started slitting my wrists and have attempted suicide a total of 4 time. I never proceeded with the suicide because I gave people another chance; but honestly I dont think I can handle it anymore.
