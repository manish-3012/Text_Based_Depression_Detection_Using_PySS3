feel so hopeless, what's the use in trying in school anymoreguess i'm finally posting here tonight. 

i don't know if i'm feeling suicidal but god i feel like my life is over. it sounds really dramatic but, my depression has ruined my freshman year in college and i dont know how to fix things anymore. i thought i had everything together but i don't know. for a little while i had hope that i'd make it out of this semester alive but i really dont believe it anymore. 

it just sucks because i've been putting so much effort into school lately studying doing all my homework early and going to class but i know in the end its not going to make up for everything else i fucked up. i reached out to my counselor my advisor and a dean and they helped me a little. theyre really supportive and gave me hope for a bit but everything is up to my professors. i emailed them about my mental illness causing me to struggle and miss important things in class and i feel so stupid because none of them replied and my grade will never improve...

if my grades dont improve, i'll get dropped and i'll be a fucking failure to my family and my friends. no one i know understands. 
its just so embarrassing and my dad will be so pissed off and i dont know how my future will work out.
and everyone will talk behind my back and think i'm stupid.

i don't know. this is so bad for me. i hate myself for being this way and wasting my dad's money on my education.
