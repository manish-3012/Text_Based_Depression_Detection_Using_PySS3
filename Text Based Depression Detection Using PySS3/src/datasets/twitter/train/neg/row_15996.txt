Fuck it. My name is Sarah. I'm obese. I'm a porn-addict. I'm suicidal. That's who I am. That's what I am. That's the circle that I'm in.

I hate myself for all of the porn crap. So I go overeat. I hate myself for that. So I go think of ways to get rid of my problem - to get rid of me. I'm depressed. I'm in pain. And I think that the most hurtful thing about all of this is that nobody is honest with me.

Can't anyone around me see that I'm in pain? Why can't anyone just come up to me and tell me that I'm fat and that I need help? Why is it that everyone always jumps to help anorexic people, but when a person is obese, it's somehow "unethical" to jump in to help that person? I have all these "friends" around me to whom I've voiced my concerns a few times. After a few times, I've learned to be quiet. Nobody truly cares.

In the middle of it all, I'm in a huge struggle with my faith - not that Reddit could give a shit about religion. So that doesn't help. Whatever. 

In reality, nobody cares. Even you. You'll read my post, and many posts like it, and then you won't remember me or my name next week. You don't care. Don't tell me that you do. Nobody does.

And nobody should.

Because this is no one else's shit. This is my crap to deal with.

MINE.

And mine alone.

Because no one else can fix this, but me. I am the only person who holds the power to control my life. Nobody else. And I have to fix me by starting with who I am and what I am. I have to start with this obese, depressed, fucked up girl.

I have to fix her somehow. And I will. I have to.

I guess I started by saving her from jumping off that multi-story parking building tonight...
