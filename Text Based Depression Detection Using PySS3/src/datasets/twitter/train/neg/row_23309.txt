How do you talk about suicide when everybody jsut thinks you are attention-seeking?I have hit the point in my struggle that I feel like the fact that I will kill myself is a foregone conclusion.  I am trying, though, to make sure everything is in place before I do.  It has been my secret quest for the past few years to prepare my family for my departure.  I pushed my wife into going to college.  She just graduated 3 days ago with her B.S.  That really triggered this feeling of inevitability.  She now has a more solid ability to provide for herself and our daughters.  I know that they can make it fairly comfortably without me.  I have made sure my life insurance policy has entered the phase where it will pay out on suicide.  We are about to complete a bankruptcy that will bring our financials into a better place.  I am selling our second car, because we wont need it.  

I really want to talk to somebody about it.  I want my family to know how I feel.  But I cannot, because I know the general belief, in my family at least, is that such talk is just "attention seeking."  The one time I brought it up I was told, "well if things are that bad you might as well do it"  with a smirk.

The only thing that can save me is talking about it, but I feel like saying anything about it at all will be the one thing that pushes me over the edge due to the response I will get.
