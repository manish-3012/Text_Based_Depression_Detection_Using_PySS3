Going blindI've been in a precarious situation for a while. I suffer from depression due to chemical imbalances and other factors, but it's gotten worse after I developed a real reason to be depressed. I'm an artist. All I have in my life is art, it's all I'm good for, it's the only thing giving me some purpose. I'm in my early twenties and my eyes are steadily going bad. There's some mornings I can't even open my eyes. They're tearful and stinging every day all day. I've had some scares this month where my vision went black; I thought I was losing my vision for good. I don't have health insurance, so I can't get this checked out. I know it would hurt my parents, but if I end up losing my vision, I won't be able to create art. I know I'd just end it if that's how I end up, because I'd be useless.
