No One Understands, No One CaresI just want to be normal and happy like everyone else. But because of 1 thing. I want to die all the time. I do what I can to cope. I play video games, watch anime but I just want to be able to smoke weed to numb the pain. But its illegal. Why is something that just makes pain go away illegal. It doesn't fix my problems but it takes my mind off them. I was fucking abused and they got away with it but I'm not allowed to smoke weed to feel better. Hows that fair. I never asked to be born why must I be forced to stay a live in this torture. People say suicide is selfish, I think forcing someone to live that doesn't want to is selfish. I wish suicide was legal and you could just go to a hospital like in some places. IMO if you want to die thats your right. If they were born me they would understand
