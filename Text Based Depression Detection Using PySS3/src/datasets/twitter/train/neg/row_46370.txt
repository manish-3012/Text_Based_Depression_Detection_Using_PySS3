I'm not sad anymore, still want to dieI was depressed for maybe a year and I just kinda kept it to myself and hid it pretty well but it slowly got worse and worse until I started to seriously consider suicide. I hid that pretty well too but my friends started to notice that something was wrong with me. One night I got really drunk and finally told one of my friends how I was feeling. He told the rest of my friends and they all took me to see a counselor to show their support. It was great having everyone come out for me and I've been seeing that counselor ever since. I've been feeling a lot happier lately but for some reason I can't shake wanting to die. I thought that going to see the counselor and becoming happy with my life would be the solution but it hasn't been. I don't want to live life happy any more than I want to live life depressed. I really don't know what to do at this point.
