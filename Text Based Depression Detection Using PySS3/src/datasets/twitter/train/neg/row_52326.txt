Is there future for me and other?I see no future for me at least. 25 years old, single and living with parents, feeling that I have no life and this feeling makes me depressed and suicidal. Now we are in quarantine it makes no sense anymore. I see this world in dark place when I read newspapers that busnisess, companies and banks are failing. Coronavirus is BS, made up by the elite and watching us laughing with cigar how we will starve from hunger and survive this plandemic. I think that we will see this effect about couple of months. Should I wait that everything going down or should I kill myself cuz it has no sense anymore?
