I donâ€™t know where else to write thisIâ€™m stuck in a dead end job where I work my ass off for no money. I canâ€™t find anything better. The person I care about most in the world constantly lets me know that he doesnâ€™t care about me. Iâ€™m sick with a mysterious illness and no health insurance to get checked out. I canâ€™t bring myself to get out of bed anymore. 
Worst of all, everyone in my life just sees me as a depression diagnosis. I am lost and Iâ€™m ready to kill myself soon. I just canâ€™t keep â€œhanging in thereâ€.
