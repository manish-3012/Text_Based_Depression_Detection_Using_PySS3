The idea of the rest of my life depresses the fuck out of me...If I just picture my life.... I want to start crying. Seriously? This is what life is? Go to school for 12 years, college for another 4 (minimum), get a job, work, and pay bills until I die? Seriously? This life is fucking bullshit. Why the fuck should I stick around for THAT lollipop triple dipped in hell? I'm just so done...
