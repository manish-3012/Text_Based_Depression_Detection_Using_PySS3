I'm just sadI'm just fucking worn out no, I haven't felt true happiness for years, just numb, people say don't compare yourself to others, but the inability to feel joy shouldn't be thst hard of a goal.
I have no energy or motivation so I waste all my fucking time playing stupid fucking video games, no matter how hard I've tried I just feel too tired aftet a short while of doing anything worthwhile.
I just want to be happy again.
