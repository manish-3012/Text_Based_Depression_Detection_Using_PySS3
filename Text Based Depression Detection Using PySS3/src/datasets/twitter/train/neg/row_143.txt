Help..? IdkI've been thinking about this since my first attempt. Which was years ago. My life is just so insignificant, and everything I do I don't like. I just want to end it. I know no one really cares. My mom has even threatened to put me in the hospital (said when I did my second attempt) if I cut or tried again and I have told no one because I'm scared. 

Maybe it will be better if I was gone.

I know no one cares, but i want to live, but this world is so hard and so scary. Always thinking about what is wrong with everyone and everything. 

I'm only posting this because I feel somewhat safe. Yannow, being anoymus and all. 

Im always suffering, even when I'm laying around doing what I want, I guess I just want someone to care? I don't know what u want anymore. I have a therapist but I'm scared to tell her about some stuff. Being scared of people, basically everything. It's so tiring. I'm always tired. 

Another thing that bothers me is that I'll always be alone. Even when with people. It's a suffocating feeling, all the time. 

If I do do it,and succeed, I want my parents to take better care of the cats, like I do and I want j and c to each have half of my kpop belongings. (sorry I sound like a 5 year old) I want my brother to keep going and act like nothing happened, I know he's always wanted to be an only child. 

I just want to give up. This is so hard to type out. But I need to get this off my chest. I hope no one I know will find this and confront me. If you do know me, don't say anything, thank you.
