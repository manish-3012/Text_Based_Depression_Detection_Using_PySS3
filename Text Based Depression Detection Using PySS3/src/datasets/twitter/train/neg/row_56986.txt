I feel like a burdenI've recently come clean to my best friend about my self-harm and suicidal thoughts. He's the most wonderful person I've ever met and he's incredibly supportive. However, I can't help feeling that I'm a burden to him and I'm basically unable to shut these thoughts out even if he says he's always there to talk. How could I be a more considerate friend and make his situation better? Also, I'm currently seeking therapy. Thanks a lot.
