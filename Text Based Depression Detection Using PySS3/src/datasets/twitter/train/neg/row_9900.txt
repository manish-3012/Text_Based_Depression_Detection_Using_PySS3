DeathDeath is nothingness. U can't even feel the air. U have no air. Light goes through you. You never had a solid entity. You were a computer programmed and killed by nature. Your thoughts feelings dysfunctions don't matter anymore. You were a computer and now you are not. You never had a identity. No one has a identity. Your life had no identity. You have no shape and make no sound. You are dead. Thinking and thought are dead forever. Time is dead. The entire universe and all space is void. Everyone else lives in pleasure or pain while you are numb as a rock. There is no more ying or yang only a silence you can't hear. Nothing to differentiate anything from anything or nothingness. No compare no contrast. You will live again but are dead forever. That old life is gone and never coming back. Everyone is alive and dead simultaneously existing in dual states. You were red now your blue. Melted morphed rebuilt and simultaneously destroyed with all new everything spit out at random fluctuations. New identity and new soul. Everything is new and u had no idea how or what you are. Thoughts are flickers of energy that are sluggish. Eventually thoughts become more advanced. The world slowly gets more in focus. You are a noob. Everything strange new never seen before. This is exciting. Memories start from zero. There never was a past. Only a uncertain future. Your dna unravels and creates who you are. Your life revolves around your dna yet you remain blissfully of the who what where and why of what DNA is. DNA is a insanely complicated code that no one truly understands. Instructions to your soul and form.
