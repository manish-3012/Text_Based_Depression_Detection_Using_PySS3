Planning on suicide tonightI am a 19yo EMT . I've seen a lot of things for a young guy. My upbringing was terrible, brutally abused and neglected most of my life. As an adult I've only seen my self become my abusive parents.  I cheated multiple times on my past few serious relationships. I am simply a degenerate.  I use drugs heavily and steal from those close to me as well. Even steal drugs from my now deceased grandfather.  I feel like this is the only choice I have. I have no motivation for work, friendships, goals, anything. I am in a deep pit. My plan is to drink as much vodka as possible along with Vicodin, and then hang myself with an audio cable.  Goodbye guys
