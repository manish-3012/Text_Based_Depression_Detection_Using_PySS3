What makes you think about it?What makes you desire suicide? How many attempts do you have? How are you trying to improve your situation?

I think deep down suicide isn't the solution, there are beautiful things to live in life. I'd have to accept that maybe I won't get everything I want in life, but there are realistic things I can achieve. Why should we kill ourselves if we could be productive members of society?

I personally tried 2 times and ended up in ER because I pussied, alone by myself crying for more than 10 hours. When I've been about to die I totally regret it and want another chance, which I kinda lose with time, the cycle is kinda hard to overcome, but I think there could be better things to come. Also struggle with alcohol and substance abuse to cope.
