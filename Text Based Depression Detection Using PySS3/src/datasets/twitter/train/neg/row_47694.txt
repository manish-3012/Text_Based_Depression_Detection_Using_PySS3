Struggling after heartbreakIâ€™m currently 24 and have been on anti depressants since I was 12. Itâ€™s something I have struggled with for what seems like my entire life. I was in relationships before but never really allowed myself to open up or care about the other person. 
In 2018 I began dating someone who made me feel like everything was okay. I gained confidence and started feeling optimistic about the future. He broke up with me after 2.5 years in July. I have been struggling immensely ever since. I did not handle the break up well and irritated him to the point that he called me an unstable loser with no friends and no ambition. He also said he never wanted children with me out of fear they would have depression too. 
He was my best friend for a very long time. I feel very hopeless and lost and it feels like Iâ€™ve been at rock bottom for 4 months. I feel so hopeless and alone, especially with all of the holidays and what would have been our 3 year anniversary coming up. I feel like I will not ever be able to find someone to handle me, let alone love or care about me. I just donâ€™t know what to do at this point. Iâ€™m hoping that maybe talking about this with people I donâ€™t know might help, but itâ€™s just a desperate attempt at hope at this point.
