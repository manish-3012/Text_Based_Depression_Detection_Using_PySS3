i tried to kill myself last night.took a handful of advil on an empty stomach. cut myself until i felt better. ate something because i was dizzy. took more advil because i felt guilty for eating. wanted to swallow the whole bottle. chickened out of taking the rest of the bottle and had a panic attack for two hours. now my stomach just hurts.

i failed my final and now i am probably going to be kicked out of a program i paid 10,000 for already. i still feel awful and i still have so much to do. two more finals and then straight into the next term and i have barely slept this past week. iâ€™m so tired i canâ€™t think. i donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. i feel so useless and stupid and iâ€™m lonely and fat and have no friends and no job prospects and no motivation and everyone i know hates me. i just want to be dont with it all. i wrote an email to my instructor begging them to accept the shit work i submitted and i am so terrified of what they will say back, so. i wish iâ€™d gone through with it. at least iâ€™d feel peace.
