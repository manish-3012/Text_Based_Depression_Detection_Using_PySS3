StuckStuck in a loveless relationship, only kept around because what I do and give to them. It's pretty obvious. Stuck with them, and their family, seeming mine abandoned me randomly... Have no where to go either. Their kids are so awful, I don't want any of my own now, seeming I'm dealing with them roughly 12 to 16 hours a day. Had to take a leave from my job to handle all the stress. I'm tired of it all and see no light at the end of the tunnel. Suicide is starting to feel like the only answer.
