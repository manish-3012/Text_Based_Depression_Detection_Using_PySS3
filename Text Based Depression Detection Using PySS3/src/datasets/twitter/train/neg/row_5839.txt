I've exhausted my only reason to still breathe.I'd given up all hope. Hope of finding friends, hope of love, hope of college, everything. The only thing that was keeping me going was how I felt I needed to help people with their problems, I knew that if I helped them be happy then I'd be happy. It wasn't the case, I'm no more happy and more alone than ever. I am too exhausted to try and help more people, I have no advice to give cause it's all bullshit. I can't tell people that it'll get better because it doesn't. You'll go years and it gets worse by the minute. I'm done now, I've had my use on this earth. I'm going to go soon. Goodbye.
