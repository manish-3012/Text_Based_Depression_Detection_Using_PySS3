What's the least painful way to die?At the point where my life has no meaning. I lost 20 years of my life due to my abusive family. This is not a life I would've chosen for myself, and I want to end it with as little pain as possible. What are some options? I heard hanging is relatively painless but I'm open to considering other options.
