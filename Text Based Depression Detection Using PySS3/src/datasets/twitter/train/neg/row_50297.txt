Birthday is coming up, family still reminds me that Iâ€™m a parasite everyday despite that.You would think that with my birthday being on the 16th that they would at least let up on being fucking dickheads, but I guess not.

Turning 19. Donâ€™t really have much to show for it. 

Had one thing I really wanted to do on my birthday, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to happen because of my family. Donâ€™t wanna get into too many details, but they had two months to help me
with a very specific thing that would have taken a few days at most but didnâ€™t. Everyday I reminded them and got yelled at for being a disappointment. â€œWhy should I help you if you havenâ€™t done anything with your life?â€ Maybe because if you helped me with this one fucking thing then my life would be significantly easier, you fucking hag. 

I guess it just is what it is. Iâ€™ve learned to not expect anything from my life anymore. My significant other doesnâ€™t even respond to my texts about my issues anymore. Not expecting her to be a therapist or anything, just expecting maybe a â€œsorry youâ€™re going through this, how can I help?â€

Mediocrity in every aspect is where I thrive, I suppose. Probably just gonna delete this in a few hours.
