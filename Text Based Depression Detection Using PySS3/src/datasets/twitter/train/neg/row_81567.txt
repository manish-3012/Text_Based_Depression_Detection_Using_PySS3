i donâ€™t think iâ€™m ever going to be okayi really need someone to talk to who doesnâ€™t know me in real life

iâ€™ve been burning bridges left and right and the few friends and family who are still around are starting to finally get sick of my shit. 

my life has been a constant battle of survival for as long as i can remember and i donâ€™t think itâ€™s ever gonna end. 

i honestly really want to die but i donâ€™t have the energy or drive right now to take the steps/put the effort in to make it happen... life is just not worth it. i donâ€™t feel like anything could make my life feel worth it cause itâ€™s not like iâ€™ve lived a meaningless life... iâ€™ve accomplished a lot, tried a million things, worked so damn hard on myself, made so many of my wildest dreams come true and nothing makes me happy in a lasting way. iâ€™m so tired of this. iâ€™ve tried nearly everything. iâ€™ve worked way harder on my mental health than almost anyone i know. and itâ€™s never enough. i just want it to end.
