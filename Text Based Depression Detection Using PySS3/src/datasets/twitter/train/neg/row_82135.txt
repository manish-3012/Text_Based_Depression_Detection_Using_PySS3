I ask for 5 minutes of your time..I am lost. I moved to Washington away from my family a couple years ago. I unfortunately for a DUI back in 2014. I DoD everything I was supposed to for court. Now back on 2015 I started drinking heavily again. I went to treatment and an outpatient program. I got clean and have been for 6 months now. It was plan to move back with my family. However court is telli g me I have to complete another iop program. I don't work and I don't have transportation to these classes. I only have a few weeks left to figure this out or I'm going tp probably go tp jail and then have to repeat this cycle. I don't know what to do. I'm so depressed and scared all o want to do is move home to my family. I don't want to commit suicide. I want to live but I don't know how I am going to make it through this. Idk what to do. Or where to turn. I have 60$ to my name and I have tp use that tomorrow for a cab ride to my assessment which I hope and pray doesn't charge me a fee because I won't be able to afford it. I have no energy for any of this. I don't know what I can do. I just want this all tp go away. I want to live to see my family but my head is telling me my only optipn is death. I can't see anyway put of this. I'm scared.
