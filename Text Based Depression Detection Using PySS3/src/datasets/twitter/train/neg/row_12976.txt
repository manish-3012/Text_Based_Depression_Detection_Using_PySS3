My friend committed suicide a few days ago. His arrangements are private and for family only.. so now what?My friend and I had dated for a short time after we first met, but things didn't work out and we stayed pretty good friends for 6 years. Id see him on a regular basis, and even if I didn't see or speak to him for a little while, I always knew he would call and he did.

3 days ago he hung himself. I had just spoken to him a day and a half before he passed, and saw him just a few days before then. Nobody thought he would ever do that. But that's how most of these stories are right? In most cases the one who did it was the one you wouldn't have expected to. Im not going to get into details with this, but he did have issues as far as depression and drugs.

Anyway, I heard today that his arrangements will be private, for family only with maybe a select 3-4 friends he grew up with as a young child. I am not insulted by this, I respect it, and understand that's what his family wishes. I am upset though that I can't attend, because I feel like I won't be able to say goodbye properly. We were friends for a while, and I cared about him.

I guess what im looking for is advice on how to cope with not only the situation that I lost a friend to this disturbing battle he faced with himself, but how to cope with my feelings about not being able to be there for his services, to say goodbye. Also, if anyone else has experienced a similar situation, if they could share. My mom said shes never heard of something like this-- if anything they would keep one day open for friends, and then the next day just for family.
