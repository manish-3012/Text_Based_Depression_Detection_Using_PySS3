Today is one week since my attemptI was ready to take my life. I had the gun, I made the plan, I wrote the note. But I was scared. My last attempt at a cry for help was texting a crisis line. I didnâ€™t get very far before I ended the conversation. They pinged my phone, though. As I was listening to music in my truck, enjoying my final moments, I get a call from my mom that cops had showed up to her house. (Phone bill is in her name, I just pay my and my familyâ€™s portion). They were looking for me. She was hysterical. I was emotionless but I couldnâ€™t help but worry about my mother. I gave them my location, unloaded my gun, and let them come and take me to the hospital.

That was a week ago. Iâ€™m still here. But not for me.
