HelloI'm unsure what to type, really how to word this. Honestly I think I just need somewhere to get this all out. 

I'm an OIF veteran, I believe I have PTSD, though I believe my depression began at an early age. I recently had panic attacks so severe I thought I was having a stroke / heart attack. So I finally went to my local VA hospital where I was prescribed anti-anxiety medicine and an appointment with a psychologist. I was told that I may have PTSD, but it was unsure and he didn't feel right diagnosing me. He gave me a few support groups to go to, though I don't really like speaking about my tour or really telling anyone I've served because of the things they ask. 

I've had suicidal thoughts both before and after my service, but rarely this severe. I feel isolated from everyone including my wife and children. Often times I feel like I'm a ghost in my own house with my wife constantly on her phone and my children only wanting / needing her. I go through bouts of depression, but this is the first time in years I've thought about pulling the trigger. I've spoken to my wife about my concerns and nothing seems to help, or she doesn't see it as a big deal. I have little to no "real" friends and at this point I'm reaching out to strangers through the Internet. 

I don't want pity, or "it's going to work out", "talk to her about blah blah blah" I don't know what I want. I just know it's been a while since I've felt this heavy and it really sucks.
