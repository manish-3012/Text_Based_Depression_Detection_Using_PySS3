I brokeI don't know what's wrong with me. But I broke today. I was clean for 5 months now. And today I self harmed. My depression has been gone for 3'months. My suicidal thoughts basically disappeared. 
And now I'm here. With less than an hour old cuts and just wanting to die. I don't know what happened. Why I got bad again. I thought I was happy... I don't know what to do. 
I don't expect replies. I don't even know what kind I would expect. I just want to end it all. But I can't yet. There's a time and place and way and it's not tonight or in my house. I'm losing my mind. 
Sorry this was all a big jumbled up mess
