Venting, no support needed(VNSN) recurrent urges to hang myself the least few days. Urges but no intent and plan so I'm ok but I wanted to let someone know because being alone with this sucks. I feel angry and anxious and keep having urges to end it all. I've been varying levels of suicidal for the past 20 years, sometimes surprised I ever wanted to die and other times surprised I never did. Right now it's just an unpleasant urge and I wanted to share...don't know what I expect out of this post, nothing really but I'm glad I'm talking about it. This is new to me.
