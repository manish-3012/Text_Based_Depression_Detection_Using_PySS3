I am such a failure, and I want to dieIâ€™m quitting my job because it doesnâ€™t pay enough and they overwork me some weeks and underwork me others so I have no consistency. I have bills to pay. It still feels like this quitting my job thing is my fault. 

I plan to strike off on my own and become self-employed but I feel like Iâ€™m going to fail, so why bother. 

Iâ€™m a burden to my whole family with zero accomplishments to my name. I have a useless degree. 

I canâ€™t sleep. And when I do, I oversleep. 

I want to die.
