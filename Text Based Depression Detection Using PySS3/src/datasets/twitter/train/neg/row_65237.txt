Just after some opinions.Hey I was just after some opinions on how I should go about finishing up. 
My main issue is the family I have, mother, father, older brother, older sister. I'm 25, no relationship, no kids and no nephew's or nieces. 
I have had a lower spinal injury at 19 with heavy ongoing drug and alcohol abuse. A pending workers compensation trial that's been going on for 5 years with no sure end in sight. 
Now I need to know wether I should sit down and tell my family what I'm planning to do and not finish talking until they've accepted my decision. I want to do this so we can have a genuine last talk where they can ask me questions that I will answer, this is opposed to leaving a note like most others. I don't like the idea of a note because it's a one sided conversation. I'd rather have a real conversation before I go. 
The main issue with this is it will make it a lot harder for me to follow through because they will have a hard time accepting my plan. How is the best way to go about this?

Also, I stand to get a lump sum at the end of my compo claim that will be between 500 000-1,000 000 dollars. I was wondering how is the best way to split this for my brother and sister in a will? Can I just transfer the money via internet banking. Is that illegal? I want to make sure they get it and it won't be taken off them. I need to know what will happen to my bank accounts when I go, should I cancel them myself? Should I actually get a lawyer to organize a will at my age? What is the exact legality involved in this when it comes to suicide? 

Any advice or opinions will be much appreciated. I have been thinking on this for a few years now, my neck is starting to go physically now and I will not be able to handle another extensive spinal operation. It will be a waste of medical resources in my view. So the decision has been made. I didn't know anywhere else where I could find genuine opinions from others other than here. 
Thanks
