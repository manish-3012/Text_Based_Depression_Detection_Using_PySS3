I'm too scared to even try and post anything because the last time I did, it got rejected because it didn't follow certain guidelines..I'm so fucking down in the dumps and depressed. I'm trying to find a place to talk but I don't like talking to the hotline because I feel like they have more important people to try and save besides my sorry ass. I'm not actually going to do it. But it doesn't stop me from thinking about it. I hate this feeling of infinite dread. If this post gets rejected like the last one because of some "unfollowed guidelines" I'm going to fucking cry. It's like having an entire community of people turn their backs on you because the message you type isn't good enough to receive any feedback. I don't know.
