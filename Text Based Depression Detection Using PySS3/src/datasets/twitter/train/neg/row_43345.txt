Suicidal and pushing away loved onesIn one week iâ€™ve managed to block out a number of best friends in my life for awfully bullshit reasons. 

Last night i spent a few hours trying to figure out a good place in my bedroom to hang myself but only stopped because i like my roommates too much and wouldnt ever wish the trauma of finding a body on them. 

I feel trapped and numb. Ive been riding the train back and forth over the bridge all night just kind of wanting to feel something. Figured iâ€™d shoot this into the void here.
