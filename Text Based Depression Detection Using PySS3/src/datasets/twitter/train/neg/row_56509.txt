I wish I had known how damaging therapy would be.I really never would have seen a therapist if I knew it'd be one of the main factors in killing myself. If I could only tell myself 2.5 years ago to not do it.

No wonder I want to just kill myself. Any hotline or ER visit is going to recommend seeing a therapist. I have the means...I guess it's really just time I take myself out of this world.
