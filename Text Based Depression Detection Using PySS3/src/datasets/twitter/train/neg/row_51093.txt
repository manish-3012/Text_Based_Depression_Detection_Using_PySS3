.I'm so tired of constantly being left by people I care for. I'm tired of trying to kill myself so many times I've lost count and not a single attempt has even brought me close to death. I'm tired of being used by everyone and then thrown away or kicked around. I'm tried of being so hated by everyone I come across. I'm tired of pretending to be happy. I just want to be dead already. Why is that so much to ask for? People don't care about you until you're dead. Some won't even care when you're dead. In the end who really cares if they do or don't miss you when you're gone. I'm just so tired of everything. I want it to end already
