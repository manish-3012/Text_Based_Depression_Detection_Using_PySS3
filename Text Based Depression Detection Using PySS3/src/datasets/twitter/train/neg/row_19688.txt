Just too muchWell, I don't know how to start this but I'm certainly done keeping this in my head. I am Seal and my job involves making other people miserable. I was young when I started this and back then it felt fun, I felt the adrenaline rush.

Now, it's the opposite way. Every day in my life feels stolen from some good man who is just out of his luck.  This feeling is especially strong on New Year's when other people are kind to each other and I'm still..me.

My fiancee is asleep in the next room as I'm writing this. I've been mean to other people tonight(yesterday for Europe?), I've been mean to her. 

After I left a party I felt like this is too much. I tried to hurt myself. Not like a usual cut that is not dangerous. I have a couple years of military(recon) training so I know how to make people die. I tried to hurt myself but I stopped before it was too late. I felt that my fiancee still needs me and I can't just leave her this way.

I took the neccesary preacutions and my friends are coming in a few minutes to watch over me. Still, I no longer feel the manly man mc man I always pretend to be and I'm certainly not okay.

So..There are probably people who need more urgent help but still I feel better posting this. You don't know me but if you took a minute to read this and try to understand me, you're a good person. I just need someone to hear what I can't say to my close ones. 

Thanks, reddit, and happy new year.
