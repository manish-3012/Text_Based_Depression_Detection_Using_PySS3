I cant stop cryingTheres so much shit going on and i cant stop cying... I feel like nobody really cares how i feel... Ever. I cant really open up to anybody! People call me an "ispiration". Why? Because i am living a toxic shithole of a life? Im not an inspiration... Im a sob story. Im a burden to everyone i meet. Nobody really likes me. Theyre just pretending to like me because theyre scared that i might hurt myself! Im tired of worrying people
