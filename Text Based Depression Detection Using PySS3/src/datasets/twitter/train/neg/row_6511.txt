Holding on by a threadMy depression is getting worse and worse. My physical health isn't great and I'll live the rest of my life in pain. I happily gave everything to raise my kids  - they always were, and still are (along with my granddaughters) my whole life; my son hates me and my daughter-I think-loves me but mainly only keeps me around for what she can get. I've had two failed marriages - I've been mentally and physically abused, cheated on, lied to. I'm old and overweight. My granddaughters love me but they're young enough that they'd soon forget about me. I don't really have any close friends. I have no love life and no real hope of one. Literally the only thing that is keeping me here is that I can't bear to hurt my parents like that. Idk if I'm going to be able to hold on after they're gone and I don't think I'm going to want to. (I've tried meds for depression and they make me outright suicidal).  I just had to get this off my chest in hopes that it might alleviate a little bit of the pain because it's taking over everything.
