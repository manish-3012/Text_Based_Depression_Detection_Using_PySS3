After four years of bullshit, I finally have a real chance at this suicide thingI'm fairly certain that I can't get into the methodology of my suicide here, but after two failed attempts, I made a plan that I believe to be foolproof. I can't be bothered to go into extreme detail about why, but in summation:

1. My parents don't accept me for who I am and I want to hurt them for hurting me for so long. (**!!!**)

2. I am borderline obese (Found that out two days ago).

3. Given all my mental health issues, I know that no woman would ever love me.

4. I am ugly.

5. I am way too impatient with myself to change the multitudinous things about myself that I don't like. (**!!!**)

6. Like my body, my mind is weak and undisciplined.

7. I can't ever commit myself to anything (see #5 and #6). Also, I can't seem to do anything right.

8. I haven't had a good night's sleep in a few weeks.

9. The mere sound of woman's voice fills me with trepidation. Wherever I see an attractive woman (read: *most of you people*), I get that good ol' mortal fear and later beat myself up for freaking the fuck out. (**!!!**)

I'm going to play Dark Souls 3 and try to beat it today before I die. Â¡Adios, compaÃ±eros!
