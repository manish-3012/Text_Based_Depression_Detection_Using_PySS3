I don't know what to doI feel incredibly lost in life and don't know what to do. A lot is happening in my life. My mom is in a coma for the past 3 years because of a brain hemorrhage. She is completely brain damaged and is in a vegetative state. My cousin's estranged me because we fought with them. The fight happened because they kept on picking on my brother and I got really pissed because they didn't offer him a ride which I knew it was on purpose and they claimed it wasn't. When confronted she told my brother he was druggy, stupid, doesn't know anything, etc. . My brother then lashed out at my cousin because she wouldn't shut it and enough. Imagine being blamed for thinking that my brother purposely tried to leave my uncle at the airport. So me and my brother got angry. Now they estranged us and no longer talk to us, this caused be great distress. They always thought they were superior because they are doctors and we weren't. On top I started university at the age 23 recently and I feel so behind compared to my peers who are much younger then me I feel so stressed that I no longer know what to do I am lost. I feel like I am stupid and inferior then others because I am not a doctor like them and get the same respect as my cousins. I no longer know how to cope. I barely have friends, cousins, and have a "broken family" which things were different but I don't know what to do at this point? how can I stop caring about my family? I worry about my brother too every single time he also tried to commit suicide three times.
