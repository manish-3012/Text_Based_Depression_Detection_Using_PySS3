My friend wants to kill herself. And I don't know how to helpFirst of all my english is not that good so i'll be using google translater. I can't speak about this in russian websites because they're all stupid.  
We became internet friends maybe 5 years ago, since then we are really close. She can tell me whatever she wants and if she will feel better after, i'll be all ears.   
She's 7 years older than me (i'm 23).  she has a difficult life. after the divorce of her parents, the mother began to hate her daughter since childhood. Until now, her mom is very toxic. "Others may have a good life, but you don't, because it's you. You ruin everything as always" her mom says that.    
of course my friend thinks so because her closest relative is telling that.   
She doesn't have close friends in real life so it's really hard to feel that you're not alone.   
Many bad things happens in everyone's life. She already have few suicide attempts but at that time she was afraid to make it to the end. Right now she's feeling so bad. She's not afraid anymore. She wants to stop feeling that pain. She has  hallucinations about her ex and bad things that he has done to her. When she thinks about suicide she feels good and free. She thinks that it's an escape for her. And everything will be good without her.  


It will happen in 2 week. And i don't know what to do, what to say to her. What can i say? "Don't worry. Everything will be okay". Well it's stupid to say that. In her place i'd gave up a long time ago. I can't come to her and help her (10000 km apart). The waiting kills me. I don't know how to help her.
