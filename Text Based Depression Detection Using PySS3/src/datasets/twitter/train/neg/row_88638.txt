Sometimes, Iâ€™m not even depressed, and sometimes Iâ€™m in deep pain. No matter what I always want to die. (15M)Today was my Birthday. I was pretty happy today, I was supported, and I have friends and family with no history of bullying or anything. I should be a normal kid. Yet Iâ€™m always looking for a way to end it. On the other hand, on most days Iâ€™m an 8 or 9 on the emmengard. Iâ€™m so depressed that I get home and cry for an hour and a half. I donâ€™t do my homework until 1am. Then I go to bed. I listen to depressing rap music, and I donâ€™t have something I am good at or have a real passion for. Iâ€™m a smart kid but Iâ€™m fucking lazy. I suck as a student. Iâ€™m unathletic, and I need help but canâ€™t tell anyone I know out of embarrassment and fear. help me.
