is this unusual or dangerous?I feel really weird right now. Kind of distant from my body. Also having a bit of a difficult time reading and writing. Only mentioning in case it's relevant.

I've had this for years but it's been really frighteningly strong the past few days. Constant every few minute suicidal thoughts. But I'm not suicidal and I don't have any urges/intention behind the thoughts. There's no emotion attached to them. But they won't go away and it's a bit scary. Because they keep happening I keep thinking about them which I think makes it worse but I don't know how to stop. It's just a constant conversation in my head. 
*
"I want to kill myself"
"No I don't what the heck?"
*
"I deserve to die."
"No I don't I have no reason to think that. No one deserves to die even if was an objectivly bad person anywy."
*
"What should I do now?" 
"Kill myself."
"....No, really."
*
"Time to die!"
"Seriously stop thinking this weird stuff."
*
"Okay but I should kill myself now"
"I probably could if I took a bunch of X I should google if that can kill you/I don't want to but if i went and found X I definitely could."
*
like that. Every five minutes if I'm not actively engaged in something else. and I feel really really strange right now. Which is why i'm typing/explaing rather poorly/strangely. Maybe this is dissociation?

anyway I'd just like to know if this is common and I should stop worrying about it or if it's dangerous at all/a risk factor of some sort. My instincts tell me its bad but in other mental health ways not in suicide ways because there's no suicidal intent.
I hope this is ok to say here. I was in the intrusive thoughts subreddit at first but they didn't seem to want this kind of content.
I don't know how to format paragraphs on reddit sorry about that.
Thanks.
