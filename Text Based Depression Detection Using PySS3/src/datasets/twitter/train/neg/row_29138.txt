I feel lost, hurt, and confused. It doesn't feel like there's a way out at this point.To be honest, I'm not sure where to start. I've always felt depressed. Sometimes, I can hide it (even from myself). But lately (past month or two) it's been getting worse and worse.

I'm not sure if it's worth giving more information, but.. I'd just really like someone to talk to right now.

This is on a throwaway, but I'm keeping it logged in so I can reply asap. I really don't want to do any selfharm tonight, and I especially don't want it to lead to suicide.
