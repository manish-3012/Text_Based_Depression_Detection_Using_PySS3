I'm not really suicidal, am I??I have given up believing things will change for the better. At this point I don't even care. I am too tired and worn out. All I want now is to overcome the fear and end it. It just seems so much easier than going on like this. I even have a detailed plan on how to carry it out. It gives me such peace thinking about it. But in reality, I am too scared to do it. 

I'm not really suicidal, am I? After-all, a truly suicidal person is determined to do it without question, right?

Oh well, what difference does it make?! I am not even sure of what I am writing this.
