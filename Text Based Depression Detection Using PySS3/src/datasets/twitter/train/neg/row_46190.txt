My friend just confessed he has constant visions of hanging himself.He recently failed out of college (3rd year architecture, VERY rough time to drop out). He has consistently told me he feels inadequate and not worthy of being an architect for a while before he failed out. He's taking this way too hard. Not everyone needs to be formally trained (he's actually quite talented, just bad at managing when projects are due). He told me tonight that he is considering killing himself. I told him that I was extremely upset and that he should **NOT** do that. I couldn't think of anything else other than that he should find a good therapist soon. Please help; I've never used this subreddit before but I hope you all can help. I can't sleep thinking he will die.
