Idk manI'm 18 and take 10 daily pills so I don't jump off a window. Anridepressants, ritalin, antipsychotic, sleeping pills...I got drunk in the beginning of August, came home and tried to die by slashing my wrists open...failed, of course...Now my parents look at me like I could break at any second, they're always worried and they're always suffering, they feel like it's their fault I'm sad. They shouldn't have to deal with this shit. 

I can't get into a good university, I can't be there for my friends, I can't make my parents happy, I feel  worried toxic around my niece, I can't even take fucking care of myself. My reflection disgusts me and my voice annoys me. Life is shit, we suffer so much why should one continue to live??? It's exhausting I wish I could just fucking stop living.
