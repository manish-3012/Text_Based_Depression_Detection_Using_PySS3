I'm so deppresed i want to cut and kill myself
When i was little I've been through some tough things, so tough that my only outlet was cutting! things that i tried once to confess to my mother, but in the end it was easier to brush it off as a joke.

I've kept cutting until questions from concerned acquaintances 
and family became to much, and they didn't seem to believe my lies.

I've once slipped back in 2012 and hurt myself as of form of punishment, and now i'm now 24 years old and i'm trying so hard not to cut again :(

The only thing keeping me alive is god and the pain that i'll put my family through :( but I'm so , so tired to continue living.
