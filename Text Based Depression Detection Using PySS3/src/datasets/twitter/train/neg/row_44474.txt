Iâ€˜m exhaustedMy family, theyâ€™re a bunch of inept and ignorant narcissists. I am criticized 25/8 and always have been. I donâ€™t know what to do. I have myself locked in my room but I feel like grabbing a bat and breaking everything they own. My life means nothing to me and I would take it this instant if I could. I hate seeing their faces and I hate waking up to a new day

Iâ€™m holding everything in, I have nobody to talk to about anything. I hate myself, I try so hard not to hurt myself but Iâ€™m physically vibrating right now because I just want to die. Iâ€™ve been punching the floor and now my knuckles are bleeding. Nobody knows, to the rest of the world Iâ€™m just a shy teenage girl but Iâ€™m drained. Everythingâ€™s been taken from me, I donâ€™t have any guidance. Iâ€™ve been trying to reevaluate my perspective of life for the last 4 years but Iâ€™m stuck. I get worse by the day. The facade I play is scary, nobody knows who I really am. I donâ€™t want to play this game anymore. The past haunts me, the future isnt appetizing to me. Why do I have to keep waking up?
