OMG just what have I set in motion?!I reached out via my GP to mental health services.  I stopped drinking a while ago but became so anxious I couldn't even leave the house.   Went to a mental health services appointment on Monday to try to get help.   As I aolice drinking again (because otherwise I would be paralyzed and unable to function) they have declined to help me.  I said 'ok I'll just die then!', not intending to hurt myself or anything.  I phoned for an appointment with my doctor - 2 weeks.  Now both the police and ambulance service have been informed that I am attempting suicide.  

Had two calls from the ambulance service so far.  Jesus!  I don't know what to do.
