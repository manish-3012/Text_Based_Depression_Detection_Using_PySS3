Am I worth living?Last night I started to feel down and hopeless, as I just started dieting again. Food numbs me. Without food all my problems and emotions come up. Then I made it worse by checking my ex online. My only ex. From 10 years ago. Never got over it.Turns out he just got another baby again. The reality of how my life is totally wasted hits in. 

* I am 34 years old
* alone and will stay that way. No children.
* extermely ugly and severly obese
* alopecia (losing my hair) 
* diabetes
* probably MS 
* stalked my ex and his wife for 6 years online, by sending lots of mails and trying to call, said horrible things. 
* unpleasant personality. Most people dislike me.
* Chronic depressed
* Avoidant personality disorder
* Completly broken, i live and come across as a zombie. Everything in my daily life is a huge task. 
* I have a master degree in law, but due to being socially avoidant i have a very simple job in a callcenter. 

Would like you to be honest; if you read this, dont you think "yeah just kill yourself"? You're a waste to this planet.
