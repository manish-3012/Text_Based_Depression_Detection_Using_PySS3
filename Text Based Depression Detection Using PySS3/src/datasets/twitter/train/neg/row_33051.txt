At work, no one knows how bad I fucked up yetPosted last night during a panic attack about this. I'm back in today and everyone is treating me the same as before, I wonder how they'll react when they know. I want to leave before it comes out, everyone has already noticed a downswing in my mood and attitude, HR already spoke to me about possibly being depressed. No one would look twice if I said I was leaving due to health issues.
I'll lose my medical coverage though and won't be able to see my therapist, I can't help but feel that will only make my outlook worse.
What would be the point of leaving though? I'd avoid the embarrassment but I'd still be living a life devoid of meaning. The more time I spend thinking about my life the more certain I am it's pointless.
