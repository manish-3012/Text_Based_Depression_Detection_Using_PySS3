To be saved.I was about to write this to my lover (ex) but I don't think she'd like it but I think I should let it out.
I think when we're thinking about this, we're also wanting to be saved. To be saved by someone who we love but it's really tough for them and we are already feeling idk how many things, I certainly do. 
Honestly they think sometimes it's drama or attention, but it's not honestly, they say get therapy but honestly when you wanna be not alive... I don't think therapy can save us. I don't think anything can save us but honestly we are as selfish as they are. They want us to be alive with this head of ours and we don't want to be because of this head of ours. It's a dilemma, where you end your suffering or you make everyone around you suffer, but I think as much as it's hard to die with that thought, they will move on, won't they? Time heals pains, they say it all the time maybe the pain I will cause this once will be far lesser than I might keep causing till the end of the line.
