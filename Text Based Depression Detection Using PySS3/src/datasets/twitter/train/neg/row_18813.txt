YesI'm not out of options, I've simply chose the most appealing and resonable out. I'm a very introspective and thoughtful person and no amount of bullshit rhetoric is going to be able to change my mind. I'm posting this as a final fuck you to the world, I care not for the prejudice thrown my way, I just want to express my hatred towards everything life ever brought upon my soul. 

I was outnumbered from the start, may the afterlife bring me justice.
