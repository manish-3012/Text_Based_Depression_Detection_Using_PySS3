sick of stupid shit.I can't think. I can't concentrate. I'm just angry.

I'm in a home environment where I hardly open my mouth because of I ever get is disagreement, not because of what I said but because it came out of my fucking mouth. If I express any problem with anything to do with what my parents are doing, I immediately get screamed at and told I'm too sensitive.

Is this some kind of social experiment? This is something you'd see on a BBC documentary. You raise a child with nothing but disagreement, and scream at them and threaten to cancel your education when they call it out to see the results. I bottle up my issues. You fucking win.

Any form of effort towards independence is treated with intense scrutiny. Any time I leave my room I'm followed and watched. I'M FUCKING 19, I DON'T NEED SUPERVISION TO. HOW. TO USE. A FUCKING TOASTER.

If my fucking overbearing parents had their way, I would have dropped out of high school as early as I could and never received any support for depression. They undermine me and everything about me and attempt to force their moronic opinions on me. I was raised by being strangled in overbearing behaviour.

I'm 19, extremely unconfident, on a university bridging course, can't cook, never had a job outside of my parent's retail shop, struggling to a job anywhere else or even **volunteer** work, can't drive, barely leave my room and have no skills whatsoever. This is fucked. Sure, people have it worse but I'm in a fucked up situation which I am incapable of supporting myself to escape. I'm nearly done with everything. I'm a loser.
