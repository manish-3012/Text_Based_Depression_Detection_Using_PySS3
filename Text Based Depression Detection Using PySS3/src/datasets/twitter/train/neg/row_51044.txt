Advice for talking to my therapistHey guys. So I have a therapy appointment on Tuesday. A few days ago I tried to drown myself in a bathtub even though I knew it wouldn't work. About a week before that I almost overdosed but a friend called right when I was going to. I feel like I need to tell her about it but I don't want to be admitted anywhere or have her call a wellness check. Any advice on how to tell her about it without getting sent to the hospital?
