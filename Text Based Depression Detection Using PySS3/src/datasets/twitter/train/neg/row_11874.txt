Suicide hotline did nothing but make me feel worseI called them during a really bad crisis episode, and they didnâ€™t help at all. The woman sounded annoyed during the whole thing Bc I was having a panic Attack and couldnâ€™t form complete sentences. She made me feel worse now idk what to do... idk where to go.... I feel horrible....
