What is life, when you feel lonely as ****?1) What's the point of life?
2) What is love if you can't have any?
3) Why death is sad, when we know we want population reduction through out the world?
4) Why making a struggle to live is heroic?
5) Why are we dragging our lives to old age, when we know we can take it away quickly, when we are young in full health. In old age, you are too scared to die (you just keep on shovelling pills down your throat)?
6) Why are we a *bunch* of **cowards**?

Pretty much everyone I have talked to about ending it all came to the conclusion that they have felt suicidal at some point in their life, but because time passes, you'll get through the **** too. And then you'll get into more shit... and then time will pass again... viola! Never ending **** till you die. What a brilliant solution. All problems solved.

7) What the F**K are we doing here?
