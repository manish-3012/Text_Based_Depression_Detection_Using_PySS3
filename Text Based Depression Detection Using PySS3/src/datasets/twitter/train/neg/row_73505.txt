Went to jump in the road today... couldn'tI went to the road thinking about jumping. As soon as I stood in front of the road there were no cars going either direction. I thought "weird" as this road is ALWAYS bustling. Then I gave up because I was there for a good amount of time. I went back and there were a few cars. As soon as I walked over,  and those few cars had gone by, again, nothing. I don't know if I'm making more of it than I should but I'm taking it as a sign...
