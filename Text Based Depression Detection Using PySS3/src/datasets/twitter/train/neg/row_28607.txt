My "happiness" is hurting meI can't enjoy anything I used to.

Smash Bros reminds me of my fratenty bros that I've theartend.

M83 and MGMT reminds me of my friends from Lebanon that I never talk to anymore

Indie songs remind me of that girl that I've hurt

Driving reminds me of my first job as a delivery driver where life was good.

Clothes and mens fashion remind me of the coworkers I've pissed off at my clothing store job.

Good food reminds me if how overweight I am and how much my mom loves to be critical of me to the point where she won't even engage with me unless I change myself to her liking.


I'm the clear link and problem in these situations, and I can't do anything to make me happy so why bother living.

World would be better if I died.
