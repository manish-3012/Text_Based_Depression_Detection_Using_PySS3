s/o to those who gave up on meI'm extremely extremely down. A lot things didn't turn up to how I wanted it. I'm feeling a new sense of loneliness because there is nothing for me to run to or find an escape. I was so down that I lost my sense of self, and the people who used to care, stopped caring the same. It's like I'm a liability more than a friend. My family doesn't help because one is mostly absent always trying to give hope of this ideal future, and one always finds a way to bring me down or annoy me because of their ignorance and negativity. I'm feeling suicidal, but I have huge faith in myself to not commit suicide. It's just really frustrating. I'm not on campus anymore, I transferred schools because I saw how my cousin really felt about me, etc. There's a lot of shutting down in my history because I am so weak. I am so weak because I am tired; I've been miserable for so long. My boyfriend makes me a little better and he's super patient with me and my emotions, but I just don't want to be this way at all.
