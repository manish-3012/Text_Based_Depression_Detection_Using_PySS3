I Just Can't Go Through With It.Hey everyone, so I've been dealing with alot of things within my life. From family problems, to horrible self-confidence, to drugs, and now a major pregnancy scare. I just don't get it, why do all these things happen when I finally hit a new happiness? Sometimes I wonder why I'm still here sometimes, and latly that's the question I've been asking myself alot. Every time I try to commit suicide something is always saving me, the doctors said I have "some guardian angel". But, why do I keep being saved if everyone can clearly see I'm no where near happy. I just don't get it, Im lost, stuck, I don't know anymore. So instead of trying to die, I cut, drink, or smoke..this has brought me to an extremely new low my mom and I fight all the time now, my sister and I can't stand eachother, and I don't have a good relationship with my father either. What should I do? I'm just trapped..
