Looking for a bright spotSo I am essentially deemed a bad person, an asshole, and many other negative characteristics, all of which I will not deny, for no man is perfect. My question is if say a rabbit was being assaulted verbally, physically, and mentally tortured with intent, what is the best course of action if said rabbit wishes no revenge, but rather a quick and relatively painless passing?
