No hope for the future. Everything is bleak and empty and nothingI dont know what to do. Im failing high school. I can barely handle regular high school and ap classes. Im useless. I love writing and reading and yet I havent been able to write for 5 years.
Im so done. Im so done.
The emptiness inside me is growing. 
My grandpa got in a car accident and hes old as fuck. I see him in the hospital. I see the pain hes going through. I see the others pateint.
I cant take it anymore. Everyone around me is fucking miserable. My mother is just like me. My dad doesnt give a shit but he does care in some little ways. My brother is autistic and has no guidance.
I look around me and all i see is pain. I wake up in the morning and its all i feel. I cant fucking do this anymore. 
Some people can transform their pain into art. Like music, drawings, etc. I cant do this anymore. I cant do this anymore.
I wanted to do so many fucking things. Im lonely as fuck. I want a boyfriend. I want someone to talk to other than my mother. 
I just csnt.
This is going to get lost in the midst of so many other worthy, more interesting posts.
Im nothing.
