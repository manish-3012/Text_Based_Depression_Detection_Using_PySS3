Friend committed suicide and I blame myselfI can't help but blame myself, and it's stupid. Recently I've fallen into depression and sometimes I have episodes of crying till I become emotionless, but then I get suicidal thoughts. ...it's like other parts of me shut down and I start imagining about committing suicide myself. 

I couldn't do anything... and now that he's gone, I can't change that, ever.
And I'll have to accept that, but I can't accept that, which is why I'll suffer from self-loathing, self-hatred to the end of my life... however long or short it is going to be.
