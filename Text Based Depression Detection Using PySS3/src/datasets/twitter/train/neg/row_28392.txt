I donâ€™t feel happiness anymoreI donâ€™t remember the last time I actually felt happy, or excited. I donâ€™t donâ€™t know if living is worth it anymore. And donâ€™t try to convince me to not kill myself, I want honest opinions, should I kill myself? I genuinely donâ€™t see the point in living anymore. I donâ€™t even have any friends. No one likes me except my mom. Please, I need help.
