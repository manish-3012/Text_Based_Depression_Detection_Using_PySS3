I want to die, but I also want to live freeI don't even know what to do, my heart is pounding and I have knots in my stomach. It could be because I'm constantly overthinking, thinking about how at 22 I never attended college, my jobs can't last more than 6 months(had 5 of them) because I get drained quickly, can't date, because I fall for someone too quickly and then guys realize that they don't need that in their life(and I don't blame them, it's my fault)... I wish I could move out of my parents house, but I can't. This is all too much, I want to disappear, or self harm(but people would notice, so I'm stuck). Idk how to even end this shit.
