How do I talk to my mum?So I've been struggling for around a year maybe, but since the start of this year for some reason it has gotten a lot worse. I sleep from 6am till around 7pm then I spend the whole night awake on my computer. Most days I eat a pizza. Some days I don't eat at all... All I can think about is killing myself but I know how badly my mum would take it and she is so stressed as it is I don't wanna seem selfish or make her feel any worse. I just don't know what to do.. I know my family loves me, but then I feel like they don't. My brother is always on his computer in the day and is constantly blocking me out. My other brother has some symptoms of multiple sclerosis or something, but I know nothing about that because I'm not allowed to see my niece because she made up some crap about me that I made her smell my finger and she told them it was piss but it was lip balm and she EVEN said it was really nice and asked for some on her lips so I don't see them anymore... My other other brother was abusive to his girlfriend because of drinking, he is now getting off the drink to try and get her back but he is so depressing and I know my mum is finding it hard to cope with him staying at our house. Then my cats do something like pee on the carpet and it just pushes my mum over the edge. Now we are getting into money problems because my mum has been paying rent and all the bills for other brother and he keeps saying he will pay her back but he isn't... Now I'm starting to get msgs from boys who I thought I could trust asking me if they can "put their dick in my ass" and I can't talk to her about that either. Sorry if this post is all over the place and hard to understand. I've been starting going to open mics lately.. I have one tomorrow actually, they are kind of helping, but in a way they are making things a whole lot worse because when I get up there I am always so nervous, but then i make a mistake and then i feel worthless again. I'm just really scared...
