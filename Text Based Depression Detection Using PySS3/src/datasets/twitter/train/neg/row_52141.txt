Why is life so hard?I'll start out by saying that my story seems extremely petty compared to a lot of what goes on here. But nevertheless whatever I have gone through has seriously made me question why I should even live. I have questioned living probably ever since sixth grade. Iâ€™d pray to god many nights that something killed me so I wouldnâ€™t have to face the hardship the next day. And Iâ€™ve noticed that every time I do, itâ€™s because of things that are hard that I donâ€™t want to accomplish. I guess that despite all of those times, I have evidently faced the challenge in some way because I am still here today in college. Because all of my life has been me as a student, itâ€™s mostly been tests in subjects that I donâ€™t do well in that I consider the hardships that I donâ€™t want to face. Also Iâ€™ve never had big issues with my parents. 9 times out of 10, they are clearly just looking out for my well-being and success in later life. And I am very fortunate to have non-abusive parents who love and appreciate me. I'm fortunate enough to go to college and still be able to see them every weekend as I have been because I'm so lonely at school. They have come to accept it because they know I'm not independent and that I really enjoy spending tune with them but they want me to branch out and find myself and I agree with that. But I hate college. There is nothing I look forward to here. **I am here only because I have to be here to do one thingâ€“ make my parents proud.**

Yeah Iâ€™ll admit it, Iâ€™m not a motivated person. I am extremely lazy and this thoroughly irritates my parents. They say that this will not only get worse as it keeps happening but it will eventually lead to me being penniless and helpless and I can see that. Life is not as easy as it was 30-40 years ago. *People with Ivy League-level degrees are keeping minimum-wage jobs*, my parents always repeat to me. And the only reason I even made it to college was because of intelligence that I guess sort of just developed as I grew, just from grasping the little bit of education that I genuinely found interesting. I floated by classes and I guess it just so happened that a lot of them didnâ€™t thoroughly evaluate me with exams, and thus I was able to pass a lot of the classes with above-average grades and get into a pretty decent state university.

And I am a huge procrastinator. Throughout high school and now college I just spend my time browsing reddit or YouTube, skip all the optional work like reading for classes and do work that I know impacts my grade at the very last minute and go to bed whenever I get tired doing it. But college is a lot different. To younger redditors as you may have heard, college DOES push you to your intellectual limits and doesnâ€™t hesitate to fail you. And I hate that sometimes even putting quite a bit of effort doesn't lead to good results. I hate that **so much**. I am sitting here in my dorm in college for my parents, not for me. Giving up has always been something desirable to me, *the easy way out*. I have no desire of continuing in higher-level education. And this makes me feel even worse and guilty because they are paying so much for me to go through college because they want me to be better than I am and not suffer to make money later in life. But I lack the motivation to work hard and persevere through college. 

My college has nothing that interests me or makes me feel better, from majors to clubs to people. The school has like 20 majors, none of which I really think I want to do. They all involve too much work that I don't care about. 

I have tried making friends but it seems like I have put too much work into it and none of them are returning that favor because they have other, better friends. Friends were so much easier to make when I was young, as 90+% of the friends I made when I was young are people I have been consistent friends with up until now in college. And those have been my only friends. Making friends back then was so much easier because life was so much simpler. As a primary schooler, you donâ€™t get judged too much. 

I tried going to clubs/orgs, but have not found any that interest me and just feel like a waste of energy to go to. Most people form groups among themselves so it's hard to join in being so antisocial.


I want to go back to the â€œgood old daysâ€ when I had less work to do in classes and I could take time to enjoy life with friends and my sister and parents. I constantly look back at moments when I was with the people I love so much and I am even doing so right now. And I know I had hardships back then too but they cannot compare to what Iâ€™m facing now. Because the hardships that you start failing now are the ones that you may learn from, but you can never remove and will seriously affect your future. I have never questioned why I am living as much as I am now.
