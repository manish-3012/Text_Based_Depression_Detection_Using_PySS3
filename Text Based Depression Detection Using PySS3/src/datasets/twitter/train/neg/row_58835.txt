I can't live as a manI can't live as a man anymore. I have biological needs but my body at its best is pathetic and I am a creep for existing. I can't do this anymore, there is no solution, we can't just make me a woman but I want to be a woman so I can be a human.

I want to be human but I can't be as a man because no one will let me because we live in a society and I don't because I am the problem because I exist so the solution is to man up and kill myself because biology doesn't give a shit about morals or abstract bullshit and neither does my body because it is not robotic but biological so I need to die but I am afraid. Pain isn't a virtue. Living in pain isn't a virtue. This isn't virtuous, it is pathetic. I am not good enough and that's all that matters because we live in a dog-eat-dog world that doesn't give a shit about anything but the sum of what you are and I have been deemed trash and I kind of knew that all along. There is no one out there that cares, apparently you need some special thing that I don't and have never had so please pray for my death. Please. I am being serious. I do not want to live any longer and I will be here hurting and never getting better because better involves another person, and it *always* did, which is why we talk in circles until I die by my own hand or old age. I am sick of talking. I am sick of living. I am sick of being inherently pathetic. This is biology. This is nature. Nature is evil. Nature doesn't have morals, it simply looks pretty and I am nothing if not the least pretty thing one could lay eyes on and certainly NEVER EVER touch.

How do I get the courage to kill myself?  Please leave solutions/suggestions at the bottom of this page.
