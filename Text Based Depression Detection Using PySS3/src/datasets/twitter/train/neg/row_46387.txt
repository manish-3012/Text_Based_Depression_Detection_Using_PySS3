The thought of suicide is the only thing that makes me happyI started to think about suicide in 8th grade. (I'm entering 10th currently)

* It all started when a guy in my grade named Thomas "liked" me and did everything he could to try to "earn" me. Thomas noticed that I was hanging out with my friend Owen a lot, and said to his friends that I was sleeping with Owen and every guy I hung out with (which wasn't true). The rumors soon spread to whole grade, which caused everyone to hate me, including Owen. No one believed me when I told them the rumors weren't true.
* The group of friends Thomas told the rumors to started bullying me everyday. The rumors eventually got to my sister and her friends at the high school, and they, too, started to bully me because of it. And soon, everyone in *her* grade knew. I hated school. And around that time, I started cutting.
* I got the courage to go up to Thomas and to tell him that I didn't like him back. And I came out to him. Because of that, he and his friends left me alone, but everyone still bullied me for being gay, even worse when they bullied because of the rumors.
* In 9th grade (last year), there was this girl named Sasha who didn't like me and kept trying to steal my friends away from me. She and her friends targeted and bullied me, to the point where I found myself skipping class just to avoid them. I found myself with only 1-2 friends left, and they even hung out outside of school without me. I was never allowed to hang out with my friends outside of school. The rumors (from 8th grade) got to the new kids, and they hated me, too.
* My home life was worse. My sister hated me, and my parents always took her side. They always believe my sister because she is a manipulative bitch and blames everything on me, even though she always started shit.

My sister said horrible things to me everyday like:

\- "You were a mistake. I was the only one who was planned. They didn't even want you."

\- "If you weren't born, mom and dad could've saved thousands because they wouldn't have paid for your therapy. We would've been living in a big house if it weren't for you."

\- "You know mom and dad think *I'll* be the most successful. They don't even believe in you, they think you'll be the *least* successful. No one will ever appreciate you."

\- "You know they don't trust you, right? They trust and love *me* more than you. They hate you and so do I. Everyone in school hates you, too."

\- "I hate you. I wish you would just die. Go kill yourself." She *knew* I was suicidal.

* She wasn't ever sorry for anything she said. She went through my things and found my diaries, and told everyone everything in them. She even found pleasure in torturing me and making me cry. She enjoyed hurting me, physically and emotionally, until she decided that it wasn't "fun" anymore. But, at least she's going to 12th grade. I can't wait when she goes away for college.
* And because of all this, I actually tried to kill myself (mainly because of what my sister said) but I failed.
* I should've been dead. But, of course, I'm not. I can't do anything right. I fucking hate my life.
