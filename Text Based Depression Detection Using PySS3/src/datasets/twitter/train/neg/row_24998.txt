I am ready now to goThings have just gotten incrementally worse to the point that I can't do it anymore.
I don't know if anyone reading this can be certain that if they died the news would be celebrated. I know this for a fact. If I were to give some more info and you googled you would see what I've done and would know that many, many people would be cheered by me going.
I did something terrible and it's something that will follow me forever. I'm locked up now and even when I get out I won't be free.
One time on the way to a court hearing the bus was playing a morning breakfast program hosted by someone Charlemagne tha God, and they were discussing suicide and he said "no one ever ever should do it, except [this one group of people that I'm part of] they should all drink poison and die"
I was too scared to do it then but it's a couple years later and I've now seen all the online reports, I've heard through a third party that my ex wife said my kids have researched me. I've looked through online collages and I've been edited out and erased. I already died when I was arrested I'm just catching up now.
I'm writing this because I want to leave something of myself. I'm not notorious enough that any of you have heard of me but just know that I accept responsibility for what I did, and it was terrible, it was a few days out of an otherwise unremarkable life, but I can't bear the cross of it anymore.
