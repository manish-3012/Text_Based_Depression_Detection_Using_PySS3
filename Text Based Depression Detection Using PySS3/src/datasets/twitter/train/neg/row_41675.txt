just another post by some depressed moron who doesn't see the point.I was born into a world where I don't deserve to be happy.

People are relentless in bringing others down.. and it isn't so much that people have brought me down anymore.. it's the fact that people get pleasure out of doing it.. out of trolling.  I have nothing anymore.  It has been shoved down my throat how worthless I really am.  I have no friends.  I have no career.  I have no motivation.  I have nothing to do.  I have nothing.

Go ahead, point out that I have internet so I must be better off than whatever fucking percentage of the world, right?  Point out that I have family, even though they're a thousand miles away.  Point out that I'm one of billions of other worthless people.  Point out that I'm not the only depressed one here.  Do it.

I'm done.  I just called and destroyed my only chance at getting to live out a dream... It wouldn't be the first one that was destroyed by the pure assholishness in people.

What am I supposed to do now?  I can't drive anywhere, I can't talk to anyone, I can't play any games or watch any movies.  I can only sit here and stare at the wall.  The only thought keeping me alive is who would feed my fucking dog?  Even he's a dick to me sometimes.  He ate my pajamas.  I don't even have fucking pajamas.
