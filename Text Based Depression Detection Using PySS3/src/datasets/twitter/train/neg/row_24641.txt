tell me honestly what will happenI have xanax, valium, seroquel, abilify, zyrtec, atarax, and tylenol. If I take a bunch of each will I die easily? I'm so done. I broke down at my therapist's office today cause I actually realized that I'll never be free of my mental illnesses. I've got bipolar 1 (the shittier type) and ptsd, and an anxiety disorder. I want off this roller coaster. If I had lithium i probably could do it, but I don't think anything I have will kill me? I'm just so tired of fighting.
