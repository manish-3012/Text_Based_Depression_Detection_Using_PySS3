Suicide makes me the happiestkind of a grotesque title, but all the way true.


With the certainty of killing myself on a set date, and the peace that comes along with it, I have been the happiest in a long time. Simply, because I have learnt to accept that there is no life or future to return to, and I am able to spend my final time completing a bucket list and cleaning bits of my name.



I see a lot of people that come here, overwhelmed by events and in emotional turbulences, and it sometimes feels a little odd to be this calm about death. I believe that I have already implemented suicide into my future to a point I do not care about life, which is a very interesting way of going on about it. In a way, I feel more like a simple human than actual person now - fairly unimportant, naive and not all too complex. Everything feels 2D by now.


Anyway, wanted to share this feeling without anyone in real life being alarmed and risking my whole plan and discreteness.
