i donâ€™t want staymy whole family have expressed that they hate me and that theyâ€™re ashamed of me in some way today. iâ€™m struggling with an eating disorder and iâ€™ve made 3 people cry today already, everything is always blamed on me and i seriously canâ€™t take it. iâ€™m depended on for everything and i just canâ€™t take it all anymore. if i ever even mention myself needing help or show any bit of vulnerability, iâ€™m shut down, shit on and attacked. thereâ€™s only 2 people in my life iâ€™m living for and if i didnâ€™t have them iâ€™d already be gone. i donâ€™t want to die but i want all this pain to go away and dying seems like the only permanent way for it to end. iâ€™ve always told people â€˜it gets betterâ€™ but iâ€™m debating the quote myself honestly.
