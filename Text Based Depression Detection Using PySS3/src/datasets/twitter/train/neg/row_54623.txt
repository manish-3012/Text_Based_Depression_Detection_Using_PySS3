Does anyone have experiences with inpatient treatment and does it help?I feel like I'm getting closer to trying to end my life and I was wondering if going to a mental hospital would somehow help. I've been in the crisis ward twice for a week each but never actually went further with the programs there. A family member also had to go there once and he stayed for 18 months and he's out now but still messed up. It didn't work for him so I'm afraid it's a waste of time. Is it? I'm at my limit.
