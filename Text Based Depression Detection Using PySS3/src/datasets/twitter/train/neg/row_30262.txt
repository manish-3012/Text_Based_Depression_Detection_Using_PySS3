I made a rule to myself that whenever I'm getting suicidal thoughts, I'd ask myself "am I exhausted? Am I sleep deprived? Did something bad happen? " If the answer is yes, I'd tell myself that I shouldn't make any decisions while in that state. But the answer was always yes.I'm always exhausted. I'm always sleep deprived. Bad things are always happening. The most repetitive thought I had for the last 2 years was wanting to slit my wrists and die. I thought I was improving. I went to therapy. I exercised, meditated and ate well just like everybody told me to. 
But I still want to die. Am I doing something wrong? Was there something I missed?
