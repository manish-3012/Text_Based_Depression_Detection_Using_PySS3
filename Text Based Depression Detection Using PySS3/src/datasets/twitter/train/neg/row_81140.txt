Head Trauma; Suicidal thoughtsI have had several traumatic brain injuries in football, the army, and otherwise. Now all I can think about is ending it and I can't see any way out. No one can understand how I feel and even I cant figure this out. I just want to go away and let everyone live life in peace. How can I fix this? I have had such serious head injuries that it took me forever to even type this out. I used to be so smart but now I cant remember what I had for breakfast.
