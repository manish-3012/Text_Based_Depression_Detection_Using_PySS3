Coming out of my shell sharing this stuff. Help? (Original post on /r/askreddit)Hi, my name is unimportant, and I feel as though I am too. For the last ten plus years it seems as though life has been on a downhill spiral. And as of now, every thing I do seems pointless.
I honestly don't know where to start. I'm constantly depressed, I have nothing in life to look forward to, every time I consulted someone about my issues the only advice I get is, "You just have to wait. Everything will be better with time". Hell, for years I've been telling myself that also. But nothing ever ends up "getting better". Everything always ends up worse. I mean sure, I get a pat on the back every couple of months, but that isn't enough to give me the will to live. I mean, just as I was driving home today from work I almost had to fight myself not to drive my car into the guard rails along the highway. So if this continues, what's to stop me from actually doing it tomorrow on my way to work?
I'm posting here because I'm out of options for advice. Otherwise, trust me, I wouldn't be posting here. I'm pretty much the type of person who bottles up all of their issues and problems inside. I know it's not good for me, but at least it doesn't make other people worry about me when I know their attention is needed elsewhere or if they already have enough stress on their shoulders.
I've taken medication, doesn't help. I've talking to counselors and doctors, doesn't help. I've talked to my parents and siblings, doesn't help. So please, if there is anyone who understands my issues, lend me a hand, give me some advice, anything...?
