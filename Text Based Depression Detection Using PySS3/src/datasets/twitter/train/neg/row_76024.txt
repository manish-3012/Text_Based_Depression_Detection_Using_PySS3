When you're suicidal but you don't want to dieHere's what's going on. Lately I've been so anxious the thought of going to work makes me want to step in front of a bus. I take lorazepam and latuda, and I dont know if they're helping. I still get manic and I still get depressed. I doubt urgent care will be any help, but I'm afraid of going to the hospital (either they won't listen and push drugs at me or I'll be locked away). Either way I can't go on like this.
