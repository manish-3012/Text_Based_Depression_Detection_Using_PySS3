Not strong enough to go on, too weak to end everythingI've made a fabulous mess of my life. I have some fantastic friends, but at this point I'm financially dependent upon one of them. I don't deserve that, and certainly doesn't either. I have a shitty part time that I'm working 40 hours at barely paying most of my bills, haven't scratched the mountain of student loans I have from my bachelors in mechanical engineering. It's toilet paper. I haven't received a single offer from the interviews I've had. I've been out of school two years and that's not helping my resume, but I can't even get the time of day from full time employers. They say it's who you know. Twice I've had connections, and both time I've been passed over. Just today I had an opportunity fall through my hands. I was waiting for the contract to be signed, can't get much closer than that. Even with the interview prep, coaching, and behind the scenes work my benefactor did, I failed to secure the position. I feel like a cosmic joke, and the punchline is getting pretty old.  

I told myself if this didn't come through I was going to end everything. I half heartedly tried earlier today, and I'm debating a more permanent effort tonight.  

I put my life on hold waiting for a solid job, and I've got nothing to show for it.
