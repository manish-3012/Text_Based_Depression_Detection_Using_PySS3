I had an explosive mental breakdown in the middle of the night. Iâ€™m feeling lower than ever. (15F)Iâ€™m just feeling so low right now. I tried telling my mom about my mental issues and some of my troubles but I was just yelled at, pushed away, accused of gaslighting her, and was basically just told how disappointing Iâ€™ve been to my parents.

Additionally, she let it slip that the reason why I donâ€™t go to therapy anymore (she pulled me out of it) is that she thinks Iâ€™m going to â€˜snitchâ€™ on my family, and that itâ€™s too â€˜hardâ€™ for our â€˜schedule.â€™

Honestly. Thatâ€™s when I just lost all fucking hope. That sheâ€™d rather prevent a few preconceived ideas/inconveniences than have a dead, fucked up, or otherwise seriously harmed daughter. 

In the middle of the night I ended up just losing my shit completely, partially due to my motherâ€™s rejection, and now Iâ€™m so ashamed. I hit myself so many times. I punched myself in the head. I punched the door. I sobbed the entire time, everything became a blur. I just wanted to die. 

And I still do, but now Iâ€™m just more melancholy and exhausted as opposed to being violently upset. I really donâ€™t think I deserve anything in life. I have a boyfriend, but how long is that going to last? Do I even deserve him? Iâ€™m just fucking crazy, my ex told me how crazy I was and I guess I should believe that. Iâ€™m too broken for anyone to love, I have too much baggage for such a young person and itâ€™s disgusting. Iâ€™m co-dependent, unmotivated, and have shitty coping mechanisms. Iâ€™m surprised my boyfriend didnâ€™t just run the minute I described to him all my brutal self-harming methods.

This post is discombobulated and jumbled up. At this point Iâ€™m just rambling rather than asking for any advice. I guess the take-away message/question I pose with this is, how can you cope when everyone (at least, the people who make important decisions for you, ie your parents) are so unsupportive and negligent? How can I even try to heal? Sorry for the long post by the way. Just needed to let it out. Thank you for reading.
