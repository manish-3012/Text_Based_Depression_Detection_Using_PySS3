i hate myself so goddamn muchive had years of therapy and i understand a lot about myself and my situation, what led to me being depressed and anxious, but god do i still fucking hate my own guts. its so hard fighting all the negative thoughts when im so thoroughly convinced of their truth. i can be compassionate to others but not myself: im responsible for everything i say and do, and theres voice in my head which insists that since its possible to not fuck up in any given situation, then i shouldnt. that if i make a single mistake, im worthless. i dont know how to keep going like this, how to live with these feelings of self-loathing and guilt that are eating me alive. im so tired. im not sure whether i could ever actually do it but god, i just want it all to stop
