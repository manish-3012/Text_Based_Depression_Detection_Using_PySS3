Too much homeworkI'm getting 6- 9 hours of homework every day and I can't spend any time with my family or friends. I barely have time to talk to my girlfriend. My parents yell at me to manage my time better which is really difficult cause I usually get like 2-4 hours of sleep every night. I can't just wake up early cause I feel emotionally deprived of anything. I wanted to drop out of my college classes but my parents won't let me. I get yelled at for not spending time with anyone and everyone thinks I'm lazy when really I'm just drained from doing the same fucking thing every day. I want to kill myself so it just all ends I'm tired of this shit
