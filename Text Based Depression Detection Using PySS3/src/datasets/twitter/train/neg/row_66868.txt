I made plans. I wrote her a note. I nearly went through with it. I can't cope without my daughter.I am a broken man. My abusive partner left me in September. Took our daughter 2 hours away. Has denied me access on several occasions. Have only had a couple weekends with her. I'm not likely to see my daughter again until late January. I also have a month to find a new home as my rental has sold. My life is falling apart. I have built the most amazing bond with my 18mo daughter and my ex is systematically destroying it. Everything favours her. I am powerless, and alone.
