very confused. lots of deaf earsso here i am 539 in morning the day after. my significant other has said she no longer has those passionate feelings for me. i still do. we went thru a lot together as im sure all of you have. we made it thru a abortion. a texting scandal. with that behind usi figured we were invincible. her children loved me as i loved them. this came out of the blue. so now once again the dark place has come and dominates my thoughts. 

my father committed suicide. he said it was a way to the end the pain. better to feel nothing than to continue feeling pain day in and day out. i have no family here in the usa. my acquaintances all say look to the positive. you have a job. you have a car. you ahve many hobbies. you have a dog. it all means nothing without that significant other. without that love. without that feeling that someone misses you adn wants to be next to you. 

i have a means. rather quick. people will miss me for about two weeks and thats it. lets be honest here. no  one xcept my mother will miss me. its recent and i know as time goes by the pain gets worse and then gets better. but i really dont want the pain anymore. the agony of desolation.
