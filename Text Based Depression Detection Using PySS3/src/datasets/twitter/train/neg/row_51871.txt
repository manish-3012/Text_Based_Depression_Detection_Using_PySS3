What's the point in anything?I figured it wouldn't matter much if I killed myself. Everyone dies, in the end. And after we die, what was the point in living? Yeah, we might be remembered for a few years after, but after that, what's the point? In the end we all die, and are all forgotten, and out entire existence would have been pointless. It might hurt my family and friends if I was to die, but in 50 years, it wouldn't matter. Nothing I did will matter.

What's the point in living except to just be alive?
