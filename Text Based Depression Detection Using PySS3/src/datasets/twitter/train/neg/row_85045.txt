2 and a half week update since I tried to kill myself.Hey guys,
Iâ€™m back as I promised to keep you updated! A lot has changed since then. Me and my ex are back talking again, there some flirting and a lot of sweetness between us and there is definitely potential for progression in our relationship! Iâ€™m still at a lost cause in terms of what I want to do with my life from here and what I want to make of my future and career. About one week ago, I tried taking magic mushrooms. Since then, I have felt completely disconnected from any depressive/suicidal thoughts and I feel completely at ease from my mental illnesses since trying them! In a way I almost feel cured, seems crazy but it helped. I have been relaxing, doing my own thing, enjoying being alive and other people. 

The only thing that is getting me down is what I want to do. I know 110% that I would absolutely love to be a pilot. Although, unfortunately it is very expensive and there are no apprenticeship programmes available. It hurts that I know how badly I want to be a pilot, but it is just impossible right now! 

Iâ€™d like to thank all of you again for pulling me through this, for supporting me and for loving me when I needed it most. If it werenâ€™t for anyone of you, I wouldnâ€™t be here today!

If anyone at all wants to talk or chat please donâ€™t hesitate to send me a message! I will talk about anything and I am more than happy to help and support :)

Thank you all.

Much love,
M.
