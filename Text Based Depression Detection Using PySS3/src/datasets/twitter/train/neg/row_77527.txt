Need help convincing my cousin not to do itBasically my cousin feels like he's a burden on his family, since he was caught up on drugs on freshman year, he went to the mental hospital hospital twice, he gave up on religion, his girlfriend broke up with him, and he's been in depression last two years while not being sober. I know his parents don't think of him like that and they would go insane if they lost him. Help me, help him.
