I'm just a problem nowI'm so depressed atm to the point I can't even make it to school but if I don't go my family will have to pay a fine. This morning my mum straight up told me she doesn't care how I feel cause its not she'll be loosing money not me then my dad texted "if you don't do something it will only get worse" when I'm literally at rock bottom and told me my hamster died.

I've reached my limit of what I can take. I'm ready to die
