I don't know what to do with myself anymore, any advice would be appreciatedI have psychotic depression, and I feel like I'm down spiraling into a special type of insanity where suicide seems like the most logical option for me, though I know it's not the best option for everyone else around me. I'm a daily pot smoker, and while I know it's probably making everything worse for me in the long run, it's the only thing that makes me feel truly alive and content. I've tried taking a break for a few months but I found that I still feel depressed and bored, just a bit more stable. I'm on several types of medication, but I feel like they aren't working anymore.

I've had a rope sitting in my closet in case I felt like I really needed to kill myself, but I feel like this is stupid, again because I don't want to hurt people around me. My relationships have all been falling apart, and I feel hopeless about the world and the future. I know I have a good life, but all the thoughts in my head torment me. I've been hospitalized because I confessed to a therapist how suicidal I was feeling, but I really don't want to go back there again because I don't think it will help. I really don't know what to do with myself, and I have no one to talk to. I would really appreciate any advice, because I feel so lost and alone.
