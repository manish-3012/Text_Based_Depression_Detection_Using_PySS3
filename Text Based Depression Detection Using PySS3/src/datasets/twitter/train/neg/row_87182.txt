I had a breakdownI'm currently having a lot of trouble in my personal life.. I've also been struggling with self hate for a long time now. It's been a really hard week and coming close to killing myself once.  I feel so tired and so exhausted. I can't do anything right now. I hope I get out of this. I really don't know how to cope with this well of sadness. I'm just so sad and I don't know what to do. I just feel so tired and ill.  It feels like my brain is fried and I don't think rationally anymore. All my thoughts are fried. Even in my sleep my brain feels like it hurts. I snapped and I feel like I can't ever get up from my bed
