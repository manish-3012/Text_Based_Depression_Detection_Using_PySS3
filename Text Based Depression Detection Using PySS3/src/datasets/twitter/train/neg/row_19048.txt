Really want to commit suicide but don't know how!Ok, as you can tell by my title I am struggling with life massively at the moment. I have literally nothing going for me, I have spent the last 4 years without any friends, girls despise me and I can't even look at a girl now without getting shot down, I haven't had a relationship in 5 years which just makes me lonely and depressed.

 I am a 19 year old guy who is on the verge of doing something I might regret. I am currently studying in a nautical college for the merchant navy, I am now about to drop out because I couldn't make friends down here and am struggling massively academically. I have already done a year at college and am on my second year. I have been bullied by a lot of different people at different times so I don't know anymore. 

I have been to a counsellor before but he made me worse, been to the doctors but they just refered me to a counsellor and won't give me any anti depressants.

Sometimes I think why the hell was I even born when I could give my life to someone more deserving of it than me and who would enjoy it more 

I know I am different, got social anxiety, and a whole host of problems but I pity anyone who goes through this or worse, I cant describe how it feels!

Anyway I wish I didn't care about anything as I really want to commit suicide but there are too many things stopping me. What happens if there is a hell which might be worse than earth, will it be painful, mess it will leave on my family, I could be unsuccessful and leave me like a vegetable which would make me hate life even more. I really just wish I could build up the courage to do it

Anyway rant over there is a bunch of other problems I have which I haven't covered but I am too tired so just kept it short
