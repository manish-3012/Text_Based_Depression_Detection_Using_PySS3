Wish I could see others lives after death.Some days I really wish I wouldâ€™ve â€œjumpedâ€... only thing that holds me back is not knowing how it would affect others. Iâ€™m sure so many people wouldnâ€™t go through with their jump if they could see life after death. Really need some encouraging words.
