I can't get over this.I told a girl I loved her. Like a few months back. Like Last year basically. She could have told me she liked some other guy. But nooooooooo. She waited for 6 months then told me today. I feel like shit. Everything is shit. I spent half a year trying and now? Oh no. What a surprise. I need some help.
