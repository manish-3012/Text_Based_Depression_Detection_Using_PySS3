Still having troubleI posted a few days ago talking about how I want to carve into my left arm, and have violent dreams. Never got a response back from anyone but I know it got views. Idk. Still having the same issue so I thought maybe putting it it there might help me somehow. My knife is still too dull to cut my skin but I sure can scratch the hell out of it. I still donâ€™t have a steady hand. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing.
