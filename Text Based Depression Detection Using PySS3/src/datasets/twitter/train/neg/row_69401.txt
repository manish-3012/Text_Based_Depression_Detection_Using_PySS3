How do I hide the signs of my failed attempt tomorrow?I attempted to suffocate myself tonight. I wasn't sure how to do it, so I just tied a belt really tight around my neck.

It didn't work, but now I have scratches all over my arms and chest from my self-harm and now a big, visible red mark around my neck from my failed attempt. I have to give 2 presentations for classes tomorrow. I have also kept my suicidal ideation completely secret from my friends because I don't want to manipulate them. I am afraid that if they see the evidence of my most recent attempt that I will have manipulated them.

It is 75 degrees tomorrow. How do I hide my marks.
