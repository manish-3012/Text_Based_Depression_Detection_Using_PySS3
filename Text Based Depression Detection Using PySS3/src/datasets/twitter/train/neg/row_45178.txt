the NHS mental health service in the UK is underfunded and i cant access the right help - if you have experience with it, can you answer some of my questions? (tl;dr at the bottom)i have been seeing an early intervention service for my psychosis for three weeks now. last appointment, i expressed that i was in a crisis and i needed help. i asked if my social worker could book me into an appointment with a psychiatric nurse at the hospital so i could have an assessment to see if i needed further support. i told her many times i was worried i was going to kill myself this week. she said she didnâ€™t think i was that bad, and asked me if i had suicidal intent and i said yes, which i had also literally stated as i walked into the appointment. she said she didnâ€™t think it was necessary, and said i should take myself to A&amp;E if i get worse. 

my girlfriend does not believe she is high risk, but she has had a lot of stress from social services recently because she was in the midst of the process of being taken out of her home with her abusive parents. after it had settled and they were very quiet for a while, they randomly popped up and said that she needed an immediate risk assessment at hospital with a psychiatric nurse because she was considered â€œhigh riskâ€. she hadnâ€™t expressed anything close to being in a crisis yet they still are following it up now. 

iâ€™m hurt that iâ€™ve expressed many times that i am experiencing psychotic symptoms and that i am a risk to myself and others but i am still not considered high risk. i donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll take me seriously until i kill myself or take myself to A&amp;E. 

i have a few questions about this; 
as i am 15 (iâ€™m aware at 16 i have more rights about being an inpatient), it is very hard to be taken seriously. iâ€™m currently being told that i donâ€™t have psychosis, because it is more long-term than short episodes so they think itâ€™s something else.
- would going to A&amp;E speed up the process of being checked out by a psychiatric nurse? 
the early intervention service are withholding information about me and wonâ€™t diagnose me properly which means i canâ€™t access the help i need and i just want to get assessed as soon as possible. iâ€™ve already been diagnosed with bipolar and i guess psychosis but nothing is being done. 
- is it better to go to hospital/my GP to ask about an assessment with a psychiatric nurse? CAMHS wonâ€™t see me as they have put me into the EIP service who arenâ€™t helping
- how can i clearly express that i want to be checked into a psychiatric ward as an inpatient? i keep asking about it because i genuinely believe iâ€™m going to kill myself, but they wonâ€™t listen when i say that taking myself to A&amp;E would cause a lot more issues for my family and i need someone else to assess me first 
- how can i be assertive and get the most out of the service? 
- how can i initiate being assessed by a psychiatric nurse?
- how can i make them take my concerns for myself being high risk seriously? i really want to be checked in as an inpatient but honestly i donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll take me seriously until i attempt to kill myself and show up. which i evidently am trying to avoid. i just want help. 

TL;DR
- i want to be checked into hospital so i donâ€™t kill myself but the NHS wonâ€™t take my concerns seriously and iâ€™m not in a place to pursue it because i am very much at risk of killing myself. i have a few questions above about expressing myself clearly and asserting how to get help. any help or advice from people who have any experience would be so greatly appreciated.
