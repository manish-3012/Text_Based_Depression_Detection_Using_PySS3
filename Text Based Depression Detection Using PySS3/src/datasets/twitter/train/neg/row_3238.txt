Weed only thing keeps me here.Afterwards getting really stoned shit doesnâ€™t matter anymore, combined with mediation itâ€™s really helped why in the hell this stuff was ever banned is beyond me. I feel at peace, the day after tripping, it dissociates who you are, which is often needed to solve your anxiety, kill apart of your identity that needs something. 

Anxiety is a hell of virus, itâ€™s caused more deaths and more destruction than people give credit for. Even worst than some normal diseases, people may counter that argument saying it doesnâ€™t kill people directly, but in a way it does extreme anxiety can lead to depression, which leads to suicide both of them. Anxiety makes you make bad choices which canâ€™t be taken back which leads to depression a lot of the time. Drugs though as much as thereâ€™s a stigma towards them not stuff like heroin, Ice, etc. but ones that make you dissociate and see beautiful things there great. Cause honestly if a person if 1 day away from blowing there head off, and everything else has failed, why not try it. Drugs are beautiful Iâ€™m not the typical stoner, who likes them for the sake of pleasure, but love them for there ability to change your perspective so that living in a unfair world is more bearable.
