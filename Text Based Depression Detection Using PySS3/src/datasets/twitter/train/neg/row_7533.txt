I want to go before my birthday.I turn 21 on Monday and I honestly want to die before then. There's so much to say and so much wrong that I've been holding back and not sharing that I've bottled up and it's hard to even explain now. I just feel overwhelmed with nobody to talk to anymore and my world has completely started to fall apart. I can hardly get out of bed to go to work, let alone shower or completely spill my thoughts in one box. So I just want to take all of my medicine and go to sleep before my birthday.
