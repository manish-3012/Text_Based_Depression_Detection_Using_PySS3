Found out that an acquaintance of mine is also suicidal.He casually mentioned it today when some water was spilled near a power socket, saying "I'm suicidal so might as well burn down the building". I knew he was depressed (possibly after some heartbreak) but I didn't know to this extent.

We then had a wonderful time putting more water and metal into the mains socket. It's profoundly sad that we were doing it together, with neither of us thinking this was a bad idea. Obviously I care about him and would feel terrible if he were to go, but when you constantly feel as down as each other it's hard to even bring up the topic. I don't think he knows I'm suicidal but he knows I'm at least depressed.

I'm predicting a lot of you will say this is a terrible friendship, because if one of us goes it'll only motivate the other. I want to help him though - I've never met someone who's going through what I am, and I don't want him to fall further to the depressing cycle of life that I'm in. I don't know much at all about his situation, so I need to do some listening - I've been looking at some resources.

Also, we're not "good friends" and he probably doesn't care for me, but... On the rare chance that he does stop having suicide ideation, I guess there's the slimmest hope in hell that he can reach down and pull me out of the ditch too. So this is where I'm at. I've never shared my suicidal intent with anyone before, but I'm hoping that if I share some of my experiences then he'll know he's not alone in this.

Will post updates to how it goes, wish me luck.
