Good career, possibly starting a relationship with a good girl, lost a ton of weight but I just feel fucking sadAnd I feel trapped inside my own head and like Iâ€™m gonna sabotage everything in my life because Iâ€™m so fucked up. This girl is obviously so into me but Iâ€™m so fucking insecure that I feel like sheâ€™s pulling away. I think Iâ€™m having a fucking panic attack right now. Someone please talk to me
