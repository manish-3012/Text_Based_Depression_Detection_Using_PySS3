damn, i'm just tiredThis is my first time posting here, so I apologize for my shitty writing. 
I thought that maybe if I vent out everything here, someone, somewhere can relate. I also feel bad for letting everything out to the only friend that I talk to. I'm writing this because I failed three midterms last week that I studied for and I'm pretty triggered with myself.
I'm 20 years old and I feel like I'm drowning all the time. I feel dumber than everyone else, and the only reason why I even made it to college was because I cheated off my "friend" for the last two years of highschool, and she was unbelievably smart. Always sat next to her in class and copied off her tests. She found out and hated the shit out of me along with other people, but I deserved that. I cheated on my SATs too. I really don't fucking belong in school right now. I'm lazy as shit and don't really care about anything. I **know** that I'll always be useless and never contribute to society because I've never done anything like that in my entire life. I have no aspirations at all, and I don't even feel like becoming anything. I don't even know anything either. The only things that I'm familiar with are a couple games that I play and anime. When someone strikes up a conversation about hip-hop or NBA, I'm completely lost. I just have no interest in what is considered popular. I've only watched popular shows like breaking bad because everyone that I knew watched it, and to not feel left out of conversations I forced myself to watch that shit. 

I feel like talking to people is really boring. But that's mainly my fault. I'm not social at all, and whenever I come across someone that I kind of know, I will definitely try my best to avoid him/her. This is mainly because I'm not familiar with politics or other mediums of popular culture, so it's difficult to find things to talk about. The only friends that I make are the ones who like anime and games. Pretty pathetic if you ask me. My whole family is filled with geniuses and successful people. All of my cousins have gone to excellent schools like harvard and stanford, they're working at google and other great companies, and they're just amazing. I'm the black sheep of the family, and I think I've finally accepted it. But I'm too big of a pussy to kill myself, so I'm just stuck being me. I'm extremely unintelligent due to the fact that I never really read books as a kid, and only played games. I read like a fucking retard, and my writing is horrible. I get discouraged *so* easily. The only things that I consider myself decent at are games and math. I'm not even good at them either. I know people who are excellent at both games AND math, AND they have social lives and are up to date with popular culture and have amazing relationships with their families and everything is just peachy keen for them. They're also fit and good-looking. I wear **baaaarely** prescription glasses and begged my mom to get my some because I hated the way I look (of course I didn't tell her that). And I still hate the way I look. I look like a fucking 6 foot baby with skinny ass legs and skinny ass arms, but with a beer belly. What the fuck kind of a physique is that? I'm 20 years old and still have never gone out with anyone. I haven't kissed anyone on the lips even. Sex is alien to me except for all the porn that I watch. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna die a kiss-less virgin, because I'm weak both mentally and physically. I hate hearing my voice too, it's so awkwardly deep.
When I was in highschool, I had a severe case of scoliosis. I looked like a fucking monster and I couldn't even sleep at night because of how uncomfortable it was. I finally got the surgery to fix my spine after high-school, and while it did improve the curvature of my spine, it still feels really uncomfortable, but at least I don't look like a creature anymore. 
But the biggest thing here is that I'm extremely unintelligent. I know that I'm unintelligent, and no one can tell me otherwise. I did say that I cheated all the time in high-school, but for tests that I **do** decide to study on my own, I always fail. I'm in my junior year of college and still haven't done anything. Haven't partied or gone to clubs or anything. I just played super smash brothers, and I'm god awful at that game too. For the first two years I was a biology major/premed because I thought I liked science. I thought that maybe if I do something that I like to do then I would succeed at it. I was soooooo wrong. By the end of my sophomore year, I ended with a 2.7gpa. Now I'm barely passing. I decided to switch to computer science on a whim because I couldn't take failing anymore, and tricked myself into thinking that I liked it. I was wrong again. I failed these last three midterms soo hard and there's honestly no excuse. I'm just outright dumb, because I've spent so many hours talking to tutors and getting help with things that I've had trouble with, and still don't understand it even with all of that. I was born unintelligent, and I know for a fact that people are just smarter. I'm pretty sure my parents think of me as a failure, but it's okay because their other two children, my brother and sister, certainly succeeded in life (both have jobs and are completely independent). I'm still a baby. I still feel like I'm five, and I haven't matured a bit. I also don't like my dad. He's not as bad as other fathers that I've heard about, but he's still a fucking asshole and almost fucked our whole family over by gambling all of our money away. He makes fun of me alllll the fucking time for not knowing facts about the Beatles or who Larry Byrd is. I don't even know who he is, I haven't really had the chance to talk to him. The only good thing about him is that he didn't beat my ass as a kid, but he certainly said things that hurt me, and he doesn't even know it. I didn't really have a father figure in my life, so I grew up to be a giant pussy. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is that I'm just a pussy. I feel so empty, and I am so empty as a person. Other people are so sophisticated that it blows my mind. I can't think of anything good out of myself other than the fact that I am a selfish asshole who gets by in life by cheating. However, I will kill myself one day, but I still need to figure out how I'm going to do that. I'm never gonna be useful to anyone, and I'll only end up being a burden to the rest of my family. I also don't feel like that I owe anyone anything, not even my mom. She's the one who provided so much and recently I've realized that, but I'm not even grateful. I can *say* that I'm grateful, but I'll never mean it because I honestly don't care. I don't mean that in a sarcastic or rude manner, I actually mean that I don't care that she's provided for me. I have zero social skills and zero life skills, and I don't really wanna improve at all as a person because there is no reason to. The world will go on without me. Pretty sure that's every reason I need to do kill myself. I'll never have any ambition to become anything in life. Other people have it so much worse than I do, but I'm so selfish that I don't even care about that. I'm honestly not needed at all by anyone at all and sure when I die some people will feel bad for a day or two but then that's it. I already feel nonexistent in social situations anyway. Whenever I go to visit family and we're all hanging out with cousins, I never say anything at all. They all seem like they're having a good time and I'm not really a part of it. 
Man, I'm a fucking little baby LOL, but wallowing in my own depression is something that I'm addicted too, and that doesn't really need to change because I don't feel like it either. I **need** to die so that other people won't be bothered by my existence anymore. I can go on and on and on and on, but I think I'm done venting for now. Thanks to whoever reads this, I feel like a journal wouldn't suffice. Maybe I should talk to a counselor.
I still can't drive either.
