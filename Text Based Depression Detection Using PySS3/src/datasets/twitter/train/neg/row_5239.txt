Hate everything about myselfI am hideous and stupid. I want to go away forever. I can't stand people looking at me, can't stand being seen by others. And I am getting so much worse: getting uglier, getting dumber, getting lazier, losing whatever hopes I used to have about getting my shit together. So much would have to change in order for me to feel that life was tolerable. I want to jump out of my skin. No one is ever going to want to be with me, because I am profoundly unattractive, and I have no other appealing qualities. No one has ever expressed attraction to me, and no one ever will. As sad as that makes me, the thought of actually physically being with another person makes me want to vomit. No one wants to touch me, and I don't want to touch anyone, so there's nothing to be done. I will be this way for the rest of my short pathetic life. So I'm going to stay in my room alone until I get so numb I don't even miss anything anymore.
