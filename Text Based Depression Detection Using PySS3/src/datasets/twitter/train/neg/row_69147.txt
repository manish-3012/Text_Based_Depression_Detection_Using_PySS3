Grrrr...Fought suicidal thoughts all day and was pretty successful...they stayed pretty quiet for me.

Now that it is late and bedtime...they are rearing their ugly head and even the beer isn't helping. 

I can hold them off only because I am way too intoxicated to even attempt right now.

Just got told by someone who is an ADMITTED alcoholic that I, too, have that disease for sure. I cried over that. I still think I could stop whenever I want, but I don't want to at the moment because it shuts the thoughts up.

Good night, SW.
