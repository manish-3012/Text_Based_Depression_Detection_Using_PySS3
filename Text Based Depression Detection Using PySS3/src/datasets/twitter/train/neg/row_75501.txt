I canâ€™t fucking take itIâ€™ve cried for HOURS today, even at work with my mom and all my mom had to say was â€œNow youâ€™re going to go and cry?â€ while sighing. She doesnâ€™t want to be fucking embarrassed because iâ€™m crying and didnâ€™t even care. I felt so nauseous that I threw up like twenty minutes ago from all the crying. My moms just in bed not giving a flying fuck while listening to me throw up.
