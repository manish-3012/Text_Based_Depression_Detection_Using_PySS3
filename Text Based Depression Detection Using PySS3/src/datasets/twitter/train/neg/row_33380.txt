Iâ€™m writing this with a noose around my neckThe only reason I came here is because I am afraid. Not of death but of the pain. My mom constantly screams at me, Iâ€™m autistic (aspergers), and my dad left last year. I am 15 years old and failing all of my classes. My mom also just took my tv that I paid for so I threw water on her that I was holding. She threatened to call the police on me for assault. I am now lying in bed with a noose around my neck. I am going asleep with it around in the hopes I wonâ€™t wake up in the morning. Please convince me otherwise. My brother now fears for his life because of me also because when I get mad I scream and he thinks Iâ€™m going to hurt him ( heâ€™s 10 years old ).
