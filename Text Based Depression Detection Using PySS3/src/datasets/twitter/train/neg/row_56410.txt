Received death threatsI'm not suicidal, quite the opposite. Posting here since I couldn't find an active subreddit relating to this.

Anyways, early today. I visited a website where everyone posted anonymously without any user account system. I decided to make a thread regarding anti-jokes, and I guess it pissed someone off. They replied to my thread saying, "[first name], I'm going to kill you soon". It was odd since everyone on there is anonymous, so I assumed that I had a keylogger or rat. So, I downloaded a bunch of scanners. I even did all the command prompt stuff seeing where traffic was outflowing. I didn't find anything that was wrong or even remotely suspicious. So, I reformatted my computer out of panic once the person decided to post it again (without my last name). If they were able to get into my computer, I'm pretty certain they would know my last name. When I went back to the thread for evidence, it was 404'd. So, I lost any type of evidence I had. 

After a few hours, I remembered that I knew someone that I used to talk to regularly who bragged about going onto deep web and going to the assassination market. I reformatted my computer, since I talk to this person.  The person doesn't even know my real name or location too, I have doubts it's this person. But, it doesn't make my anxiety any easier.

Nothing weird has happened since this. If it was a troll who got lucky with the name, 10/10 to him/her. But, this was a bit overkill. I am afraid of telling my parents about this, because if they called the police and they dig deep into this. The fact I had contact with someone who is dangerous might ruin the chance of me ever getting a security clearance and it could put my parents' at risk.

I cannot sleep due to this. I have multiple knives in my pocket with a sword and bat next to my bed.
