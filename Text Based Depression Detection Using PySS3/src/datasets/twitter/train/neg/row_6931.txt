Changed my mind - ending it todayI've posted here before (like anyone remembers) saying I was suicidal but wasn't going to kill myself yet. Things have changed; I'm doing it later today. I've had enough of being worthless and burdening others. I'm done. I don't really WANT to kill myself, but I really have no alternative at this point.
Don't bother telling me to talk to someone - those emergency numbers and helplines are for people who are worth saving.
