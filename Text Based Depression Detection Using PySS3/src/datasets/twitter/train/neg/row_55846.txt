Thank you everyone who helps.So Iâ€™m not exactly sure if this type of post is allowed but I guess Iâ€™ll see.    Last night I posted something similar to most people and I got multiple responses from people willing to talk to me. I can honestly say that I was able to go to sleep without crying and hating myself because of these people. Throughout talking to these people I was going through this subreddits post history and I saw a multitude of people who comment on almost every post and always try to help in the best way they can.  I just want to say thank you to these people, they are the ones who donâ€™t mind taking time out of their day to help. I canâ€™t speak for everyone when I say this but I feel as though if I ever feel the need to post something on here again I will much more willing because Iâ€™ll know someone somewhere will be listening to me and will be willing to help.     

TLDR: Thanks to all the people on this subreddit who take time out of their day to help others here.
