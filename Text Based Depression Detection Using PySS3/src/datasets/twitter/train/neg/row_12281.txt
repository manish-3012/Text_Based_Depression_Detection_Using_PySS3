Need to kill myselfIâ€™ve never thought about doing it. Iâ€™ve been incredibly stressed and overwhelmed lately and honestly I just donâ€™t think I can keep going through with this. Idk if I should or should not. Iâ€™m too stressed to do anything. I donâ€™t have the funds to keep going to school. Iâ€™ve kept everything bottled up inside but thereâ€™s only so much I can take. I donâ€™t know what to feel or who to tell I never been in a similar situation. I need to kill myself today.
