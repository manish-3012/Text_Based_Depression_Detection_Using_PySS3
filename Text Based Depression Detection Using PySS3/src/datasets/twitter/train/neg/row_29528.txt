I probably will throw myself off a 5th floorIm really sorry for write this... But...

Im so stressed so harmed right now, ...academic, social, familiar, mentally and physically... Im tired

And sincerely... Im really... Really considering, throw myself from the 5th floor of one of the buildings of my college next week...

I usually think things like that... But this idea is different... I dont know why, but i feel relieved, and in someway it seems like a great idea... It feel so... Good...

But at the same time... Im scared because... It seems so... Real...

Im so sorry... I dont know what to do....
