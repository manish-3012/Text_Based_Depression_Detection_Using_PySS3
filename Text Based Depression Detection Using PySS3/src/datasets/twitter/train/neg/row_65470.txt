Please stop telling me it will be okay.Today I've learned that my credit is too poor to apply for a student loan for living expenses this school year. I'm a full time grad student and I work full time as well, but I don't get enough hours at work to make rent and bills every month without a student loan. I don't know what to do. I only have a few months until I graduate my program, but without this loan, I might not have a place to live for spring semester. 

My mom and fiance have both told me today that it's going to be okay, but it just felt like they were both trying to soothe me. I'm living several states over from them while I'm in school, so I feel alone all the time. I can't ask either of them to help with my rent as it's so much money and they're both struggling with their own bills. 

It's not just my financial situation that's making me consider suicideâ€”I've been battling with depression for the past decade now. This won't be my first suicide attempt, but I'm hoping it will be my last. I know it's selfish of me, especially when I promised my fiance I would never leave him, but I'm so tired of everything. Life, depression, anxiety, and hearing from everyone that it will be okay. Stop lying to me. I've been waiting for it to become okay and it's only become worse and worse. Please just let me go. 

Thanks for reading.
