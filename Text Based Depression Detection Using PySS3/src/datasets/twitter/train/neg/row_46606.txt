Iâ€™m tired of living life so others wonâ€™t get sad, instead of because I actually enjoy it.So sick of living life for others when others even wouldnâ€™t be that sad if I go. I hate life - I hate that Iâ€™ll never have been born a girl and I have to go through years that feel like decades of changes to get something resembling what I should have been born with, I hate that Iâ€™ll never achieve anything, I hate that Iâ€™ll always be alone and ignored and have friends that prefer their other friends to me. I hope when I get COVID it kills me so at least I wouldnâ€™t be remembered as a suicide victim but I probably would be â€˜â€™â€™luckyâ€™â€™â€™ enough to be asymptomatic. I donâ€™t know why I donâ€™t just put myself out of my misery and kill myself
