Doing it out of spite?I had a job, last spring. I was the only racial minority in a workplace full of white people. I had a company paid car and apartment. My manager was a California blonde, and my roommate/coworker a brunette with green eyes. Those bitches scapegoated me and always bombarded me with â€œwe donâ€™t like your workâ€ no matter how hard I tried. And would always say it with a â€œteeheeâ€ kind of air not uncommon in basic white girls. Clients also scapegoated me. I couldnâ€™t play the race card. No outright racist remarks were made. Despite this, it was better than living at home. And I begged to stay. But was fired. 

I wanted to hurt myself in the following months of unemployment. To make them guilty. To haunt them. But my therapist said it wouldnâ€™t work. That even if they did face a lawsuit, based on my note, they could play the â€œshe had a historyâ€ edge. That my parents would get any possible lawsuit money. And there would be no guarantee that those two would feel bad.
