I want to go.I don't wanna go home per se- I have no home, never have. I don't know such concept. I wanna go to sleep. Sleep is more like home to me. Death is like sleep. I want to leave. I want to go. Not home. I wanna go to death. That's my home. This world...so wretched. So jagged. How could anyone ever find a home here? How could I ever find one here?
