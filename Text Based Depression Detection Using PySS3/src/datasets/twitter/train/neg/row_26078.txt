How to help someone with suicidal thoughts?My new friend has mentioned that she wants to die. First of all, is it selfish for me to want her to live? All things considered, she is having an extremely rough time right now, so its understandable that she would want to die, and me wanting hee to stay alive is just making her continue yo suffer. Second of all, she feels that in the afterlife things will work out for her. How can I explain to her that she should stay alive and not try to go to some 'afterlife'?
