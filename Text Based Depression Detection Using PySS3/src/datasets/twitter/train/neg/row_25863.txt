Cycles of Anxiety. I just don't want to be me anymore.I don't know where to begin. Nothing is how I wanted it in my life, I'm in a 5 year relationship with a guy who has no interest in sex. I put up with it for so long but I recently broke down and cheated on him. I absolutely hate myself, mostly for not being able to break up with him because neither of us can afford to move out of our lease. 
Then a few days later....the worst happened, and I can't help but blame myself. I was drinking at a friend's house, and was apparently sexually assaulted..I went to bed in my friend's room and woke up in her (guy) roommates room sore all over with a hickey. He says I came into his room and started it.... I find him repulsive and can't imagine I would do that but I was so drunk I can't prove anything..  

I feel so different about the first consensual encounter and the second non consensual one. The second one makes my skin crawl, it makes me want to cry every time I think about it. He's so gross. First he tried to say nothing happened but I got mad because I knew he was lying and he finally told me. He said quote "it was like having sex with a dead body"
This is the second time something like this has happened in 2 years, and I'm worried something about me screams "take advantage of me" 

I want to shed this skin that's been defiled and just start fresh. I want her roommate to feel what I feel and know how this has affected me. I want to die. I want to die and let everyone know it, because at this point they are all surprised I'm alive anyway. (My mom tells me "she's so glad I didn't kill myself back then, I would have missed my sisters weddding") 

I have so many messed up sexual feelings. I don't want anybody to touch me, but I feel so sexually frustrated. I don't want to bang randoms and my boyfriend doesn't want to bang me and I'm goddamn cute. What the fuck. 

I'm sorry this is so incoherent, I guess it's just my stream of thought. Thanks for the rant.
