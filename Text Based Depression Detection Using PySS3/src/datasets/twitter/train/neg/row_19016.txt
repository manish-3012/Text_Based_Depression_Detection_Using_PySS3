Life isnt for me ...I am just tired of life. Everyone hates me, I'm good for nothing, all I do is wrong. I have no hope of anything. This world is lost, is just a torture being so miserable. ðŸ˜”. Theres nothing for me here. I dont have the courage to take my own life, I fear God in condeming me then to leave this hell to go 
 to another. I dont have anything, or no-one. Im alone,  cant keep friends, I keep my familly away im just i dont know... Just feel like i dont belong.
