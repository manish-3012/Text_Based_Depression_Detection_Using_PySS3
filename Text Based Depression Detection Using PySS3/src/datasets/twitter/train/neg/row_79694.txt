We live in a world where the predators will always winItâ€™s survival of the fittest. Natural selection. Weâ€™re all a bunch of evolved bacteria that have managed to develop sentience and itâ€™s all chaotic and meaningless. We like to come up with religion because it gives us a sense of meaning order and control but itâ€™s all just delusions. Lately Iâ€™m starting to see therapy and â€œtrying to get betterâ€ in a similar light. Itâ€™s all just lies we tell ourselves. Hope, faith shit like that, it all gets religious eventually and positive thinking is exactly the same. â€œJust keep on fighting, think positive, it will all pass, meditation, exercise, gratitude, hobbies bla bla bla bla....â€ 

I donâ€™t think we actually get better. I think weâ€™re all flawed as nature is flawed. Weâ€™re like broken toys that weâ€™re built broken with the purpose to suffer. But the worst part is that we lie to ourselves with any and every opportunity we get about what our reality really is. And itâ€™s all stupid.
