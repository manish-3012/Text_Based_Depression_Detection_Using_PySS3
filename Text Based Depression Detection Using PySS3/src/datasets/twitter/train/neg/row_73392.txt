After 6 weeks meeting psychiatrist I feel worse than everTried different antidepressants. Either they make it worse, or they make it worse plus ridiculous side effects or they doing absolute nothing.

  


Now I feel so bad, it's somehow even funny. I thought I reached already the most worst. But guess what, there is no limit.

  


Apart from antidepressants I got Xanax, zolpidem and lorazepam. Not sure anymore which combination of that shit gives me at least a little relief. In the best Case I get tired and can sleep a few hours. But then when I wake up. Wow. Amazing. Anxiety in full force.

  


I wonder for what is good to feel that bad. Wtf is wrong with my mind?

  


I guess it was just another bad decision to start a therapy. Actually it's amazing how many bad decisions one (me) can do in a row. It's completely against any rules of probability. Whatever I do, it gets worse. But it's OK. A statistically outlier.
