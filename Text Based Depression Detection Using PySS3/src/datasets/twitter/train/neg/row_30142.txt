I don't know if i can stop at this point.I cut. a lot. Its gotten worse over the months, probably started in early February when quarantine hit Utah and schools became online. i never was much of a talker, i have a few friends here and there but not many. i don't do dating, my mental heath wasn't great to begin with so i didn't want to get rejected because i was the quiet kid. I was fine before the panic of COVID-19 started, and a couple weeks after it started i got depressed. Like i said, I wasn't social, so what was the problem? my theory is a lot of shit happening in two weeks that pushed me over the edge. My father isn't the nicest, not abusve, physically, but mentally. I didn't have high esteem to born with, I was never told to be proud of what i've done so i wasn't. My dad and my mom got divorced on Christmas, they thought it was a good idea to tell me, my brother, and my sister (both younger than me) after opening out presents and i was 13 thinking, "why wouldn't they tell me first?" but my mom said it was for the best. The next thing was two weeks after Covid was my grandpa died when his heart went out. it didn't really hit me until a week later, when i started cutting. I always loathed going to my fathers because every day i would be yelled at for messing something up. he has this thing where he thinks that if he yells, it get to my head better. it doesn't. he's also a reason why i started cutting. thats all for right now, im tired and just want to sleep, I will edit this if someone really does care to add more
