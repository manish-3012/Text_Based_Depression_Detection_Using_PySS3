I feel suicidalI haven't felt quite like this in a minute. Ive been going through a lot in the last few weeks and just came off of my medication, and i'm feeling it. My BPD symptoms are back with a vengeance and im having a really hard time even making it through the day. I feel beyond overwhelmed by everything going on and how i'm feeling, but I dont feel like I can tell anyone. I dont know how. I just stay really high to try and tone down my thoughts, but sometimes its not enough. Im sleeping a lot. I started cutting myself again. It helps but I feel like i'm just digging my hole deeper. 

I just feel like no one cares about me. I feel like I can't connect with anyone anymore. I try to make meaningful relationships and I fail. I feel like such an annoyance to everyone, and a burden to anyone who gets involved with me emotionally. I am so desperate and vulnerable that it disgusts me. I feel embarrassed and ashamed to even exist. I wish I could die. Ive been on the verge of tears for days, and pretty much unable to make eye contact with anyone I know. Its been absolutely horrible. Thanks for reading my post.
