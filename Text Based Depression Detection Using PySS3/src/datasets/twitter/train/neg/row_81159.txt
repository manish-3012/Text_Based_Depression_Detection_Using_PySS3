Need motivation to clean before the endI don't want to leave behind a bunch of crap when I'm gone. My family had to spend three straight months selling my grandmother's stuff. I'm not putting my family through that again.

I bought some crap in what you could call a fit of shopping therapy, back when I didn't realize I eventually become this suicidal. Unfortunately, what I bought was obscure, rare stuff I can't just dump in the Goodwill. I went to sell it and leave behind money people can actually use.

The thought of putting the energy into eBay listings and wait extended periods of times to finalize the sales makes me ill. And there are several items. I just want this to be over with. I barely have the energy to make this post.
