Please just end my sufferingI just want all of this pain in my body and mind to just stop. It just seems like the only way is to end my life but I just canâ€™t bring myself to doing it. The pain of doing it first of all is a deterrent as I know no matter how I do it itâ€™ll either be long and tortuous or just straight up agonizing. I do want to love but not like this, not like this at all.

I feel separated from all of my friends. I donâ€™t have the most amazing relationship with my family. My boyfriend seems to just be getting more and more fed up with me. I donâ€™t feel desired by anyone, not even myself. I canâ€™t even look at myself without feeling guilt and shame. I hate the way that I am. Physically and mentally, it is all disgusting and horrible.

For years Iâ€™ve felt like this. Iâ€™ve felt so isolated. I have trouble telling anyone about what is going on inside my head. Those who I have told treat me differently like they did before. They either ignore the issue and distant themselves or coddle me, trying to â€œfix the brokenâ€. Itâ€™s so dehumanizing.

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore

Iâ€™m so lost

Please just end my suffering
