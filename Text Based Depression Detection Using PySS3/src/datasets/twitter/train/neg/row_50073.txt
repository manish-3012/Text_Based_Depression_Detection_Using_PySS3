I'm 24, painfully lonely, fat, and I really want to take the gun from under my bed and be done with it.I'm not gonna sit here and bore anyone with my entire life story. Just trust me when I say it's been shitty to the point where I honestly, truly wish I'd been aborted or never concieved.

This latest desire to kill myself came from the mirror at the gym today, and reddit, of all places.

I decided to try and lose weight this year and I've lost about 60lbs. Even with 60lbs gone I look like utter shit. I looked up and accidently saw my reflection on the gym wall and I just had to leave.

I'll never have a nice body. I'll never like the way I look. That's a small thing but I'll never be able to get it. I came to reddit on my other account before I deactivated it to ask people for advice on the fitness subreddits. 

And I can tell you that reddit fitness community is full of cruel, smug bullies.

It's just, I'm so tired of always getting shit from everybody. I'm tired of being the punching bag and the butt of the joke. I'm tired of crying and being alone. I'm tired of fake friends. 

I mean for Christ's sake I only wanted to ask a fitness question on a fitness messaging board and I still got rejected/shit on.

I know it's a small thing, but there's a certain point when you just can't take anymore. There's a certain point where you just can't do it anymore.

I wish just one person understood how I feel and how much I hurt. I wish I had someone in this life. One friend. One person who really cares. 

At the end of it, all I wanted was to earn a nice looking body. I got the good diet and the gym membership and I've been dedicated.

I'm rambling. Fuck I hate life.
