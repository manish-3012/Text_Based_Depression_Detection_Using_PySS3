The black fog is returningI typed out a long thing but I decided there's no point.  Instead I think I will just write my honest innermost feelings.

I'm tired of feeling lonely.  I'm in a terrible relationship but I'm stuck in it.  There's no way out.  I have no choice but to suffer through the yelling, screaming, being treated like dirt.  I just want to love and be loved.  I want to actually look forward to coming home after work every day.  I want to spoil and be spoiled in return without being told that it's not good enough.  I'm tired of listening to the complaining all day every day.  I get it, you're miserable and I'm mostly to blame.

Like I said I could write a book about it but there's no point.  I'm tired of the empty feeling in my chest and the stabbing feeling in my stomach.  I know that what I'm feeling is real and I'm tired of trying to explain to myself that it's not my fault.  There's always that voice in my head that tells me that she treats me like dirt because logically I did something to truly deserve it.  After years of it I'm finally beginning to believe that it might not be true.  I only wish I had friends but she cut me off from the few that I had long ago.

The thought just occurred to me that I have the rest of my life to feel like this, and the stabbing feeling came again.  

No more justification.  I only have my honest feelings.  I want emotional and physical intimacy.  I crave the give and receive nature of a normal relationship.  The effort of closing the gap between each other, even if it does involve occasional disagreement.  At least the disagreement doesn't always have to end with me apologizing and being berated every single time.  

I'm tired of feeling lonely.  I can't go on like this but I don't know what else I can do.
