i lost another one of my friendsi was having a bad day so i just decided iâ€™d make all my friends hate me and it worked! at least for one. they didnâ€™t even send a last picture of their catðŸ˜” i feel like if i donâ€™t kill my self itâ€™s a waste of losing them. they were really nice to me, i just ruined everything.
also i wish i could just throw my phone out,
all it does is make me sad and distract me at the same time
