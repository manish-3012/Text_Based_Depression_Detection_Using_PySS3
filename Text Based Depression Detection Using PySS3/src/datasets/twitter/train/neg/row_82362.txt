this world is not for meevery time night comes and Iâ€™m trying to go to sleep thoughts start to fill my head and Iâ€™ve just come to the conclusion that this world isnâ€™t where I should be. thereâ€™s too much love in my heart but I constantly only feel wanted for physical pleasure and Iâ€™m tired of existing as a person full of love who is not wanted for it. constantly being replaced by someone else and it sucks to think about how much effort I put in to people to make them feel loved and cared for only for them to say itâ€™s not enough. truly wish I could give up on love but my heart is stupid and throws itself into situations where I get taken advantage of. tired of being mistreated and forgotten. when will life ever get better?
