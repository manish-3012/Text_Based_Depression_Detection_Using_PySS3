Just need to vent a littleSuicide has been on my mind a lot. It seems so easy. The world is a cruel place, I don't envision it getting much better. My life sucks right now, and it probably will for a long time. To other people I'm always loud and smiling and laughing but inside I feel like I'm living a lie. My parents, well they are not good people. Not abusive, but my mom is a bipolar bitch and my dad is a lazy douchebag. My stepdad is just an asshole. My friends, most of them are pretty fake to me. None of them really know me and I have no intention of opening up. I feel pretty unmotivated about doing anything, schoolwork seems more like a waste of time than anything else these days. The only thing that truly keeps me from ending it all, when things get really bad and I'm laying in bed in a huge bout of depression (it is on and off, sometimes it gets to me hard) is willpower/insanity? There's always a voice in my head scolding me about being weak and selfish. How dare I allow the cruel thing that is life to defeat me? Am I so selfish as to not even consider the effect it would have an the people around me, even if I don't like them? It brings me right out of it for a while. But lately it seems like that voice is getting weaker and weaker, while dark thoughts are getting more and more desirable. I don't know why I'm posting, I don't feel as if I'm in any immediate danger of killing myself. I guess I just needed to get this shit off my chest
