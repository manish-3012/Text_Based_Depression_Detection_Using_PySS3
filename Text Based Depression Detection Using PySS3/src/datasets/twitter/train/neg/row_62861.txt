ive got a lot of reasons not to kill myself but i sure still want toi struggle a lot with being hyperempathetic, and i havent been able to go through with suicide because of guilt over the people it would hurt. i only have a job because the guy who had it before me killed himself, and itd be shitty to put the other 3 people at the company through that again. i dont want to die still living in in my moms basement in utah.  my cat would  get sad. there are a couple of tv shows i want to see the end of.  i already got kidnapped &amp; dropped off the face of the earth once when i was 16, and everyone just thought i was dead, i dont want everyone to have to find out im gone again.

but, fuck, the ptsd and psychosis keep me up all night, and i'm so tired, all the time. i'm obese and lazy and  terrible at my job and my mom openly hates me. i'm transgender. i'm dissociated constantly. i'm an addict. i'm autistic. i have these fucking meltdowns where i hit and scratch myself uncontrollably because i get so frustrated. i burn myself severely at least once a week.

ii was in residential psychiatric treatment for a year and a half, by the way. so its not like i just need therapy. it's bigger than that. it's bigger than me.
