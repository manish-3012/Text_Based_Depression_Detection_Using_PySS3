My life just won't get betterI have always been a bit of an outcast, not academic, not popular or funny, I left school at this year when I finished college and made the decision not to go to uni because I didn't think I would have coped, I tried to open up to a couple of people I thought were friends this year about how i have been feeling and thinking about ending my life, they didn't really talk to be again after that, i really hate the person i am. I have tried to fix parts of my life that bother me like I have read on here like my job, i have just transferred from an abusive employment and am still getting shit from the employees and im starting to really think its me not them. I can't find nevermind hold down a relationship even though all i want in life is someone who i can love and be with but im starting to think that won't happen just because of the person i am, i have had been getting relief from spending my small amount of my fee time in bed thinking how i can end my own life and just be done with it, my only worry is that death wont be any better and that I will bottle it and look like a fool. I just don't know what do do anymore, after four years of feeling like this i just want it to be done._x000D__x000D_Sorry for posting something so long but i just don't have anyone to talk to.
