Lost my job and maybe also my apartmentWhile I am not suicidal I am very very sad at the moment. I just started a new job 2 weeks ago at Abercrombie and Fitch, it was my first real job ever. I am studying economics and one week after I started the job I had to write two important exams at university.
I decided that since this is my future and I really like my studies that I had to skip work to focus on learning and that I still have like $30k in cash in my bank account.

I was so embarrassed that I couldn't keep up with my job and my university that I didn't even call them, I just didn't showed up to my shift. Of course this week I called them, explained it and they told me to come to file my resignation letter. It was really a cool job with a lot of nice girls and boys in my age and I really regret my decision.

At the same time last week my two female roommates decided that they want to leave our commune, we are a total of 4. The two girls and another guy. A friend of them told me, and I couldn't believe it. When I wrote them a message they just played it down that they only think about it, and aren't sure.

So I am pretty sad, I could lie down and cry. I haven't eaten anything today and it is already 20:00.
