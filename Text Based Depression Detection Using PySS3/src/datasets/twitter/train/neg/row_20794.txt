Iâ€™ve been feeling good recently (long and rambly)This post might be pointless or redundant but I just feel like writing and chronicling this moment. While I donâ€™t have diagnosisâ€™s or anything else of the sort to prove anything, I can confidently say that Iâ€™ve been quite seriously suicidal for the last four years (although Iâ€™ve experienced suicidal urges of lesser extents since 2009 or so). This has not changed at all and I honestly donâ€™t see myself living past 25. But as soon as my Uni break started two weeks ago, Iâ€™ve been an on absolute high.

Typically Iâ€™d go through depressive and/or suicidal episodes every other day, sometimes daily. I havenâ€™t had a single thought like that this entire break though. Considering that my suicidal tendencies follow me all year round and arenâ€™t triggered by any specific root (as far as Iâ€™m aware...), Iâ€™m just pleasantly surprised. All of the things that bring me down and make me worthless are still very much intact and I realise thereâ€™s no sign of them changing. Maybe Iâ€™ve just successfully distracted myself from them at this point?

Whatever has happened seems to have done me some good though. Iâ€™ve been much more positive lately and I can notice the change it has had on my day-to-day life. I am speaking much more fluently (even though Iâ€™m still a social anxiety ridden mess) and have been much sharper with things like my critical thinking and even joke making.  When I chatted to my parents or on the few times I hung around with my friends it just felt like I knew exactly what to say, which is something Iâ€™ve been trying to crack for a long time. Normally when Iâ€™m out with my friends (whether it be in private with a few close friends or something more public involving a lot of mutual) I undergo a depressive bout half an hour or so into whatever weâ€™re doing and it stays with me until I go to sleep. For whatever reason though, I havenâ€™t had this feeling all fortnight even after being in situations that wouldâ€™ve easily caused this two or three times. I genuinely enjoyed myself every time I went out.

Iâ€™ve also been really dedicated to my hobbies and am seeing the results to back it up. My favourite past times are performative and depend on building skills to succeed. I would usually get very upset over underperforming and it would sometimes trigger a depressive episode which would then spiral down into the track of suicidal ideation. But I havenâ€™t been bothered nearly as much by failure or messing up in this time which has giving me much more drive to continue to practice even when a certain task is impossible. It makes me feel accomplished and worthy actually seeing results for all the time Iâ€™m spending doing the things that I love the most.

This post is definitely not structured at all and is basically a diary entry for me, but I had to write this down. Iâ€™m just confused why this has happened and Iâ€™m scared that itâ€™s gonna go away (probably tomorrow since uni is starting again). I canâ€™t recall ever going through anything like this so Iâ€™m just surprised by whatâ€™s happened. 

I want this to last forever, but I know it wonâ€™t.
