After suicide TRIGGER WARNINGI think that I and every other living being, literally, would be better off even to the smallest degree without my being here. 
I want to die, but I question the afterlife and the punishment that would come with taking my own....is that just am excuse??
If I hknestly think its for the best theni guess thats where my faith should lie and I should go with it...
But its of course a really big choice so im just trying to look from all perspectives.
