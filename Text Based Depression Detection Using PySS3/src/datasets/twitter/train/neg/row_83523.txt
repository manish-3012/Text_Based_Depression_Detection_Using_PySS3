spiraling depressionSo I have had the feeling that things will only ever get worse for me as of right not the pain is bearable but it seems like everyday is getting worse and worse. I recently picked up smoking to deal with some of it because it gives me an escape for a few minutes. Everyday I just feel myself waking up with what feels like the weight of the world and the feeling that I can hold it for know but I dont know how much longer I can.
