i just feel like shit and i dont want to anymoremy irl friends never seek me out or talk to me and the people i meet online are the same way. i always feel like have to initiate things,  people call me funny and say im fun to hang around but nobody ever hits me up first to hang out. i think im just secretly really annoying and everyone just lowkey dislikes me and nobody wants to tell it to my face. wish i could just not exist so i dont have to feel this way.
