[how to help suicidal boyfriend ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cm6frw/advice_dealing_with_my_sos_suicidal_thoughts/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

I am in another state visiting my mother who has incurable cancer, I had to leave my boyfriend at home in order to  see my mom. He has been having a hard time recently, last night he told me he made another attempt. He took  the rest of his prescription for benzodiazepines, about 15. He luckily woke up and survived, and told me about it saying he just needed someone to know and immediately regretted telling me. I am so far away I donâ€™t know what I can do. I called his sister and parents and told them everything, I feel they arenâ€™t taking this serious enough. They say they keep checking on him and he seems â€œfineâ€. Meanwhile he sounds so quiet and â€œdeadâ€ to me. They actually asked me if I think it was just for attention. He absolutely needs help, whether they think itâ€™s for â€œattentionâ€, which is not something he would do. I think he is very serious about wanting to end his suffering and I am lost. I am trying to spend whatever quality time I have with my mom and also be there and check in on him. I want to race home but I canâ€™t get another ticket or change my flight unless I borrow money from my mom. I donâ€™t really want her to worry either but Iâ€™d do anything to save him. How can I be there? Is there anything that has helped anyone here? I feel like I should call the police even though he would hate me and the family wouldnâ€™t understand. What if he ends the relationship because I call and no one is there to stop him? I am so lost! 
I contacted some close friends for the mean time to check in as much as possible, but I still donâ€™t know what to do when I get back. 
I feel like Iâ€™m losing the love of my life and my mother at the same time and doing everything wrong.
