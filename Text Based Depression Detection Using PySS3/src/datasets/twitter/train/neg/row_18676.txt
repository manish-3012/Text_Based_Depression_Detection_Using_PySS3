I hate my existing and my being in my own bodyI have no hope left in me. I have been depressed for so long I do not remember how it is to live without the constant feeling of sadness..
I barely ever smile or laugh anymore, i spend most of my time alone, i got to the stage i HATE everything about me. My existence, my memories, my ideas, my thoughts, my sense of humour... basically if i met myself i would never ever want to have anything to do with her. I am a waste of space and energy and a weight for all those who i meet. 
I am ungrateful, unhappy and uninteresting. i feel like i dont deserve to be alive also because of how unhappy i am.

How do you learn how to love someone you hate and despise?
How do you find reasons to live when you have none?
Is change even possible?
I got no hope left in me anymore

In therapy since jan. 
Medicated since 5weeks.
I am out of options and ideas.
