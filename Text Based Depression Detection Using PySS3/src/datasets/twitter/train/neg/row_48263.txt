I feel like writing suicide notes would lessen my temptation to actually kill myself.i do. i feel like it would help me cope. i don't know why, i always fantasize about it, and i feel like writing suicide notes to people would make me feel better in a sort of morbid way. like a weight off my chest. i'm constantly thinking about what i would write in the note to my dad/friend/sister/grandmother, but i never actually put it on paper. i've always wanted to. i don't plan on killing myself any time soon, but i have this unquenchable *urge* to write the notes. i'm slightly afraid someone might find them, but it's not a big concern of mine really.


i don't know why i'm posting this. what do you all think? in hindsight, would it be more damaging? i honestly feel like it would help, but i desperately want a second opinion or two. :/
