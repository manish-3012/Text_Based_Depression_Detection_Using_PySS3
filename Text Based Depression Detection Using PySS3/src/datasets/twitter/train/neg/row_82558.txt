I'm done. There's nothing more I can do.It's more affordable for me to land in the emergency room for a suicide attempt than it is to get the regular mental health care I need. 

I live in a very expensive area, where all of my friends work in big name companies making 100K+ a year. I'm barely scraping by with $15k. No health insurance, no security. I bet they pity me. I bet they think I'm a lazy, useless fuck who couldn't even finish community college while they're graduating from Stanford and Brown. Why do they even talk to me. 

I found work in an extremely competitive field, but just barely. I can't make ends meet where I am. I might be able to, if I move 6+ hours away, but when presented with this idea, my partner breaks down in tears. They can't handle the idea of up heaving their lives all over again because of me. 

My partner. We've been together almost seven years. They deserve someone so much better than me. I'm trash. I drag them down. We're so codependent, they can't see how much better their life would be without me. But I'm too selfish to dump them. 

I can't talk to my partner about this. I'll say "X" and their only response is "It's not X!" Nothing ever gets anywhere. 

I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I've been thinking about it for over ten years and I'm finally going to do it.
