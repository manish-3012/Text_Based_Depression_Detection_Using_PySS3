I'm only 21 and alone in the world.It's often said everything gets better. Everything gets better. But it hasn't. Over the last two years I've been unemployed, friendless and girlfriend-less, and my suicidal thoughts are creeping back from when I was younger.

I am pathetic, a waste of humanity, the reason for a failed marriage and bitter divorce, three time college dropout, and I am done with this world. I don't know anymore.
