I almost killed myself and now I'm shakingI run on my bike for hours, got very out of town and didn't even realize, had this plan of jumping in front of a car on the highway. Sstill seems am ok plan. don't even know why I'm writing here, I don't know what to do. I'm sitting on the dark shaking. My feet hurt I'm exhausted and just want to lay on the ground and hope for sleep
