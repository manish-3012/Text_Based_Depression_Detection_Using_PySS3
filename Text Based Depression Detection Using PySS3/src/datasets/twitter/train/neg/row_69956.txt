to those suffering after a failed suicide attempt, i feel you.helium suicide is fucking hard too 

if you have the SLIGHTEST will to live it will be terribly difficult to kill yourself 

i turned the tap on and i felt the whoosh of cold helium through the pipe as i pulled the exit bag over my head, iâ€™m pretty sure the exit bag was wrongly made and i did not pass out soon enough for me to have second thoughts 

i have wanted to die and have had suicidal ideations for 8 years, i canâ€™t believe that i couldnâ€™t kill myself.

yes, thereâ€™s lots to live for, i know. iâ€™m not here to get support or the â€œiâ€™m here for you, donâ€™t kill yourself, i care for you and iâ€™ll miss youâ€ 

its terrible for those who attempted, failed, and has to return to normal, going to school, taking exams and eating beside someone who has zero clue that you just tried to kill yourself last night. 

my heart goes out to anyone suffering alone after a failed suicide attempt. 

you may feel relief, sadness, bitter that you canâ€™t even take your own life properly, and i feel you. youâ€™re not alone. weâ€™re all out there, struggling to get day by day as a functional being after every failed suicide attempt. i stand with you, and i feel you.
