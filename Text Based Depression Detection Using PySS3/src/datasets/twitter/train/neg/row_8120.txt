How do I get help?Male in my thirties with a wife of over 10 years and I've been contemplating this for far too long. It's so bad that I don't want to have kids knowing there's a very real possibility I will leave my wife to raise them on her own. 

So, how do I get help without letting anyone know? 

I am a very private person who cares way too much about what others think about me and the thought of my employer or wife knowing I'm receiving help kills me.

Do I tell a Dr? Will I be admitted against my will? I just don't want to get pegged as a depressed suicidal unless I actually follow through. 

I live in California and I don't have kids. 

I just can't go on like this.

Where can I go?
