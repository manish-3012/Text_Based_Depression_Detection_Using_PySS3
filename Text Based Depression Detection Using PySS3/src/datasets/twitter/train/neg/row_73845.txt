I attempted suicide for the first time ever today30 minutes ago actually. I tied a belt around the door knob then around my neck and leaned forward. I didn't think it would work. But I felt fainting after 4 seconds. a few more seconds and I hallucinated my mom saying "you know those razor blades are sharp". I think it was because the only thing I could hear was the bathroom fan. I don't know why but those words made me panic. I leaned back and started freaking out. I felt like the belt was still choking me. I started puking immediately after i untied it from my neck. My heart has been pounding ever since.

Part of me feels kinda happy because now I know I can actually do it. All methods have always seemed impossible to pull off. But I didn't and pussied out. I don't wanna die but god I don't wanna wake up tomorrow and go to work! I don't know what to do or if I should try again
