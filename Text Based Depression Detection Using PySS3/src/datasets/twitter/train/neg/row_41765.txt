Every breath is excruciatingIt's so hard to describe this feeling. It's like I'm being compressed by this pressure inside me. It's mostly located in my chest and throat. Every breath I take feels like worse than death. It's not a physical pain, it's barely even an emotional pain. It's like physiological. It's every fiber of the essence of my being screaming out and being muffled into silence at the same time. I fucking hate it. It's constant. I don't even know why I feel this way, I just do. I want it to end. I want everything to end. I want the cessation of all experience forever. I want the sweet release of eternal nothingness. If only I could bring myself to killing myself, all my problems would end forever.
