I need help.I have fucked up so bad, I was in a really bad place 8 days ago. Well not only 8 days ago, just like three months but it crashed 8 days ago. I broke up with my girlfriend OVER A TEXT! What kind of idiot does that, now I deeply regret it.

 She doesn't trust me and I am trying to earn it but she still loves to make me jealous. Please don't try and say MOVE ON, because I can't.. I love her, I love her more than anything. I was so close to suicide yesterday because of what she was saying, she doesn't care if I hurt..

 She shouldn't, I fucked up so bad. It hurt the most when I was threatening suicide and all she said was "Kay." through a text, I had a knife at my throat at that point. The only thing that stopped me was knowing that I am not worth it, I don't deserve the satisfaction of death.. 

But I can not control it anymore, please just help me. I know this is so stupid but I can not change how I feel, I hope you guys understand. You are the only ones that really do.
