How can I justify living?I can't seem to justify why I should continue living. I am 25 and my 4th attempt at university is yet again, going down the shitter; I have wasted tens of thousands of dollars of my parents' money and just can't do it. My eating disorders have ruled my life for 11 years too long and my mental/physical health is in shambles. I live out of state from almost all my friends and family. The only person I can think of staying for is my SO, also out of state. He is the only thing that has kept me alive for the past year but now it's becoming a chore to even stay alive for him. My family and hometown friends will be fine, they have each other and we have dealt with suicides in the past.       
     
    
I can't validate living when almost everyday feels like torture. For me there's no light in this tunnel when there tend to only be 1-2 good days on average per week meanwhile the rest of my existence is an obligation for the comfort of others. Help me please.      

      
Edit: "good days" being not fighting that unidentifiable depression. Not sadness but real depression, like being pulled into dark abyss without knowing why you were chosen to sink into nothing for no reason.
