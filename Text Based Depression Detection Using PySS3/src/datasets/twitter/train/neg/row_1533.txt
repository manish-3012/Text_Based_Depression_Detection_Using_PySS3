I came back from the edge. I wanted to share what learned for anyone still out there.Over the last few months I got caught up in a bad situation - probably the worst I've been a part of. It was entirely caused by my own screw ups. It left me in gut-wrenching pain, in regret, in shame, guilt, humiliation. It ruined my life for the time. It ruined my repuatation. It took its toll on those around me. It will be a long, long time before I'm able to recover. And at a point, the pain of it all was so bad that I truly thought it would be better to leave everything behind. I imagined the relief I would feel if I wouldn't feel at all. And then I imagined the void of it all. That's the other side. There's no pain, but also no joy. There's nothing in that void. I came close to it, but got scared of jumping in. Because of the good things. Though at the time the bad things were overwhelming, I couldn't stand the thought of never having another good time again. And that's what kept me from jumping in. There's never another life. At some point, that void will come for me. I won't be able to stop it. But I want to be sure to have gotten every last drop of joy out of my life before it does.

I had my weight lifted off my shoulders lately. I feel better now than I have in a long while. So I wanted to share a few things that I've come away with, for anyone who needs to hear.

*I've been where you are. I came back. I didn't think it was possible for me to come back, but I did. It's possible for you to come back too.

*Admit it to yourself. Whatever it is that's buried inside that you don't want to hear. Admit it to yourself. Then admit it to someone you trust.

*Almost everyone wants to help you. Please just ask them. Please just ask them. Even the people you're scared of. Please just ask them for help. Ask me if you have to - I'm anonymous.

*Face your demons. They'll outrun you if you don't. Seriously, this is the big one. You must turn to face them. Don't make my mistake - don't wait to face them. Once you do, the sense of relief is greater than the sense of dread for consequences you'll face.

Right after my weight was lifted, I realized how much more I wanted to savor the good times. I started to write myself a note. I wanted something to remind me of the things I loved. But as I was thinking of the last piece, an interruption occured. I never finished the note, but I like the way it turned out:

At the end is a void, so make sure you spend this life...
