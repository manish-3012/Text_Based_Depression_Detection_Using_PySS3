Yeah, no, I feel done.I know this is pathetic and I don't expect a reply. 

Reached out to everyone I can. Tried all sorts of things. 

I just feel like nothing works. I change, no one else does. I grow up, they stay the same. 

I think I understand what owning up to the past means, but that's not good enough.   


I think I'm moving forward and growing as a person, but the past catches up.   
I just feel exhausted. Done. Spent. Tuckered out.
