tonight is the series finale of Lifeive been battling depression for lord knows how long. a year ago i found someone who helped me so much. i was good for that whole year. she left and i guess that whole year i wasny battling it on my own, it built up. she left a few weeks ago, but today found out the truth and everything and i just wanna fucking die. i give up. i dunno what i did to deserve this but i just cant deal anymore. my arms are tender, my eyes burn like a motherfucker, and i just cant do shit anymore. tonight, im downing all the pills and swishing it with all the alcohol i can find. i give up. in this series finale, the protagonist "Life" has won. it got the best of me. i wish the absolute best for you all and ik you all deserve nothing less than to be happy. hopefully i can meet some of you one day
