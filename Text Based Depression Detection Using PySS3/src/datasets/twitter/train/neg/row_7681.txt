EmptinessSo, I was with this girl, she is fun, makes me feel good and everything. The problem appeared 6 months ago after a misunderstanding, we started to go separate ways. She started seeing another guy, and, some weeks ago the guy cheated on her. I thought that would be our chance to start rebuiding what we had, she gave me hope that we could be together, but she told me we would need to wait. Finals were coming and starting it again could have been a distraction we both couldn't afford. Finals passed, and the day after it she didn't even speaked to me, she just run to the guy who cheated on her. I was angry, and told her how she made me feel, then, she told me they was seeing each other for some weeks and she didn't wanted a relationship with me. Right now I'm feeling worse than a piece of shit, I just want Nasa to hire me, so I can live in ISS and I won't be obligated to look at people's face for the rest of my life. I really don't know what to do but killing myself is one of the options I am seriously taking into account. I don't know, I just want the pain to go away and leave me here, in my bedroom, alone in the dark.
