I lost my only reason to live.girlfriend of four years left me almost three months ago and she was the only reason i tried to live at all. weve been through so much shit together and grew because of it. we made plans to live together and grow old together. the only reason she had is that we arent compatible people. and it came up suddenly one day. (see my posts in r/BreakUp)

i have a history of abuse from my blood relatives throughout my life as a child. ive wanted to die since i was 5 years old. i remember waiting for a car to just run over little me. now im 22 and seriously considering just offing myself. driving over a cliff or into oncoming traffic would be poetic as i had an interest in cars. i have no intrest in anything anymore, i am a gamer and car guy but now i dont care for either. have tried the hotline and just like many people here, its bullshit. it really does nothing for me. all i care about is my best friend. and shes gone. therapy hasnt helped either. goodbye world, i guess.
