Enough before 25?I'm 24. I came from a fucked up family but I managed to get a masters degree and a job. I wasn't passionate, just going thru the motions.

My dad is a severe alcoholic and surfers from bipolar depression. My mom is an abusive narcissist who left me to my dad's psychological abuse. I acted as a human shield to him against my younger sister. 

I fell in love with an older man when i was 19. He was 32. Because my family fucked me up he spent years leaving me slowly, pointing out all my faults. It ended officially earlier this. 

The younger sister i rescued from an abusive house is moving on with her life and I'm happy for her. when she goes away to college I will have nothing left to live for.

I've escaped my home, had a career job, lost a career to COVID19, had a love too fucked up to try and repeat... Hell, I've even raised a kid. I've checked off all my boxes. 

Does anyone else feel like they've lived multiple lives and are ready to give up? I'm so tired. I'm ready to give up.
