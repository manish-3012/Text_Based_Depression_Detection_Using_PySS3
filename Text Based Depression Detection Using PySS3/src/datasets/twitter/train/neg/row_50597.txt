Slowly coming to peace with the idea of death.I don't need to post any history. I will say that I've been seeing a therapist now for over a year and he's helped since it's a way to get my thoughts out.

But recently it's like a switch kinda flipped. I've had suicide on my mind in the past, but this time it's different. Now, for roughly the past week, it's like I get ready to go to bed and would rather just hang myself. Not in a dramatic way. I haven't been too upset about wanting it. Now it's just about waiting until I can actually do it.

My therapist have me the number to a crisis intervention center last time I saw him but I'm not sure that I'd use it anyway.

To be honest, I really have no real reason to post this. Maybe someone feeling alone can relate. I'm not sure.

Have a good one.
