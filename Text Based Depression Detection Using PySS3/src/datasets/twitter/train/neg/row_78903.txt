Itâ€™s taking everything in me not to kill myselfI havenâ€™t felt like this in so long. Iâ€™ve been sober for 19 months and all I want is to take a hundred pills. Iâ€™m so sad. Anxious. I would kill my self right now if I was home alone but my mom left my brother with me for the night. I donâ€™t know what to do. I wish I was dead. Iâ€™m sick. I canâ€™t stop crying. Someone please make all the hurt stop.
