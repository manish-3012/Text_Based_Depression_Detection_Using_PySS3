I am just empty.All there is left is a human looking shell. There is nothing left in me. No drive, no motivation, no perspective. Nothing. I don't have the power anymore to fight my inner demons. A fight that never ends. I can't just do it anymore. All i have is emptiness and disgust over what i have become. I am the only person responsible for what i am now, but so far all my tries for happiness have failed me. I don't know if there is a way to better myself anymore. There is no power left for the things to be done. No motivation because of the endless cycle of trial an error. I have never been able to lift me up. The more i tried, the more i made everything miserable. I am a fucking disgrace for humanity. I am a selfish useless piece of shit. Hate is the only emotion, but it havn't helped me to become better. I loath myself, i loath everyone around me. I suffer day for day for day. And there is nothing i tried that made anything better. I feel so hopeless i don't even care anymore about the stuff happening around me. I just want it to end.
