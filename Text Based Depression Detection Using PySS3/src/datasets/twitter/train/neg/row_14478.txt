I posted before about giving myself 2months to live...I think iv only got one now...My whole life has been pointless...until I met her I was nothing and now that iv lost her I'm nothing again and I know I won't ever get over her or ever love someone as much as I loved her...I'm trying my absolute best as changing my life and fighting to get her back because I have set my life to litteraly depend on it...I saw her this weekend and even though I though I got her back she slipped though my fingers and I won't say why but the end of march will decide if there is a future for us...Im more of venting here but iv set my mind to this and I kinda feel free knowing that I can do anything until then...I hope I can get my happiness back or else I just want to sleep...sleep and never wake up
