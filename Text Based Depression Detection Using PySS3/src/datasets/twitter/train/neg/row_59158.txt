Concerns about ER visit re: covidi should probably go to the ER because i am a little scared im going to kill myself. however, i cant get it out of my head that i will get covid while there, and while i want to die i dont want to die of covid. i also dont know if they will admit me, and i dont really want to be admitted. but then that's worse, getting covid and then going out into the world again. has anyone experienced something similar?
