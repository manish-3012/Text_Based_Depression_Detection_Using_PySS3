SuicideThe difference between barely hanging on and submitting entirely into darkness is shockingly small at just a whim of a decision to let go. 

I look at myself with hopeless despair. Like staring at a man who's foot is one too deep on a landmine. It's so noisy yet the silence of the night is unbearably deafening and seductive. The air is so still and quiet you can hear the ticking counting down to your eventual demise. 

This post is probably going to be buried amongst the sea of suicidal people sharing similar fates yet from different walks of life. 

I wonder...and I wonder...and I wonder...what the world will look like when I'm gone. It's like detonating an emotional nuclear bomb readily to wipe out those surrounding you. What a devastating and lethal experience that affects those who keep on living. At the point of choosing or not to kill myself, I have the greatest control over myself. I am consciously choosing the clearest "either or" of my life. Either live or die. Somewhat it is greatly comforting and heartwarming to know that everything in my life can fall apart except my conscious decision to decide my final outcome.
