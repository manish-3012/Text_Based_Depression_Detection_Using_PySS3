I don't want toOkay, so here's the deal up front. I don't want to die, I don't want to kill myself.

But I can't stop thinking about it.

Little stumbling blocks crop up and I find myself contemplating it, it would be so easy, just opt out of the whole struggle. I hate it, the thoughts depress me and I spend hours hating myself for thinking about it, the hate spirals into anger at the world for making me think that way (logical I know) and I wind up putting it out of mind, at least for a day or so.

But it creeps back, lurking in the back of my head. It honestly is scaring the hell out of me and I don't know what to do, I'm not sure if this is a cry for help or just me finally letting this out of my head, either way thanks for reading if you got this far through a scared messed up guy's confession.
