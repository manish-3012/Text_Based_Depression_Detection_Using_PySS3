My brother tried to kill himself todayI'm in complete disbelief right now.  One of my brothers, Steve, called me today and told me my other brother, Mike, tried to take his own life today.  

I was just on the phone with Mike last night.  Steve told me a couple weeks ago that Mike sounded down, but I wasn't able to reach him until yesterday.  Mike was talking more or less like normal.  His fiance is 8 months pregnant, so I was telling him how I'd send him some of the more expensive things he needs to help him out, since it's his first kid.  He acted so normal.  I guess he made peace with it?  

Anyway, I guess the reason I'm posting this is because I'm flying out to see him this week and would like to know if there are any good resources for me?  Mentally, I'm all there.  I just need to know what I should say to him when I see him.  He doesn't even know that I know, but I thought showing up would be a much stronger statement than a phone call.  He's in a psychiatric ward right now, so at least he's safe, which is comforting.

Thanks for your help.
