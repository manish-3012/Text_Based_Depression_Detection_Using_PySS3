I feel like an old man with 22Ironic isn't it? I am not even shure if I count as depressed.  
This should be the best time of my life, but it certainly is the worst I guess.  
I don't inherently want to die, or comit suicide.    
I don't have a massive pile of self hating.    
I just feel empty. Burned. Used.    
Everything that made me happy just feels like coping.   
Running away and hide my eyes like a little child, from the suffering life is.   
I just feel like the veil of coping was took away from me.   
Life seems so pointless. Like an audience hearing the opening of a joke, but the actual gag never drops.       
The fact, that this is all. THIS is life, and I am considered to continue for no good reason.    
I just have oje wish.     
I just want the veil back.    
I want to feel happy about the small things.    
I don't want to work 9-5 and pretend on a few days a year I am "happy" or "free" or "in control of my life".        
I don't want to get older, and continue this suffering. Like I said, I don't think I am inherently suicidal, just I don't care if a lightning would strike me right now.    
Do you remember that feeling in your tummy, when you bought yourself something you really wanted? Or get a gift from a person you love? That sweet little warm feeling?   
My only feeling switch between anger for no good reason, sadness for no good reason and numbness (maybe my body realized that no feeling is better than anger and sadness 24/7).      
I don't know why I write this.    
There is nothing you could tell me to get better.   
My problem is not a bad moment that happened a few weeks/months ago.   
My problem is life and some unchangeable parts woven deep in it.
