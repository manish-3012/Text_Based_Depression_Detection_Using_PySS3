A way to cope with the painWhen eaver you start to get those thoughts in your head quickly think why you wanna kill yourself and think of a solution for me I have no freinds my dad hates me my siblings never talk to me so i just tell my self it will get better multiple times and that's all I think about I know it's not gonna get better in a hour or a day or a week or a year but I know one day I will have freinds that love me and a girl and kids of my own so I just look forward to the future and it helps alot when I'm really bad and want to end it I walk out my house and start running saying to my self it will get better and when I'm tired I dont feel like killing my self anymore I hope this helps trust me everything gets better if you think your situation won't get better reply to my post and I'll tell you why I promise it will get better I had alot of other things that brought suicidal thoughts in my head but there better and we forget the past and always look at present but think back in your life you will realise it will get better I am not a regular person I have depression and I'm bi polor I think about killing my self every day but I do this and it helps you also have to forget about what's makei g you want to hurt yourself I play video game after I'm done telli g my self it will get better and I totally forget what was going on I hope this heals if you guys have anything els that helps please let me know
