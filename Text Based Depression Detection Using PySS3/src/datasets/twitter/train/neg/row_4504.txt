Hello there! Well gang.... It's been a good run. I don't know why I'm making a post but I guess I just want to feel a little better. I thought this might be a good place. Sorry if I offend you! So I'm going to schedule my death in a couple of weeks. It's just been so surreal. I never wanted to hurt myself and I still don't but we'll I guess it has to happen someday. I'm olay I guess.i wanna go away from everything. I want a family that would love me . I want to be happy. I want to pursue my goals. I guess I'll have to wait. It's just that when ur so determined u finally have clarity. If things don't work out my way then it's the highway or in this case highway to hellðŸ˜œ. I try to make cheeky jokes so that I don't spontaneously start crying. I'm sorry if I offended anyone. Well I guess I'll see you guys later. Have fun!
