Broke out crying in school today.First off, I'm sorry if some of this is gibberish, I'm still crying and can barely see the keyboard.

So my last post on here got ignored a few months back, but I needed to come back today. My last class in school today was a free one. I have been pretty good recently. Less thoughts on suicide and stuff, but for some reason today, it all came rushing back. I put my head down into my arms so no one would realize I was crying. (I was crying because I was thinking of killing myself). The woman who is in second charge of the school yelled at me from across the campus "Torchdexto! Put your head up!" 

I looked around and there were other kids there, so I was horrified to show my face. I let her walk away and pulled my hoodie over my head to hide my tears. Am I just crappy in judgment right now, or was it sort of stupid to tell a teenager who's sitting alone with their face obviously being hidden to show it? Isn't that how a lot of people hide the fact that they're crying? She constantly yells at kids who do this, and I bet I'm not the only one who's been crying before. 

Anyway, I want to just end it. Today. I just turned 16 on the 11th, and I really wanted to try hard to change and try to be happy, but apparently that's not happening.

I wan to just kill myself. I want it to be over. But I'm scared I'll fuck up and end up horribly scarred, or if I succeed I'll hurt my family. But damnit living hurts so much.

No one knows I feel this way. Not my mom, dad, either of my siblings, or my best friend. I'm scared they won't believe me because I'm a teenager and they'll just say it's normal. I pretend to be happy all the time, so what if they don't believe me if I tell them?  I'm too much of a coward to tell them or to end it, so I have no one to talk to, and no way out of this.

Thanks for reading.
