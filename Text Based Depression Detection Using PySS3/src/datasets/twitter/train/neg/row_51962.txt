Feel like my life got stolen from meI canâ€™t even enjoy things anymore. I was looking forward to cyberpunk 2077 ever since it got announced, pre-ordered it, and now Iâ€™ve been playing it and I barely even care. I should be all over this game, but Iâ€™m too depressed to even play and enjoy it.

It pisses me off. How my passions and hobbies are being whittled away by apathy and depression.
