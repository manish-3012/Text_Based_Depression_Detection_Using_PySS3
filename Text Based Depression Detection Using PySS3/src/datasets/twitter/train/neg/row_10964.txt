i have therapy tomorrow and i don't think i'll be honest with my therapistlast time i talked to him he literally told everything to my parents; the pills i collected, my plans, the bridge i liked sitting on, everything. i didn't even say anything suicidal, all i did was being honest with him. can't tell my parents that i don't want to go because then they will say that they payed so much for it and that i always waste their money but the therapist's place of work is 3 hours away from where i live and being stuck in the car with my parents for 3 hours sucks. plus on our way back home i'll be reminded that i'm selfish for being suicidal and that i hurt everyone. i want to end it today.
