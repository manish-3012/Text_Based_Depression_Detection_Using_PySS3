I am considering stepping in front of a train todayI am unemployed, in a lot of debt and it has all caught up to me. I am over Â£30,000 in debt and need to pay off at least Â£2500 of it today. I have tried everything to get this money and to get a job or benefits and I can't. I have let everyone down around me and lied to everyone that everything is OK. I can't keep up this pretence any more and just want to end it all.
