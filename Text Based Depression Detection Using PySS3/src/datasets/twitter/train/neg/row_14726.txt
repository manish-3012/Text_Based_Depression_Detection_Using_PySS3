So tired of everyone getting at meMy nana constantly gets at me because I don't leave my room until four in the afternoon and don't do anything, yet fails to realise that I'm not well and don't leave my room or do anything because I have no motiviation. My grandad has a go at me because I had to reset the internet router. My friends are constantly giving me shit. My parents and sister don't even talk to me. My ex is too busy with her new fucking boyfriend to even acknowledge I exist unless he's not around so she logs into my facebook to check up on me. 

Oh and my family are all annoyed with me because I don't wanna spend Christmas at my uncles. I'd rather spend it with my ex than them but that's not possible, so I'm gonna spend it alone. If I go with them I'll be sat there all miserable and they'll try getting me to cheer up, but they don't stop to think that maybe I can't be cheered up and there's no fucking way I'm gonna pretend to be happy for them. Why should I?

I'm so fucking tired. I can't deal with it anymore. Fuck this world. Fuck everyone. They're gonna be sorry when I'm gone. Really can't wait until New Years. If they understood just how much I'm hurting myself by staying here now so I don't ruin their Christmas, they might think differently about giving me grief 24/7.
