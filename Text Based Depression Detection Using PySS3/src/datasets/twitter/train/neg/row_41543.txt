Tomorrow, maybe.So, I posted a day or two ago. I'm back, I'm still keeping tomorrow as my date for now. I'm a little stuck with letters to a few people though and I was looking for a little guidance.

I've written letters to my recently ex partner and my two children but they're terrible and need to be re-written. I don't think I'm ready to leave without sorting that out.

Oddly I also wrote a letter today to a long term friend for whom I held a torch for a long time, setting out my feelings for her and brief dump of how she greatly impacted my life. This letter is excellent. I'm not even sure I should send it, she's got her life pretty sorted, is settled with a guy who makes her happy and has a new baby on the way. I don't know that I should throw a grenade like a suicide letter into that mix, if it even were a grenade, I doubt I've had the impact on her life that she's had on mine. But I've always told myself I'd let her know about it if I ever decided to check out. Thoughts?.

Also, why can I blurb all that out onto a letter for a friend but not my children or the woman I loved so whole heartedly?. Right now my letter to my ex just sounds like a very bitter person telling someone how they feel they've been hurt by them. She's already in a state herself mentally speaking I think, I'd prefer to leave her with something a little more positive. Ideas?.

Please don't try to tell me the best idea or the most positive thing I can do is not do it.

Thanks!
