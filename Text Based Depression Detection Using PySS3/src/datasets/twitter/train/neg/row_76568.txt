Friend at risk of suicide attempt/ serious mental health issue?My friend just had some sort of mental breakdown. He and his girlfriend were hanging out and as I was going to sleep(we share an apartment) she comes in to my room asking for help. He had locked himself in the bathroom and wasn't responding to us in anything but mumbles one word answers. She told me to break down the door so I did and he was standing naked clutching his head like he had a bad migraine. He wouldn't talk to us or put clothes on or do anything but stand there rubbing his head in his hands. He eventually started to calm down and he told us that this happened before and he doesn't want treatment or thinks it won't help. What should I do to make sure he gets the help he needs?
