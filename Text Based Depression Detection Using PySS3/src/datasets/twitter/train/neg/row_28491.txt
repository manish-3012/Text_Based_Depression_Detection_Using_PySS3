I'm not sure what I should do :(I'm 24 years old male. I want to talk about myself and how I feel right now.

I always try my best to be nice to everyone. But, It feels like no one is nice to me. In fact, It feels like everyone hates me for no good reason. I was bullied in many years. It's very painful for me. I feel dead inside. I'm emotional guy. Even right now, I feel this way. I'm trying to live a normal life. I have made changes to my health. I eat healthier, I exercise, I have lost 37 kg (122 kg to 85 kg). I'm 193 cm tall. I have also improved my dental health. I've had this lifestyle since November 2014. But, my mental health is a different story. It feels like everyone hates me, everyone wants me dead. It's difficult for me to live when I feel like this. I never felt this bad before. In the last few days, the only thing going through my mind is suicide. I can't stop it. I don't know how to stop. I fear that I actually will take my own life. I've been bullied by a lot of people. My social life is getting worse and worse. I don't know who I can or can't talk to. I apologize if this post is long.
