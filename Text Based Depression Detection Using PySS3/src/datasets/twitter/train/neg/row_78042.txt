Fuck itLife sucks. I thought my depression was getting better but it's only getting worse. This is the second time in a week I've been close to killing myself. I'm sitting here with a knife on my lap right now. I'm home alone so there is nobody here to stop me. I could just end it all right here and nobody would know for hours. What's the point in even trying anymore? It's not like I have a life or friends, I'm just a usless piece of shit burden on my parents
