ExhaustedI'm 29 years old. I've been truly happy maybe handful of times. My life has been a continuous shit show. I'm mentally exhausted, trying to stay strong. Every day I wake up, first thought in my mind is "I hope I die".

I want to die. But I'm too Much a coward to do it myself. 

Often people say "you can't give up, you don't know what tomorrow holds".

I've been waiting tomorrow after tomorrow and it never has gotten better. My life is either shit or neutral.

I haven't felt true happiness in so long. I don't have anything to feel happy about, externally or internally. I'm living life for the sake of...living? 

I don't know why I wake up every day. I would be happy not to. But really I go through every day just going with the flow, living without purpose. Living without any hope.

I'm dead inside. And in the physical world, I'm just there. Like a walking corpse.
