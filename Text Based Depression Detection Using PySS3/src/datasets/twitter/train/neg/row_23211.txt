..Idk what to do anymore. I hate college, hate my major, don't know what I'd do if I wasn't in college. Only incentive I have to live is the possibility of getting a gf. People keep saying that it'll happen and you have to have patience. I feel like I've been patient for years and I think I've lost any patience I had left and hope. At this point I just don't see it happening so why bother keep going.
