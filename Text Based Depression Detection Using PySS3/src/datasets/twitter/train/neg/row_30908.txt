I woke up after my suicide attemptI woke up in the hospital and my first thought was "well now I fell stupid, can't even kill myself right". I should've felt relief or regret but I essentially was like "well fuck". I tried to overdose on a bunch of pills my younger sister found me though. From what I'm told I barely made it. 

I tried my best to hide my illness. People knew I had issues but they didn't know how deep it actually was. Now everyone in my life knows I guess I don't want to be a burden and I don't know how to move on from this. The reason I tried to kill myself was I was struggling in online school and I hated feeling like a failiure. I don't know where to go now
