What's the point?I have been struggling all year in school except for last quarter, getting all B's. And even after getting those grades I feel like there's no point, this quarter I am doing well again but my parents have been making me feel worthless. Wanting me to get a job in a field I have no interest in always making me feel shitty when I tell them what I wanna be. I just have been waking up and going to school with zero motivation and feel as if I'm just a waste of space. It's not like I'm a shut in either I have many friends but lately I just get home and sleep cause I don't see any reason to be awake. Please help me.
