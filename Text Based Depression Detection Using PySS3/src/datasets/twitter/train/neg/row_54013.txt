I migt regret posting this on my main account, but i finllay lost all will to liveExcuse typos 

These last 4 months have been nothing but hell for me, after an abusive relationship i found an amazing guy who i thought i was gonna stay a long time with, he broke up with me 4 months ago, and just recently i found out he went out to la with a girl. All my life i was too fat or too ugly to date and now that i changed date all i get i being used or broken up with, i failed 3 classes from my 9th quarter in college and my mom found and and i can feel her dissappointment with me, i don't know how i'm gonna manage to pay to take 3 classes and also keep up with my regular classes. I was supposed to go on a date today with a guy that i was going strong with and he told me this morning that he is not good enough for me and would be waisting my time if we meet.

I feel alone, stupid, depressed. I don't know how i'm gonna do it but i wanna take my life soon, i wanna stop dissapointing my parents. I wanna stop being used, going to a therapist didnt work, everything in my life is failing right now and i'm just a complete failure.
