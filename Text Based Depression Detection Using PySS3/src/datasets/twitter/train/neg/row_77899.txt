drugs. the world. and how the voices won.love of my life. every opportunity in the world. we had a beautiful life in God's county. moved to Albuquerque for the first part of 2020. I kicked alcohol and decided to leave my bad habits behind. he got a promotion and we were off to Dallas. we had such a bright future. I have always been too scared to go to the doctor after Covid. so I stayed unmedicat ed from bipolar type 2. Self medicated with meth, and before I knew it, he was so distant from me, spending time in the bathroom, in bed sleeping constantly. and then he got mean, and I was left with depression. and drowning in nostalgia I got voices in my head one day. I remember it. it started with my dear dead brothers voice who has passed from a suicide. it all seemed too wild. they changed. became ugly and mean! and constant death threats that had me screaming all night. neighbors, the management all didn't like me, I ended up not allowed on property. I was homeless the month of october. traumatized and running around the whole city thinking I was going to get killed. or my love would be. I ended up actually losing all hope and back at the property. I tried slitting my wrists. the scissors weren't sharp enough. I went to the hospital. my love became homeless with me. and just now quitting his job because of how suicidal I am now. we are so distant. we don't talk. at all. I lost my friends and family, I'm not sure where he is. I've been asking for months. I miss him. 
I miss me. it's like they killed us. we're ghosts. get an Ouija board! lol but honest me, is just thinking it might be my only way away from the pain, the distance from me and the world, the once happy life we had planned out, gone! no one would even notice.
