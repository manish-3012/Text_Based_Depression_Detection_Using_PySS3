I just smacked my self full wack in the face for no reason, any one else do this?I hate my self so much, instead of going work tomorrow I might set off as usual drive that way stop on the bridge near work and jump :), it's funny I'm not even depressed I'm actually smiling haha I supose that says alot about my mental health, I can't believe I've never even been docs for it and I've survived this long but god I hate life so much now I can't even see no point in going on, ild kill myself now if I had a decent means to but unfortunately I live in the UK and I don't have a gun, I feel a pistol through the roof of the mouth is the most dignified way to kill ya self,, something fancy to like a glock or an old school revolver that would be kinda cool I guess, night SW I'm guna try and get some sleep I don't even know why I wrote this.
