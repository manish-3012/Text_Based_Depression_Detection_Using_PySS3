I dont wanna be here anymoreSo yesterday I (14/m) lost my only friend. It was an online friendship. Its all my fault it ended... I caugh feelings for him and asked him to date me. He said no but we continued being friends but his parents saw the message and made him block me on everything.

He is the only reason im here but is there a point of being here any longer? I dont have anyone ar this point...
