Don't know what to doi'm so tired of being alive and it's spring break and i should be happy but i can't see any of my friends because they're all busy and i think they're just saying that because they hate me and don't want to be around me, and i have free time but i feel like the more time i have the more i'm spiraling. I'm taking meds and therapy (haven't been in a while since i had to cancel my last appt when my grandma died how fucked up is that aha) and i work out almost every day and i eat healthy i don't know what i'm doing wrong? i just want everything to end i think about dying every day i wish i could just go to sleep and never wake up but i can't. everyone says it gets better but it's been years and it's only gotten worse, my parents still refuse to accept me as trans (i'm non-binary please don't make fun of me) and i still have these hallucinations and what i've been told are delusions because i have schizoaffective disorder or w/e according to the psychiatrist in the hospital. i'm trying really really hard to fix things and feel better but i don't know how and i just want to die please how do i make the pain go away
