It's officially time to say goodbyeI tried to be good enough for my friends/family/boyfriend and I guess I'm just not enough. 
I tried getting through this and all I wanna do is talk to someone and I did try someone I really love but I guess he didn't want to talk to me not One Single bit I promised I wouldn't do it for him and I really needed him especially now I feel like he's blocked me. 
That I'm just useless or not even good enough.
It's ok it's honestly ok I'm used to it tbh I wanna cry I've kept it in for so long and now  wanna burst I don't wanna live in this pain and I shouldn't have to anymore if anyone truely cared they would just let me go I obviously deserve it, 
I'm pathetic as it is. 
To everyone this isn't anyone's fault it was mine for not getting the help and opening up I should've done more but I chose not to bc I was afraid now it's finally time to say my goodbyes no one does not want me here and It feels like my bf doesn't either.
Thank u for everyone who tried.

I've taken pills and I've been harming all I'm gonna do now is sleep and hope I never wake up again.

Goodbye ðŸ˜­
