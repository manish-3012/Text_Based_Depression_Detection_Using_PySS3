There's nothing life can offer me would make living worth it.I'm 22 years old, diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.  I tried to kill myself by overdose last Christmas but landed in the psych ward instead.  I self-harm fairly often.  Sometimes that has kept me from trying to kill myself because I go numb when I cut.  In the past couple years I've been in and out of the hospital.  I spent 6 months in a partial hospitalization program before they gave up on me.  I've been in a mentalization based therapy program for the past year, but it hasn't been very helpful.  My family thought it might help if I got a psychiatric service dog, but I can't because one of my flatmates is deathly allergic to dogs.  It doesn't seem like any amount of therapy or medication has made me want to stay alive.  All I can do is cut to distract myself from wanting to die.  

I understand that there are a couple of people that would be hurt by me killing myself, but why should I constantly suffer just so a couple of people can go about their happy lives?  If they want me to be alive so fucking bad then they shouldn't leave me when I need someone the most.
