I'm tired of feeling like a burden.It's not even justified. My family loves me and assures me I'm not a burden. My friends tell me the same thing. I'm surrounded by people who care about me, yet every time I interact with someone it's never "oh here's someone who enjoys spending time with me!" It's always "I wonder how much longer until this person is sick of me/abandons me."

I have absolutely no reason to feel that way either. Apart from some bullying when I was a child, I have a very easy life. I honestly don't think I've ever encountered a single true hardship except for twice. Once about a year ago when I was sexually assaulted, and once very recently when my grandmother died. So naturally I feel bad because my problems aren't real, so I feel like I'm making them up. Because I don't have any fucking problems,  I just feel this way! My parents even tell me that as long as I feel like I have problems, it's worth talking about to a counselor or therapist, especially if it is negatively impacting my life. Yet as much as I believe them, I still feel like I'm just burdening them by even bringing it up. It doesn't matter how loving they've always been or how healthy of an outlook they have on mental health, I'm jut a worthless fucking burden.
