I don't know how much longer I can go on like this.I've been just barely keeping my head above water for so long. For so long. I'm in a fair amount of debt, I'm struggling in school in my final semesters, I've become an involuntary social recluse. My long-term girlfriend broke it off with me, and is more than thrilled to be out of my life. No one notices I'm gone, no one cares to reach out. It seems all so petty and meaningless. Why slave my life away just for a life I've dreamed of but will never have? I had such grand dreams. None of them have come to fruition. I'm a failure in every sense of the word. I'm an atheist. I know, as much as I can know, that nothing is after this. So my dilemma is whether or not to keep enduring like this, or pull the plug. End this sad little existence. The world I know, the ones I've loved, will gasp at my passing. Then move on, living their lives as they always had. The memory of the world will not remember me. The world I see is a dark, cruel, sad place. A place of misery, of suffering, of pain. What is the point in living in a world so cold and so dead. I'd embrace the quiet darkness much sooner than endure the sorrowful tomorrow.


What's the point?
