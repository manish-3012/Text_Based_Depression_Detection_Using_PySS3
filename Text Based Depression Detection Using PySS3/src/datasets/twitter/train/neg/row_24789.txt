I am still alive and I had convinced myself I was going to die on the 31stI got distracted on that night with someone that needed money and I was so distracted with making sure they were okay that I missed my deadline. A lot of things have happened since then that I donâ€™t want to talk about but also delayed it. I just want you guys to know that iâ€™m done with delaying it any more. Iâ€™m killing myself tonight and if I fail iâ€™ll try straight again tomorrow rather than wait a week. Bye reddit
