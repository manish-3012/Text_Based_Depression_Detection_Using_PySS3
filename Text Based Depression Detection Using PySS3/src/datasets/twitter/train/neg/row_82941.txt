HopelessI had a thought today. What would the world be like without me? And I instantly knew the answer. Better. No one would notice the loser being gone now would they? Didn't think so. I tried to think of the friends I have currently if they would, but it's the same for everyone. I never made an impact on any of them and I was just annoying to them. I guess I should just leave this earth because I have no skills to fallback on and nothing else planned for the future. I'm pretty hopeless since nothing I do amounts to anything.
