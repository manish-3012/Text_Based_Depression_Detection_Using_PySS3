I'm going to run away if school keeps getting worse.Posting to this sub because, while it is running away, doing this would likely be suicide. School's been rough on me. Not because of bullies, I could beat them in a fight anytime, but because of stress and too much work.

My grades are crap. I'm just not compatible with the system I suppose. In the likely case it all goes to hell, I have plans and supplies for a long hike. The most suicidal part is that I'm going to get as far away as possible. I'll likely head for the Trask Mountains which is a helluva distance on foot.  I'll pack supplies, such as food, water, and knives, of course. Possibly with friends. Research will need to be done.

There are a lot of different things that make this suicidal, such as bad people, the distance, lack of food, and the cold of winter. 

Figured running away is better than flat out killing myself. I've already attempted suicide once and it hurt horribly. Maybe I'll wait until spring if possible so I don't freeze. Maybe I'll even have some sense then.
