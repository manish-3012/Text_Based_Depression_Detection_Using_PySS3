FearI've been struggling with depression on and off since I was in middle school I've always felt like I was alone and that I'd never be happy I've thought about how I would want to go when I would do and how to but I've never gotten to actually try because I'm just so scared to die I don't know of death could somehow be worse then life and I've held out hope that maybe things could get better and they did I met the most wonderful woman in the world she made me feel things I thought I never would joy excited hopeful and she's made me feel that way everyday for the past 14 months but because of certain things that have happened between us I'm starting to feel like I lost my chance to be happy with her and I don't think she loves me anymore all of my friends are her friends that she introduced me too  I hate my family and Ive even tried several hotlines but sit through two minutes of automated dialogue makes me lose the courage I built up to even call in the first place if my fears turn out to be real and we split up then I'll know that the best part of my life is behind me and there won't be anything left keeping me from just ending all I want is to spill all my thoughts out to her and have her tell me everything will be okay but if I did that and she stayed it wouldn't be because she loved me it would be out of pity I don't know if typing this has made me feel better or worse but either way I probably won't check this again
