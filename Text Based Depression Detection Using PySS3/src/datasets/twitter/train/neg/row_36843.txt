Why do people tell you to open up but don't hear you?Going through such a bad breakup and no one to talk to. I suffer from depression and it makes everything 100x worse. Not to mention, I played a huge part in the breakup. I just want to be ok and feel worthy of love or anything for that matter. It's like I try to open up and people listen but they don't hear me!!
