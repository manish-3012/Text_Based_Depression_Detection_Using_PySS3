I must be losing it in another way.In spite of my many recent paranoid delusions (e.g. the government is colluding with large corporations to introduce lead into municipal drinking water and shuttling off the chosen few to secret communes where they're raised to lead the world in secret), I thought I couldn't be having any sort of psychotic break because I wasn't hallucinating.  Now I'm hearing fucking music when it isn't there.  How can I be so fucked in the head?  I don't deserve to live.  I'll disappoint myself.
