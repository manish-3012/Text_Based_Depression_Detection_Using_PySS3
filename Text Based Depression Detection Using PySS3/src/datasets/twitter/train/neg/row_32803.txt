Human TrashThatâ€™s what I feel like.... my only friend, who was there for me when my Dad passed earlier this year, she helped me so much.... but she said sheâ€™s starting to get tired of my negativity :â€™( She was my best friend, and now we fight like every other day.... I feel like garbage, to be used by people and then just thrown away when theyâ€™re done with you. :â€™( No one cares or wants to be my friend.... even if you did.... youâ€™d get sick of me... I just wanted a friend... :â€™( was that too much to ask for?
