A wonderful girl I know is going to a mental hospital tomorrow for suicidal tendency. I wrote her this poemthicker than blood

yes we are

absence of wisdom

i apologize for having

this world is painful

and confusing more than ever

but time will show you, more than all

that this pain you feel today

means less and less tomorrow

and that i love you now

as you are a sister

feel not as an outcast

but as a person with great due

i care very deeply 

and i need you

stick with me through this mess

and one day we will understand it
