Anyone else suicidal because of losing a loved one?I lost my mum 2.5 years ago to cancer, and my dad 1.5 years ago choked to death on a piece of meat. Since then I have been planning to kill myself - I just need to push through til I am at least 36 (cos I have a lot going for me, don't want to waste it, at least I should live out my early 30s and then I can say I lived all my best years and I can die before I get old). 

I just posted on the grief support group but I was told I should see a therapist as it isn't normal to be thinking of suicide. Baaaaa No therapist is gonna make this better cos they can't bring my parents back, and no therapist is gonna make me not want to kill myself. 

Life is so fucking pointless when everyone you love is dead, even if I supposedly have everything else going for me, none of it matters without mum and dad. 

Anyone elseÂ´s suicidal ideation triggered due to loss of a loved one?
