How would my daughter ever understand?I just don't want her to be the one to find me dead.

I hate everything about my life except her, how would she ever understand such selfishness. 

To leave her with whom? Her piece of shit father? 

It hurts so much being here through all this I just wish I was rotting in hell where I belong
