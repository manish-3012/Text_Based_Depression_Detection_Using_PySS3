They'll call me selfish when I'm goneI don't know where these thoughts are coming from but I can't stop them. From everyone's pov, I have it all. Great husband, 3 kids, big house, nice car but my brain is telling me they would be better off without me. 

My husband is into guns and has a collection, his biggest caliber handgun is what i would use. It's under the bed, I know the combo. It's loaded and ready to fire, it would be so easy to put it to my temple and squeeze. I know, it's not the ladies way out but who cares if it does the trick. 

I don't want these thoughts, I don't want to be sad and fake this smile. I love my kids but my brain is telling me to do it.
