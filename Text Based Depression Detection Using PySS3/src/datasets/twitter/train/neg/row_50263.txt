I am a failureMy relationship with my parents are failing apart. I just had the biggest fight with my mom yesterday. I feel that I've failed to be a good child and that I am a loser.
It's just unfair to be born in this world without me asking for it. I kind of forced to live another 40-60 years in this unhappiness and uncertainty. I just wished theres a button to erase my existence. Like there wasnt me in the first place. Or if I could die peacefully cos im afraid of suiciding.
I know other people have it worst, and people keep telling me that im still young, but being young doesnt mean i cant be sad and miserable. I just dont want to face my problems anymore. I wish I could be done.
