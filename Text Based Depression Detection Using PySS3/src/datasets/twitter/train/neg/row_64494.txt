Taken from me was she.I had planned it all out. I was to die in a week... I had given up and found peace in the expectance of death. A sort of calm washes over me as I think about how all this constant pain will soon be over...

She strolled into my life unexpectedly at my part time night job. (Subway) Saw my best friend first. My face smiles for what it can. I nonchalantly look over past him and behold, my angel! I stopped everything to march around the counter to hug my pretty much life long friend. (She commented later on how my face LIT up upon seeing her.) She moved in a few days later and we spoke of old age together.. For once, us both unattached and free to feel for each other after 17 long years of misses... 
     A motorcycle wreck took her from me not even two months later... She had brought me from the brink of death. I tried my hardest to hold to that... I really did. 

    My new plan is almost finished. The point to anything gone. More so than ever before. Every waking second is pain. My body from this and previous wrecks. My mind distorted by lifeâ€™s ever swinging blows I can no longer nor want to shrug off. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m saying here. Nothing is okay. I spiral down. I digress.
