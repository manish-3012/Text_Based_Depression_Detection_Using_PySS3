I give upMy life has been a shit hole since the beginning. Nothing ever good has happened to me, my parents have been verbally abusive my entire life and now there starting to be physically along with it. I have cuts,burns and scars littered across my body from self harm and then I thought I found something to keep my alive something  actually good but nope not even 24 fucking hours into the relationship "I found someone better then you goodbye fuckboy" and then again I let my guard down for any other person but after 4 months she breaks up with me and now she just keeps harassing me and pounding me with insults I told her everything about me my entire life story every time I've tried to kill my self or runaway I told her all my deepest darkest secrets and now she just uses them against me 24 fucking 7 I can't escape it I've tried blocking her but she just keeps making accounts on top of my parents being even more aggressive to me I actually give up I can't fight it anymore I'm killing myself tonight I'm taking any pill I can possible find and taking them and just to make sure it all goes to plain I'm going to the tallest building that I can get into in my town and jumping from it
