I am at breaking point in my life and I don't know if I can do it. Need support. I'm male, 25 years old and for two years I have dealings with anxiety. I'm an agoraphobic and I feel unable to drive long distances. (From one city to another). There is little to no support from my family. I live 500 miles apart from most of them. When I was a child I always felt like I was unwanted and tried very hard to get attention from anyone in order to subsitute the hole my parents left in me. Their work was always more important than anything I could do, for example school concerts or sport matches. I always felt empty inside and that I am on my own, alone, all the time. Unfortunately I didn't develop a strong and self confident personality. Sure, I went away from my family and it felt good for the first couple of years, but there still is this feeling of being insignificant, an inability to love myself and love others as well. I have a girlfriend, but I'm not a good boyfriend to her. I often become aggressive and throw things at the wall. I never hurt or touch her, that's out of the question. But she feels so sorry and there is nothing she can do to help me. It's my inability to accept myself as a person. How can I open up to her? I don't know. And then, there's this anxiety, this fatal seed, that destroys everything I try to start. Whenever there opens up an opportunity in my life, the heavy thumb of fear presses me down into the ashes and the dust of nowhere and nothing. I feel isolated and cold, in some way not human. All life I had is sucked up by fear and all I do, or still able to do is dictated by fear. 

Next week I'm going to start an internship and I need to start it in order to finally finish my studies (it's obligatory). I have no idea how to deal with it. I can't sleep and I'm nervous all the time. I read (on reddit) that suicide seems like a constant solution to a temporarily problem, but what do you do when the problem is constantly bringing you to the knees?
