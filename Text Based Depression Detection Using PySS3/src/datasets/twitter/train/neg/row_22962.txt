Next Weekend.I have the house to myself next weekend. Iâ€™ve never felt this empty before. Even if Iâ€™m laying in bed with someone i care about I just keep thinking about it. How much easier it would be. My life is in shambles and nothing Iâ€™ve done in the past two years has helped. Iâ€™ve pushed everyone away and I let toxic feelings and people in. I am so tired. I donâ€™t want to fake that Iâ€™m okay when Iâ€™m not okay.
