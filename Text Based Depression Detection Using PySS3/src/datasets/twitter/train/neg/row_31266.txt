Reaching my mid-twenties. Realizing how big of a disappointment being an adult really is.Hi SW. My lack of health insurance and lack of money don't really allow me to see any therapist or anyone, so I have turned to you guys.

I am a 24 year old ginger, and I really feel like not existing anymore. I dropped out of college because it's too hard. Quit my job because it won't let me smoke weed, and stopped talking to my family because they are a bunch of blind republicans who think that I am just lazy.

My plan since I was 17 is to kill myself. I was originally going to do it after high school ended, but I started hanging out with people, started partying, and let myself become addicted to WoW. It's been a very good couple of years, but I am starting to realize that this can't go on forever. So, I think it's about time.

I have no dreams, no plans, and no ambitions. I do not want to contribute to society and would rather bleed out in a bath tub then suffer with a 9-5 job everyday. I don't see how you people do it. You say that life is all about experiences and people. Well what happens when you hate people? What happens when you don't have any money for these 'experiences'?

After typing this out, I guess I don't know what I really expect to happen after posting this. I don't want to get talked out of suicide. I want people to tell me that it IS ok to give up on existence. I want people to be accepting of suicide. I want suicide to be a doorway for people who feel like this world is not for them. Why should we deny the people suffering? Why should we brainwash them into thinking this world is somehow worth staying alive for? It all ends up the same, so why not expedite the process for those willing?

The captcha made me laugh, it asks 'Are you Human?' 
No, I am not. And I haven't been for quite some time.
