i'm very tired of everythingI want to die. I'm exhausted and I'm a failure. I feel really guilty about being alive. I know I'm inherently a lesser so I should have died a while ago but people complain when I try to kill myself. I try to be as small as possible and avoid things like eating and talking, but it doesn't really pay for how awful I am. I just want to be done.
