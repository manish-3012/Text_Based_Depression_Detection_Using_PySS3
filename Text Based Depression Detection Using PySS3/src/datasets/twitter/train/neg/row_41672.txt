Hey guys (and gals)Iâ€™m not posting this for anything other than just wanting to talk for a bit. I feel like I am useless, I have no job, no income, barely any friends (if any at all) and I feel like shit. I am always alone, I can never be happy for more than a couple of minutes at time and I am definitely at the lowest point Iâ€™ve ever been at. 

I lost my job in july (not because of the pandemic) and since then itâ€™s just been a mudslide running out of control. 

Iâ€™ve become more and more secluded, been going less and less outside, and whenever I actually go out all I can think of is how various objects or spaces could aid me in my way to end it all. 

I know itâ€™s a clichÃ© to say, but the only reason I havenâ€™t done the final yeet is because of my mother and my grandfather. They have done everything they can to help, but I just canâ€™t handle it anymore. Itâ€™s become to much.

I donâ€™t know if I will return to this account, but thanks for reading some of my random ass venting. 






TL;DR: I feel like shit and just want it all to end.
