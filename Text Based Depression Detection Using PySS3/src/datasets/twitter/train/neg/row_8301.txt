Thereâ€™s no truth.I asked for one thing from the people around me; the truth. Today I found out that for the last six years Iâ€™ve been lied to every single day. I have no idea where I stand in the world or who I can trust. I want to take responsibility and blame it on naivety, but itâ€™s too heavy. I have no idea how Iâ€™m supposed to move on from this. My world is shook.

The thing I wanted most, truth, is the thing Iâ€™ve apparently never had.
