I've done the unfathomableTurned $30k into over a mil trading stocks and lost nearly all fucking gambling on options while in a deep depression.  Finally mustered up the wherewithal to start applying for jobs as I have a wife and child to support.  Would have offed myself already if I had life insurance.  Now gotta tough it out for at least two years.  Fuck my life and fuck this god damn job fair I'm up dreading about.  Fuck all these linked in games and fuck all these people who are accomplishing things while I wallow in my filth.  Fuck me for being too socially inept to embrace these networking games.  I was suicidal when younger but it ain't the same after throwing away a small fortune with only one's self to blame.  The grief and torment does not end.  Quit drinking 90 days and get back in shape?  Hasn't done shit for my psyche.  Can't hit up the resources for mental help as I need to get that life insurance.  Supporting a family not easy when you're too fucked in the head to even support yourself.
