Should i end it? I've kinda battled the thought lately and tried my best to get a job, workout, Eat healthy, Just live a normal life. But here lately hearing all this news about the virus, How it is stopping teens from graduating and people are losing their jobs left and right, Food is scarce on the shelves, religious shit about locusts attacking africa, So here i am in the middle of this equation, Why does it matter if i live anymore, Why does it matter if i take another bite of food or listen to my favorite music or talk with my friends again, why does it matter if i see the next morning or feel the cool air of the next night? I don't see a reason to try anymore. I've battled depression all my life and sometimes it has been for attention, but as of right now i think im willing to except my fate and leave it with whoever is waiting on the other side, in all honesty i hate technology i hate the new social normality that we all have to abide by and how idiotic people are, Fighting over toilet paper for godsakes. Why do i of all people have to deal with it, Why do i have to scavenge for bits and grains while others just trample over me everyday over pandemic, Why do i have to live the rest of my life unhappy and struggling for jobs when it's not even my own fault i can't graduate, Why do i have to try anymore, If i had a gun id say id do myself a favor and just end this madness but im scared and need some help.
