I am ready to end my lifeI haven't felt this suicidal in a long time. I just can't live with my past actions.

I used to bully. Really, really harshly and relentlessly. I've apologized to the people I hurt and tried to do right by them, but I can not forgive myself, even if they have forgiven me. I think the only way to escape the pain is to die. I'm so unmotivated to live. I can't take this.

I've gone to hospitals, therapists, physiatrists, but nothing will work. I can't go on. No punishment or torment is enough for what I've done.
