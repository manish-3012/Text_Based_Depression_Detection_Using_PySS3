My Story / I Donâ€™t Want to Be Here AnymoreHello, my name is Calvin. Iâ€™m a 16 year old kid and I think Iâ€™m done, for good this time.

As far as my backstory, I donâ€™t know where to start. I grew up well, had good parents, and being an only child, I ended up being spoiled as fuck, looking back I wish I wasnâ€™t as it played into some bad mindsets later down the road but never mind that, as I grew up, life never had many issues until the early teen years and onwards.

Since then was an absolute downwards spiral, there started my porn addiction, loss of friends, lack of connection with everyone in my life, lack of desire for anything, on the flipside when age 15 hit, the drive struck to turn all of it around, since that point I started working on quitting my bad habits and made progress, I have reconnected with friends, I have started working on music that makes me feel fulfilled more than ever.

Looking back on this year, the most things have happened this year than any point in my life despite the pandemic. What went wrong? Ever since three days ago, something happened, it was like the energy got zapped out of me. Not just mentally, but physically aswell. Usually when I hit a low point, thereâ€™s always some sort of big spark that arises that inspires me to get back up again. That spark hasnâ€™t arrived.

Iâ€™ve tried everything in my power to build the momentum again: Better sleep, eating healthier, working out, everything that used to revive me in the past, nothing. Nothing is working. I genuinely feel like my soul does not have the power to get back up again this time, for good. At this point Iâ€™m looking for a quick way to end it. Iâ€™ve lost all interest in my hobbies, relationships, and myself, I am ready to be done with this.
