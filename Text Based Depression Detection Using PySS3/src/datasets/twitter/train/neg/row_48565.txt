Just slip awayYou can scream but no one hears you,
As you sit and mock in disdain,
The blood seeps down your arm
As your crying out loud in pain,

The broken glass beside the bath,
The water turning red,
Laying down in a bloody puddle,
Trying to rest your head.

You can hear your family laugh
As you say your last words
Feeling as high as the sky,
Flying away with the birds..

The pain is going away now
And you canâ€™t help but hear 
Youâ€™re mum crying next to you..
In hurt and fear.

You try to speak,
But nothing comes out...
You know your going away 
Youâ€™re never going to live with doubt.

As you feel death coming near
You hear her say â€œI love youâ€ 
As you slip in to a permanent sleep
You reply with I love you tooâ€¦
