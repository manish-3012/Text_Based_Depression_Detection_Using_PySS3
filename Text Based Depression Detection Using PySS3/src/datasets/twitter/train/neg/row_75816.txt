I don't know why im still alive...Ive been depressive for a good 20 years, and had a diagnostic of mental health at least 20 years ago...

Around 10 years ago, I sought support from my local social services. I ended up seeing a therapist, whom I felt in love with...

Zoom in time, 3 years later, Im supported by a local organism, where numerous people work and where i can meet a psychiatrist weekly, or almost upon need. Ive been suicidal since my teens, I think. My worst times are when I fall in love and it dosnt work out any good. Ive been wanting to die so hard for the last 3 years since i met the psychologist I could barely go out of my appartment... I wanted to die, but i was too coward. By chance, and, im sure undirectly, a women working at the center took me out of it. I suddendly had projects, went back to school. 

I swore myself never to fall in love anymore with anyone giving me proffessional attention, alas...

Three months later, I was telling her that I love her despite, and that I was so terribly sorry. Now the whole center is aware of that, im still stuck with suicidal thoughts, and
