I'm not able to see a future anymore, my SO is distant, coming home late from work and I'm going to lose my mindI was homeless until he took me in, I've lost nearly all contact with everyone since I became homeless, because I just wasn't 'around' I guess, I try to make new friends, I try to get over my mothers N abusive behaviour and I'm trying to work on my own issues and myself, but my SO who was supportive is pulling away, lately he even admits to staying away from home longer so he doesn't have to 'deal' with me because I 'need' him too much, I just wish he'd see I only get mad because I don't know what to do, I don't know how to ask for help, he's broken up with me several times saying he doesn't want a relationship, saying he loves me, then he says that it was a mistake, but that he does see no future with us because of how I am, and I'm sure it's me, because I'm so fucking sad all the fucking time ... I don't know what to do anymore, I only feel him pulling away from me, ...I have no family and no friends (not that I see or hear from often since they're all caught up in their own lives which is normal) I've never really been open to anyone about how I really feel, because my SO is the only person I trust and I don't want anyone to make me hate him, I don't know what to do anymore, he's pulling away; coming home late, sitting in a different room than me, avoiding me, and sometimes he's really nice to me but I don't know what to think I have no one else... please help me
