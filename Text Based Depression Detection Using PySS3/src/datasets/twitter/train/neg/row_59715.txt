I must have done something horrific in my past life to deserve this because Iâ€™m definitely living in hell.Been suicidal for the past 2 years, extremely depressed for the past 5 years and donâ€™t remember a time when I was actually happy. Iâ€™m an atheist but I guess god is real and he hates me for something I did in my past life so now Iâ€™m getting punished for it.
