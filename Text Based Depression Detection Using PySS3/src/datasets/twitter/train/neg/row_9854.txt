Only reason I'm still here is my fianceeI don't have any other friends, on account of being trans. I find that women feminize me, and men ignore me, and I'm too old to think it's fun to be a minority. I don't really have hobbies, because what's the point? It doesn't matter if I can cook or knit or get good at yoga. Hobbies don't add anything to anyone's life, and they cost me money. Same goes for relationships, I honestly don't know why my fiancee is still with me, and if they leave me, good for them. They can go find someone who's not completely worthless, boring, and incapable of contributing anything to society. I work a fast food job because I can't afford to go back to school. I can't have a dog because my fiancee thinks our apartment is too small for a second pet. The car is on the edge of breaking down, I'm broke, and I have nobody to lean on. I don't feel like wasting money on a therapist, so that they can tell me to work out more and eat better and stop being mean to myself. I'm entirely capable of doing those things - there's just no point. 

I apologize for being so whiny, but it's very late and I'm lowkey drunk and I can't think of anything that makes my life worth living except my one relationship, and the vague hope that someday I can get a dog.
