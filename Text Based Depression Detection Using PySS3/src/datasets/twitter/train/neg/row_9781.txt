I know I have a good life, but chronic depression doesn't care, and I can't talk to anyone about it.I'v fought depression for close to 20 years now. I want to escape, but I fight it. I can't talk to my friends about it, or even my councelor because I feel like it will be taken the wrong way. I need a sounding board, to help me figure out what I'm feeling, and how to deal with it. That's how I deal with my thoughts, by talking about them at someone until I understand them. But the people in my life care too much and will, rather than just listen, tell me how much they love me, how I need to be alive, how I have a good life.
I know these things. I have a 18 month old son who needs his mom. I have a position at the company every student in my department wants to work for, I have a husband who isn't perfect, but who tries his best and loves me. I have friends who care. The problem isn't with any of that.
The problem is that I am unable to overcome the darkness inside myself, and even though I fight it continually, it overwhelms me, drags me down, and I don't have it in me to keep going, and I don't have anyone I can talk to about it.
