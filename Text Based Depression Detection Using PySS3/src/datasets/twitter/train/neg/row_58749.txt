I Donâ€™t Want Anyone to Know Iâ€™m SufferingEveryday I do my best to put on a smiling face and make others laugh or brighten their day. I wear the mask. 

Itâ€™s actually scary how well I wear it to the point even my friends think Iâ€™m doing well or great or whatever. Or coworkers excited about my great mood. Even in a work review it was mentioned how much positivity I bring in.

I donâ€™t have the energy or even want to tell these people I just cried in the bathroom 10 minutes ago. Cried before I got here. Cried myself to sleep. How alone I feel. How I feel like ending it all. How all these suicidal thoughts are running through my head constantly.

Thereâ€™s nothing they can do or say anyway. No amount of â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€s or â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€ will help.

So I wear the mask.
