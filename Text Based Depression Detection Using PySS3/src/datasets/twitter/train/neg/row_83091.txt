I have no reason to live. I have no interest in the world. Nothing I want, nothing I desire to strive for. I don't crave success, I don't want friends or a family or even a child, I don't crave wealth, I don't even crave pleasure all that much. I dont want to be alive, I don't have any obligation toEverything is bland to me, nothing gives me any excitement or drive. Most people have something that they're good at and want to engage in as a hobby or career or what have you. But me, I suppose I don't want anything out of my life.
