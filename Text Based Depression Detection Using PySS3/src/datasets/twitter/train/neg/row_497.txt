Iâ€™m committingToday I learned that no matter what I do Iâ€™m bound to fuck everything up. Today I committed to a plan of action that, with any luck, will lead to my death.

Iâ€™ve bought tickets for a gun show a month away, far away from where I live. Since Iâ€™m 18 thatâ€™s the only place where I can buy a handgun. The time delay is for me to make preparations and psychologically as well as philosophically justify what Iâ€™m about to do to myself, to come to terms with my own death. Finally, Iâ€™ve quit school. Besides being too much to handle, this will burn the main bridge tying me to being where Iâ€™m at.

Regardless of my intentions and how far Iâ€™ve come, Iâ€™m better off without this miserable existence and the world is better off without me.
