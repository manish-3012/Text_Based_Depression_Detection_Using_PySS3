It's days like this where I feel like fighting it is not worth it.It's a fight every day, and there are days where I don't think it's even worth fighting because most things suck anyway. That and my life is so significantly damaged and I don't see it getting better after so many failed attempts to fix it. I guess if I can't make it, I'm weak. At least that's what everyone says. I've got two tests tomorrow and I'm trying to study, but I just can't absorb the information and I can't focus and I'll end up failing college again. I don't know what my parents will do when they find out. It doesn't matter if I have depression they will think it's an excuse I'm sure. Basically my life is falling apart and I don't even see the point of trying to fight the pain anymore.
