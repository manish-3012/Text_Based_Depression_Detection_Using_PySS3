I don't know what to do, or who to tell.I think that suicidal people use the possibility of dying by their own hand as a comfort.
Life is so unpredictable, it's hard, it's cold.
Sometimes it feels like you can't even sleep now when sleeping was all you could do before. 
So what if you just killed yourself?

Suicide is a sanctuary, it's heaven.
It's better than right here and right now, it's better than hurt at the hands of something else.

You don't have to worry about the sadness of the world, you don't have to feel the anxiety of fear. 
Fear about what if nothing gets right, what if your brain can't go straight, what if you're too useless to handle anything else but the softness of dying.

I'm afraid of everything. 

I'm scared that if I go to him (my husband) and end up changing my mind, I just make things worse between us and in our marriage.
I mean, all I ever really wanted was a happy marriage.
It's not like he's even talking to me now.
His friends probably think I'm a terrible girl, and I'm on a bad foot with his mom (he confirmed my fears) 
He's in a really good space and his friends will help mourn me, I'll be forgotten before he knows it.

I think the choice is obvious for me.
