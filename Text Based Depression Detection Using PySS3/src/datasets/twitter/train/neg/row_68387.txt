Every minor inconvenience makes me wish I was dead.I'm so tired of living on the edge of pulling the trigger. The next time a train crosses the tracks in town I'm getting out of my car and jumping in front of it. I feel bad for the driver but I just can't take it anymore. If there is a merciful god, he will grant me this. That motherfucker owes me for this piece of shit he made me, anyways.
