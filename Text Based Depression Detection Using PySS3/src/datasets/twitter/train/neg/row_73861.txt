Iâ€™m tiredI made a throwaway so I could post this. My husband knows my Reddit name. 

Iâ€™m tired of pretending everything is ok. 

Iâ€™m tired of pretending to care about myself. 

Iâ€™m 40. My life is shit. Iâ€™m so impaired with depression and anxiety that I canâ€™t live a normal life. I also canâ€™t afford the help that I need. I canâ€™t even afford to go to a medical doctor for the physical issues I have. 

Iâ€™m married. Dead bedroom. I donâ€™t think he finds me attractive. Canâ€™t say I blame him. 

I honestly have nothing to live for. No kids. Husband doesnâ€™t really care. Heâ€™s not abusive, but weâ€™re roommates. Thatâ€™s it. 

So I want to die. I donâ€™t have a method yet. I donâ€™t have a gun and to buy one would be suspicious. The only thing I can think of is to just swallow every pill I have and hope itâ€™s all over.
