Tonight's the nightI've kept everything internalized, I've down all I can to keep it to myself. I cant do this anymore. No ones there to listen, no ones there to help. 
I pushed my girlfriend away with my mistakes, I lost every friend I ever had to my mistakes. 
I've considered suicide for so long, but I'm tired tonight. The weariness is getting to me. I fear I cant go anywhere in life and I'm damned if I keep trying. 
I'm sorry to my Girlfriend who might miss me for some time, but I hope she will move on, I'm so sorry for my parents. Who I wish in a better place could have me stick around. They do not deserve to feel the pain that will come. Neither does my girlfriend.  I dont want to go. But so much of my mind is telling me to do it tonight. Tonight's the night, and I'll see if I wake up tomorrow.
