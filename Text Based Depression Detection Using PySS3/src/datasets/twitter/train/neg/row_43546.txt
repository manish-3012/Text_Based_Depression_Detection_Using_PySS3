Days are getting longer and my will is getting weaker.Iâ€™ve always thought about ending my life. Itâ€™s always been in the back of my mind. After my gf broke up with me a couple days ago, I just feel like itâ€™s my only option. I feel so worthless, pathetic, and stupid. I just want some relief and this seems like the only way.
