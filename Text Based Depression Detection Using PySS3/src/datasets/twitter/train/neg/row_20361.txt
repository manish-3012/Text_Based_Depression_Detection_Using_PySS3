I'm just a jokeI'm 18 years old and have lived with clinical depression for a while now, I only developed suicidal tendecies as of recently, I'm seeing a therapist and taking medication. 
No one seems to take me seriously, I have threatened to commit suicide twice to my mother and both of those times she encouraged me to do it until I actually grabbed a knife, then she would beg me not to do it, both of those instances she wouldn't give me the emotional support I needed afterwards, she would just shrug it off as a desperate bid for attention, I'm tired of it, I'm tired of being seen as a joke, as a teenager who's just throwing a tantrum, it's only making me want to actually go through with it and just end it all, I feel hopeless because the person who should support me just doesn't seem to take it seriously at all.
