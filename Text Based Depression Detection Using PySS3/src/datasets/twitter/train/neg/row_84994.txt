Yet another post from me, an annoying burdenSo fucking yayyyyy i am here again. Avoiding any sharp objects, pills or rope. I know I never should have learned how to tie a noose, I thought that day was the end of my life. Oh boy past self your brain gets even worse!! You have nothing to fuckin look foreward to besides your online friends being better and a girlfriend who you care about but hate at the same time! (I dont even want to explain the girlfriend situation) I feel like throwing up with how sick of myself I am. How the hell do I not annoy every person around me? I try to do things for them to make up for how terribley annoying I can be, it usually helps not always though. I feel like hell though, I have dealt with so much fucking shit and I am still alive. Why?? Not for myself clearly.  The suicidal thoughts are nearly unbearable and I want to just end it. If i did though I know i would at least leave behind ten sadish people. Why ruin one of those amazing peopleâ€™s day when i can just fucking suffer? I barely deserve the air I u happily breathe. I have stopped looking before crossing the street, started walking around sketchish neighboorhoods alone and all of the shit every younger female is told not to do. Why wonâ€™t someone kill me? Why am I so much of a fucking wimp? Why am I alive to suffer and hate myself when I could easily go outside with a rope and not have to worry about it anymore? I just want to stop breathing, is that so much to ask? Thanks for listening or not listening to my venting, have a nice day. I can assure you every single one of you deserves to have a happy life unlike me. Have a lovely day/afternoon/evening/morning ~Brooke
