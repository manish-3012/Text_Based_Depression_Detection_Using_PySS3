Tired.I am tired of my depression. I'm tired of living. I'm tired of suffering. 

I'm a 19 year old college student. I study biology and dance. I've always wanted to be a doctor. But I can't see a light at the end of the tunnel anymore. 

My dad was wrongfully put in prison when i was a baby. I "grew up" in the visitors room. Then, when I was 10, he died suddenly. My father's death has made my life miserable for almost a decade. I struggle with complicated grief disorder and was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was 15. I've been in and out of therapy since I was 10. 

I dabbled in SSRIs in high school. got off when I graduated. Went to a private university in southern California on a $123,000 scholarship. I've always been high functioning, but I've always been depressed. 

Started my sophomore year. Moved into my first apartment and felt myself slipping again. Started talking to a new psychologist. Fucking hated him, stopped talking to him. Applied to countless internships, got rejected from all of them. Started lexapro. I'm a month in and i only feel the shitty side affects. Can't stomach a full meal, nauseous all the time. Now, failing two of my classes. I met with the Dean of Sciences and the Dean of students and they were no help. Absolutely no sense of urgency and just emailed my professors telling them in a little-to-no-effort automated email saying that their student (me) was having "personal difficulties." In the last week I have become  suicidal. I am so tempted to end my own life, but I don't want my mom to deal with a dead husband and a dead daughter. I am so miserable. I can't get out of bed, brushing my teeth is a chore, and even dance (the only thing that has ever made me feel alive) isn't fun anymore. I don't know what to do. I just know I don't want to be here anymore.
