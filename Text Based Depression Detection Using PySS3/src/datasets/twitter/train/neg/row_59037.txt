Who do I sometimes want to die for no reason?I don't have a hard life, I have a good life, I have parents, a home, I go to school everyday, I don't have friends but whatever, I'm very lonely and I like it. However, sometimes I really want to hurt and kill myself for no reason, actually I'm so frustrated of not fiding something I like doing. I live video games, but at the moment, I just don't want to play them anymore, I lose my time and I have some suicidal thoughts because of boredom. Anyone knows a cure?
