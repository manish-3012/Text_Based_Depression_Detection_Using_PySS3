RantThis will be more along the lines of stream-of-consciousness. I really just want to rant. 

There's something wrong with me. I don't know what it is, something deep, something immutable. Something repulsive. People detest me. They hate my guts. I'm so lonely. Very few people have contacted me first during the quarantine. People do respond when I start conversation but rarely ever start it. 

I guess there would still be a reason to live if it was a contingent issue. If the people in my life were the problem. But they're not. The problem is with me, i'm just a terrible person.  i could hope for things to get better if the environment was the problem. But it's not. I guess I'm cursed, somehow. Cursed to be hated, lonely etc.

I wan to die.

The things that are stopping me are my parents. They'd really be traumatised. I just want to know -- how much time does it usually take for a parent to get over their kid's death? 

And a few friends who have invested time and effort in bettering my mental health. I think it'd be insulting to them if I go on and do this.
