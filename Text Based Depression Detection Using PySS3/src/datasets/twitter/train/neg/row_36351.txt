why are you here?I usually respond to posts here; I really want to help someone. But I feel like my motives are mostly selfish. Trying to help others is just a way of trying to desperately help myself. A part of me wants to be the hero I didn't have when I self-harmed as a cry for help a couple years ago. Those were unheard cries into a merciless and bottomless void of which only echoes could be heard. Honestly, I don't know if things are going to get better; I'm trying. I think I don't want to die yet. When I can't sleep, when I'm stuck in dark corners of my mind, when I think school feels really useless so I want to do something meaningful, I come here. What could be more meaningful to me than the possibility of saving a life? I'm just a wannabe hero.
I don't know if I've actually helped anyone here, but I want to thank anyone who helps out and replies to posts. I don't mean anything in a self-congraulatory way. I kind of just wanted to appreciate the existence of this subreddit; it means a lot to me.
