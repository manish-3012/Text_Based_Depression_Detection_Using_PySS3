1 yearTried to hang myself around a year ago. I was living by myself at university and had absolutely no friends just my girlfriend. Boring job where no one likes me or speaks to me, crippling anxiety as a result of a bad childhood and parenting. I had just been arrested and wanted out so used a belt to hang myself. I unfortunately came around and called an ambulance. 

One year on and back living with parents I am more depressed than ever. No one cares that I attempted suicide and am severely depressed. My parents give me no space and make my life horrible. My girlfriend expects so much for me and I feel our relationship is not a 50/50 effort but she is my only friend. 

I am ugly as fuck and 5â€™6 with no social skills whatsoever. I will probably get kicked out of university and my work and get a criminal record. 

I will probably attempt suicide in the near future by crashing my car at high speed so as to avoid the chance of survival
