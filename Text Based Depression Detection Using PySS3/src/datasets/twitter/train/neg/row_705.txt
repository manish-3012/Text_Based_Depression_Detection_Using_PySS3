Please helpI'm 19, I'm in college, my parents are still together. I have a roof over my head, food on the table and a boyfriend that cares greatly for me. So what could possibly be wrong with me? Why do I hate everything so much? 

I'm so afraid that I'm not good enough for my boyfriend. I'm not good enough for my parents or my family. I have virtually no friends. Nobody cares about me except for my boyfriend but I know I'm wearing him down.

I was raped when I was 16 by a random man. He pushed me against the wall and pinned me by wrapping his hands around my neck. He pulled off my pants and began to feel around before he pulled down his own pants and raping me. I've never told anyone this until now, but his memory haunts me every night.

When I was younger my father used to grope me and when I reached puberty he began to touch me even more inappropriately. To this day, I can't look at my father the same way.

My boyfriend and I just recently started having sex. He's my first, besides that man. He doesn't know about this, but sometimes when we're intimate...I just get flash backs of that night when I was raped, and sometimes of my father.

I live every day scared, scared of running into that man once more. Scared of losing the only person that cares about me. Scared of my father touching me. 

My parents abuse me. They choke me until I pass out, and throw things at me. Things that would break bones or skin if I didn't dodge out of the way. They hit me almost every day just because they can. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't take this anymore. Please reedit, help.
