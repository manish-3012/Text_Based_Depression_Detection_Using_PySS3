Iâ€™m thinking of taking my life peacefully before it gets taken from me painfully.I have been struggling with depression for years now. I've been on medication, but I'm too scared to ask for a higher dosage because I know my family will be judgmental of me (yes, they're that kind of family), so I'm already on the edge anyways.
As to what I mean by the title, I'm a genderqueer, gay, Muslim and Arab person (I was born a male, so I guess that gives you the idea that I also have to deal with toxic masculinity from external forces, even though I don't necessarily consider myself male), and the more time goes by and the more I see how the world is going into bigger shit, the more I'm starting to accept that I won't last until old age. I see so many queer people, and especially those of color, getting murdered and hate-crimed left and right, and I've become so used to it that I'm not much scared of death itself as I've come to accept it. I'm more scared of the fact that I may die a painful death, and I don't want that, so I might as well take control of the situation, and, like i said, I'm already on the edge from other forces, so I might as well just get it over with so that I can at least have the peace of mind of knowing that I won't die an excruciatingly painful death like other like me have gone through.
