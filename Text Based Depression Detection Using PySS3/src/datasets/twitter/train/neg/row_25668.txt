Use your depressive thoughts to live carelessly.This is a post for everyone of you guys feeling suicidal. Ive been there, many times...until I broke these patterns by realising what life really is. Its nothing, for all we know it could be a figment of our imagination. So go be careless, have fun, give zero fucks, in other words become sort of a hedonist. Whats the worst that could happen? You could die, which none of us here would mind so whats the point of cutting to the chase. Make the most of whatever existence is...and stop caring. Its so freeing!
