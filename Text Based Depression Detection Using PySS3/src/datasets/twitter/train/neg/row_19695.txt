GoodbyeItâ€™s fitting that this is the last bit of me; writing was always the one place my thoughts could stand on their own merit. Itâ€™s just words - thereâ€™s no face, no body, no stereotypes to diminish the validity of my ideas. Maybe itâ€™s why I always loved English class growing up.

I lost my last bit of strength today. Itâ€™s something I would often fantasize about, but now that itâ€™s here I realize I always hoped this day would not actually come. 

After all the work, all the struggle, all the pain, I feel like a loser for going out like this. 23 years and Iâ€™ve built so little Iâ€™m spending my last night making sure a note that might be read by a couple of strangers is written well. But thatâ€™s the sort of thing that a weirdo like me takes pride in. Well written sentences. 

Thereâ€™s no point in adding another sob story to the hundreds of others here. I just wanted to thank anyone reading this for taking the time to honor peopleâ€™s last thoughts. You have to know pain to have empathy for it, and I hope whatever ails you goes away one day. 

Kiwi, you canâ€™t understand this but I have to get it out. You were the greatest friend I could have ever asked for. Thank you for teaching me what unconditional love is. I am sorry I could not do the same for you. I should have worried less and played with you more. I pray you get used to your new owner and forget about me eventually. Maybe weâ€™ll see eachother in heaven one day.

Love,
Michael
