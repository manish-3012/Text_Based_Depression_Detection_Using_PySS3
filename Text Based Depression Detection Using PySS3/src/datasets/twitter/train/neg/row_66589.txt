I was just saved from killing myself todayI had a fight with my dad and I ran outside to the bridge saying I was going to kill myself. I sat over the edge and a girl and boy stopped by and tried to stop me. They were so nice and took me to their house talk and gave me water and gave me there number. They took me home and talked to my parents and here I am lying in bed. I swear I wasn't going to do it, I didn't want to, I was just so sick of my life, the instant they came up to me I came down saying I didn't want to do it. I really didnt want to I was so over come with emotions. I saw how concerned they were for me and to see that they cared about my life meant alot.

My embarrassment is over the charts, I feel so stupid.
