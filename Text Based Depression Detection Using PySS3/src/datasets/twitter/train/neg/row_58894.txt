Is this a good idea...Umm hello reddit, just wanted to ask an opinion on something I have been doing... I'm on this subreddit for the same reason many people are here and am having many of the thoughts people here might be having and well have been documenting this process...

What I mean by that is that whenever I have said thoughts on any given day I add a date to my phone... So for example  today is the 11th here in the UK so I would put in "11th June 2016", but at the end of any given month if half of the dates of that month are filled I erase them all and would write just the month and the year. Eg: "July 2016" (I have the same system for the year)

I just wanted to know what any of you thought of this process and if you could see it being harmful... Thanks
