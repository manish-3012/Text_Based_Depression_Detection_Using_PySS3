I hate posting here but I might kms tonight or tomorrow.Before anything, please don't say "it will get better". I don't know if there's been a suicidal person who's felt better from hearing that but I haven't met them. 

I'm gonna try electrocuting myself with a thing I made out of a step-up transformer and as many capacitors as I can find. If I know what I'm doing (I don't), it should charge all the caps and release it as a jolt of high voltage and current right through my heart. If it fails, I'll live, possibly with a heart condition which I don't care about. I hope I get a fucking heart attack.

Common questions people ask me are

I'm in therapy

I'm on medicine and I've been on medicine for like a year and have tried like 15 different kinds

I'm 16 and live at home. I know how my parents would feel but I'm doing it anyway, I'm an asshole.

The reason I'm killing myself is because I don't have friends. One of the reasons is because I never went to school, my mom took me out, I don't know why. School isn't an option for the rest of this year, and I'm 90% positive I'm gonna kill myself before then so I don't have any hope.
