I wish no one cared for meMy life has been complete shit for way too long now. Every time I go out with my friends, I feel there's an increasing distance between us. I'm always down, much quitter than usual (and my usual is being the quietest person I know), have nothing to contribute to the conversation. As a result, I sometimes feel people hang out with me out of obligation now, because I can't fathom why anyone would like to be around me anymore. 

Last night, I told my best friend I'm going to be out of the country for a year, and made no big deal out of it. He started crying. Fuck, I wonder how he would feel if went away for good. I wish it wasn't like this, I wish no one would give a shit for my absence. I just can't bear to always be bringing people down. I just want to disappear.
