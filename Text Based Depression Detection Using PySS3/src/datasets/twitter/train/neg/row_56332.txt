how do i tell my parents iâ€™m suicidal(for reference i am a 14 year old female)
after endless battles inside my head for months on end, i have finally come to terms that i am suicidal. iâ€™ve always been one to deny my emotions and bottle them up. but i cant take it anymore. itâ€™s always the small things that are the most triggering. as my depression is getting worse, so is my anxiety. i cant do the most basic things. tomorrow, i am supposed to give a presentation. i emailed my teacher to ask if there were any other options besides presenting, as my anxiety is becoming too much and i canâ€™t imagine giving a presentation in this state. she told me that she canâ€™t allow me to skip it, and all i have to do is read some words. itâ€™s not that fucking easy- the whole thing just made me explode and i want nothing more than death at this point. i cant even imagine myself alive in a few years. everything feels pointless- like if i died no one would care. iâ€™ve lost so many friends, and missed out on opportunities of making new ones because depression got the best of me. i have the same painful thoughts: â€œwhat would my life be like if i didnâ€™t have depression/anxiety?â€ imagining myself being out there and having fun like a normal teenager is so fucking painful. especially because i used to be an extroverted ray of sunshine as a kid, which my mom always brings up. i bet sheâ€™s disappointed to watch that kid turn into a train wreck. and then i have to watch my nice, normal, popular, teen brother have a healthy social life, having the time of his life with his best friends and girlfriend. and thereâ€™s his deadbeat sister who canâ€™t even say hi. this whole time iâ€™ve been so occupied inside my mind i didnâ€™t bother to look at how i let so many opportunities pass right by me. im so fucking tired of crying to mitski songs and thinking about what a failure i am. i cant do this anymore. thereâ€™s no point. i ruined everything.

but i do think i want to get help. but i donâ€™t know how i can walk up to my mom and tell her iâ€™m suicidal. i donâ€™t want my family to deal with the costs of treatment. my other brother is already very mentally ill and sucks up a lot of attention+care because of it, i donâ€™t want to be another problem for them. i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m doing anymore
