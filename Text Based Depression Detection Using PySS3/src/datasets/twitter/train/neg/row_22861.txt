Iâ€™m worth more dead than I am aliveI have life insurance policies in the amount of $300,000. That amount is doubled if I die as the result of an accident. The more I think about it, the more it seems that it might be better for everyone if I die in a car accident. All I heard growing up was how my parents wanted me to study very hard so I can make lots of money and take care of them. 

I declared bankruptcy in 2017 so my financial future is now tainted with huge scarlet letter. If I die in an accident, that would leave my parents with $600,000 in life insurance proceeds. Itâ€™s not like I have much joy in my life anyway. As a gay man, I see all these straight couples getting married and starting families, things that I will never be able to enjoy. While my family might support my sexuality, they will always see my relationships and possible children as inferior.

I am so jealous of all these gorgeous guys that I went to college with. They are buff, have beautiful wives, children, and a normal life. I donâ€™t have anything of that and never will. I am a fat fuck who would never get the time of day from anyone. 

I really wish that someone would cause me to crash my car on the highway. That would solve all my problems.
