Everyone I interact with is worse for it. Consider this "hard mode.""Work on the parts of your personality you don't like" people say.

That's not what I dislike. I don't know how you don't understand that.

Remember when Mr. Rogers says, "It's you that I like / The way you are right now / The way down deep inside you"? That's what I hate.

That foundational core is a blighted ball of filth and foulness that the world would be better off without. All I do or have ever done is frustrate, irritate, or upset others. I'm a goddamn narcissist in disguise. I have the sex appeal of a septic wound. I'm about as lovable or worthwhile as entropy itself.

And you know how I know? Because I know me better than anyone or anything else possibly can. Just as you know yourself in that way.

**Stop saying the same things.**

"Accept yourself" - There's nothing to accept. It's a given, *a priori* fact that I am shit. The evidence has been insurmountable. Good luck disproving that. 

"It will get better" - Oh, you can see the future now? Go to hell. You're a liar. Half the people who ever died alone in a gulag or natural disaster zone thought it would get better, too.

"You don't need love to feel fulfilled" - Is that right? Which girlfriend told you that? Or was it your wife? Get bent. I'm 27 and never even had someone like me in a coy, childish way, much less a dance or kiss.

So you want to help? I doubt you actually do. Nobody wants to help anyone unless it helps themselves somehow. But in case you actually do want to, **shut up with the same tired old shit**. I'm not falling for it.
