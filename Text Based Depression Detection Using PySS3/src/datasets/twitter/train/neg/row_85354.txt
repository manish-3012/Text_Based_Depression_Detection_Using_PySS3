Suicidal thoughtsHello, I am writing to get some perspective on things.
I have been depressed before during my teenage years because I was so bullied.
After those times, I have been heart broken, sad, in a bad situation but I never thought about hurting myself.
Now, I am 34 and I have everything! I have a good job, I am doing another masters, I have a partner and an amazing dog. 
I also have problems, of course, family and stuff.
But it is crazy how I think about killing myself all the time. Everything became so stressful. Very simple things, like cleaning the house, brushing my hair, going for groceries, etc. I seat down to work and I start sweating like crazy.
I had some problems at work a few months ago. I had a boss that bullied me and made my life a hell. But I left that work and change countries. 
Just odd that I have these suicidal feelings now.
I feel so bad about myself all the time.
