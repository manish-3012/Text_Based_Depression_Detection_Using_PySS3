What are the potential consequences of confessing suicidal thoughts?I live in the UK. I want to go to some doctors asap to treat my depression, however I do wonder what would happen if I was completely honest about my thoughts. I don't want to end up taking mandatory treatment or leave, or it to have long lasting effects on my life (e.g. a record of it somewhere that may prevent me from doing certain things)

Likewise, the consequences of talking about this with university or work staff?
