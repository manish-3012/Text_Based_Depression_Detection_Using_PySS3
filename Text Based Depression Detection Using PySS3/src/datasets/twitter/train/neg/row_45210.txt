Why would so many people push the burden of existence upon someone?Why do people have to recreate bad genes over and over again, why canâ€™t they just stop reproducing when they have terrible genes. I wish my parents would have thought more about how many problems their children would have given our families and their disposition to endless mental and physical health illnessâ€™s and diseases. We donâ€™t need more terrible people to be breathing the oxygen and eating the food that could be going into people that want to live, and would work their hardest everyday to just be able to eat food everyday and have a roof over their head. From this post is the beginning of the end as I know it. As my consciousness will soon be swept from existence with nothing left but a dead body to decay and be eaten by larvae and worms until eventually I am pooped out and turned into dirt.

I bid you all Farewell in whatever happens after this life.
