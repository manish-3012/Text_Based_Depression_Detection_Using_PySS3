I'm going to be at home alone for the next two days, and I'm thinking about doing it...Maybe before I didn't want to do it so soon...but something happened and I feel like I can't do it anymore...
No one really knows that I'm suicidal, and I never intended on telling my parents. There's no point. Recently, they were worried about my grades and health. I know they are worried, but the way they express their thoughts are too extreme...My dad, he told me Iâ€™m a pig. He told me to put up a word of Pig on my wall to remind me that. (He was really angry because I wouldn't answer him. I didn't feel the need to with his aggressive attitude.)
He told me if I don't get my weight down, heart issues, diabetes are going to latch onto me. 
My mum, she told me about school work, and I need to get a high Atar to get into a good Uni, which will lead me to a good life. 
This is all set upon that I will live till then. Which I probably won't...
