24 here with childhood PTSDI have so much pain from my past. I can't function. I just feel the need to let it out. My family hurt me emotionally so much. My mother always siding with my father who was incompetently abusive. My mom to keep us financially upfloat would leave me in the home with my brother who would just take his anger out on me of our shitty parents. I tried finding an escapee by finding friends at school as a child only to be bullied by this one kid all my elementary. I never told anyone about my feelings growing up because no one ever bothered to take care of me and give me the time needed to grow healthy. I just feel I don't fit. I lied to myself all these years about myself and how everything around me never affected me,but truth is, it hurt me so much and the pain in my heart along with the void is unbereable. I just wish it was all over every single day. I am useless. My father was right. I was always useless. I am so empty in the inside. I have an amazing boyfriend who loves me and if i'm not suffocating me I feel shitty all day. I'm dependent on him. I just wish I could die. I am just a piece of shit waisting oxygen.
