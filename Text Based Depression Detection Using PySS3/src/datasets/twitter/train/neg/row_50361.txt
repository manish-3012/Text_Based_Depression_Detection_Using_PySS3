it will be over soon and i can sleepi honestly think i am going to hang myself soon

i wish it weren't such a big deal to kill youself. i want to say goodbye to people properly

i don't want it to be a big surprise and they all say 'i wish i could have stopped them' or 'i wish i could have told her what i wanted to say'

i want to hug my mum for the last time and for us to both know it's the last time and be happy that i am going to a better place
