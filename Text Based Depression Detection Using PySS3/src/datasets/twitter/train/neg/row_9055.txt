good day to die?well i've had depression and many suicidal attempts in the last 7 years. I'm 23 right now haven't been in treatment for the last 3 years and been drinking heavily for the last year. I have no job so I resort to stealing the alcohol whenever I get the chance. Also been stealing norcos, morphine, xanax, klonopins from drug dealers. I keep combining all of this hoping I would just not wake up the next day, but hey here I am still. I'm tired of waking up every morning. I just finished my 2nd 40oz and whatever tequila was left from last night. I've taken 6 mg of xanax along with 6 325 mg / 10 mg norcos. Just found some ativan too, only 2mg. I've been burning myself all day and have found just what I need to hang  myself. I hope this works
