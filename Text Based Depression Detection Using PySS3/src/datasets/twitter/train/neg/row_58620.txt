Iâ€™ve started to want to give upSpent my life fighting as we all do, but reached a point where it doesnâ€™t feel worth carrying on. Was sold a lie that things get better I order to keep me from killing myself as a kid and have come to realise thatâ€™s not the case. Every day is fix peoples problems at work to earn money to survive until tomorrow. Iâ€™ve never felt like it was worth doing only that one day it might be and 20 years of wondering when it gets better and life becomes easy and it never does. Venting to yall as Iâ€™m tired.
