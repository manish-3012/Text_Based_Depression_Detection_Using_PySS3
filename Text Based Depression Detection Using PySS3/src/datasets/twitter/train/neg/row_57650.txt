i dont know...Its the unknowing if ill ever be happy again.
Its not knowing if i should be depressed or not because my parents told me they people have it worse.
Its having to live with the permanent factors that will always sway my life towards the negative
Its the constant reminder from everybody that Iâ€™m disappointing and too negative. 
Its never having the ability to be optimistic.
Its the questioning of my future will be worse. 
Why cant i kill myself? Whats stopping me. I genuinely think that i am insane, thinking like no-one else does. Please i donâ€™t know what to do. Im not happy and never will be.
