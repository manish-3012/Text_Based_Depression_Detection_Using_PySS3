Thereâ€™s no point anymoreIâ€™m afreshman in college and Iâ€™m so depressed and tired of life. I started college this semester and I hate it and all I do is go to class and have work when I dont. Iâ€™m sick and feel sick every single day and I have no friends. My best friend goes to a college near me but she has a whole new group of friends and never asks to hang out anymore. I live alone and Iâ€™ve been depressed for so many years but now itâ€™s so much worse and I literally see no point in life. Whatâ€™s the point if I hate college and  whatâ€™s a the point if all we do for the rest of our life is work. I donâ€™t want to go to college anymore but thereâ€™s nothing else for me to do. I literally donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I have a mental breakdown everyday and nobody even knows. My family lives close by but theyâ€™re dysfunctional. All that makes me happy in life are dogs Iâ€™m not even kidding?? Iâ€™m thinking of killing myself but Iâ€™m scared and donâ€™t want my family to be upset and I donâ€™t know how I would do it. I just donâ€™t see myself ever being happy.. I always thought college would be fun and I would finally be happy but itâ€™s the opposite. I always thought things would get better but they never did so I donâ€™t think they ever will. Sorry this is so long and just a rant .
