I cried really hard when Jim Carrey's son kissed his first girl in Kidding. [24M]I hope someone reads the whole thing.

I wish Iâ€™d experienced youth like that. Nothing storybook. Just the stupid shit he and and his friends did. How it introduced him to the girl. The scene on the hill. How he was growing up and learning about people and the world. Iâ€™m not a virgin, and this isnâ€™t really about wishing I got laid more. I just know I did it wrong, and there are a lot of things Iâ€™ll never experience. Iâ€™d have to recreate some sort of formative years to feel normal again.

Iâ€™ve had two bouts of psychosis in the last three years, and It's been maybe 7 years since I was really okay. I don't know how to reclaim the worldview, the opinions, or the personality I had before the psychosis restarted a year ago, let alone the self I really want back from before everything started. I'm not here anymore. It feels like way, way too many overlapping factors to unravel over the last 5-7 years. Itâ€™s too many years in the past, too many cognitive distortions to disprove, reinforced by a person whose validation I will never stop wanting, too much shame, too much lying to myself too much failure. (I see my therapist tomorrow, and I've been to three psychiatric hospitals this year.) My mind doesnâ€™t make much sense a lot of the time, and the world around me is slowly making less sense. 

â€œI want you kids to look around you today and think about your future. This is the time of your life when anything is possible.â€ I wish my life was ahead of me again.

I used to be a bright young kid. Now all I can think about is swinging from my parentâ€™s gazebo (lost my house when my roommate enlisted in August and I couldnâ€™t afford it). I bought rope from Loweâ€™s to hang myself a month ago. I know Iâ€™ll never both go back to the store for thicker rope and figure out how to tie a noose. Iâ€™m a failure. I hope I get the courage to. I deserve it.
