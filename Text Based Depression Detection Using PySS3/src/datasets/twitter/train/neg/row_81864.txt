My ex-girlfriend is very right about meI'm nothing but a selfish pathetic human being i tried to act like it didn't phase me i feel like anything else she could of said would of been fine but I don't know why being called a pathetic person hurt me so bad,

maybe i should just end it all and help the rid the world of 1 pathetic worthless person all i want is to put a gun in my mouth and blow my brains out and end it all, I have slim to 0 reasons to live and life is just a pain.
