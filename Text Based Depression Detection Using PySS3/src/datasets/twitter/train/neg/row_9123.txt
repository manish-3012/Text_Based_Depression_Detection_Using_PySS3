seeing flashes of self harm &amp; suicide when zoning outAnyone else have this happen? Lately, depression has a taken a new turn where I find myself just staring off at nothing - like someone would if they were in thought, but heavily glazed over. My contacts will usually go out of focus and fog up. Things almost don't feel real, like what you're seeing becomes a flattened image and your environment falls away.

Since that's been happening I'll sometimes get flashes of incredibly violent and detailed self harm. It's happening more frequently now that a new semester has started and it's starting to happen when I'm in class.

Just looking to hear if others have dealt with something similar?
