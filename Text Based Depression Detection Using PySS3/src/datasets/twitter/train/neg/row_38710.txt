I don't feel like my wife loves me at all.She's just fucking meh about me. She never wants sex, she always says she wants to go out more but always wants me to make the plans with no input from her beyond "I don't wanna do that". She just sits upstairs all day playing on the computer. If I ask shell come down stairs with me but she admitted to me recently that "it feels like a burden". I told her I was depressed and that I want to go see a therapist and she didn't even ask why. I literaly cannot live without this woman, she is the only reason I do anything at all but now I feel like she doesn't need me in the slightest.
