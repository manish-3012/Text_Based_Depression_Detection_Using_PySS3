I canâ€™t do this anymoreI canâ€™t do this anymore, I do not want to be alive. I donâ€™t want to feel this pain anymore. I donâ€™t want to not understanding people and having them not understand me. I donâ€™t want to be alive, there has not been one positive thing that has happened. People tell me to change my mindset and somehow be positive when I have people making fun of me and mocking me for my disabilities. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I canâ€™t deal with people talking down to me because I need more help than the average person. I canâ€™t do this anymore I just want to fucking die like they want me to.
