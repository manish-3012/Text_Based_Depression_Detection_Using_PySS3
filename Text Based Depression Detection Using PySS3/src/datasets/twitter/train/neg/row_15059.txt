[TW] On crossroadsI cut myself last week.

I took out my father's hunting knife, sat in the shower, and I buried it into my skin, almost in a sawing motion, until my wrist hurt and the cold water brought me back to my senses. The only thought I had was, "Wow. Look at how stupid I am. I can't even cut right."

And so I did it, every day, for the past few days. I'm avoiding my family and the few friends I have left. I figured I'd be better off dead. That my parents would rather have a dead child than a dropout. That I'll end up disappointing myself if I stay. That maybe I wasn't born to face disappointment anyway. And dropping out of college was the last straw. I don't know what to do; suddenly I'm lost in guilt and anger and emptiness. On one hand I really need to stop cutting, but on the other hand, it may be my chance to escape---if I cut deep enough.
