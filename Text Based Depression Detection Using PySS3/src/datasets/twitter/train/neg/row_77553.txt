I think I'm going insaneI'm havimg some real issues here. And it's not like me, at all. I literally decided I want to kill myself. Like, tonight. And I am serious. 

There is a lot going on and I really don't think it's worth going into. It's boring life stuff. 

I know I'll use the knife my mother sharpened for us. I'm so mad at her. And I know everyone will be better off without me. I know I'm wasting resources. I know it's over. 

I literally just want to smoke some cigarettes and drink some beer and take care of a few things. I think I will do this by Monday.
