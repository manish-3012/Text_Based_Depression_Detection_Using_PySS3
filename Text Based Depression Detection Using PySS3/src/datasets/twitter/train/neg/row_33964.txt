Does anyone else feel like they NEED to be institutionalised?I often daydream about going to prison or (after another failed suicide attempt) being sent to some psychiatric health place. I think I'm attracted by the idea of being allowed to start from scratch. God knows that almost all of my suicidal urges come from a fear of the past, maybe that's why I struggle to see a future without wiping the slate clean and starting again. 

To lock myself away from drink and distractions, to be forced into a routine that, at first, I'll cynically protest and undermine (not in prison though) , only to come out as the stamp-approved normal person that I've always wanted to be, forced into it because I have no recourse in browsing reddit or playing video games or getting drunk to spend my time.

But then I'm scared because I know when I come out it'll be so hard to *not* fall into the old routines. I want to be put away somewhere for so long that I am broken, my black dog to be put down, like a quarantine for the soul.

Apologies for the ramble, somewhat drunk but have no access atm to anything i could kill myself with
