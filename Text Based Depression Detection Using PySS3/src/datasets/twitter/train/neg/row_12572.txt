Nothing excites me about the future and the presentI don't want a girlfriend/wife. I don't want children. I don't like working. I don't enjoy doing anything. I don't want friends. I hate my family. I don't want to go to school. I don't want to go to the store. I don't want to feed myself. I don't have motivation. I don't want to grow old. I don't want to live in my ugly body. I don't want to talk. I don't want to breath. I wish I was never born. So I have no business staying alive anymore.
