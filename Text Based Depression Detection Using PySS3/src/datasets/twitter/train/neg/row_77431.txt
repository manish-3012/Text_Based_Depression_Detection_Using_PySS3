The best wayI've given up. I can't go on this way. I've already decided that. But I'd like to go about this in a way that will cause minimal harm. I'm not worried about the pain it will cause others, Im all alone in this life. I am worried about a stranger or someone that will find me after the fact. I was thinking about hanging myself, but I'm worried about the poor soul that would be left to find me. I thought about taking a bunch of pills and just riding it out in my car on the beach, but I worry that it won't be affective. What is the best way for me to go about this without fucking up another persons life? I wish I could just combust into a million little pieces and fly away where no one would have to find me.
