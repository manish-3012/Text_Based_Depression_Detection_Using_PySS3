My life is goneI can't but i want to. But i just can't. My poor mother. I can't bear it. I don't know what to do. Do i wait for mt family to die? I don't know how long that will take. I love my family. Theyvare all i have. I guess Im lucky to have a family that loves me. despite all our issues they are still my family. How selfish of me to want to throw it all away. That's the thing, i have no reason to be like this. If i dont want to live i obviously don't deserve to. I wish i could give my life to a dying cancer patient. This world is so unfair. Im full of grief every day. Life has just passed me by. I miss my dogs. When rhey died i wish i could have went with them. I wish my mom had given birth to someone who makes her happy and is happy. Not someone who wants to kill themself. It would destroy her. I'm so selfish. That's what hurts the most. My mom.. i just want her to know im sorry. Every day im so fucking sorry. I wish i could make her proud. I wish i was someone else. I don't want a future. You cant help someone who doesn't want it. Im going to wake up in the same bed and the cycle will comtinue and nothing will change. Nothingnat all
