Cut off contact with partner of two years, ordered drugs online, Iâ€™m ready. Yeah! ðŸ‘ðŸ»Iâ€™m planning to overdose on seizure medication and hopefully go out as painlessly as possible. I donâ€™t know how long it takes to get here because itâ€™s generics from a web medication site.If that fails Iâ€™m jumping from on top of a parking garage in the area. Not really a poetic way to go but it gets the job done for sure. I was hoping with the pills I could die near the beach or in a forest? Somewhere peaceful and really special to me. But beggars canâ€™t be choosers! 

I spent another miserable day at work to come home and be told what a failure I am by my parents again and have my mother insinuate I should try one community college class instead of grad school. I had coworkers tell me how ugly I was and customers tell me how stupid. I slept even less and I had planned to get a tattoo with an amazing artist but had a bunch of people tell me how ugly and pathetic girls with tattoos are. I just want my body to feel like mine to control, not the guy who raped me. Iâ€™m done making plans for the future that involve trying to use this life and body. 

I want to go out in a way where they can donate my organs to help someone else. That would be a really great thing I think. Being able to give people the life I didnâ€™t want? My stepmom used to say â€œthe world is overpopulated enough. Anyone who wants to die just should.â€ Im there. Iâ€™ve made peace. And hopefully pushing away people close to me will ensure less hurt on their part. Im also going to write up something that makes it clear I place blame and responsibility solely on myself. This isnâ€™t the pity party and Iâ€™m not going out as some weak piece of shit.
