Being molested as a child and continuing the behavior.My aunt went the a rough divorce when I was around 3 years old. She had a very abusive husband. Her and my 14 year old cousin lived with me and my parents on and off for a little over 3 years. Consistently over this time my cousin would want me to sleep in the same bed as her because I was "so cute" and would instagate playing "doctor" every  night that I slept in the same bed. She had me touch all of her "privates" and to me at first it seemed like a silly game. I felt super uncomfortable, especially when she wanted to touch me. After a short while I began to enjoy it and became very sexually attracted. I eventually was willing for her do the same things to me. My parents became suspicious eventually and I was told to lie to them. After my aunt and cousin found a  place this continued on until I was around 8 years old. I have only told my gf of 3 years about this. And only this part.  Unfortunately this is not the worst of it. Because I had no idea what I was engaging in was wrong (at least that's what I tell myself), besides the fact I had to lie to my parents, i recreated the "games" my cousin and I would play with my friends and nephew (approximately the same age as I was) until I was around 9/10. I honestly feel like the worst person to ever live. And the constant guilt is eating at my soul. I understand that I was completely ignorant of how my actions could impact some of the people I care about the most, but it makes me want to die inside that I ever continued on a behavior that could fuck someone up as badly as I most likely did. I cant live with this.
