I just want to ventPlease donâ€™t say donâ€™t give up or be hopeful or any of that I just want to vent. Iâ€™m tired, Iâ€™m giving up I want to give up I want to go. Iâ€™m tied by responsibilities. I have a little girl. I donâ€™t even have the choice to go. My shitty moral mathematics wonâ€™t let me. But Iâ€™m so tired, Iâ€™m so mad Iâ€™m so full of anxiety. I have nothing to live for except responsibility. Everyday is a regret everyday Iâ€™m reminded. I hate this shit I want go. My life is an obligation to my family if I go no one will take care of them. I want to be free. I probably wonâ€™t go, i just want to vent. Thereâ€™s so much noise, annoyance, I like it when itâ€™s quiet I want o go so that itâ€™s quiet. Iâ€™m dragging on, I canâ€™t do this, thereâ€™s no choice no choice no choice Iâ€™m never given a choice. I think it about it all the time how I wanted to be free ever since high school and when I gambled my opportunity I failed and gotten more responsibility. I know more context is needed but Iâ€™m just venting. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m fucking sorry. 
People canâ€™t drive I hate them. 
People are so loud they are so selfish 
Iâ€™m tired of people. 
Iâ€™m tired of life
Iâ€™m tired of pretending. I donâ€™t want to fake smile anymore
Please make the noise stop 
Iâ€™m 25
Iâ€™m Asian, responsibility is a culture ingrained 
Iâ€™m trying Iâ€™m tying Iâ€™m trying itâ€™s not good enough 
I have a little girl. She needs a father
I should have killed myself before ever having a child how stupid of me. 
Now I have to endure, endure for her
Maybe Iâ€™ll kill myself when sheâ€™s older like 21 (sheâ€™s 3 now
I hate my life I hate my job I need it, I need it to support my family. 
Everyday I wish someone would hit me in a car
Sometimes Iâ€™ll think about getting my veins with a knife 
But Iâ€™ll make all the excuses to myself to live, Iâ€™m a coward but someday maybe Iâ€™ll find the courage or just be mad enough. Someday Iâ€™ll be free where I wonâ€™t have to hear all your bullshit society.
