I wish I could just die in my sleepBecause I can't kill my self. I won't use a gun or hang myself because it's not fair to leave a mess in the house. And I don't know how much of my  medicine to take to kill me. 

If I die in my sleep of a natural cause, I could stop feeling so horrible, and my family wouldn't have to live knowing I wanted to die

:(
