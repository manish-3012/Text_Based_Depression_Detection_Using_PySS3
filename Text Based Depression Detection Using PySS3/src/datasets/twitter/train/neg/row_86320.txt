I'm getting worseI almost shot myself Saturday night, I was so close. I haven't eaten anything in 5 days and I passed out in the shower this morning and I couldn't get up without my vision turning red and black. I feel like a walking skeleton. I actually really don't feel like anything at all. I feel like I don't exist. I looked at my arm last night and I had to convince myself that that was actually my arm. I've never been this fucked up before. I feel like I'm being haunted by myself. I stare at the wall for hours on end. I don't think I've ever been this bad.
