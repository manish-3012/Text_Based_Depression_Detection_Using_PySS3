Suicide is inevitableI am a 20yr old male. My brain thinks certain unimportant sounds in the environment are threats. Those sounds are extremely frustrating because they are all i can think about. I have to constantly wrestle to get my mind back from each of those sounds. I am afraid to go outside because i can be stuck in a situation where there is an irritating sound. my house is not exactly a refuge because of the creaking floors. I am a prisoner in my room. I used to be able to go on two 40km walks per week. I don't remember the sounds being able to get this bad. Maybe i have become sensitized to the sounds by spending too much time inside. or maybe there just wasn't that much construction when i went on those long walks. I do not want to experience more of the sounds. I have atypical autism, the doctors and psychiatrists cant do shit. I am unable to go anywhere without the fear of being debilitated by some sound. I cannot see how i can have a relationship. I really cannot see how my life is worth the crap i have to put up with. there is not much to my life anyway. 

earplugs make the sounds worse

I'm going to get a knife with surgical steel tomorrow. I can do a lot of damage before i am debilitated by pain.
