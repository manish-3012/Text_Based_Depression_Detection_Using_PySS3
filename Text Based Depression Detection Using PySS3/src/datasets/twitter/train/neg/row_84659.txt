Why does everyone treat me like absolute shit?It's as if my role in life is to be stepped on by everyone and everything. I have no friends and even my girlfriend said she hates me and can no longer stand me even though I've done nothing but love and support her. I've never had a genuine connection with another human being, a time where I was genuinely valued and appreciated rather than used and discarded. Whenever I try doing something selfless or kind, I get taken advantage of and emotionally abused. Even when I had friends, they constantly made fun of me behind my back or left me when I was no longer good enough. 

Is that what I am to everyone? A tool? Do I have no inherent value as a human being? Am I a monster that's impossible to love?

I should just fucking die already, nobody cares - they only pretend to until they reveal their true colors.
