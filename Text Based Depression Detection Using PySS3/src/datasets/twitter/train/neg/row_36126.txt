Im in love with my best friend.This is my first post here, so bear with me

Im talking ti someone right now, its gotten pretty far. I love them, a lot.
But i donâ€™t know if iâ€™m in love with them.
Because when Im I should be thinking about the person im romantically talking to, my best friend pops up in mind.
Her laugh, her personality, her jokes, her looks, her everything has literally blinded me
Shes perfect, i love her,
We dated once, it didnâ€™t get too far because my mental health was messed up, she was so understanding.
Weâ€™ve done a lot
four day calls, laugh, talk about meeting up (lives a couple states over), shes been here through my attempts, places her mc bed next to mine ;), weâ€™ve even gotten intimate several times

shes so, perfect. I love her, i want to call her mine.
Im in love with her, but

She has a girlfriend.  Just to clarify, iâ€™m F, bi, shes F, lesbian.
Her and her gf have been dating for four months, theyâ€™re going great, have never argued, talked about moving in w/ each other, gave each other gifts, all the good stuff.
When she first started dating her, i was heart broken, i felt betrayed for no reason, we werent even dating
but, i still cant stop thinking about her,
Ive never had this reaction with an ex.

I, dont know what to do. I thought i loved the person i am talking to, 
but im not in love with them

because im in love with her? i dont know what to doooooo :((,,
All of this is spiraling my mental health, i know i need to focus on myself,
but shes just so,, i dont know
