I just don't know what to do anymoreI don't think I'm depressed. At least i don't feel depressed, not all the time. I actually feel happy and content in some periods of life.

But it always comes back me feeling worthless. I'm probably the most useless person in the world. I don't have any ambitions, a few things make me happy these days and I don't feel loved. My friends all seem to get along very well but i feel like a fucking outcast, a tag-along and everytime I open myself to people it just feel like I'm playing pitty.

I hate myself. I hate that every relationship I have feels superficial. I feel like everyone has a special someone, be it a friend or lover, but not me. I'm no one's first choice, not even my own, and even through all that I'm too much of a coward to kill myself.

Part of me wishes i could have the courage. I also fear this is just a phase but I don't want it to be. I want to get worst until I can finally put an end to things cause I'm not worth it. I'm human dead weight and I should be treated as so.

Fuck me, I shouldn't be doing this but I hate myself. I fucking hate myself and the worst part is that I'll never change that.

It doesn't help that no one loves me. Everytime I've gotten close to something good with someone I manage to fuck it up because I'm so goddammed pathetic.
