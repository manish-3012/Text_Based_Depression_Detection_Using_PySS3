There's something very, very wrong with meMy psychiatrist put me on 10mg of abilify 2 weeks ago. This was done in an attempt to titrate me across to something similar to seroquel so that I can wean off of it. The longer I took the abilify, the more my suicidal ideation climbed and climbed to the point that on sunday I was browsing methods on the best way to kill myself by hanging and teaching myself to tie a slipknot. The adrenaline kicked in and I realised that things were getting serious. So I took my scarves over to a friend's house. I had forgotten that I own a belt. 

I've been feeling very agitated, so much so that I've been experiencing urges to self harm and cut myself. I normally never have those sort of urges. I'm just desperate to get rid of the feelings of agitation. My doctor prescribed my klonopin to help, and it does, but I can only have 3 in a day. Sometimes, when the suicidal urges and agitation is extreme, that 3 in a day isn't enough because I can't sleep.

I stopped taking the abilify at the behest of my GP on Monday, but the agitation isn't much better. How can I deal with this without killing myself or hurting myself? Does anyone have any advice? I've got a bit of time before I see my psychiatrist again.
