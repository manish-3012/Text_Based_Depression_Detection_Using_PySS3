Fantasizing about doing it.Whenever I feel down, at least more than "normal" I start to think about how badly I want to die, to kill myself.  It is tiring, it isn't "natural". The past couple days whenever I shower is all I'm thinking about. Killing myself, I spent a lot of time thinking about ways to do it, what would happen to my body. What would my family deal with it.

I got the idea to start saving money, money for my family to deal with my body, I wouldn't want them to spent money on that. As for how to end myself, I had the opportunity to do exactly that a couple days ago. But at the moment all I could think of was not to harm anyone, it was a couple second but maybe if it has lasted longer... At the end, the whole situation just made me more sad.

I don't want to keep being a weigh on my family. I already know that my future isn't very bright, I know that no one will care about me, I know that no one will love me. I just deserve to die.
