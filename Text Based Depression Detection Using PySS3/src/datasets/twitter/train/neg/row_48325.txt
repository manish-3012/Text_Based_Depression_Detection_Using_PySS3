I was wondering.(Ramble)I canâ€™t deny the heavy, cold ache in my stomach, the hot tears that keep me awake at night, the nightmares when I do finally fall asleep, the feeling that Iâ€™ll never belong.  
I canâ€™t run from it. 

I was wondering, does anyone else have a buildup when the suicidal thoughts hit?
Like, it will start small.. an escape if things get worse. Then, the feelings will escalate and push down like a demand.
â€œYou NEED to start planning.â€
Suddenly, itâ€™s overwhelming and hits you like a train. 
â€œGET IT OVER WITH! DO IT!!â€
All consuming, and the only thing you can focus on. You need to get out. To finally be done.

But, just as quickly as it comes, it starts to slow down and become the safe escape that you can use if youâ€™re feeling trapped again. Back to the â€œideaâ€ stage. 
Each time it happens for me, it gets harder and harder to even myself out to the â€œescape routeâ€ feeling.

Whatâ€™s it like for you?
