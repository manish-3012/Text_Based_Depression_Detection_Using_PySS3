Am I ever going to be able to do it?I'm in pain all day everyday. It's not even just mental pain anymore, it's physical too. Agony that feels like I'm in fucking hell. I just want the pain to STOP. Why won't anyone just help me put an end to the misery? 

Getting help in therapy is too fucking slow. The loneliness and lack of affection from other people is an unexplainable kind of pain, and something I won't have for years still. I just want to do it and be dead again.
