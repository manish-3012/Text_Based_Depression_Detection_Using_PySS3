This might be the last yearI've always teetered on the edge. Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to just stop. My mom was not even a teenager when I was born, so I took her youth. My step-dads mostly ever just beat me or threatened it. Up until now, I never dated someone who didn't just turn around and cheat on me or use me like a plaything, but now two years into my marriage I've had sex less than 10 times - all of them out of pity for me. Before we got married, he said he didnt love me anymore, and I was too weak to end it. Now he acts like nothing happened but he won't touch me because his dry grip is better.

When I was a kid, I always said I would give it 30 whole years. I achieved things thought impossible for someone of my background. I have a house, I have 'good' debt, I have dogs. My husband is talking about children, but the only reason I havent killer myself yet is a combination of my dogs needing me (because my husband can barely care for himself) and Undertale.

My health has gotten drastically worse. If i don't kill myself, I think I've perfectly set myself up to die from malnutrition or something. 

It feels like its too late now. I feel like I'm trapped. My mom says this is normal. My husband says he cares about me and loves me and finds me attractive, but he would rather jerk off than be with me.

I dont know what to do. I know the obvious answers, but I risk losing everything anyway... What's the point.
