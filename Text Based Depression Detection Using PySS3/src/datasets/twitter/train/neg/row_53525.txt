This is the only place i can talk anymoreIâ€™m deeply depressed. I sat at work with tears in my eyes all day. This feeling will be with me for life, I have to realize depression is forever. Each time I come out of it Iâ€™m like convinced Iâ€™ll never feel so low again. And then it inevitably comes creeping back so slowly until it finally grips me in itâ€™s familiar (almost comfortable) embrace. 

Wish I wasnâ€™t such a pussy. I need to it to be over once and for all.
