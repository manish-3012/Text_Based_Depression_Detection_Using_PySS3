No friendsI don't have a lot of friends and it makes me feel worthless of myself. I don't really know how to make any, and when I do I mess it up completely. It just sucks so bad especially at a time like this where I'm anxious nonstop. I feel like I have no one to talk to about my anxieties and what's going on in my life so it makes it harder to function because I feel like no one cares about me anyway so working on trying to fix it is useless
