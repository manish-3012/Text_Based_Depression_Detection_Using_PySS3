Tonight, I swear to fucking god, tonight.My family doesnt own a gun, I've always been afraid of pain.  My sister does.  Keeps it loaded and everything.  We're having dinner at her house in about 10 minutes.  After dinner, the pain ends, finally.  All I gotta do is find the mother fucking gun.  Find the damn gun, pull the trigger, and the pain is gone.  Fuck this world, fuck everyone in it.  Idk why, I felt like I had to tell someone.  Maybe its validation, I dont pretend to fucking know.  Wish me luck
