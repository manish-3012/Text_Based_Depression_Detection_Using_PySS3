I Don't Want To Live.I'll keep this short and simple.

I'm hopeless. I don't want to live. I've tried to want to live, but I can't make it happen. I'm tired of being alone, even when I try to not be alone. People don't like me. I'll definitely never have a relationship or love in my life. I'll never have a passionate hobby or job. I can't enjoy the small things. I'm just a drag. There's nothing that I want that will ever be within my reach because I'm weak. I don't want to live.
