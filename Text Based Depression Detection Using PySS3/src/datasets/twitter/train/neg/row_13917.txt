First time here in a whileI was doing alright over quarantine. Then the reality of finishing high school, applying to and planning for college, going back to work, and the constant pressure to do something instead of sit in my room and pity myself hit like a ton of bricks. Now I remember why i was cutting myself in February and honestly its only a matter of time til that starts up again. Life seems so pointless right now. Im already suicidal in high school i can't imagine itll be much better when im 30 and working a job i hate.
