Been like this since I was 16.Hello everyone. I don't really know how to start this off... I have been dealing with depression and anxiety since around 16 years old. I don't really know why, I have never been able to find the source. I have pretty severe ADD. This has caused havoc in my relationships, school work, and social life. I feel extremely lost in the world most of the day and wonder what am I even doing here. I'm 21 years old, finishing my 3rd year of community college and feel like I'm just wasting my money (student loans) and my parent's money. I have a 2.8 GPA but that doesn't really say much for a community college or any college really. I'm constantly thinking about how to end my life but can't imagine the pain it would put my parents through. I have never been worried about hurting my friends as I don't have many. Just worried about how crushed my family would be and that's pretty much always been the reason why I couldn't bring myself to do it. I wish there was a way to be unborn. I feel completely fucking worthless and dont even really care about my future. I'm surpised I haven't dabbled in drugs to ease my pain. None of this probably makes much sense because of my ADD its going in a thousand directions. Relationships have always been a main source of depression for me, I just currently got out of one in which I really liked the girl but she couldnt give it "100 percent" due to how busy she was which I respect but now im stuck here wondering what she is doing or who she is with. Little thoughts like this eat me alive. I just dont understand and I'm extremely lost in the world.
