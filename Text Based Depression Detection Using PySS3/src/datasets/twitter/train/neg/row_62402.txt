having suicidal thoughts. what are the legal implications?I began a counseling regimen a couple weeks ago. At that point, I wasn't having suicidal thoughts. These days, however, I've been having them nonstop. I've read that if I confess this, they might have to put take me to "emergency care" against my will. What does that even mean? Is this true? I don't really want to be taken against my will for anything. I just want to get out of this rut.
