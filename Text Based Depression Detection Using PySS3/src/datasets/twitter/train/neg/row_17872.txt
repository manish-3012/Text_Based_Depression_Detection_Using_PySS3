It's getting worse. AgainI feelâ€¦ hopeless. I have to face an abuser, I have to go through school, I have to wake up at 7:30 each day (on the really good days.) all of these things I have to do but I just don't have the energy. Every night I think about killing or cutting myself and I can't even do that because of a deal I made with my boyfriend and I just can't handle it. I need something to drown out my own thoughts. I've been getting existential thoughts more and more now. Every two seconds I'll think of it. And then I think of killing myself. 




I just don't want to deal with this anymore.
