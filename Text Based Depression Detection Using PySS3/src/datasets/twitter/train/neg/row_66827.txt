Suicidal but not depressed?Female, age 19, college student.

Almost my entire life Iâ€™ve struggled with mental health issues. Anxiety, severe depression, anorexia, ADHD, and dermatillomania (OCD). When I was in my early-mid teen years, I self harmed almost every single day and I attempted suicide 5 times in total. Self harm and suicide became my obsession bad then, and I was so extremely depressed for a 3 year period that I barely remember anything from it. Eventually, my mom found out about how serious my mental health issues were, so I was fortunate enough to start seeing a therapist and to go on anti-depressants and ADHD meds. It took a couple of years, but eventually after a max-dose of Zoloft, frequent therapy visits and supportive friends/family, I started to recover. I stopped self harming and I stopped thinking about suicide so much. I became happy again, and the past 2 years were some of the best years of my life.

However, my mental health has taken a turn in an odd way. Iâ€™m currently in college, and I love my roommates, friends, classes, and my school. But recently Iâ€™ve been starting to fantasize about suicide and self harm again, which is weird because overall, Iâ€™m not NEARLY as depressed as I used to be. I relapsed again (cutting) after 2 years and itâ€™s become my drug again. Whenever my roommates are gone, I seriously consider hanging myself in the shower or overdosing on pills. But this seriously makes no sense to me... Iâ€™m STILL on the max dose of Zoloft, and my life is overall so good and I should be so happy! I donâ€™t even feel depressed, I just feel numb and â€œmehâ€ all the time. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me, and my dark thoughts are scaring me.

Iâ€™m the kind of person who NEEDS to find explanations for everything, and Iâ€™m trying to figure out why I could be feeling this way. Here are my ideas.

1. My body has gotten too used to my Zoloft (Iâ€™ve been on it for 5 years, max dose for 3.5 or so) and they are therefore slowly starting to not work.
2. I recently started drinking a little bit (like, 3 times in my life total) and after drinking I did get super depressed... Could that be the root of my problem?
3. Iâ€™m not as athletic or healthy as I used to be in high school? I used to swim for the swim team 16 hours per week, and now I donâ€™t even have time (or motivation) to work out 2 hours per week.

Iâ€™m lost and confused. If anyone could help me to try to figure my shit out I would really appreciate it. Am I weird for feeling this way? Has anybody else felt this way? Does anyone know any other reasons that could explain why Iâ€™m feeling this way? Feel free to ask me any follow up questions and please share your own experiences. I feel so stupid for feeling so down when I shouldnâ€™t be.

Thank you.
