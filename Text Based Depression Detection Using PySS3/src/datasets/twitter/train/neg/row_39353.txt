WishesI wish I grew up in a different circumstance. No childhood disability ,two stable and hard-working parents, no repression of sexuality, just a normal healthy past. Now, I have the sins of my past following me into adulthood. Everything I know, I learned from the people around me. I have tried to emotionally break away as far as I can. I am absolutely miserable. I hate living like this. By turning 21 in the coming days, I feel absolutely worthless. I donâ€™t think any sane person could like me/care for me in real life. My closeted sexuality has driven past the state of self-hate to more of a constant mental annoyance anytime I think about it. I have connected with people on here but in real life, itâ€™s like I donâ€™t exist. I have been alone for al of my life. Not even a glimpse of the idea that someone has wanted me. Besides 1 or 2 friends along that way, I have been mostly isolated from the world for as long as I can remember. I feel so wasted. I have so much anger and frustration built up in me. All the emotions bottled up because I have no where to let them out. Listening to music can only soothe for so long. I am on the brink everyday. Itâ€™s quite pathetic. Sleeping is the only time I find true peace. I am so scared of whatâ€™s ahead of me once if I tie the noose. Man, I am so broken.
