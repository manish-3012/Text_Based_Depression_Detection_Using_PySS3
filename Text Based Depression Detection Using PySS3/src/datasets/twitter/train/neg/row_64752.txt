I just cant hold it together anymore.Im sitting here with tears streaming down my face as i write this. My depression is taking over again. I feel lik a shitty mom, a shitty wife and an all around awful person. I feel like everyone around me would be better without me. I feel lik my daughter and husband deserve better than me n its the first time in a long time that i have really thought about killing myself. Im so scared. I dont want to leave them and i dont want them to see me dead. I just dont know what to do anymore.
