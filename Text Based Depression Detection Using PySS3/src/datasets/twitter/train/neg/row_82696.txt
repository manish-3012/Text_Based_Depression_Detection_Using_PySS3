I want to kill myselfTitle.

I used to be such a good kid.
I don't think I'll ever beat depression.
I'm alone, and I wanted to cut my arm lengthwise, but my roommate only has little steak knives and I knew it probably wouldn't work.

My parents are so proud of me but If they knew the truth they wouldn't.

I'm not really a Christian anymore. I'd like to, I just can't believe it for some reason.

I look at porn, and drink, and party.

I'm a fat piece of shit now, and I don't have any friends I've made since high school.

I couldn't even get wasted because I can't buy liquor until the spring.

I spent like 5 minutes telling myself what a piece of shit I was in the mirror, so now I even feel like a dick.

No one will even read this. Eh, fuck me.

These subs have a ton of rules and I didn't read the sidebar so it'll prolly be taken down anyways.
