What's the point of music if no one wants to hear it?I'm 22 years old. My passion has always been music, but I can't do anything with that in a backwater town like where I'm from.  Dime-a-dozen "talent" and looks. No job, no S/O, no money to move. Yeah, I have relatives I could move in with out of state, but I'd just push my burden onto them. I'm just so fucking envious of people who play mediocre music at best and get so fucking lucky to have success just drop into their lap, meanwhile you can play and try for years and years and get absolutely *nowhere* because you're from a hick-town.

Things have gotten morbid, too. My lyrics have become blatantly about suicide and self harm, my aspiring major at my community college is mortuary science so I could potentially get some sick, deplorable catharsis out of staring at the dead, I'm saving up for a 12-gauge, and I've got a noose tied in my dresser. I'm just too pussy to use it.

I live in the Great Lakes Region currently, one of the lakes is notorious for bodies never being found if you don't know where/don't know they fell in. I figure in wintertime I can get out far enough nobody would ever find my body if I decided to shoot myself into an ice-fishing hole. I've written my suicide note vague enough that it sounds like I just packed up and moved across the country, so at least anyone I cared about would be spared having to hear I killed myself, they'd just think I went No Contact. (Please tell me this didn't violate the "explicit methods" rule)

I'm going nowhere fast and I can't take it anymore. I've decided that if things haven't improved by the time I'm 27, I'm fucking going through with it. My mother says "what could be so bad that you would" and I say "what would be so great that I shouldn't?" I've been this way since I was 12 years old and it's getting fucking tiring to have to wake up every day and face the fact you're a miserable failure.
