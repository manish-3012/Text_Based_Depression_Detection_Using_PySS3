i am heartbroken and done with lifeIf someone waiting to be born wants my life they can have it, it seems all I was born to do, is suffer, cant find a job due to current issues in the world, likely wont be able to for a long time after, due to being very high risk of death already (diabetic, with a previous lung infection that had the same effects as covid-19). Was talking to a woman yesterday via text and she sent something that gave me hope but will not say what it is, then she used the dreaded words that shot through the heart.  "OMG that wasn't ment for you.  i am devistated and crushed, i really dont want to do online dating as i want to know the person i am talking to is real.  Since i cant go out and hang out for obvious reasons i am just crushed and no longer want this life, its not worth the pain and sadness that permeates my being ever second of every day.  Stop the world i want to get off, its gotten so bad i just ordered a sex toy on amazon (something I never thought i would do), but that is what it is.  All i ever wanted in life for someone to love and cuddle, sex is not important, its more of a "would be nice" but not required, Or maybe it is and I am too depressed to notice.  FML
