I'm a failure. I dare you to prove me wrong.I'm a 20 year old male. I've actually made a few posts like this before, but haven't gotten a lot of responses. I'm a failure for the reasons I'll get into below.

So I'm almost definitely gonna fail out of college. Been on academic probation for one semester and I'm about to fail it. I'm studying web development, and can't understand Javascript for the life of me. I know CSS and HTML pretty well, but that won't be enough to get a job and sure as shit won't be enough  to graduate. My dead grandfather paid for my college, so its not like I'll have  a bunch of student debt if/when I fail out, but it does bring a certain sense of dishonor. But not being able to get a job is the main thing.

I'd rather be dead than a homeless failure. I know supposedly life isn't over once you fail out of college, but for me it pretty much is. Shit, all I want is to get a decent job and be a person that can provide for himself. That shouldn't be a major life goal, but it is for me, and I'm not gonna be able to do it.

Kind of a more minor point, but at this age I've never had a girlfriend. To be honest it doesn't totally bother me. I don't have my shit together so its not like I could deal with a relationship anyways. I just want to lose my virginity. If I do off myself I don't wanna die a virgin.

Everyone always says that you'll have loved ones that'll miss you if you commit suicide. The thing is, I genuinely don't care. I'd feel bad about leaving my tightly knit group of friends that I've had since high school, but it wouldn't be enough to stop me. I could give a fuck about any hurt that I've caused my family. Kind of want to do it to spite them. Haha.

Fuck. When this semester is over, if I fail out, I'll either get a gun and just do it, throw myself off a tall building, or pop a bunch of xanax with whatever alcohol I'm feeling like at the time.
