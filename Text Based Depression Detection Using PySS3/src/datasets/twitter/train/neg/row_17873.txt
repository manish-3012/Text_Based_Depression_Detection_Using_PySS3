I just want to be put down.Like a pet. I don't want any blood, anything that would make a video in bestgore or something. I don't want anyone to cry or be sad when I'm dead. We don't matter, we're so insignificant that I can't believe we care about the most unimportant stupid things. I'm not breathing, one day you will stop breathing too, what's the big deal? No one matters anyways. I just... Want to go peacefully, without any pain, any fuss over it, nothing. Just wrap me up and bury me or leave my corpse to sink in the ocean, so it can be like I never really existed. Because it doesn't matter. 

I just want not to exist. That's all.
