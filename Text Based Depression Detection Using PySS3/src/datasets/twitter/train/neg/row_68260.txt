NEED some support A.S.A.P (serious)not for me, but for a friend.  Long story short is that I met her, we had some fun times; I really like her &amp; that she has lots of problems.  I just got off the phone with her and I'm going to check-in with her in another hour, but I could use some real support/report lines &amp; I don't particularly know how to go about finding them.

area in question is; United States; VA/Northern Virginia outside/around the (Washington D.C. Metropolitan area). If a moderator would like me to be more specific, I can do that via PM.

(2:31:53 AM) Aurora: theres no one out there for me
(2:31:56 AM) Aurora: it will never work
(2:32:07 AM) Aurora: so if theres no reason for me, no reason for my family, and no reason for others

(2:33:44 AM) Aurora: im too broken for anyone to be with 
(2:34:12 AM) Lunar Redemption: it always sounds nice, but that whole dying thing is a lot harder than it seems to be

(2:37:14 AM) Lunar Redemption: part of life is struggling to find the people that make it worth it, but when they do...
(2:37:51 AM) Lunar Redemption: The one constant in people's experiences is that everyone know's pain.  It's being open about that pain; well, that can bring even strangers close together sometimes.

(2:43:10 AM) Aurora: i cant burden people with myself
(2:43:16 AM) Lunar Redemption: Yes, you can.
(2:44:04 AM) Lunar Redemption: It's just a matter of accepting that people have responsibilities too; they're not availible 24/7.  Most of the time I have my phone turned off at work.

Here are two places where you can write about things.  Reddit is unique in that there are always people up even in the wee hours of the morning.  It's also very good for creating 'throw-away' accounts for people that just want to post a limited amount of times.  
(2:51:47 AM) Aurora: i requested that my belongings go to charities
(2:54:50 AM) Lunar Redemption: that's very noble of you, but you should really wait a while and see if you can get some rest
(2:58:46 AM) Lunar Redemption: do you want a few hotlines?
(2:59:51 AM) Lunar Redemption: Helpline 2:Â 1-800-784-2433Â &amp; 1-800-394-4673
