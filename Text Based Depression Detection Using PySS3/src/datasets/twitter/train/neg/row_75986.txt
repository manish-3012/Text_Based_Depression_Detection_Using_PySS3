I know how strange this sounds, but fuck it; I just want someone to cuddle.I've spent my entire adolescence disconnected from my peers. I couldn't concentrate in class, so instead of combating that, the staff at my junior high just hovered over me as I did fuck all. I just want someone to hold, anyone.

I used to think I was solely attracted to women, now I don't know. 

I like the idea of having a boyfriend; a guy my age I can lay in bed with, it's a nice thought. 

I know I'm a weirdo. A lonely weirdo.
