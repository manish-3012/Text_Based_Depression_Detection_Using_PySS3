I'm 28. Never had a boyfriend and my booty call just rejected me for my friend in front of me. This is approximately the 97th time this has happened.I am just so done. I know the problem is me. I'm not mad at either of them. I just can't keep going through this. I'm undatable, unlovable, and I don't know how to stop hating myself. I'm aware that 100% of the problem is me, but I don't think I can change it at this stage. I hate posts like these, but I can't bring myself to call any of my friends, so I'm just letting it off here. I know sex and love are not the only things to life, but I just know I'll never be loved. That's a hard pill to swallow, and I don't really know if I want go through the next couple of years with that knowledge. I know I sound overly dramatic, but I just don't want to do it anymore. What happened is so trivial, but after so many years of the same thing (knowing it's my fault) I'm just ready to give up. I'm ranting, but I don't know who else to reach out to.
