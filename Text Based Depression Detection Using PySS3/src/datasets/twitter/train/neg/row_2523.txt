Telling a couple worker about my suicidal thoughts.I am considering telling a close coworker about my suicidal thoughts. I am scared to do it because I know he will take action. But I am also scared for the first time in my life that I will actually do it. I have 4 kids and I donâ€™t want to make them sad, but Iâ€™m honesty at the edge. I donâ€™t know what to do and I canâ€™t hardly even function at work. Shoots I tell my co worker?
