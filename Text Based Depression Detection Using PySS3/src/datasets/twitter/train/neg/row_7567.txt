On New Year's Eve I'll either be dead or start a successful career and lifeHey r/suicidewatch,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 18 year old with a giant history of social anxiety. I spent a great part of my youth socially isolated. I would literally not leave my room or interact with anyone except my mum for 6 months, then get taken to a locked psych ward by police for a few months. Therapy never worked a bit for me, so that repeated itself four times, so I spent my entire youth, from 13 to 17 in psych wards.

&amp;#x200B;

I never got a degree from a school, because I stopped going 3 months before the final exams, so now I have nothing. My mum kicked me out of the house into my own apartment she paid for. I only got worse and started using drugs. A lot. Eventually got addicted to fentanyl and overdosed alone, it left me a bit brain damaged. My memory is permanently fucked and I have a lazy eye. I have restless legs syndrome now, every night. I'm clean now, though.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I discovered benzos, a class of drugs, which are used for anxiety. I ordered them and was able to go outside, be social, manage my life, the relationship with my mum improved, she likes me again and I go out almost every day, but it feels fake. I am on benzos constantly and got addicted, I've been on them for a few months now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that without them, I can't continue the life I currently live. I am utterly scared to live a real life, I couldn't do it, go to work every day, interact with people, I am so scared. The benzos created a path I was never supposed to take. If I stop, I'll fall back into social isolation again, 100%. My mum will hate me again. Everything will be shit again.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't continue living a normal, social life, because it scares me so much and I can't stop and go back into isolation until in a few more years I get thrown out because of lack of money or I overdose, because I will end up ordering opioids again, if I go back into social isolation to help me not feel so alone and hopeless. So what am I supposed to do?

&amp;#x200B;

Until New Year's Eve, I will make a decision: I either continue using benzos to live a social, normal life, go to school again, be with people, wake up early every day, live a fake life, which would normally scare me into a panic attack or commit suicide. Suicide would stop all this. Everything feels fake, I hate my current position. I feel like I'm going to go with option 2 - suicide, but I am not sure yet. I have everything here for a painless death...

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on this? I couldn't write everything that happened down. Everything that hurt me. Everyone that hurt me. The escapes from the psych ward, almost freezing to death in a forest, being handcuffed by police at 6AM, only to be locked away in a psych ward in a white room for months? I have a lot of pain and darkness in me. I am going depressed and psychotic. The benzos make me forget stuff, get timelines completly wrong and make weeks feel like days.
