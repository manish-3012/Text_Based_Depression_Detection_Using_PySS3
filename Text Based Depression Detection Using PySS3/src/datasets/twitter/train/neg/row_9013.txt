Same place where I was 6 years ago. No everything heals with timeI just had a breakup and she was love of my life and I was gonig to marry her, before her I had suicidal thoughts but she gave me hope and I thought I could survive this, but I think I had my share of happiness and I am good for nothing, tried committing suicide at the age of 16 but was not strong to execute, since then 6 years have passed and now again I'm in the same place. Deciding whether I should live or not. There is no meaning to life and I wish I could give someone my life who wants to live.
