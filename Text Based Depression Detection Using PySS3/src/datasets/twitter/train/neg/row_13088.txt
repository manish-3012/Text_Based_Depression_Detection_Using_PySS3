Thereâ€™s nothing leftI fucked up. Iâ€™m a college dropout, and I live with my parents who hate me and blame me for everything. I make minimum wage, so itâ€™s not like I contribute anything to society. I would go back to school, but whatâ€™s the point? My family makes me wish I was never born. I regret not having the courage to end it all sooner.
