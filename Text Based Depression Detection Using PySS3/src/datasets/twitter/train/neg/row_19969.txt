I just want to run.I just feel like I want to run away. Start my life anew, on my own terms, my own whims. On my own. Free.

I don't have my drivers license (I'm 20) so even if I wanted to how am I supposed to? Public transport? Get a motorbike license? A boat?

I've always had a dream of living my life in South America doing freelance work enough to pay for food and shelter... More and more I see this dream being just that. 

The beam that supports my life is rotting I can either leave my life and build a new one or stay and wait for the inevitable collapse...
