it's hard for me and I want to kill myselfI am a teenager, I am 15 years old, I want to commit suicide, because of despair and mourning in which I drown deeper and deeper. I also have borderline personality disorder, and itâ€™s hard for me to have negative emotions, and itâ€™s really hard for me without a loved one, all because I'm just dependent on him, because of this I tried to kill myself. I feel like a complete idiot for writing this post. I just donâ€™t know with whom to talk about this, Iâ€™m afraid that my friends will not understand me that way and will laugh at me.
