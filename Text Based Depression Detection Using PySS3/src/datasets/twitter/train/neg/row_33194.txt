I'm done.Last week was an Election Week and it was absolutely pure Hell for me. I completely broke down on Thursday; received 4 hours of sleep, missed class by taking a nap, can't take my exam on time because of this stupid spyware software that we have to install on our laptops. I thought the weekend would make things better and that I will get back to normal today, but nope, I missed my two morning classes (earliest is 8, need to wake up at 6:30 to get ready) by sleeping in soundly. I went to be at 10 which has been the latest I've slept at. Only a few weeks left in the semester and my grades are plummeting. I would be surprised if I'm able to make it through next year.

I forgot why I'm in college in the first place. I want to be a nurse. I want to work in healthcare. But my motivation is dropping by the day and I'm just really mentally exhausted. All my life I've been an average student, never had a job or any volunteer experience, living with my parents, and has really bad mental health. Basically I'm hopeless and I could just kill myself right now. This year is by far the worst year ever and I could really take a break. I regret for not taking a gap year. Then again, I don't even know what I would do during that gap year. At this point, I don't even know what I want to do with my life anymore. Goodbye thousands of dollars I've just spent for this semester.

I want to cry again but I live on campus and I don't want others hearing or seeing me being miserable. Right now would be a great time to study for finals but I'm still behind on weeks load of assignments. I'm really thinking about ending myself tonight. I just don't know how to do that.
