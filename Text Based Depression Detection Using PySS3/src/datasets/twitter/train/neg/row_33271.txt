I am considering suicide even when I am calm now.It just seems like the best alternative. I think of all the options I have, I think of all the possible outcomes. The good ones, the bad ones. And I feel like the best course of action I have is to kill myself.

I have been suicidal since forever but I've always tried to wait few days until I calm down and think clearly and then I'd think "damn  I am glad I didn't do it" 

But now I am calm, and I just think there's nothing negative about it. There's just positives.

The only thing that keeps me from doing so is that there's one person I love.
