What's the point?i know that i will never succeed

i know that i will be forgotten

i know that it wont be better

i know that after my parents' death i shall soon follow

what's the point?

I tried to seek an answer in religion but it made me hate life even more, why would god make such a shitty universe for his creation to live in? What kind of an incompetent shit stain do you have to be to fuck up literally everything you do and yet call yourself good. why make insects, why make death, why make suffering , why not just make a perfect world? id rather be happy than free, but no he had to make a literal hellhole for everyone to live in, IF he even exists, after that i turned to atheism but that made it even worse,i don't really like the idea of ceasing to exist after death. is there a word for that kind of feeling? to hate both life and death? anyhow, i don't know what do do anymore, i can't count on anyone for help, even my parents, they don't give a shit about me anymore and yet they are the only thing keeping me here, i know that for the rest of my miserable existence i will be nothing but a tool for those above me, and i will die alone and heartbroken possibly by my hand.

What's the point?

i don't know how this will be received but i just wanted to put it out there for someone to read, for someone to understand, because nobody around me understands my problems, i doubt even i do.
