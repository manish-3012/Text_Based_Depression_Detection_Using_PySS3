Hey reddit, well idk what to say or do but I know reddit is a place to just put random shit. Well I wanted to become a music producer since I was a kid, I failed to do so now that Iâ€™m 20, I just want to kill myself. Love and respect others please and donâ€™t be rude life is hard for that nonsense!Iâ€™m sorry everybody I really am. Music was my everything so I have to let it go. 

Iâ€™ve been making music all my life and slowly started losing my inspiration and motivation and idk what do now to just end it and see where life can take me.
