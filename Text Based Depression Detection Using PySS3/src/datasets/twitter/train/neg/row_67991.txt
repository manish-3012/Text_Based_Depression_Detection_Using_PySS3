I feel like my girlfriend is borderline-suicidal, and I can't do anything to help her.My girlfriend is the sweetest most wonderful girl in the world, and I love her with all my heart, but I have no idea what to do anymore. She's depressed and she constantly tells me how she feels empty, and alone, and like no one loves her. Her mom and step father are totally fucked, and they have a horrible marriage so they take it out on her, Her mom told her that if She commited suicide she wouldn't care. She had attempted suicide 2 years ago and (thank god) failed, but her mother is indifferent. Her father is supportive and loves her but he lives far away and he isn't able to be there for her.

She has no idea what she wants to do with her life and she hates herself, and on top of that she's under constant threat of being kicked out of the house.

She's 15, almost 16. She has nowhere else to go, and she has fallen into groups with the wrong sorts of people before and I don't want that to happen again. 

But I can't do anything. It's hard for me to help her, and I have no idea how to get her help. If anything, it'd have to be someone at our school because her mom would refuse to let her talk to an outside psychiatrist or something. 

As someone who lacks the ability to help her beyond listening and support, how do I get her real help?
