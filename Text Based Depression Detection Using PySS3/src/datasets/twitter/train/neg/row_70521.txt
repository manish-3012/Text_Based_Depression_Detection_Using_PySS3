I've had multiple suicidal thoughts over the last few weeks.I feel like I can't do anything about my life. I've heard my parents fighting alot lately and my dad is keeping money from my mom. My grades are slipping and three of my friends said that I was too clingy today, just because they're some of the only people I really trust. I want to tell someone but I can't bring myself tell them. Somebody started a rumor that I asked somebody for sex. I'm 13. I can't fix any of this and I don't want to hurt myself or anybody else but I feel like there isn't any other option.
