My Finace is at Work and I've Made My DecisionWhen I was a child, I was often physically, emotionally, verbally and after the age of ten, sexually abused. I didn't know what it was like to feel safe, know what family was or really have any kind of normative experience. 

I stopped cutting almost four years ago now, and my last suicide attempt was a near fatal overdose at fifteen. However, last year I was raped a second time and even though certain parts of my life have vastly improved, I can't live with my head anymore. I don't want to. I just want to not feel like this anymore. I can't afford therapy and nothing I do makes it better.

I feel trapped. I am trapped. So, I've decided to end things before they get any worse. I just can't do it anymore.
