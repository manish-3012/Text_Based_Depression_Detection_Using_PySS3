10 year plan cut shortWhen my best friend overdosed, I created a 10 year plan. Get everything in order, meet him when I'm done.
I dont think I cant wait that long. Things are beginning to seem pointless.
The drug I'm going to use is so expensive, so that's the hardest part at the moment. But I'll get there.
Just make all the pain stop. Please.
