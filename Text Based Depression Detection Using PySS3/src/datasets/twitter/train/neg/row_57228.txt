I will NOT end it!The feelings may be terrible, and the thoughts may make death seem like the answer, but I have decided I will not give in.  I may hate going to therapy, and feel anxious about it, but I wont end my life.  I might not conform to what others do, but I will not end it.  There is stuff Iove, my family, my fellow gamers, my amazing loving Dog. I keep a lot of how I feel to myself, but that is ok.  I have to stop being fake, I can make this work.  I don't hate life, I see that now.  I hate the feelings I face and the circumstances of everything at the moment.  I will live, I will be the person I want to be.  I wish you the best everybody, and remember, fuck other peoples bullshit.  It is your life not theirs
