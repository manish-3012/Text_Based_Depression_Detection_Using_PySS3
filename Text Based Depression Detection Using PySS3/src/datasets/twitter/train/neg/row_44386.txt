I Really Do Need to Kill Myself ASAPI've posted several times here but I'm absolutely at the most desperate point I've ever been. Things will never get better and this prolonging "just in case" isn't working. I can't see any chance of a decent future. None. Life is dull and boring and painful and saddening. 

I really want to do it today I just need to make sure the logistics are in order.
