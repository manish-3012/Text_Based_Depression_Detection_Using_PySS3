please someone help me calm downthrowaway account for obvious reasons 

i donâ€™t know where to start but i really really need someone right now and i donâ€™t know where else to go 

i have anxiety&amp;depression but iâ€™m being watched for signs of bipolar disorder/borderline personality disorder. the past 4 months or so iâ€™ve been dealing with really bad intrusive thoughts. iâ€™ve started to believe everybody is a bad person. iâ€™ve started to think horrible things. i have mood swings every single fucking day. i started therapy but iâ€™ve only had four appointments so far so i havenâ€™t really gotten much out of it. 

one of the intrusive thoughts iâ€™ve been getting recently is that i feel like i was raped. and i was sexually assaulted as a young kid once, and i was exposed to things i shouldnâ€™t have been exposed to. but i donâ€™t ever remember being raped. whenever i have sex with my boyfriend now, i become completely disconnected. i donâ€™t feel like iâ€™m even in my body. thatâ€™s all i can think about. sometimes i can distract myself but other times i canâ€™t. lately once weâ€™re done iâ€™ve been having panic attacks, i still donâ€™t feel like iâ€™m in my own body, and i just feel completely disconnected from reality and i donâ€™t know how else to explain it. this horrible feeling comes over me and i just donâ€™t feel like myself anymore. 

well tonight we had sex and i had those thoughts, i was fine for the most part but once we finished i started feeling really emotional. i started panicking and all of a sudden i got these chills running throughout my body &amp; i felt like i was no longer in it, and i also got the uncontrollable urge to hurt my boyfriend. the more i panicked the more i felt like i was not going to be in control of my body so i tried to calm myself as much as i could. iâ€™m in the bathroom now. heâ€™s asleep and doesnâ€™t know about this. i donâ€™t know why i felt that way but iâ€™m freaking the fuck out. iâ€™ve never felt something like that before, iâ€™ve never felt like i have absolute no control over my body. it felt like i got fucking possessed. i got it to go away but it lasted way too long and felt too real and i donâ€™t know what to do iâ€™m in my bathroom and now i just want to kill myself. i just need someone to calm me down. iâ€™ve gotten intrusive thoughts before to hurt somebody but iâ€™ve never actually felt it like that and iâ€™m so fucking scared
