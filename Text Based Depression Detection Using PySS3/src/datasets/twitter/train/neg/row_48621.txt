DeathI flipped a coin. I'm doing it tonight. 

Details of why i am doing it now are on the post i just put on r/depression. I've tried before with bars and alcohol (also in my pervious posts) but that didn't work either time. So i'm making sure i will die this time. I'm gathering all the medicines in my house right now. I'm making sure i mix as many stimulants and depressants as possible. I will bar myself out to make the whole thing easier to go through with. As well as drink to get my body to the brink of death. 

Edit: just took 20 mg xanax. Drinking as soon as it kicks in. Then i have adderall to speedball and hopefully 500 ml of night time cough syrup will finish me off. 

Edit2: found some of my LSD earlier too. Took that bc i like LSD. It'll keep me conscious until the dark abyss envelops too i guess which will be cool.

I'm looking through pictures of life. Trips i went on, fun times i had.. Grace.. bitter and painful nostalgia needs to prevail as the decision is irreversible now. (Just drank)

Edit3: bars kicking in. Slightly drunk as well now. LSD is beginning to alter time perception. No regrets. Still looking through pictures. Kind of crying but i'm more happy for my pst self that he found a way to go on for such a long time. Good for him.

Edit4: Fitting no on e has commeneted i guess. Death is a personal venture. About to drink cough surip. Lsd really negating alot of the alcohol drunkness effect.
