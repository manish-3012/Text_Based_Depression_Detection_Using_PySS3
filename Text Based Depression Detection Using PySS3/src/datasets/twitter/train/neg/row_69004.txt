Iâ€™m sorry if this doesnâ€™t belong here. I want to kill myself but canâ€™t.Because so many people depend on me. And i know if I leave their pain will be greater than what mine is right now. Iâ€™m just so useless I canâ€™t do anything right. I canâ€™t even take care of myself, clean or cook right. Iâ€™m just so useless. People only depend on me because Iâ€™m all they have. I want to runaway.
