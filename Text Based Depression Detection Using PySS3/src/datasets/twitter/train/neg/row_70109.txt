My future is bleak. Thereâ€™s just no point in living anymoreI just canâ€™t get excited about anything. Transferring, grad school, writing a novelâ€” all these things I used to dream aboutâ€”- I just canâ€™t bring myself to be happy. Being in a relationship while having BPD is the worst combination ever. Both my parents are new immigrants in a new country with no friends, so theyâ€™re both depressed, and I canâ€™t leave them. My brother and best friends are continents away and busy with work, and my brother is fighting a life-threatening illness. My hero passed away in 2016 and it still hurts. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I just wanna die.

I just realized I never told anybody anyone all of this.
