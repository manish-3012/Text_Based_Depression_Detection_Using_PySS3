I feel so empty and sick of myself.I ruin everything, every chance I've been given to have a better life, my parent's life with all the shit I've caused, all my relationships, my own body.
Everyday is the same shitty feeling and I'm so tired of pretending I'm fine.

Today my alcoholic mom tested positive for covid and started yelling at me as soon as she got home for no reason. It got worse when I called her out for coughing everywhere and not wearing a mask, she also went Christmas shopping after. Then everyone gets mad at me for not wanting to get tested, I mean what's the point if she already contaminated everywhere? And it's not like I care anyways.
I'm so weak this kind of shit makes me want to cut myself. I'm hoping next time I finally do it right and end it all because it's too late for me to get help, my parents didn't care when I begged them back in high school.
