Is there such thing as a nice gesture before suicide?Basically ive planned my suicide and I keep thinking I want to do something nice before I go out. Im going for the exit bag approach in hope it will stop me panicking and ripping it off. But the moment before I slip the ole bag over my head I don't really know if I could leave a nice msg on my phone or a video or something. 
I feel like I want to help others not to do what I'm doing but surely that makes me the absolute hypocrite? I've nailed down my suicide note it's quite brief and puts all the blame on myself without hurting anyone who may love me. I just feel like I want to make a difference with my death that I couldn't do while alive. For example I could put on my Facebook a video of me saying if there is anyone feeling like me please get help don't end up like me. 
What's your thoughts I'm here for a few days?
