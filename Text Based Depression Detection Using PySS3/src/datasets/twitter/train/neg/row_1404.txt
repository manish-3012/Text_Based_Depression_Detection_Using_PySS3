My dad hurt me.About a month ago, I confessed to him that all I could think about was killing myself, and that I need to find help. He flew into a rage and told me that I'd been given every chance to succeed, that he was gonna take away my phone (because further isolation always makes things better, yay), that if I just listened to his advice I wouldn't be going through this. The worst thing though, was that he told me to just do it.

He calmed down and apologized afterwards, but I cannot trust him with this anymore. I will *never* forget him telling me to kill myself, even as he and the rest of my family were a major reason for me not doing it.

So now, I'm just crying myself to sleep or not sleeping at all, 'cause I don't know how to get help, and I'm still thinking about it a lot.
