I did something unforgiveable. The guilt and paranoia is too much.I did something horrible to a now former friend of mine a few months ago. I told her what I did, and we are understandably not friends anymore. I don't know if she read my apology or not. What happened was on the internet, and I'm paranoid someone knows what I've done and they're going to expose me at some point. I'm too afraid to go into specifics. I feel so much guilt and anxiety that I want to end my life. It won't stop, and I feel like someone is always watching me, and I'm going to be taken away to jail or somewhere to be killed.
