all I want is mercy and peaceI'm exhausted. For the past near two decades I have been so miserable. I can't connect to people -- they scare me so much, and they are loud. Always in my ear buzzing about their emotions and urges. They keep hissing it out me, like I did something wrong. 

I'm just trying to eat, but there are others in the cafeteria, and they are all thinking about me. They are all directing their pains onto me!

All I do is daydream. In class, work, with friends, or in bed, I am in my fantasy world. 

You should see me there! I'm happy, successful, and happy. I find love in my little world. I have someone to nuzzle up to, and she loves me. 

All I have here-physically is a pillow that my hugs and clutches are wearing holes into. 

Meds don't help me. My therapist got a new job. My best friends moved far away a few months ago. I've fallen in love with one of them. 

There is no joy -- nothing seems good to me anymore. I can't laugh like I used to. I can't smile like I used to. I still have those, but they're masks now. I made them carefully. And they make me seems human for a little while. 

I'm no person. I'm past defective. I'm not what everybody else is. 

Coward! Everyone calls me one. I am one. I couldn't pull the trigger. I'm not man enough. I want to die. Please have mercy. Please let me be. Please, please, please, help me go out peacefully. 

Don't walk in on my bloody body. Don't. Just please sit by me as I fall asleep and never wake up. 

WHY SHOULD I BE EXPECTED TO GO THROUGH THIS EVERY DAY. THIS WILL NEVER END. 

I've tried it all. 

No respect for a stain like me. 

Please, please, have mercy.
