Not a throwaway, I feel guilt and ashamed.Ive told my wife about the attempt I made on my life about 6 years ago when I was publicly stopped from jumping. I told her I changed my thoughts over time when Ive come to realize that I need to live for other people because I couldn't for myself. Shes mad and thinks less of me for some reason. She told me she wouldn't have even dated me if she knew this. My heart aches and I feel so confused. I was told by other people that it's a moment of strength to tell her. Was I wrong? Was I supposed to keep it to myself?
