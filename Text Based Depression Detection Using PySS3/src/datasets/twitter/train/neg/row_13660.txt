reasons not to quit? struggling with thoughts.ok, i usually hate these sorts of things, posting/complaining and whatnot but i don't have anyone to speak to irl about these kinds of thoughts.

its been building and building over the past few months, the feeling of just complete boredom with life. i can't get excited about anything. i don't care about finding love, or going out, or doing well at university, or getting a job. i don't give a crap about any of it, i don't have enough motivation or perseverance for the trials and tribulations of life. even if putting in effort would mean i could find those little pockets of happiness and "meaning" in llife, to me it is way too much effort. i'm not happy with being and doing nothing, but i don't care enough about life to change. 

i don't know what to do anymore, i can't make myself excited about anything. i feel dulled. i've been on antidepressants for a while now but they don't help with the empty feelings, which are the main reason for the suicidal thoughts. I just can't see myself ever getting the will to make life interesting, so why bother with life atall? i'm biding my time until i die, so it seems logical to get it over with now. 

i don't know what do anymore, the thoughts are becoming more and more frequent and i'm sick of trying to convince myself that something amazing is out there for me, when it feels like a complete lie. 
anyone out there feeling similar? how do you cope? any words of wisdom/advice would be appreciated.
