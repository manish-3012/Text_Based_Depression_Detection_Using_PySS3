Help appreciatedThis may not be the correct site/place within the site, but here goes...

I'm in a really tough spot and need to reach out for help.

My life situation is tollerable, I'm poor but surviving, yet feel hopeless and lost.

My existentialism has brought me to suicide attempts lately, and I need some hope/advice from someone who's been there.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Thankyou
