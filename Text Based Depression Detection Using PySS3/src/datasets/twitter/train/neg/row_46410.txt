I tried to reach out to any crisis hotline I could, any place I could, scared that this is the end.What did I ever deserve do to deserve to die? I can't escape my country and I can't find an support anywhere this is hopeless. Please help me die at least because it's all my fault and I don't know where to do anymore.

Edit: No I have no Sim card so I can't call or text anyone. Stop telling me to do that because I already would have.

Edit 3: I was too scared to hold my breath underwater to die I'm pathetic. My family knows I want to suicide and they don't care, my mom said sometimes she wishes I would just die because I'm useless. Everything is getting worse every day I can't be helped I'm completely gone I have to die somehow because there's no way to save me, please help me die I beg you.
