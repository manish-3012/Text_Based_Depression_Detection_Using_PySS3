No senseUm.. Hello guys! It's my first post here, I'm new so please be forgiving. I'm 15 yo and I have no reason to live. I just don't understand why we exist. I feel like when we die, everything ends so there's no reason to do anything. Someday I'll die and forget everything I've done. I also don't feel happiness or fulfillment in my life. Any ideas what to do?
