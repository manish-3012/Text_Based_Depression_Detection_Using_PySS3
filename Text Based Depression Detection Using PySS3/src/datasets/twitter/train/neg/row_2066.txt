Why do I even bother? What's the point of it all if I'm miserable all the time?I've lost passion for things that I used to really enjoy, and the last thing I truthfully hold dear is starting to slip away. My music, the one thing that honest to God keeps me from going insane and outright killing myself, I've tried and failed to do so, I keep telling myself it's worth keeping my head up just another day but something always comes to drag me down whether it be an argument with my parents *they don't know anything about this* or a "bad day" or just my thoughts dragging me down. I've been playing the game of life for 19 years and the last 5 I've spent on autopilot most of it doing things I thought I wanted to do and it's all just turning up to be wasted bullshit time, when I graduated from "high school" got my equivalent diploma "homeschooled" I felt empty it felt like I just accomplished this and your telling me that's great but if you really want to do anything at all with your life spend another X years in college getting a bs degree that really ends up not meaning much to an employer, it just makes me feel miserable to the point where I wouldn't mind a bullet to the brain or a handful of pills to end it all, but I then think about what I'll never experience I'm a virgin, never been in a relationship, don't have my drivers license or a permit anymore, I've never made a purchase of more than $450, and a lot of that seems to far off to bother waiting for, I was going to ask a girl out from a class in college last semester but the last time I saw her she introduced me to her boyfriend, it like I finally get the balls to do this and it's rubbed in my face like that? Why did I even bother if the first place? I dunno man, it's like sometimes when I go to a fire call and it's already all burnt to the ground we are like too late now all we can do is put out the smoldering remains and hope it doesn't flare back up after we leave. I'm even considering resigning from my volunteer fire department at this point, but it's just another thing I have to explain my way out of to my parents and chief and then pay for the classes that I've taken etc, im sure it would break their hearts to hear that I committed suicide and someone else may end up taking theirs because we lost one of our guys to cancer late last year and for most of us that wound is still fresh me included, and to top it all off of was messaging a guy here back and forth for awhile just about stuff and I haven't heard from him in about 1-2 months I'm pretty sure they killed themselves I feel guilty and responsible and it all snowballs  to bigger and bigger things. Does anyone have the chance to chat? Just pass a message around etc.
