Drowning in debtI honestly don't know what to do anymore, I'm at my wit's end. I owe so much in money in medical bills that I wish my attempts would have worked. I currently owe $38,000 to one hospital, and an additional $6,000 that has already been moved to a collection agency. I'm fucking dirt poor. I work a minimum wage job and don't even get 40 hours. I'm 22 the amount I owe is probably more money than I've ever had in my entire life. I don't have a car, still living with family, and a high school diploma. I just don't see any way out of this shit. I don't want it to have to come to this but I don't see much other way.

I've been sober for 8 months but I might as well just say fuck it and find something to overdose on.
