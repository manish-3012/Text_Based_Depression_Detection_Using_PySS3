I've veen trying to do my bestHi
I've been suffering with my parents eversince I was born. Evrything they did and all their behavior towards me was abusive, never abused my other siblings though. My parents made fun of me infront of other kids because I was scared to ride a 2 wheel bike when I was 5. My mom never let me near her for reasons I don't know. Everytime I needed something, they made me personally pay for it while bringing the same thing to my siblings for free. I've been a high achiever my whole life, though they've never encouraged me or been my side, and when I tell them that they look at me as if they even know me or anything about me.I've never said anything bad to them, never been spoiled, always done what pleased them, but I can't keep up amymore. I was beat 7 years ago because my parents asked me why was I sad and I purely answered my thoughts and fears.I've stayed in my room wversince barely interacting with them, and they complain about me staying there as if I look just exhilarated to be with them. They didn't change. I'm 22 with no where to go, I'll have to stay with them. It has been hell. I was studying abroad but due to coronovirus my stay was extended. I've been thinking of suicide ever since I was 14. I have no access to any therapist. I'm reaching my limit, and I don't know how much will I keep fighting to stay alive. I'm becoming numb. Those who are supposed to care for you and make sure you're okay are the ones messing you up. How can I accept other people in if my beginning and my whole Life was like this. No I can't runaway unfortunately, I don't have anywhere absolutely to stay. No laws protecting me. No money at all on me.
