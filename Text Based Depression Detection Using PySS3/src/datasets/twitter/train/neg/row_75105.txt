Probably a goodbye I guessðŸ˜To be honest, I am thinking about just killing my self. It would be better for everybody around me since they pretty much think Iâ€™m a waste of space. Since Iâ€™m 14, I go to school and I get the feeling like Iâ€™m the only person in the whole school. If I just died then it would be less weight on my parentâ€™s shoulders so they could do what they want to do. If anybody even responds to this then I will respond if Iâ€™m not dead yet. So thank you for reading this I guess. ðŸ˜
