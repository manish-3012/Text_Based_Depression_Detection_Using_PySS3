I'm a 30 yo bipolar grad student and I'm strugglingI don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore.  I'm 30 yrs old about halfway through a PhD and I'm realizing that I just don't want to do it anymore.  But there's nothing else for me out there, this is all I have.  But I hate doing research now, and all I wish I could do is to go back in time and re-do everything with some actual fucking guidance.  My parents did nothing for me -- how did everyone else figure it out?  Even the people in my college cohort who were idiots have high paying bay area jobs now.

I just want to put a bullet in my head.  Life feels so dark and meaningless and I know I'm now never going to meet the life goals I wanted to because I'm too old to change course.

I just have zero resilience.  I'm the type of person that, when I play an RPG video game, if I get to a certain point in a game and I don't like my team / stats I just scrap everything and start all over again.  But you can't do that with life, and now I have the shitty team that's going to be single and poor.

Fuck all of this, life is shit and it's not worth it anymore.
