Rough night35 male PTSD â€œsurvivorâ€ here. I had a major episode triggered yesterday before coming to work and got sent home because I couldnâ€™t stop crying. 

Nightmares were there with a vengeance last night, even with the prazosin. I tried my CBT therapy (thought replacement, mindfulness, meditation) and even did a little self-EMDR this morning, but nothingâ€™s touched it. I keep spiraling. 

Psychiatrist and therapist both have appointments for me in the next few days, but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to be able to handle how fast and strong this thing is moving. Iâ€™m at work right now and Iâ€™ve had to leave my desk to sob heavily in my car at least once an hour. 

I have clonopin for breakthrough anxiety, but Iâ€™m already three times over what Iâ€™m supposed to take in a day. Iâ€™ve got two more hours of work before I can leave and Iâ€™m planning on calling the suicide prevention hotline (1 800 273-8255) just to make sure I can make the 20 minute drive home without driving into oncoming traffic or going off a bridge. 

I canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself, though. I remind myself what itâ€™ll do to my wife, my kids, but I canâ€™t make any of that register in my head. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. I want to want to live, I just donâ€™t know how. Someone please talk me through the next two hours of work so no one has to find my body in the morning.
