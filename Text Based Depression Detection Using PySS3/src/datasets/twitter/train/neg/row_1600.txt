I don't like that the only thing keeping me alive is guilt I don't want to hurt my family by offing myself, but there's literally nothing else keeping me alive.

I'm going this year, and was thinking maybe august or the beginning of december, just so I'm not too close to a birthday. Don't wanna ruin anyone's special day by being dead, ya know!
