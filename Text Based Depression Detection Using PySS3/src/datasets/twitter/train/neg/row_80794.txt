What is the fucking purposeSup ppl, local sad boy in the building. This thing called life has me pretty fucked off. Whatever I do I can never find a sense of connection with anything I set out to do. I can never fit in, go with the flow, etc. Iâ€™m the most oddball person the world has ever seen. This is the root of my depression essentially, every time I rationalize mental situations of what I can do to get out of this funk I can never solve anything. I have no hobbies, I go to fucking AA meetings, Iâ€™m sober as fuck, I work a shitty job, Iâ€™m bored, and one day Iâ€™m honestly going to just pull the trigger, because I have the balls to do it. Really waiting on something interesting to happen in my life or something but Iâ€™m a socially awkward lunatic with 0 ambition for anything in life, 0 life relevant skills, and 0 connection in my life. What the fuck should I do?
