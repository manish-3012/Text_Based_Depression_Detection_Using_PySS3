No reason leftMy life has been spiraling downward for years and every time there is a glimmer of hope for things to get better its crushed by something far worse than the last. Im tired of wasting every day away just wishing I didn't have to see the next one. My family is all gone. Im in a place where I have no one. The pandemic has caused me to lose my job, then my car, and now.. Here in a few days I will have lost my place to live. The girl Im in love with could care less if she ever saw me again and would be better off not seeing me anyways. Im tired of hearing all the " get help" bullshit. Talking to someone isn't going to change that I don't want to experience any more of this hell. The only reason I haven't done it yet is because I couldn't imagine not being able to see her face again. I imagine I'll come to my senses soon enough though and realize im not going to see her.
