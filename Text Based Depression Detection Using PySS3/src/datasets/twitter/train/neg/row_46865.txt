Can someone please talk to me.I hate being 16 for the fact I can't just disappear for a while. I have no where to go no one to hang out with nothing to do. Add that to a dash of suicidal thoughts and you get to where I am now. 

You guys are gonna ignore me just for the fact I'm a teenager and "You'll grow out of it it's perfectly normal to attempt suicide at this age" 

If you're gonna say something like that just stop. Ignore my post. I don't want to hear from you. 

I feel so empty. I feel so alone. I seriously just want out of this world. I don't want a future I don't want to wake up tomorrow. I want this pain to end. There's no one left to stop me from cutting. No one left to talk me out of suicide. I doubt she cares anymore but really it's ok. Being alone makes it easier for me to make stupid decisions and end it all. I want to do it tonight. I'm going to slice my thighs open then hopefully hang myself. Sitting here trapped in my mind is fucking torture.
