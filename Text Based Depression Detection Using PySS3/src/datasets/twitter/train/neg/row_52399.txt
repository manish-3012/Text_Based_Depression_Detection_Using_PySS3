The only thing stopping me...is the thought of the person who would have to clean up. I don't want to hurt anyone around me, but I don't want to go on anymore. I always think to myself that one day these thoughts will go away. Maybe tomorrow, I say. I always just wait it out until the next day (and then the next day, and the next day). I always just think about my friends and family. I don't want to upset them. But it's just so painful to keep giong everyday. Everyday I am alive physically hurts. I wake up in the morning, go to work, come home and cry and explode, until my room mate gets home and I fake being normal. I just want the thoughts, the anxiety, the depression to end. I'm afraid to ask for help. Where do I start? How do I say it without sounding crazy or stupid? Sorry if I am rambling....
