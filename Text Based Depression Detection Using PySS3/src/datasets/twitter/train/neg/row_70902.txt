The end is soonIâ€™ve been struggling for years to stay alive but Iâ€™ve finally reached a point where I am happy that Iâ€™m going to die in the next week. Iâ€™d rather enjoy a week and not care about anything once more than have to keep suffering on. Iâ€™ve tried so many ways to stay alive and nothingâ€™s worked. This is my last option.
