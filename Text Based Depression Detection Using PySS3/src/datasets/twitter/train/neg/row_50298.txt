If I try to "get help" I'm going to be sent to a hospital and put in several thousands of dollars of debt.That's just how it is. Honestly, that's a fate worse than death right there. I LOVE the United States. We're the best country that ever existed. /s in case it wasn't clear.

If I tell my therapist how I feel she's gonna call the cops. Then I'll be baker acted. And they'll drug test me, then I'll be marchman acted. And then I'll be ordered to stay there for a month because I consumed cannabis. And every night spent there is $300, I believe. What's 30 times 300? I think it's like 9000. So, $9000 in debt, if I ever tell anyone how I'm feeling? And I make NO money? I'm not even on disability or unemployment, or anything at all. I make 0 dollars.

Suicide is a much better option than telling ANYONE the truth because the moment I even open my mouth to speak, I'm gonna get thrown into a police cruiser against my own will. That's never going to change. No one is ever going to actually help me, they'll just threaten me with debt.
