DoneThings have progressively gotten worse. In a few minutes I'm going to go to the school and withdraw. I can't catch a break, I'm continuosly sick mentally and physically. My parents hate each other and are tired of putting up with me. I don't have any friends. Once I withdraw I mostly likely will be on my own and I can't do it. Thank you to the people on here for helping me.
