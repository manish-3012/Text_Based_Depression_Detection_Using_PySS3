I live in a world that abuse is not take seriously. I can't take another bit of abuse from anyone, I want to die.For the past few years, I've been bullied in school, harassed by them to the point where my arm was in a sling, been racially abused at times, and nothing of note was done by my school. Now, can't find a job because of my race, those memories of school are not going away and I'm seeking therapy. But this morning I posted on AskReddit for any good trustworthy online therapists. The replies I got were from douchebags.

Anyone want to give me help before I send my final goodbyes?
