I've reached itI think this is what it feels like to want to leave my life behind. I've ended my five to six year close friendship with somebody I considered a brother. We were growing apart anyways, but it still hurts a ton. I can't rely on my family, my other friend has other stuff going on in his life, and doesn't care that I was close to killing myself a few days ago. I'm really just hurt, lonely and angry that my life has come to this. I don't even have the self confidence or happiness I used to. I tried to talk to a suicide chat line, but I was denied as they deemed my situation too extreme to be helped. I feel numb and useless. I need to muster up the courage to go ahead and do this thing
