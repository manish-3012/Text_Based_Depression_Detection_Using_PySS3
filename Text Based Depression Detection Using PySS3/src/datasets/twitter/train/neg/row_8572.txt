Fuck love and fuck life I donâ€™t want to feel againI donâ€™t know how to be alone. I just want someone to always be there. I want someone to love me even when I mess up. I want to feel totally at ease with someone. I know that will never happen. Our society is so fucked up you canâ€™t get into a relationship without someone cheating. I donâ€™t want to try anymore. I donâ€™t want to feel this pain again and again. I donâ€™t have normal emotions and I canâ€™t take this bullshit. I just want to be enough but I never will. I just want to die and not deal with the pain and suffering. I donâ€™t want to wait for it to get better. I just want to stop my mind and my hurt.
