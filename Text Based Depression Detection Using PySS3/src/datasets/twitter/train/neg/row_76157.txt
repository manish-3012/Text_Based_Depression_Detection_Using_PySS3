31M, self-esteem below zero because of rejections31M. I feel absolutely hopeless. Right now I (...cut out, just now saw the rule about not being explicit with methods...) but I realized that I don't even have the guts to do it. So there is no way out and no solution at all. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm alone for 6 months already. I broke up with my gf. Now everytime when I try something with somebody I get rejected. It's the same everytime. They explain that I'm very smart, educated, handsome, stylish, and an interesting person, it's not about me, they are just "not looking for relationships right now". Everybody knows what it means. Yes it's totally about me.

&amp;#x200B;

My self-esteem is below zero. I'm lonely. I feel like I'm pure shit. I'm a weirdo. I disgust women. Many years ago some women even expressed the disgust openly.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not an asshole, a neckbeard or anything like that. I think there are two main reasons why I get rejected. I'm not tall (5'8'') and I'm pretty quiet (sometimes they even mention the latter as the reason). I had a very difficult childhood with domestic violence in my family, and now I have minor depression and social anxiety. There is absolutely nothing I can do about my "quietness".

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in enough pain to be open about that: I'm becoming what you call "an incel". I envy women. I feel that any woman, good-looking, not so good-loking, interesting or not, educated or not, can get emotional support, find friends, casual sex, a boyfriend easily, by finger snapping. They don't understand it. You can be a lot of good things, but if you have a trait like my "quietness", it's enough to disgust them. A woman always has many options. I don't blame women. I blame myself.

&amp;#x200B;

No, I don't project those thoughts to my real life. I know it. Also, I know it because they always try to reject me softly and nicely, trying not to hurt my feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that a lot of people have it worse. I know that there are virgins of my age. It doesn't help me. I just pray that some day I'll find the strength to finally kill myself. I disgust myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I don't know why I feel like it's so important to me, but it affects me very much.
