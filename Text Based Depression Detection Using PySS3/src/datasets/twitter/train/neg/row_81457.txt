I'm thinking about doing it soonToday was a pretty horrible day. Worse than usual and that is saying something. I am a sophomore in high school and a good student usually. I had 4 tests today and I couldn't finish any of them. Grades are super important in my family and my parents are going to freak out when they see the grades. I'm still messed up from a couple weeks ago when I tried to ask this girl out and failed miserably. She hates me now and it sucks because I see her everyday. I'm just so lonely too. It's really starting to hurt just to get up out of bed. I feel like no one loves me anymore. I just don't know what to do anymore. Almost everyone hates me. I just can't find a reason to live any longer. It just hurts to exist. I found a way to to end it and I'm just waiting for the one day that pushes me over the edge. I can't go on any longer. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. If you ask anyone of my friends they'll say I'm probably one of the happiest funniest guys they've ever met. It's all a facade. I put on a fake smile so no one knows I'm unhappy on the inside. I try my hardest to make others laugh so they'll never feel the pain I feel. It seems to be working but I just can't take my own emotions anymore.
