Doing it tonight Iâ€™ve seen all the world has to offer and Iâ€™m tired, tonight I become an AngelI plan on ending it tonight. I got my driver permit and immediately crashed into a pole, my physical and mentally abusive dad was teaching me how to drive. He did his worse: many will say this was a revenge suicide, but itâ€™s not. I was planning on doing this years ago. The first time I was ever truly suicidal, or at least truly suicidal with a name to attach to it , I was 9. I want to die, Iâ€™m an adult, Iâ€™m 18, Iâ€™ll do it. I have no friends left. My abuser and baby sister and my mom are the only family I have left. My baby sister is my world, sheâ€™s 17, sheâ€™s so sweet but also sometimes snappy ðŸ˜‚ I love her fiery personality. And my mom, she is so amazing to me, sometimes she is cruel but of course in that motherly love sort of way. I will miss them so much, but they will eventually feel better, I was nothing and no one special. I hope they feel better soon. I hope their not the ones to find my body but if they are itâ€™ll be okay. They both see a therapist and can talk it out. I thought I wanted to grow up but I didnâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to be alive. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. If you read my story I love you, happy New Years! Happy 2021!
