There's nothing leftI've been considering killing myself for so many years, a few weeks ago I've decided what I'm going to do. my original plan was when i go back to college in a few days, to slit my wrists in the bathroom. now I've decided to do it on my college lunch break at the nearby river, if i decide to back out (i won't), i will hopefully be able to call somebody i know and she can get me help. or phone the samaritans and get them to phone an ambulance for me. I've been talking to this girl for a few days recently, she says she's falling in love with me and i feel sorry for her cos i am the worst. I've told her this but she's so persistent. i just can't take it anymore, i fuckng hate myself and I'm scared but excited in a way.
