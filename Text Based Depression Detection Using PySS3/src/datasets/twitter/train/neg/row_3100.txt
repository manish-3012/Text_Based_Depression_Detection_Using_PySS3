DepressionI made an attempt about six months ago. After I got out of the hospital there was no hiding anymore, I started talking to my loved ones about my illness, switched to a better therapist and psychiatrist, and overall just feel better. The key factor here was telling people. I got lucky and failed, but I could have saved myself a lot of grief by just telling people instead of trying to bear it all on my own. Reading back over this I kinda make it sound like a cake-walk. It has been a painful experience. But I am here, and I know now that it is never a bad time to tell someone how you're feeling.
