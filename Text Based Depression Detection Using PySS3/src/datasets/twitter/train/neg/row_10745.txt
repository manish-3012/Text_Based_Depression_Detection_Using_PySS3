Does anyone else find themselves writing suicide notes at least once a week?Throwaway account, because obvious reasons. But is this unusual? Do people typically write them more than once, or is it only on the final straw that they write them, or does it vary per person? All I know is that I find myself accepting my fate more and more, and something random stops me before I get onto another step. I guess I'm lucky.
