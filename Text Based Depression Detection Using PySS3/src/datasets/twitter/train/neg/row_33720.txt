I have a very complicated ****show of a life, but maybe someone can offer some insight to show me some hope.I have lived for 25 years and it is going on 26. I have had 5 years of random severe pains preventing me from sitting or standing that forced me to pretty much lay down all the time between doctors appointments. No one has been able to help me and as of now I have 11,000$ in debts and I am living on sparse support from my parents that is essentially running out. I have a growth on my face that I am positive is a tumor that is causing me even more pain on top of the pain I was already enduring. I told my father that if it is cancer it would probably be a blessing because it would mean I'd get SSI I previously didn't qualify for, medicaid health aid, EBT and other benefits. It wasn't a lot but it was certainly better than nothing and I was trying to salvage something to keep it going. He said it wasn't good enough. That was like getting a sand castle kicked in my face.

I am physically unable to work and I am going to the ER tomorrow for the pain this growth on my face is causing me. I have suicide on my mind for several reasons; pain, mental exhaustion, anxiety over debts and finances, the overwhelming guilt of being a burden and the lack of any real apparent future beyond being a bum.

&amp;#x200B;

My Dad was right. It really wasn't good enough. He wanted to retire soon and I was still going to be a financial burden. I don't intend for this hospital visit to fix all of my problems, but I am waiting to see. I was considering if all fails to use the remainder of my credit for an exit bag to die quietly. The strangest thing is a detached feeling I have about the whole thing. It feels like something I have to do or am expected to do; not because I want to die. It looks like the only feasible end.

&amp;#x200B;

My life was largely unimpressive. I had decent grades, went to community college, went for nursing, was in too much pain to continue my education and the last 5 years were spent seeing any doctor that would see my in a fruitless endeavor to get well. I have never been in a relationship, went on an actual vacation or did anything worthy of being remembered. I wonder if this is why mass shooters exist? Are they just suicidal people that would rather be remembered as a monster than no one at all? I am not planning on this in case anyone was concerned.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am trying to look at everything one more time. Even if I declared bankruptcy I would still be in an awful position with no bank account or means to pay bills. It might be a long shot that this tumor is related to whatever has caused me such pain over the last 5 years. If it gets cured, will everything else be? What if it's just a rogue infection? My PCP already gave me antibiotics just in case which I am taking. That's why I am not even sure I should go to the Hospital and risk worsening my finances. Both my Father and my Brother are supposedly angry at me for not going to the ER immediately, but they forget the time of year and that I might rack up thousands in debt for a simple infection.

&amp;#x200B;

That's about the complete story. Is there any way you can see me salvaging this life? I'd prefer not to die, but I am not averse to dying. Everyone has to go sometime and not everyone gets to choose when or have it be painless or easy.
