I want help. I also want out.I can't even think enough to write something. I want to feel better. Life keeps bringing on the knocks. I know everyone has challenges. I just don't think I can handle feeling this way anymore. Chronic pain, mental illness and all the other life stress is too much to cope with. It's been almost 4 years since I felt like myself. I've tried to make a new normal but still haven't managed.

I was doing slightly better going on medication after the last time I posted. I was barely hanging on but there was something better in all of it so it was definitely the medication helping. My pain levels and stress levels have been too high to handle again though. I just want out of this. I don't even feel worthy to be in this shell. My babies mean the world to me though. I am struggling with feeling like they'd be better off, but I don't want to ever hurt them. I just want to feel better for them. I don't know if that's possible. I want it to be, but it's been 4 years and I can't handle feeling like this.
