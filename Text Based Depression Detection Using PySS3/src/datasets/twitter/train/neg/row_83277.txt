How do I say my goodbyes without anyone knowing what I'm about to do?I set myself a date, but honestly I set that date too far into the future. I'm going to do it today. It's the only thing that makes me not anxious terrified and suicidal (ironic I know).

I want to say goodbye. I can't just leave it like this. How do I say it without people working out what I'm going to do?

Note that I have a decent history of mental health problems, so people are generally pretty wary if I say anything out of the ordinary at this point.
