I'm getting better. I'm getting better, I can feel it. I haven't been taking any pills, no antidepressants, nothing. My moods have improved slightly, and to be honest, I can't remember the last time I had a suicidal thought. I don't really feel nervous anymore when I'm at train stations, and I no longer feel the need to jump out of a train or car. 

I passed my 1 month self harm free day on Sunday. I'm not going to lie - it was difficult, hard and stressful, but it was worth it when I was able to wear short sleeves around people. 

I still get the same, awful, low mood now and then, but I've learnt how to ignore it. But at the same time, it makes me realise how much better I am. 

I feel like I have something to live for now. I decided that because I'm 15, there's no need to throw away a life. So I pulled myself together and decided to make my life worth living. I'm going hold myself together and get through the shit life throws at me and get better. Not just for myself, but for my family too. I'm going to laugh at all the stupid jokes I get told and enjoy every moment. I'm going to remember the good times and replace the memories with the bad thoughts. I'm going to get a girlfriend and just enjoy being young while I can. I'm going to finish my GCSEs then go onto college to do my A Levels then I'm going to go onto university and study astronomy. Then I'll be able to look back and remember my darkest, weakest time and tell myself I got through it. I'm going to do it, I promise.
