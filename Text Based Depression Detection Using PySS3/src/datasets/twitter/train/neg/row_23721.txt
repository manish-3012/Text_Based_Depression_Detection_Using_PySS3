2 Week Update: I am feeling better.I almost ended it a few weeks ago but I didn't because I told myself I could try to change things and see how it goes. 
Well. I've started going on walks. Sleeping when I need to. Eating better. Standing up for myself. 

It's not great but I am feeling okay right now. 
I still can't stand my job or the place I live but I suppose it's an improvement.
