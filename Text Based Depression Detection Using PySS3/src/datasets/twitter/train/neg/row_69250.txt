I wrote a suicide note for the first time todayI have felt like dying on and off for the past 8 years or so.  My mental health is the worst it has been these past months, breakup, lost my job, failing at my degree.  I'm a burden to everyone I know.

The more I wrote out explaining myself, the more it made sense to me to end things.  I truly think that some people never get better, and I am one of them.

I think suicide can be selfish, but I think me dying will be the kindest thing I can do for those around me.

I am distracting myself tonight, but all that does it put this truth in the back of my mind.  It will be back.

I don't know why I'm posting here when I have already made up my mind.  Maybe there's a small part of me that doesn't want it.  I don't know.  Nobody has to respond, I just wanted to get my thoughts out somewhere.
