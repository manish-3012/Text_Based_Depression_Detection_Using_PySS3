I haven't achieved anything in my life so far.**Intro**

I want to preface this with a little bit of history before I ask for advice. I started college at the age of 18 like anyone else here in Belgium. Got forced into a degree I didn't like and quit after a year. Afterwards I fell into a heavy depression and tried to kill myself by cutting my wrists with a pocketknife I got from my dad. 
The reasons for why I wanted to die back then were low self-esteem issues, coupled with extreme loneliness due to never having had a girlfriend before that age.

Afterwards my parents consulted me to take studying on a 'slower tempo', which basically means I will probably finish my bachelor's degree (normally a 3y one) in 5 years, meaning I'll have my first actual college degree at the age of 25. Master's (if I don't fail any of my classes or kill myself before that) will be at the age of 27.

**Reasons for my current suicidal thoughts**

**1.** Now, how do I deal with feeling like a huge failure compared to everyone I know around me? When I talk to the people who know me they tell me I shouldn't worry too much about it because of my previous mental problems, but it doesn't take that feeling of being a loser away for me at all. 

**2.** Not only that, but I've never felt so alone before. Now I did have a girlfriend for 2 years after my first suicide attempt which made me a lot happier, but the fact that I'm still going to be in college until at least the age of 27 gives me such a low confidence that I don't know if I'll even get one until I finally hit that point. I think the best thing for me would be to get into a serious relationship again but I keep telling myself no one wants to be with me until I'm an 'actual independent adult' at this point.

**3.** Lastly, I've never had to struggle economically in my entire life. Why do I even feel depressed? There are tons of people out there in worse situations and I'm the one who feels like he should end his own life. I feel like shit for letting my parents down all these years.

Sorry for the long bible of text, but I just don't know where else to tell my story at this moment. If there's any advice or guidance you have for me please do tell, because I'm desperate.

**Tl;dr** : **1.** Feeling like a failure for not having a bachelor's degree until the age of 25. 
**2.** Feeling extremely lonely because of not being in a relationship + feeling like not having a degree will make no one want to be with me in the first place. 
**3.** Feeling guilty when other people out there have it worse than me. 
Any advice is very much needed
