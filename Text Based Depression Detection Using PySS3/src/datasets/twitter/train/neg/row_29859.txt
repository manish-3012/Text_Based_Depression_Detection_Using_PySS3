overdosed and nearly died, anyone want to be friends and support each other?I have no one, when I told my dad I ODâ€™d he just went back to sleep. Told him iâ€™m going to the ER he went back to sleep. Thatâ€™s my family =]

We can talk about anything, or nothing at all.

Iâ€™m glad I survived and hoping I could meet a friend on here so we can support eachother 

Keep hoping to find an amazing girl that
makes life worth living again.. but iâ€™m not holding out much hope =P ... I donâ€™t like to admit it but I miss my ex of 9 years. She left me right when my mom died of cancer, like the same day. 

Anyone want to come to my rescue? Very kind soul, just a bit broken inside.
