I'm losing my mindI'm loosing my mind. I'm a compulsive liar, I push all my friends away, my gf left me because she lost interest in me and you know, I fucking loved her to death, now I'm watching her go after someone better than me in every single way, but who can blame her? I'm trying to hold on but I fucking can't. My friend tried to kill herself last night and I tried to help but I fucking couldn't. I didn't know how. She made it through the night but what happens if she gets that way again and I'm the only one who can help her? I won't know what to do. I want to die so badly right now, and I'm trying to get through the day. I don't see myself going on any longer. I just want to die in the least painful way possible, but I fucking cant because I don't have any money and I don't have a way to get anything. I could just hang myself but I don't know. I'd try to fight for my life. I know I would. I'm so damn lost and I don't see any hope left for me. I wan't to scream and just cry but I fucking can't. I am loosing my fucking mind. I need help but I don't know where to get it. Help me... Please
