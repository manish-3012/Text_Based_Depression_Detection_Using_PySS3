I hate myself and felt depressed :(Hello guys, I have been feeling lonely and depressed lately. The reason is , I gave my ssn and my other personal details to Bitcoin scammer foolishly and mistakenly. In one word, I got scammed so I hate myself. I was thinking about suicidal thoughts when I got scammed. Now I have no energy and no desire to do anything. I constantly worry about my identity that what identity thief would use my ssn for what etc. I am in other country other than USA. Whenever I try to do things to prevent from identity theft ( put freeze or fraud alert or something to prevent from IDtheft) those things can't be done because I am stuck in other country. What should I do? I feel no energy :( I just need an advice and inspiration, I felt so desperate
