i wish i could go through with it.ive never felt so sure that i want to die until today. ive been looking at prices for CO tanks and theyâ€™re not too expensive. i just wish i could actually push myself to buy one. i never planned on going this far in life and i really thought maybe i could do it, but today has showed me that i canâ€™t. i know this is what i need to do, so why canâ€™t i just do it?
