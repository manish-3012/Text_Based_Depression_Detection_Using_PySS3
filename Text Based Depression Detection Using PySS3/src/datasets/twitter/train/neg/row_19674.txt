Mods/Frequenters of this subreddit - I need adviceLet me start off by saying I am NOT suicidal.  I just need advice on dealing with the amount of in-your-face coveridge of the shooting there has been lately.  Its really starting to bum me out, and I figure the people who frequent this subreddit and the mods might have some advice as to how you cheer yourself up after seeing so much depressing stuff.
