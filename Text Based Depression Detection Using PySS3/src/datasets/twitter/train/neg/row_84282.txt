Finally, the end is near.I never been this close to wanted to kill myself ever. I can feel it in the air that my death is near. I really can. For so long I wanted to kill myself but never had the guts to do it. Yea only wanted attention for my sadness back then. Now I have overcome the need for attention and block the advice that people give to me. There is no point of talking me out of suicide. I have made this decision for a long time. SO why talk about it here? To express my feelings that is why. I don't have timetable nor I will share it on here, I hate white cops. But I think I know what to do to achieve it.
