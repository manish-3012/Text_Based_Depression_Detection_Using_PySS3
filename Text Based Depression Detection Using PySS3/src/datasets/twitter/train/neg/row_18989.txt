Born a fucking failureFirst off excuse my username...

Anyway, I feel like a useless piece of shit. My brothers and my friends are totally better than me, while I'm still struggling to find out who I am. I feel liek I wasn't meant to be born. Nothing has been going good for me and I feel like I'm stuck in a loop. Who the hell am I? Everyone is having fun while I just sit here and suffer. Am I just too unique for anyone? I'm the odd one out. Everyone looks at me funny as if I have an awkward presence, even though there are a ton more awkward people they talk to and that they're fine with. Who knos it coudl be me thtats the problem. I've been a lurker on here and I actually posted on here before on another account i deleted. it's my birthday in 4 days and most of my friends moved on to different things and i dont know what i will do to my life. i've been a cutter recently and i don't know...i just don't fucking know.
