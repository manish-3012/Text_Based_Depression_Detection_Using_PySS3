"Fake it til you make it". My last ditch effort. Failed. I don't want to do this anymore.Therapy, meds, exercise, CBT, moving, new hobby, new friends, eating properly, sleeping as properly as I can, and finally just pretending to be happy until I can convince myself that I am. Failed. 

I've tried it all. Nothing actually fixes anything if **I** am the problem. 

I can't sit here thinking about her with MY dog and that other fucking "street artist" guy any more. I can't fucking deal with being alone. I can't sit on the sidelines watching people live their lives while I'm fucking just using up their oxygen. 

Everything I was fucking working for. Gone. And it will never happen again for me because I won't let it. I'm not going to waste my fucking energy seeking what I know I'll never have.

I've gone and gotten myself in a situation where someone depends on me for rent money. If not for that I'd fucking check out right now.  I thought if I put myself in a situation where someone depended on me, it would give me the push I need to get the fuck over this. But I'm starting to feel that I don't really give a shit anymore.
