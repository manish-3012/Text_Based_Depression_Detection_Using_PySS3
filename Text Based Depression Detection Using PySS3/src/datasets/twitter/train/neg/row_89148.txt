Why am I such a piece of shit?Why am I incapable of being a normal human fucking being. Why can I just not be lonely. All I do is feel this extreme loneliness and reach out to my friend for some company and I get irritated when they say no and it just pushes them away from me. Today I think I've finally broke the last straw of our friendship and when they eventually end it later today or tomorrow I will no longer be bound to my promise I made to not kill myself and I will be free to go forth with my plan and end my pain. I can't lie the thought of not feeling anything is so appealing right now as I can't see my life getting any better due to me being an incapable piece of shit. Everything is all my fault but I will soon rectify my mistakes and remove myself from this existence. I really wish I didn't feel this pain and I wish I could be happy but I know it's not possible because I don't have the willpower to do anything about it.
