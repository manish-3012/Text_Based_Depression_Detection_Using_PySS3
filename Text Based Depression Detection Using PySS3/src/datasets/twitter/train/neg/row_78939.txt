I tried to hang myselfLast thursday was a fun day, but it was also the scariest for my family. My parents are divorced, so that day i went to the beach with my Father. It was really fun. And when i came home i talked with my mother and everything was fine.

But I tried to commit suicide in my bathroom later on that day. I tried to hang myself, but i was too scared or i didn't want to. I'm not sure which. I wanted that fantastic day to be my last. I didn't plan it, it just happened. 

When i was in the bathroom, i called my sister and told her everything. She told me that she loved me and that i was loved.Â  The next day, my sister came over to my house and we had an emotional conversation with my Mom. I promised them that i would never think or do anything like that again.

The reason why i tried committing suicide was because of the fact that i hate myself. I hate the way i look. I hate the way i talk. I hate myself for making terrible friends. I hate myself because i present myself as a dumb hilarious guy. I Hate Myself. I don't know if i can keep that promise.
