Gonna kill myself on my birthdayI'm 19 now. I'm gonna kill myself on my 20th birthday to show how much I wish I never existed. I was never going to amount to anything. I was never going to do anything good for society or humanity or my country or my friends or my family. 

I don't want to do anything good for anyone. I don't want to fall in love and have a family and grow old and have a job. If I can't get high, I'd rather die. I can't live the rest of my life sober. I'd rather be 6 feet under than live another few months sober or the rest of my life. I could never deal with my emotions and I could never deal with life. I blame my parents for my addiction. I blame them for not being good enough and for being abusive when I was younger. 18 years of that is not something I forget. 

If there is a Higher Power, I pray that I die this time. I don't want to ever wake up again.
