[TW CHILD ABUSE] My family already hates me. So what's stopping me?Hey all. Sorry, this gets a bit heavy.

My parents hate me for various reasons I'm not about to get into here. Rest assured it's crap beyond my control. They have demonstrated this my whole life, as they've been abusing me the entire time. Never physically, although I almost wish they would.

I feel like they would be far happier without the burden of their failure child. They can pin their hopes and dreams on my brother, he's already more successful than me. 

It should be easy, but why can't I just end it? Probably because I'm a coward. Sorry for the vent.
