Why do I have to live in a world without her?It's been 8 years since she died. I wanted to be with her longer and I wanted to spend my time with her a little bit more. I wanted to talk her a whole night. I wanted her to see me change for better. I wanted her to be a bit proud of me. Lastly, I never wanted her to leave me.

So, why do I have to lose her existence while only  getting to keep these unfaded memories? Why do I have to live in a world without her?
