Is it safe to bring up suicidal ideations in a counseling session?I have a session today and I have posted a similar thread before asking the same question. I lied to my counselor on the first go around regarding thoughts of killing myself, but I do not know if I will get the appropriate help if I do not come clean regarding all aspects of my life. I caved and bought a pack of smokes last night (2 years without one) and think about blowing my brains out every day (I do not have a gun for that reason). Recently got put on meds and am trying meditation. I want/need to avoid being hospitalized, but I also want/need professional help. Any personal experiences with similar situations?
