Nobody loves me. I'm fucking done.I'm so fucking fundamentally alone. All my former friends have moved on and I think they're embarrassed to have been associated with me.

People say "ooh you're so talented" that "you're so funny", but no-one ever wants to read my writing, listen to my music or look at my paintings. And if I ask them to, I feel like they're only doing it out of politeness. Either way, I hate myself for existing.

No-one EVER gives me a phone call out of the blue, which means I have to call others to talk. Just to feel like I matter. That someone likes me. But they're always too busy. Which makes me feel like shit for bothering them. I am literally a liability to everyone around me. And I hate myself for it.

I've tried to meet people, to get out of my shell. Social media, dating websites etc. I message people, and they fucking ignore me. Not even a "I'm not interested, sorry". Nothing. Like I don't even exist. It utterly destroys me.

I'm so near ending it all. All that has stopped me from killing myself before is fear of what comes after death. Fear of oblivion. But if this miserable existence of mine continues as it is, I won't care. No-one will miss me.
