you have pushed meI hate myself I wanna fucking end it fuck everyone I ever told I loved that never loved me back 
I don't want to do anything anymore I just want to get the courage to cut open my wrists I don't care about anybody any more I don't care about anything anymore I just want to die 
I'm tired of being obsessed with her 
I can't get her out of my head I don't want to think about her anymore 
I am living the same thing over and over and over again I just want to bleed out all over myself I want to watch myself die 
I don't want to breathe everybody hated me and everybody told me they hated me
