I Feel I have Nothing to Live ForToday I'm not sure why I'm alive.

I'm close to being homeless because I can't pay my rent. I'm three months behind on my car payments and will probably lose my car to repossession any day now. My bank account is negative one thousand dollars and growing. We owe nearly three thousand dollars in medical bills. We owe nearly eight thousand dollars in credit card debit. I lost my job. My husband doesn't work either but at least he's getting unemployment compensation. For now; it expires soon. I was pulled from going to college at least for the summer because I couldn't get a loan. My phone is constantly blowing up with people trying to collect money on loans and bills and everything else we owe on. I've been suffering from depression for years and have been hospitalized twice in the last month. I've been to therapies that haven't seemed to help and have been on many medications as well.

I just feel like with all the crap going on in my life I have nothing left to live for. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up again.
