Seeking help finallyIve been hating my life situation for years even though its probably better than most people. I have a job, college degree, good pay, at least one reliable friend, hobbies. I still want to die daily. I dont think ive gone a month without thinking about suicide since it started when i was 8. I had anxiety attacks in elementary that seemed to go undiagnosed and passed off as tantrums. Finally at 24 i went to the doctor and got prescribed venlafaxine. Hopefully this is the start to enjoying what should br a good life
