I really just want to not be alive anymoreI had a spa day with my friends and they showed up an hour and a half late because they stopped to visit with a friend who just had a baby but they didn't bother telling me.  I know this is a fucking pathetic thing to be upset about but i was already not in a great place and it just confirmed the idea that no one really gives a shit about me

I have a baby and without her I would already be dead but a big part of me thinks it's better that I do it now before she really remembers me.  I don't think I'm going to be okay as a mom I already yell at her when I get frustrated and it has to be better growing up without a mom than with a shitty mom but I also don't want her thinking I killed myself because I didn't love her enough to stick around

I'm jst sitting here sobbing and drinking in front of her and I can't stop

I am just the worst
