This is the last post ever.After tonight I will no longer feel numb, empty, unwanted or unloved. I will no longer feel the pain of loving someone who will never love me back. I will no longer have this empty place in my soul the left from the lose of my son. And after tonight I will no longer feel anything but peace. 

Goodbye
