Iâ€™m tired.Iâ€™m tired about everything mentally physically and every way possible I feel like Iâ€™m digging this hole taking down my few friends who care and Iâ€™m sorry to them that I canâ€™t stop being how I am I hate me I hate how I just canâ€™t stop being depressed and not suicidal for one minute it seems like a belt of burdens that drag them all down itâ€™s hard I feel like itâ€™s pushing them away to but maybe thatâ€™s just me pushing away Idk anymore I just want to feel happy again I was once not to long ago but it feels gone again as everything else I feel things just going bad and back to how they were which Iâ€™m hating I want to cry but I canâ€™t I just have to sit here with the same stupid songs on repeat and just suck it up cos I canâ€™t die on the few people who need me right I want to talk about things but idk how to express them no longer in just a blank piece of crap maybe the demons should kill me instead of them wanting me to kill others I just want this all to stop itâ€™s just to much.
