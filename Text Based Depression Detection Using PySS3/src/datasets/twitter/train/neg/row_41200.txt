No matter what I always come back to these thoughts.is it better if I'm no longer here? If I left would anyone notice? if I could stop caring would that be better? Maybe today the day that I get in a car accident and everything stops. Maybe if I wasn't around anyone their lives would improve? I'm surrounded by so many people yet feel so alone. I don't want to take my life. But at times I wish someone would do it for me. I know the answer to all the questions, but I don't care what the answers are. I just want things to end.
