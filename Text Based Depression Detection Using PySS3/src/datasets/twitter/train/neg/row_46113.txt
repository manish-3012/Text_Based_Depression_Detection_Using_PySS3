Iâ€™m aloneI went to my school dance last night and I hated it. I felt so alone. Not just because slow dancing happened but because my friends were just not being around. I wanted to be near them and theyâ€™d just wander away. I was afraid Iâ€™d end up feeling like this. I hate it. I wanted to just leave the dance and walk to the park and just get in the water and swim till I get too tired to swim farther and then just keep swimming in the hopes that I drown.
