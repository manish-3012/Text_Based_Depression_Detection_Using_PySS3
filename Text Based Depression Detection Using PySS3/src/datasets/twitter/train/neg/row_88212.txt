Why do I event continueI don't know what to do.

I don't see any reason to keep on doing anything, don't see any reason to continue bending to the system of consuming and buying to be happy.

It won't make me happy, there is just sadness.. and no reason.

I should be looking forward, using the opportunities given to me.. 

But I don't want to, there is no reason behind it.
