I feel so alone and brokenThe one person I trusted just blocked me because of a petty argument that is probably all my fault. I just feel so alone. Theyâ€™re one of my only support nets, and iâ€™m at the end of my ropes. I donâ€™t want to keep going without them. Theyâ€™re one of the only reasons iâ€™m still here today, and without them I feel so empty and broken. I just want to destroy myself and slowly drift away because obviously all I do is ruin things constantly. Iâ€™m untrustworthy, and not good enough to have around as a friend. Iâ€™m too disgusting and just an awful petty person that doesnâ€™t deserve anyone or anything.
