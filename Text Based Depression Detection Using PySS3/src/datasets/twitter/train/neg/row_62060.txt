Just aloneI don't know what I'm trying to find or accomplish here, I don't know where or how to start. But I will.

I've been bullied and singled out since elementary school. I'm fat and have learning disabilities, so I guess tat makes me an easy target. I went to a private middle school for kids with learning disabilities. Those few year I actually enjoyed, I got along well with people I became the star of the baseball team. But then I moved half way across the country, and back into public school. It was a total system reboot. Bullied and abused to the point of skipping more often than not, thus failing, thus not being eligible for the baseball team.

Throughout that whole time I always seemed to have a friend. Not good friends, not like we'd hang out after school or anything, just someone to talk to. But without fail would eventually hurt me, stab me in the back, publicly humiliate me or just pretend I don't exist.

But half way through high school, a younger (8th grade) girl approached me. We met at a weekly kids church event. She would always approach me and try to start a conversation. By this time I knew to just shut up and not do anything, just hope people don't notice me. But she just wouldn't leave me alone. So we slowly started talking getting more friendly. She eventually became my best friend, We'd hang out at her place regularly with other people I got to know pretty well, became friends with most of them.

But without fail she hurt me. I had to go back home (halfway across the country) for the summer. While away she abandoned her morals for short term benefits. Even her best friend knows it and strongly opposes it. But I'm the more stubborn, hard headed, my-opinion-will-be-heard type.That landed me in hot water i guess because now she doesn't talk to me. Even when i see her and say hi she'll hardly glance at me.

I just feel like trash. Like no one want to be near me. Just alone. I'm paranoid and have bouts of depression 


Sorry for being so needlessly long. I know I made typos and grammatical errors. Sorry Sorry. Just Sorry for everything


**TL;DR:** Picked on, alone. find great friend, lose great friend. Foreveralone

**EDIT:** I never meant to use my learning disabilities as an excuse just that it opened me up to more bullying ie being told I'm stupid, illiterate, retarded, ect.
