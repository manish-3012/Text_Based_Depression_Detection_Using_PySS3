I don't want to liveThere is literally not a single person I love or even moderately like in this world anymore and I've tried thinking hard about this for a long time but no one comes to my mind. The only person I ever really truly loved even after my adolescence is David Bowie and he isn't here anymore. I want out and I want an easy way out, I'll ask the question in the comments section or reddit won't allow me to publish this post.
