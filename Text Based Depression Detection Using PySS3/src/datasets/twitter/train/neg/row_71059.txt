I broke up with an ex who was my best friend and I just want to dieToo clarify I donâ€™t love her romantically anymore. Not even in the slightest. I feel Deep down I should have ended as I care too much too lose her. Currently on a break. But Iâ€™m struggling so much. Learnt languages, gym, drums all I think about is our friendship. Like she doesnâ€™t want to lose me. 
But messaged me â€œlook at what your doingâ€ I donâ€™t want to be friends. 

Now I read that I think maybe is because we are still on a break and I messaged quite a bit and just broken promises because Iâ€™m struggling. I havenâ€™t messaged her for a bit as I need to leave her alone. 
But Iâ€™m 100% done knowing that if I canâ€™t be friends fuck my life. Like I have no one. I just want to die if thatâ€™s the case. Like I hope she finds someone lovely who loved her as much as I did, but knowing I canâ€™t see her In the future. I canâ€™t take it.
