I think my best friend just killed herself through text and I don't know what to doLet's call her Ann. Both of us are still in high school, and our lives were pretty miserable. Both of us were closeted (she was bisexual and I was gay), and Ann was much more miserable  than I was. Her family doesn't giver her enough love and support and she has unchecked mental illnesses that verge on psychotic. We met on the first day of school and we've got along ever since I found out she was bi. We became very close and the more we grew closer the more I found out about her life.


She was depressed, not because of school (mainly), but because of her family. Ever since she was a child, she was abused by her brothers and denied love and support form her parents.

She started messaging me an hour ago, at 11 AM, telling me that she needs help. 

At the beginning of the conversation, I asked her what happened and what was up, but she didn't answer and says that she doesn't wanna do it anymore. At this point I wasn't fully aware that she was on the edge because she always feels down like this and later she'll be all fine, but I told her that whatever she was going through I supported her. 

She then says that "no one can help" "I can't make/have no friends" " but nobody wants me". And at this point I got serious and started talking to her about stuff. Stuff like how she mattered and that people loved and supported her and that she had friends.

I told her that I love her and replied with "I appreciate that" "but I'm just simply done."

When I asked her why she then said goodbye to me and after that moment all my messages to her, telling her that we should talk more, werent seen by her at all.

I went to my local group chat and sent them a screenshot of the situation but since it was the middle of the night no one was yet to answer.

I tried calling her phone but she didn't answer.

I'm panicking. I don't know what to do.
