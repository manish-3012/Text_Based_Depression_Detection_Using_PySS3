I can't wait to fucking kill myselfI know no one gives a fuck, no one will reply to this but fuck it. 

Everyday I'm closer and closer. There's no fucking light for me. I'm fucking ready to die and I'm so sick being alive 

I'm a fucking piece of shit failure who no one loves. I trusted too many people in the past and deeply deeply deeply deeply regret opening up to them and telling them some things about me. I sit in anxiety every single fucking day because I fear those people will expose me and my secrets and ruin my fucking life 

I just want to fucking die I'm going fucking crazy. I'm crying to so much but no one gives a fuck.

I'm too fucking sensitive for this world. I'm really fucking over it. I'll try hang myself, and if that doesn't work I'll buy a gun and if that doesn't work I'll jump off a building. And that's it. That's my plan. 

I can't fucking wait. No one cares. I'm never going to be happy. I'm never going to be loved. I'm never going to be strong. I fucking hate my life so much
