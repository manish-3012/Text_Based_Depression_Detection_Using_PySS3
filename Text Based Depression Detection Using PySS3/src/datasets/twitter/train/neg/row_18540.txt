Why is suicide illegal?I don't understand the point of having the act of suicide as illegal. Like, killing yourself will not merit you paying fines or having jail time, because you're dead. Seriously, what's the actual point of criminalizing suicide; or am I just misinterpreting what the word illegal means with regards to suicide?
