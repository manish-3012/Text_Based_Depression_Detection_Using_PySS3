Tired of bieng used.I'm 23 (m) my girlfriend is using me, just like my exes all of them. I have never been in a relationship with someone who wasnt cheating on me. But this one idk if shes cheating but shes using me for sure. She used to live in my town, and shes come back once since we got together the first time we hung out etc. She stayed with me too, well this time shes coming and I took the whole time off all 3 days. And well I wont see her but at night. As soon as i pick her up from the airport she wants me to drive two towns over and drop her at a friends house then go pick her up that night whenever they're done hanging out, next day shes getting picked up at my place at like 8 a.m. then i will have to pick her up that evening when shes done again Saturday she cancelled our plans for a date night to be with her friends again. Sunday I take her to the airport. I'm gonna do all this. And then I plan on killing myself in my car after dropping her off. I cleaned the car, bought plastic sheets to tarp the back seat and the floors so the clean up is easy. And since it's at the airport my body will be found shortly. I'm just tired of bieng used, cheated on everything in the book. Since theres something wrong with me I might as well fix the problem right?
