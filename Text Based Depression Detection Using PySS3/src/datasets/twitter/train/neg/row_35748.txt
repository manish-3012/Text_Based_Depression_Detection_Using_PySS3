Before anyone thinks this is a troll post, Iâ€™m actually serious about this question. Why stop or discourage suicide? People have the right to do what they want to their body. Stopping people from killing themselves is restricting their right to take their life.Personally I think it is absolutely disgraceful to tel people to not kill themselves.
