The only thing stopping me is my Partner.The idea of just ending it has been on my mind for a long time. I have been planning it. No one would really miss me. I only have one true friend, But to her I'm a random friend, no one really important. The only thing stopping me is my boyfriend, who i don't want to hurt.   


He wanted to break up on Sunday. I managed to talk him out of it. It was like the light in my head was snuffed out. all the dark thoughts came flooding back, and even though he said he still would be with me, the darkness won't go away. Every day it just gets harder and harder, i hurt myself and that inst enough. I don't really know why I'm telling you guys this. I guess to vent. I'm sorry.
