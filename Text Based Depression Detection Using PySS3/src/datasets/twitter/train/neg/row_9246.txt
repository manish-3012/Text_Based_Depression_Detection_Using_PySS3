I haven't been right in longer than I rememberAnything I say has no confidence anymore. And anything I believe has no purpose because anyone I tell will disagree instantly. I cannot explain myself not have reason to. I have no time alone and still have nobody I can talk to. Everyone is so hostile to anything they don't believe in.
