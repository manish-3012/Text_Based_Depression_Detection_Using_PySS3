I got my girlfriend pregnantSheâ€™s 25 and Iâ€™m 21. She already has one son who she can barley look after. Weâ€™ve been dating for two years and when my parents found out I was dateing someone with a child I was threatened to be sent back to my home country because they have control of my visa so I said to them I stopped seeing her but in reality I lied to them for over two years. 

I found out last night that she was pregnant and she has told her family and now sheâ€™s saying there going to find my parents at there work and tell them. Iâ€™ve tried to push for an abortion but she doesnâ€™t want that.

I canâ€™t live with the guilt,anger ,disappointment and hatred that my familyâ€™s going to have towards me. I feel so alone and scared. I donâ€™t know if I have that many more options left. 

Iâ€™m lost.idk mabey itâ€™s the answer.
