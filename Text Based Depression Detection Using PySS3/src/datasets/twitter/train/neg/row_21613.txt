Idaho labor call center don't work for Idaho and won't tell who they do work for.I'm done...I've called the Idaho number a dozen times and spoke with a dozen people.  They hang up when I press who they work for..  

I was declined unemployment even though I was laid off,, letter and all...  After these phone calls... I'm done.

Clearly Idaho officials don't care.  They hired people to provide Buddhist reasons. 

I'm sick and tired with the way Idaho runs this state.  I'm done with living like this.  It won't get better.
