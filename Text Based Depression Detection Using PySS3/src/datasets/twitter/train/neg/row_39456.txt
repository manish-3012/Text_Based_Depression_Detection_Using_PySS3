Regret from cheating.I had quit my job when i started developing an affair. But he keeps updating me about everything . And it developed. We ended up having sex. I was getting depressed at that time . No one knows why i had quit my job and my family kept on nagging me for losing job. 

After 3 months i was prescribed meds for depression( not taking any now). But the guy left me owing to my mental illness and start having an affair with another girl.He promised to marry me and save me from my not so happy marriage.( i had lots of issues in my marriage and that is not my problem now).

I got used to this and adjusted to my life . I was doing okay with my marriage. This guy contacted me again after 4 months ., took me for a drive and kissed me . Again he dumped me for another girl . 

I regret. I regret cheating my husband. I confessed everything and he is not completely ready for divorce.That my husband is still living me is killing me. I cant stand longer. I want to die. 

I loved this BF of mine too much that i even wanted to have kids with him. Now i donâ€™t want any. If not my ex BF never . I still love him truly and he is the best thing on earth. 

On the other hand , my husband is  a wonderful human being. He deserve some one better. I can stay single. I cant live like this. When ever i see his face i am dying . He have not done that deserve cheating. That is the worst thing one can do to spouse. After this i dont want to live nor i deserve.
