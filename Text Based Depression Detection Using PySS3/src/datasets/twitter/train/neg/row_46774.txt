I'm so tired and feel incredibly alone. I hate to ask for help, but I need some.I'm really really tired of being me. I have GAD, OCD, social anxiety, clinical depression, paranoia, body issues, and anger issues. I can't remember the last day that I didn't have to spend the majority of my emotional and cognitive energy on just maintaining functionality. I have a very supportive partner and mostly a supportive family, but I feel like a burden on them, which makes me feel so much self-hatred, and extremely isolated and alone. I feel like a stain on the lives of everybody around me. And the larger world just feels like it is descending into greater madness and injustice every day. The fascists are winning, the world is melting, and I just don't want to be here anymore. I feel like I'm imploding and suffocating. I'm sleeping more and more and I'm disappointed every time I wake up. I used to be a good writer and communicator, and I can't even string these thoughts into anything more than an incoherent plea for support.
