Planning to end it all in the near future.I'm usually not the type to make harsh decisions due to emotions or anything like that.  
I've been really depressed since I was a child, and soon afterwards suicidal.  
But the only reason I haven't taken any action was because of my fear of hurting my family.  
My entire life I've been struggling with life &amp; myself.  
I see myself as a failure, and i can't seem to improve myself.  
I'm usually a real optimistic, 'life-enjoying' person, or maybe that's what I think i'm trying to seem, I always put up a happy mask until i'm alone and give everyone as much love as i can, but never myself.   
All the things I've loved in life, i can't seem to enjoy anymore.  
I only feel pain and regret when I look at the mirror, at what I have achieved and done in life.   
I know that leaving this world will leave people devastated, but for once I would like to think about myself and make a selfish choice.  
I've watched every motivational video, been to the therapist, etc. But every thing I have heard/seen is what I have told myself from ages ago.   
Nothing really helps lowers the feeling I have to just, quit.  
Is there anyone that has experienced anything similar &amp; got better?  
I honestly don't know what to do.
