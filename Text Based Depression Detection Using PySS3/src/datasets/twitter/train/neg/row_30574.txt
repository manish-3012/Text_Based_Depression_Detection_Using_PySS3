George Carlin and SuicideWhether I like the comedian or not doesnâ€™t matter. This thread is not really about subjective opinions, or perspectives. Iâ€™m just objectively speaking about his work. 

He predicted mass suicide. Yâ€™all think suicide rates will only get worse? I donâ€™t think this terrible culture and system will change quickly enough to conditions to equal that of say Finland. 

Mental illness will continue to plague this nation(the US). We need rapid change towards making the health and well being of the overall population the absolute #1 priority.
