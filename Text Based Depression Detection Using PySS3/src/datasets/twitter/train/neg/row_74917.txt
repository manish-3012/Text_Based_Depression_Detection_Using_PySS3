Having a broken heart can kill you.Whatâ€™s wrong with me? Thinking of this hurts me. I feel something wrong with me already previously? But my intuition wasnâ€™t on point. Now things are happening and itâ€™s as my intentions made.  

This man had a girlfriend and hid her until she decided to come out. I found out he didnâ€™t like me, and he said heâ€™d see me again later but that he was sorry.

My heart hurts. I feel like I have a broken heart. Whatâ€™s going on? This person was suppose to protect me. Iâ€™m moving too fast at my young age. 

I donâ€™t want to be here, anymore. My heart is turning into a mental situation.
