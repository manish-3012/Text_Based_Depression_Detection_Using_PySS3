feel like im at the end of my ropeNot gonna tell you my whole life story 
but lets just say i had a shitty childhood filled with trauma and bad parenting 

i have adhd and have an addictive personality 
been smoking weed and drinking since my 14th
highschool dropout 

ive had been depressed before and suicidal but its diffrent now i feel like im getting closer and closer to actually doing it it started a few months ago when my stupid fucking brain suddenly gives me all these lost memories, bad memories

im not gonna tell what i did but i did some bad things unforgiveable things in the past i forgot about them but my fucking brain just deciced for what ever reason to rememeber all the bad and shady things i ever did 

i feel paralyzed now i remember  everything and i wont forget again there is nothing i can do to forget again i feel like suicide is the only option i can't do anything my past actions and things i did paralyze me i can't distract myself i can't feel good about myself there is nothing left for me here
