I don't like livingI'm not in a bad position as a person. Early thirties home owner live with two dogs. Had plenty of short and long term relationships but don't really care for them. Youngest of a bunch of siblings who all have had kids which I never mind entertaining or spending time with but I am glad to not take home. I have no interest in life at all. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal but I have been waiting/hoping for it to end since I was very young. Nothing about life is intriguing or stimulating or truly entertaining to me. I am essentially bored no matter what I do. I have jumped out of airplanes, flown hang gliders off of mountain tops driven motorcycles fucked hookers and dated 10s messed with 3s and nothing has entertained me. I've tripped on drugs been an alcoholic for about 17 years I've been arrested and again none of it matters. Life is a joke. I yearn to live off the land like our ancestors but feel forced to live the capitalist life I was born into which has made me only care to survive long enough for my parents to not watch me die.
