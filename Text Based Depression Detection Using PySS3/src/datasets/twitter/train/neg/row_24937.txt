Assisted suicedI firmly believe there should be a program dedicated to assisted suicide for the terminally and mentally ill when prevention and recovery prove ineffective. 

When an individual gets to a point where they have fought for years with their illness with little to no success, there is nothing anyone can do to stop them from ending it.  Thatâ€™s why a program should be put in place where a person can be in a safe, controlled environment with trained personnel to be euthanized.
