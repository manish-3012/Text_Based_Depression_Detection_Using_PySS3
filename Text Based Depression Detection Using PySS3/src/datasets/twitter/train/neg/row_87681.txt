Do you feel ok yet?
Is this just how life feels, are you weak?
Yes,
I can hardly stand.
A puppet on her last string,
150 milligrams 
The only hope left 
Cold in its orange bottle
Unfeeling like me. 

Tranquilize me, rip my heart out, stop itâ€™s feeling, stop itâ€™s beating, no difference.
Unmake me 
I pray to a god of 150 milligrams
The only one I can feel.
Take me somewhere else
Anywhere else, Iâ€™m begging.

Maybe we should up your dose....
150 mg doesnâ€™t seem to be working.
