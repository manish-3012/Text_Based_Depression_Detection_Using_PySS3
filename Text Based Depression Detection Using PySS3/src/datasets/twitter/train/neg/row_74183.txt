Weed is the only thing keeping me alive.When I smoke it, I feel happiness.  
Sure life may be temporary and full of bullshit, but hey, at least there's weed.

I smoked it the other day and I had the best time at work. I met a cute Italian girl and we flirted with each other.  

Then the high wears off, and I realize how fucking broken I am.  
I'm autistic, and weed makes me feel normal.
