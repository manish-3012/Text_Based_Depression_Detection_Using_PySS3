Thank you. And, by the way, it does look better tomorrow.A few months ago I posted on here about my issues. A few people cared enough, for complete strangers on the internet to tell me that my life mattered, and my problems, whatever they were, were solvable. So I did not take my final liberty. 

So here I stand today, with a closer relationship with my wife. Who incidentally is sleeping next to me with no knowledge of my posts, and better outlook on life, and if not complete happiness, the willingness to fight through it to achieve satisfaction.
Let not death be your option. Find the fear that is stronger than death to you, and conquer. 
Mine was letting my wife, my family, and my country down. But thanks to 2-3 random people, I chose life. 
Anyone who needs help, ask. Say something. 
That is all. Thank you.
