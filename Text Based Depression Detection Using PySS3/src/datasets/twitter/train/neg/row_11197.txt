How to make friends? What is confidence? How to respect yourself?Why do feel the need for a partner? It's humiliating and makes me so ashamed. I've never needed one before, only in the last few months. I think it has something to do with me pretty much giving up on recovery, knowing that I'll die within the next 5-10 years, and not wanting to do so alone after having starved to death in agony, lying in my bed.

What is confidence? I keep hearing about it, but I've never experienced it. I hear it can help you make friends. The only way I can get people to notice me when I leave my house is if I attempt to steal something. How do I make friends? In the very few instances that I THOUGHT I've made a friend, they always turn out to be racist, or sexist, or homophobic. I don't want friends like that. Then they blame me when I turn away from them. 

I'm just so sick of all this nonsense. Why can't suicide be easy? Everything that's ever lived has also died, so why can't it be as simple as getting in the bed and telling your mind: "okay - die."??
