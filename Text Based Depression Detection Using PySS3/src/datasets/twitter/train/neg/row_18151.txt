hopeless and aloneto much is going on at once, every one i know is depressed and unhappy with life but seems to not be able to think of anything to make it better. i try to be there for everybody and then when i need help i have no one to go to since they have other htings that are more important then my life which im trying my best to end. ive been suicidal off and on for six years or so but until recently i alway had at least someone there, now im only used and all have gone, moved away or have others that mean im worhtless. im drowning in medical bills frm a surgary that i had wher i was in the hospital for a month and relized i had no friends left when i came out since out of sight out of mind is very true. ive failed at everything and am only wasted space that is not woth living and will have no one miss me if this time it works. history has proven that it probably will not work so its hard to talk to anyone that i know about it since its ust liek o not this again and disregard it, i apolizise for all the typos but its hard to see straight and though tears, ive left out lots of other things that are happending in my life but if interested ask. it all just seems hopless and will never get better it hasnt in years and can think of no reason it will start now
