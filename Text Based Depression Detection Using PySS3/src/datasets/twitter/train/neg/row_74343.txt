UglinessI look in the mirror, and I see my wretched, ugly face every single time. I'll look at it at every angle and in different lighting each time, hoping that my face will change from ugly to conventionally attractive. I think I should kill myself because of how disgusting I look. My face is not symmetrical. My eyes have an odd shape. Whenever I speak, my ugliness increases. I really don't want to be ugly, but at least some people get a kick out of it. People will point out my flaws for entertainment. I'm sure they look at me, and they laugh in my direction saying, "look at that ugly girl! Why does she even exist?"

I want to kill myself, and I want to do it today, but I don't have the means to commit suicide. Sorry about posting this whiny post. I feel extremely suicidal, and I want to die. I really want to not exist. Being ugly is just one of the many reasons why I want to commit suicide.
