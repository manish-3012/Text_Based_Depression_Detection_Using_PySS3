December suicideHello,

I am not suicidal or feeling suicidal, but I have a *lot* of friends who seem to be going through some December depression.

What exactly is the best thing to say to somebody who comes to you with suicidal thoughts? I'm honestly getting personally drained into feeling depressed by them leaning on me so much, to the point that I'm sometimes tempted to tell them to just shit or get off the pot. But that is probably worse than ignoring them. Should I ignore them? What if they are serious? What if I ignore them and I was the last person they tried before actually going through with it because nobody would listen?

Thanks for your input.
