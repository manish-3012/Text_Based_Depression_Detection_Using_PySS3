I'm lost, please help me...I'm totally lost in my life and I feel like i really have no reasons to stay since i'm just suffering anyways... Right now i can't stop crying even if i've been crying for an hour. I have nobody in my life I can talk to and even if I'm really young it seems to me that my life is already ruined. I'm just posting here because i don't know what to do and i don't have hope anymore but i'm also not brave enough to kill myself. What should I do ? I wish there was something that could make me feel better, even if just a little bit because I just can't stand this pain anymore...
