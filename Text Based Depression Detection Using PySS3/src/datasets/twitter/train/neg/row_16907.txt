Is it possible to get euthanized?Depression started with High school. Made tons of bad grades, trouble focusing, and not bullying but teasing from folks. Dropped out of college because it was too much for me at the time. Worked terrible retail and warehouse jobs for years. Hopped from job to job looking for decent fulltime work, preferably office. Went into the Army, one of my dream careers, and failed Ait due to injury. While I refuse to reenlist due to "stuff" I was a somebody. I became a man, an adult, friends, a personality. I guess it was the freedom I had. When I was considered a holdover/holdunder at least. Now I'm back home with a family that never understands and neglect my feelings/emotions. It seems like I can't be happy and continue to fail at everything. It doesn't help I have social anxiety. I just want to end it all. Only thing keeping me from committing suicide is the pain I'll feel. I just want to die in my sleep or something. Had thoughts of driving into a deep river, but I fear drowning. Is there any places where euthanization is legal? I don't want to live anymore. I don't care how my family feels because they never consider how I feel about anything. They're old, traditionalist, Christians who never had to deal with depression, stress, or social anxiety. I want to fade into obscurity and cease to exist. 

Tldr: Failed a lot in life, matured away from home, came back home a failure again
