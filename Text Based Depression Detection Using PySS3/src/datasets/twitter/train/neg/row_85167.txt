I tried to kill myself 3 times, now I know what it takes to get the job done, and i'm afraid that I will do it.I know how to do it, I don't want to die, but I am just tired of life being one piece of bad news after the other. I can't sleep anymore because I have flashback-nightmares of when I was abused and bad fights I was in with my family. Its just constant torment and I am not strong enough to deal with it all. I really don't want to die, because I don't know what that will do to my best friend, but I can't live with this anymore. The only way it might get better, is if I can make it till i'm out of highschool and I can move out. But I'm only 15 and I graduate less than a month after I turn 19. I just want the pain to stop. I asked for therapy because I started cutting again, but was instead made fun of by my family. My life is fucked beyond repair. 

I might try tonight.

I hope I don't, but I can't keep going like this anymore.

I don't know what to do anymore.

I'ts not like anyone will see this anyways. 

I just want a hug
