Whats the point of life?We are born without a choice of whether we wanted to be born into this world, we arent told what to live for. Were only told what to do

We are told to get a job, go to school, all to support society, but where was our choice?

We work for materialistic gains, gains that corporations achieve, not us. We can buy games,cars with the mony we make, but what is the point of it all? 

I dont see a point in life anymore, since I was young I just stared at people and watched them live their life, but for what?  Why do they choose to live?

What will anything accomplish, whats the point of living
