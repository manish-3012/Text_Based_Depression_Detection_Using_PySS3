This has been one of the worst weekends of my whole year and I don't know who to talk to.Im in crisis mode atm. I woke up on Friday thinking i had a meeting I had to rush in for, but turns out it was actually online, which was shit for me, because I had no idea what was going on during it (we ended up using multi-caller phone call) because I was so phased out. I was then meant to ask for prizes from businesses to donate this week, and I only ended up having time to work out which ones I wanted on Thursday, but for the rest of Friday I was out of it, and was also too scared to sort them out in person so i told the manager id organise it on Saturday. 

Eventually I got a headache from being in front of the computer for so long and then I started talking negatively about me and stuff which was probably a minor anxiety attack but my friend convinced me to go home and rest after eating something. I did and then woke up on Saturday, feeling shit cause it was so hot (34 degrees Celsius), and then I ended up getting a severe anxiety attack in the afternoon which left me crying on the bathroom floor, to exhausted to try stabbing myself. Then the evening rolled around and everything seemed amazing. 

Then I woke up at 2am with my friend having an anxiety attack and me having to be there for her culminating in me being told that I'm not going to be talking to her as I was before, and I don't help at all cause nothing will help her anymore, so she wont check her phone but will stay in bed. I feel cut deep inside. I haven't been able to go to sleep and it's 4:40am because a person I live with hasn't gone to bed yet and has made noise to keep me up all night. 

The holidays are nearly over and I can't cope, I probably won't be able to go to church this morning, and I'm a failure because I haven't been able to do any of my commitments and I don't know how I'm going to explain this. I'm in a horrible situation with my friend and I don't know who to talk to. This is the worst.
