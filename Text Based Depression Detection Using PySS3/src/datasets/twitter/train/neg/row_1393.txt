I just can't do this anymore.I have past posts with specifics about my garbage life if anyone actually wanted to read it, but the tl;dr is no job, no local friends, no money, family that likes to give shitty generic advice "just move your sleep schedule, just get some exercise."


I can't do it anymore.  I can't find a job - everything I apply to in my field just doesn't get back to me; I really don't want to work retail.  I can't go out in this city because I have no money and my abusive ex still lives in the area and I don't want to run into him.  I can't just make friends when I have no money to go out.  I absolutely hate living at home with my family and a crappy retail job won't allow me to move out on my own.


Last time things got close to this bad, I used to get through the day by remembering that I was never more than 20 minutes away from not having any problems anymore, but I don't think I can handle this cesspool of a life anymore.


Thanks for the support in getting off cymbalta, and sorry for wasting everyone's time.
