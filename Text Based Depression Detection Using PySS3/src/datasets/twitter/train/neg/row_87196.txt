I dont see it anymoreI'm sorry but I don't see anything worth me being here anymore. Nothing makes me happy anymore even if I try. And I've tried for a long time. The person who made me finally happy decided to hurt me and leave some time ago. The closest doctor appointment I could get is in October and I don't know if I can make it until then.
