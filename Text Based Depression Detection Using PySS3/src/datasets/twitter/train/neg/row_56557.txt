Idk how I will do this life thingSo mental illness is one big reason why I'm suicidal. But another is just life itself. I don't have it in me to work 9-5 the next 60 years while being miserable. I'm not a good worker anywhere because I give no fucks thanks depression. I am simply not fit for this world. I've been doing a lot of fasting lately and I just feel like going into a forest and fasting until I die or something. I mean im already dead. Theres no life to me. I csnt experience pleasure pretty much. I'm boring dumb ugly useless mentally ill . How is this not hell ? I feel like life clulda just been created by a higher power to torture me. It really feels like it.. I'm tired of this shit
