am i too young to feel this hopeless?i'm 19 and already disappointed in everything. i don't believe in the healing power of love, the possibility of financial success and being content with your career... i don't see any way how the world can offer me something exciting. some people are scared of wasting their life but i feel like i just have to sit still until it ends - i don't think there's such thing as "wasting time" because every second is a burden. the only moments i truly enjoy are when i'm with my mom or friends, but they can't dedicate their lives trying to help me or be here for me always, they have dreams of their own...while mine are dead.

i just wish i had a desire of being alive, a lust for life. i don't know if i don't because the world is fucked up or my brain is, or both.
