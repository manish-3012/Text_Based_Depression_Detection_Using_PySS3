Dealing with loss and my mistakes.Like a lot of people here, I am on the verge of suicide. Yesterday I had every intention of hanging myself but I couldn't because I was locked out of the house. Go figure. 

I recently broke up with my girlfriend and after seeing her again, it was made clear that I ruined our relationship with my depression. I was so focused on how I felt that I couldn't see what I was doing to her. I couldn't see that I wasn't there when she really needed me. I've told her I'm sorry. I balled my fucking eyes out to her and told her how much I regret letting her down. But she has begun to move on. I was fucking crushed. My heart exploded into a billion pieces that I don't even know how to begin to pick up. 

I have sought help. I went to the hospital and waited for nearly 6 hours to see someone. I still want to kill myself, but I don't have the energy. That is my one protective factor. I'm am too tired to kill myself. 

I want to get out of this void. I told the psych nurse that I want to get out by either ending the cycle or ending my life, whichever comes first. I have nothing left to give. There is nothing more that can be done until I learn to move past my mistakes. I just don't know that I have the strength to do it. 

I love you Sarah. With all my heart I love you. I'm sorry I couldn't be the man you needed me to be. I'm sorry I fucked up so badly that you can't take me back. I wish I could undo it all. I love you.
