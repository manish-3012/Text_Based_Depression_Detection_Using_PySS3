i want to diea while ago i realised i might have muscular dystrophy, which means i am going to have a slow and depressing death. not too long from now i wont be able to walk, i'm going to loose my favoured hand. 

because of this i fell off on my school work last semester and failed more than half of my modules which means my sponsor cutting me off, but i cant afford to pay on my own.

i haven't told my single mother yet and this is stressing me out and now am seriously considering suicide
