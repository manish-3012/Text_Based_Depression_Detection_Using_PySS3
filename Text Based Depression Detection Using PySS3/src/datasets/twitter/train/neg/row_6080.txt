Looonnng ShitI'm so tired of considering suicide whenever i struggle with something.There's no reason for me to commit however.I'm a moderate student (well my grades keep getting lower but not to the "dangerous zone"),my family doesn't hate me,i have a few friends that actually love me and we don't have financial issues.However i've always struggled when i tried to communicate with new people and i've always had a strong discomfort among crowds but these are just minor flaws i guess.I don't think these are the symptoms of i mental disease i might have.I have always had a low self esteem so maybe that might cause what i've written before.I tried to talk with the schools psychologist but she didn't seem to care about my suicidal thoughts.I feel like a spoiled asshole because i think about suicide always.I think about disabled people or people with deadly conditions who are still keeping their minds intact but i just don't feel like i should go any further.I don't have the balls to commit -yet- so i wonder if there's any way to stop your suicidal thoughts without ending it all.
P.S:Sorry for English mistakes and long shit but i just felt like i have to talk with somebody eventually.
