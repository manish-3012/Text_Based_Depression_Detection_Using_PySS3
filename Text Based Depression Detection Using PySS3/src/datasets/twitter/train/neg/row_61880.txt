No hopeI have no hope for the future. I don't mean just for me. Don't get be wrong, I'm beyond hope personally, but what really bogs me down is the fact the world hates mediocrity. The government in the US is beyond corrupt, the planet is dying, I have no access to mental health services, no job training that's affordable. It's not even about not dealing with the pain, I honestly want a gun so when shit goes even farther south I have a way out. My government hates me, I hate me and everyone else is apathetic. Animals are literally suffocating on plastic, my rent is going up, Flint has no clean water, there's asbestos in baby powder and it never ends. I can't pretend to be okay, I'm not and nothing else is. We're all going to die and there is nothing anyone with any authority can or will do about it.
