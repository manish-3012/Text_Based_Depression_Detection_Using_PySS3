I can't do itI can't live, i tried. I fought. I've been in ICU. I've encountered death 7 times, all not from attempting suicide. I tried to go on surviving by sheer willpower, i did everything i could. But i can't go on anymore.

I've been sad for 2 decades and i'm only 32. i failed starting up business 5 times. Last year was the biggest blow. Just lost my job in march. Debts are piling up. 

I was a brilliant kid, had so much potential. Certified genius at the age of 9. What a joke. Now i need to face a reality where i am never going to amount to anything, with 25 dollars left in my account. My mom told me she is disappointed i don't become what everyone predicted for me.

Had a traumatic birth 19 months ago, baby wasn't breathing so they took him to NICU and it messed my head. My heart stopped during birth and consequently it damaged. Had another cardiac arrest last year so they put in a pacemaker. I honestly think it's a waste now. 

I was a writer, a painter. I cant even think what to write or paint now everything was abandoned in my work desk underneath a pile of rubbish in the store room. 

I want to end everything except i have a toddler who i'd hate to see following my footsteps. But what if he grows up sad and defeated like me? I want to bring him with me but it's not a decision for me to make. He can't make a choice to die like i do. 

Have so many voices in my head i cant think.
