Listen!I am always reading these posts and I feel with you. I feel horrible not knowing what to comment to you because I am scared of writing the wrong shit but GOD DAMNED! I effing want everyone of you feeling better because nobody should feel this way. Since I've managed to bring my life under a bit of controll I dont feel worthy to say that I feel with you anymore. I dont even know what this post even is about I just hope someone will feel a little bit better knowing that at least a stranger who doesnt even know you cares about you even if she doesnt know how to help. I just want everyone to be better because I have the feeling the world is wasted enough. Dont make it worse by hating on you or somebody else or your future or the past or anything else that makes you feel bad. I wish you all will find enough strengh to hold on to a better moment in life. Even if it is just for your pet or for your family or maybe just because you got an amazing hair cut that you want to show the world just a little bit longer. I have no proof that life and the world will get better but I hope it does. I really do... but maybe I am just too drunk to think so you might as well ignore me. Love ya'!
