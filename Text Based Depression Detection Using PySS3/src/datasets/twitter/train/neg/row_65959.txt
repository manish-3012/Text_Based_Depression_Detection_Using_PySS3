Iâ€™m so doneIâ€™m trying to remain positive but this is just the end of my rope. Guess who didnâ€™t get a paycheck today? 

Yesterday was bad enough.. we got laid off but got promised our checks. Ubereats was slow but it was something and I knew Iâ€™d get paid today so I had some type of hope. 

My boss knows my situation.. yet still no checks. He said weâ€™d get them when the office opened up. Thatâ€™s not legal.. just how it was not legal to try to tell us we werenâ€™t layed off when he literally did it.. but wanted to try to guilt us into not filing for unemployment. 

I cried... threw a tantrum, told him how hard things were and that I worked for my money and he basically said we all have to suck it up because he wonâ€™t be making any money either.  I can obviously go to the labor board but by the time that fixes itself, itâ€™ll be too late.

Today I have made $22.71 on Ubereats. It is ridiculously slow.. and will probably get worse. And of course Half of it went to gas. I just am just so tired of struggling. Itâ€™s only going to get worse with everyone freaking out aboht the corona virus. 

Why am I even trying? A part of me wishes that Iâ€™d just get the stupid virus and die that way I wouldnâ€™t even have to have my grandma feeling guilty once Iâ€™m gone but Iâ€™m young and my immune system is pretty good so my chances of dying that way are slim. 

I just donâ€™t get why Iâ€™m even trying... I could literally end it right now. Iâ€™m tired of being ok one minute, watching my stupid tv shows and trying to distract myself and then the other minute Iâ€™m suicidal. I just need to do it because there really isnâ€™t a purpose anymore.. After all the shit Iâ€™ve been through all of my life, Iâ€™ve been here fighting but for what? What is the point? 

I remember being in school and being so stressed about a big project that I of course procrastinated for and then after hours and hours of not thinking Iâ€™d finish, Iâ€™d finish right on tome... and then all that stress left your body and it felt so good.. thatâ€™s what I think dying feels like. Iâ€™m just done. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I need that feeling back.
