Falling back on old habits..I'm trying my best but it's just not enough. 
All I want to do is end my life and I'm barely a teenager. I'm in a residential facility, and I have been for roughly 5 months now - and I've gotten all that I can out of it, and now I'm starting to slip. I'm back to self harming and I'm running out of hidden places to do so. They're keeping me here when what I believe I really need is to reintegrate into society. 
I'm tired of therapy being shoved down my throat by my mom and everyone who's a part of this program I'm in. It just isn't helping. Every session I'm drilled into and made to feel like my best isn't enough and as if I'm never going to amount to anything.  
My main fallback, self harm, is starting to take over my life. It's all I really think about anymore and it's all I want to do. I've stolen and lied because of this habit and I'm so sick of myself.
I don't get why anyone would miss me. I'm tired of this life and I don't want to keep living - not like this.
