possibly the last few months of my lifeiâ€™m currently in uni and am wanting to transfer to a different degree next year. thing is, i canâ€™t accept myself if i donâ€™t get the offer next year. i was going to end it earlier this year but this time it feels different. it may sound ridiculous to people that this is the reason why iâ€™m suiciding but iâ€™m so tired and drained from everything.
