I almost hung myself this morningI never went to bed that night so my emotions were hitting real hard, that morning still without sleep I decided I was going to kill myself. I found a belt and I tried it on around my neck to see if it would fit. It fit really well so I went to hang up the belt so it could hold me and just before I hung it up I had a moment of (somewhat) clarity: Iâ€™ll go to sleep (I ended up not getting sleep and I still am going off of no sleep as I type this) and if I still feel this way when I wake up then fuck me itâ€™s been decided. I â€œwoke upâ€ and I completely forgot about what happened
