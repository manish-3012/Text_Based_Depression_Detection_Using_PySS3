Want to be let goEver since I reached out for help, I feel like this enormous burden on everyone around me. Seeing them struggling to support me, keeping me alive by making sure I don't kill myself, it just makes me feel so much worse about myself than I already do. Why keep me alive? For who? What am I really, really needed for? People's feelings, so they don't feel sad after I kill myself? All this effort they went through to get me to take meds and go to therapy.... For what? Why is my life worth saving? It's literally pointless.

I just want to be let go. I want to kill myself, it's all that's been on my mind. I'm staying for them for now, but I just want to be let go. I don't want the help, I just wanna drown in my thoughts and let suicide take over and take action...
