It never gets better, I have been miserable and suicidal for the longest timeI think about how horrible my life is on a daily basis... the only reason that I kept living is because I don't want to hurt my family... but my life hasn't gotten better in any way

I have been stuck in a rut that is nearly impossible for me, I am starting to think more and more that there is no substitute for first world privilege... and that the only solution is suicide

I know that this is embarrassing for me to say but I still said it... I don't even know what to do with my life and my parents just don't like me 

WHY do I have to have extreme depression? WHY do I have to have OCD? WHY do I have to have anxiety? WHY do I have to have BRUTAL and utterly crippling anger issues that are worse than anyone else's on the planet?

I would give so much just for my life to be as bareable as it was before 2 years ago, but since 2 years ago it has gone to shit and I have done nothing but suffer and try so many things to make my life better but all of them have failed
