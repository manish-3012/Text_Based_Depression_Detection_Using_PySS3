Please grant me the death I seekNo one on this earth wants me. I want love.  I don't want to go on anymore. But I'm too scared to actually commit to killing myself. I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't. And my brain keeps telling me, 'what if'. I just want to be dead. People who die are so lucky. They are. I was watching a tv show episode. And in that episode, this girl was about to get killed. But then she realised she didn't want to try to survive. That her death means release, it means peace. And the person who was about to kill her sensed this and gave her a peaceful death. I want someone to do that to me. To at least give me a painless, peaceful end. She is so lucky. I want my release. So then I'll be free.
