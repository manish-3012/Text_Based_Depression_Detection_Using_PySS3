Treated like a dog in my own household.Iâ€™m open about my suicidal thoughts and anxiety to my family but I wish I never told them, because they donâ€™t care, Iâ€™m treated like an annoying pet, I canâ€™t talk about the things I like or Iâ€™m excited for, my stepdad probably wishes I was just not here, my mum just seems annoyed by me being here all the time and speaks to me like Iâ€™m an animal, she embarrasses me sometimes knowing that Iâ€™m potentially depressed and sometimes incapable of taking care of myself, sometimes life cripples you and all you want to do is rot in your bedroom, not eating, sleeping, washing, just rotting in darkness, she makes me feel as if Iâ€™m incapable of doing anything, so I never fucking bother, she gets annoyed that I feel sorry for myself but itâ€™s the only comfort I get, Iâ€™m so done with life, Iâ€™m just a mistake that deserves to rot away, Iâ€™m an ugly disgusting bitch that just deserves to fucking die.
