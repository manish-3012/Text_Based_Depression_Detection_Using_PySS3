What do I do if I don't trust myself not to do something stupid?I've been in a particularly difficult spot in my life for the past week or two, and this past weekend was easily the worst I've ever felt. What do I do if I don't trust myself not to hurt myself or something worse when I'm alone? I'm currently in high school and won't be seeing my therapist soon enough.
