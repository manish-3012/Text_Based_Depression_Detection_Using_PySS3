Sick of it allI don't know why I'm such a loser, but I'm sick of it.  I'm the guy that always gets cheated on. No friends in middle school, no friends in high school, barely any in college and they all think I'm a loser.  I just don't know what to do anymore.  I can't do this for twenty more years.  I'm so sick of being alone.
