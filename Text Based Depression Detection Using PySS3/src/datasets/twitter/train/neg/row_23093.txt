Idk anymoreI dunno why this is happening. Iâ€™m only 15 and feel like I shouldnâ€™t exist. For about a year at least Iâ€™ve been depressed. I heard puberty can give depression or something but this feels different. Iâ€™ve thought about how life isnâ€™t worth it so much that it is actually how I feel about living now. I have some social anxiety and seeing my friends easily talk to girls and flirt and shit makes me jealous. I feel like a loser even though my friends like me. But sometimes I think they are really talking shit about me when Iâ€™m not there. My brother is the only person who knows about how I feel, but only how I feel sad. I couldnâ€™t bear to tell anyone that I donâ€™t want to live. During some days I will just switch to a bad mood for the rest of the day. I stay up late and always say Iâ€™m tired so I donâ€™t have to tell the truth. Iâ€™ve thought about the least painful and easiest ways to kill myself but never looked it up because I probably wonâ€™t get results. Iâ€™ve even thought about suffering until Iâ€™m old enough to buy a gun but I donâ€™t want to wait that long. I canâ€™t fathom even getting a job or learning to drive because I never knew what job I wanted or even wanted to grow up. It scares me thing about living without any of my immediate family even though I feel so distanced. Thereâ€™s a couple pocketknives in my house and Iâ€™ve thought about using them but Iâ€™m too scared of blood and pain. Tbh that and my mom are the only things keeping me alive at this point. My mom got me a knife for Xmas to protect myself but it sits next to my bed and I think about using all the time but Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™ve thought about how I want to do it but I canâ€™t. I just want to die peacefully. I want help. I cry myself to sleep all the time listening to music. Death is terrifying but idk anymore.
