Trying to find a reason to live (vent sorry)In the past Iâ€™ve always had a breakdown moment and tried to kill myself. Iâ€™m older and I realize my impulses so Iâ€™m not acting on them right now. Iâ€™m just trying to find a reason I need to be here. There is none. I set a date and Iâ€™m keeping track of my good days and bad days. If I canâ€™t find a reason to live, Iâ€™m okay with death and going away forever. I know my mom is the one who would be hurt by it, I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s enough to keep me alive though. Itâ€™s just constant suffering and struggling everyday with my mental health. I canâ€™t remember what any other feelings than loneliness &amp; sadness feels like. Whatâ€™s the point in doing all of this just to have no one, except your mother, who loves and cares ab you at the end of the day? Going through the list of people around me, they wouldnâ€™t realize Iâ€™ve gone. Maybe years later trying to catch up, but Iâ€™m not important to anyone. My therapy is going well, i take my medications everyday on time. Iâ€™m praying my outlook changes before August 30th, Iâ€™m praying something comes along that shows me thereâ€™s more to life than this.
