I met my gf in a game and we grew close enough for her to tell me personal info including suicidal thoughts So I met my gf online in a game called overwatch we ended up growing closer and closer though I've never actually met her. 2 days ago she told me she had multiple sclerosis, hypothyroidism, anemia and rheamutism.   We were both scared she would forget me so we made a promise to keep talking to each other so that wouldn't happen.  The next day she told me that she has tried to commit suicide 6\-7 times and I also made her promise never to do it again. But she promised herself she would when she was 30. I asked her why 30 she said she wants to experience life and not die too young or too old. She wanted to have that time with dear people.   My girlfriend is 15 years old in a few months and I was 15 years old 2 months ago. I really want to help her but I don't know how.  I have 15 years to try though and I only know I have to give her a reason to live.
