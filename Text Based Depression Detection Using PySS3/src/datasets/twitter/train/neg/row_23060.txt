I wrote a note yesterday just in case...These past few weeks have been the lowest days of my life... I've been depressed before, sometimes for no reason. I've been in pain and turmoil and have felt hopeless before. But never like this. There is a single reason for this, but to mention it would mean to explain it... and no one wants to read something that long, I'm sure... The main point is I'm in the worst place of my life and it just gets worse by the day. Ending it is on my mind every day throughout the day. I want to, I cant handle it anymore... I don't even know whats keeping me from it right now. All day I can't do anything... I just sit there and wait...I wait for time to go by and I suffer in silence. It's so painful. I barely sleep ever. It's really taking its toll... I wrote a note yesterday just in case I go through with it. Its folded up in an envelope labeled "A note for just in case I'm gone" in my nightstand drawer. I don't know what to do, my life is hell... I just want it to stop so badly.
