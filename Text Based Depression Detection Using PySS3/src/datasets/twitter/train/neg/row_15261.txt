These are among my last messages until the end of timeI can see it. Every damn day. Literally every person in my life.

They are obligated to love me and I feel it. I can see how painfully obvious it is that they donâ€™t like the person that I am.  

Iâ€™m simply an unlovable human trash. I have no purpose and it wonâ€™t get better. Everything thatâ€™s left to love me or for me to love is gone. The only reason that Iâ€™m here is to clock in at 9 at clock out at 5. Nothing else.

Iâ€™m done, my time has simply passed and my days of enjoyment are gone. All gone...

With those days that life took away from me, Iâ€™ll soon take my own life with them too. That piece of shit called â€œcycle of lifeâ€ can have me back.
