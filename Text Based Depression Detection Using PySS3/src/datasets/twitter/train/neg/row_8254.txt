I made my plans today, and I am calmer than everI wonâ€™t reveal what Iâ€™m doing, but seeing all of this feels like Iâ€™m finally done and over with everything. Like Iâ€™m no longer dealing with this life long psychological cancer. I feel happy. Iâ€™m ready for the pain to stop. At this point all of my life feels like a joke, Iâ€™ve posted so many â€œcries for helpâ€ just to see if people were really genuine about â€œwishing they seen the signsâ€ and itâ€™s all rubbish as I suspected before. 

My fiancÃ© doesnâ€™t know, my family doesnâ€™t know, no one except my best friend knows and itâ€™s hilarious. Iâ€™ve been so upfront about my pain for years and itâ€™s the same old â€œwe care!â€ â€œItâ€™ll get betterâ€ shit. 

But it never does. It just evolves into bigger reasons, bigger pains, more energy. I donâ€™t want to keep going, All I can think about now is how nice it would be when things finally just...stopped
