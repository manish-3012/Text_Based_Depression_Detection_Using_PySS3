No way outI've had anxiety and depression for as long as I remember. My dad walked out on me and my mother is an emotionally abusive and unkind woman that constantly tells me how I'm a burden meanwhile my brother can basically do no wrong even though he's disregarded his education and can't pick up after himself. I currently hate the college I'm in but can't afford anywhere else unless I downgrade to a college that wouldn't even have a good program for my major. Even colleges close to my house that don't fall under this category also have the problem of requiring me to live in the same house as my mom again- who thinks that no matter what any problem in college is my fault just because I don't try hard enough. Every time someone asks me what I plan to do after college I just lie and say I'll go into marketing or something when really I'm thinking about how I just want everything to end. I'm so tired. I'm tired of never being someone's first choice, of being a plan b friend, of feeling like shit because I can never put my full trust in someone ever again because I don't want to be hurt anymore since I get enough hurt from my inescapable family. I'm usually considered someone's rock or emotional support- but when I need the same help from those people they're quick to turn their backs to me- or they'll act like my mom and say my feelings are invalid. It feels like I'm constantly cornered all the time with no escape and no one to turn to. Sometimes I google guns for sale because I fantasize about just pulling the trigger on one and erasing everything in an instant. It used to be just slitting my wrists but with past experiences with cutting myself the stinging is just too much. I'm not looking for help, nothing makes the feeling go away permanently so why bother
