Ive always considered it the most selfish thing anyone not terminal could do..... Now im looking up ways to make it. Look accidental. And literally think about it multiple times a day.My lifes a mess. Partly medical partly my own self destructive nature. Im doing too many drugs and drink too much to escape just.... Everything. Literally no one knows just how far down ive spiraled. They just keep begging me to snap out of it. Blame things like my girlfriend leaving me. when thats just a symptom.

Ive decided that if im not happy by my next birthday..... Im gonna start making plans. This is a shot in the datk here. I really dont want too do this since i have such loving family and friends. But everyday just hurts to exist. Im a burden on everyone and they keep trying to drag me to a finish line but im not sure i even have the energy to help them. Only problem with making it look like an accident is im gonna havr to let them in on one of the darker sides of my life like my drug use. Or i can text someone and drive off a cliff at the same time. But then the person i text would probably blame themselves.


I literally cant afford any help.  I started taking my old anti depressants 2 weeks ago but still no change. Every time i look at my wrists i imagine slitting them open. Which funny enough is a way i would NEVER go. Too much cleanup for my family.

Sorry if this sint the place for this but im not literally standing on the egde. Just feel like im being pushed forward inch by inch and soon i mighr as well. Do a. Flip.
