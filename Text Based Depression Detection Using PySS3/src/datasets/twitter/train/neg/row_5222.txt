Doing my part to decrease the UK crime rateThere have been reports recently that the murder rate has gone up a lot and statistics have shown that British people born after 1996 are the most violent, most disrespectful people on the planet otherwise the crime rate wouldn't have gone up.  I want to kill myself in order to protect older British people and young people from other countries.  I am ashamed of my culture and mutated genetics.  I often wish I was a either a young non-Brit or a Brit born before 1996 so I could actually be HUMAN instead of a disgusting degenerate with no empathy.

I am only doing my part to lower the crime rate caused by people like me.  Other countries' youth do not have the empathy lacking mutation that we have or the sadistic culture that Brits born after 1996 are known for.  Every single British person born after 1996 just wants to stab old people and young people from other countries for being nice.
