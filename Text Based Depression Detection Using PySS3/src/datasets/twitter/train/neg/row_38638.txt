Wanted to jump out my window this morningI have really come to the end of my patience. I have tried so hard to be a strong person but really I'm as weak as they come. I've posted a few times here and felt like I was getting better. I had a pretty shit childhood of sexual abuse and bullying which still haunts me to this day. (I'm 22) These past few months have gradually been wearing me down. 

I have pretty severe anxiety, especially social anxiety. I work as a Beauty Therapist in a salon and it's super fucking tough being a quiet/socially awkward person. If I'm not with a customer I'm generally doing my best to stay away from the busy part of the salon just to be alone. 
My boss is really forceful in trying to make me more sociable but he infact makes me feel worse as he belittles me in front of customers.

I'm used to working in quiet places, whereas the salon I'm at now is just noisy and people just yap yap yap. I normally work part-time and have even done stock room shifts rather than sticking to my profession. 
I constantly feel on edge as when I do actually speak to my customers, my boss listens in and starts making sarcastic jokes if I'm asked about my hobbies.

I do art, writing and gaming in my free time just to stop me from having thoughts of suicide. The thoughts have been getting so much stronger over this past year, and I'm 100% definite if something bad happens I'll be tipped over the edge and just do it.

My mum keeps pushing me into going to the doctors, but really I feel my mind is made up. I don't really care for living anymore and every day just fucking drags and I'm so sick of it. I don't have a social life, no friends whatsoever, never had them either. I have a boyfriend and I don't really think he takes notice of my mental health anymore as it's just become normal to him. 

I'm not sure what to do with myself, I just don't feel I have the strength to continue anymore.
