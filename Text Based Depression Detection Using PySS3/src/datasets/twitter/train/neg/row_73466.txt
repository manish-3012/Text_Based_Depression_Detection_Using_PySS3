I fucking hate this holiday.Honestly I may as well just end it already. I can't take another shitty year. I try to be a good person, do the right thing... and for what? Nice guys and girls really do finish last.

I have no family here. My friends purport to care about me but I have not been invited anywhere for Christmas. My plan is to just dope myself up with sleeping pills and stay in bed the whole day with earplugs jammed in my ears.

I know I am pathetic, "playing the victim"... I've heard all this shit before. Yes I tried to volunteer at places, but I've been put on waiting lists (please don't start with "Oh, you should volunteer at other times of the year" 'cause I do). I'd make a nice meal and distribute it to homeless, but I have 20 dollars to last me until the New Year. My family doesn't give a shit. I am staying off Facebook until the end of next month, if I can make it, because other people's happiness and nice gifts and pics with their family just reminds me that I'm forever alone.

I am feeling sorry for myself. I have suffered for so long. I think it is time to let go and do something that I want to do instead. Suicide is selfish, people will say, but I'm tired of being selfless.

Good night.

P.S. I don't act like this in real life. Like a bitter, hateful asshole. I keep these feelings bottled up. I am known as the quirky, caring, adorable person. It's all an act. So I'll just leave you with this:

I heard a joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life is harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world. Doctor says, "Treatment is simple. The great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears. Says, "But doctor... I am Pagliacci." Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.
