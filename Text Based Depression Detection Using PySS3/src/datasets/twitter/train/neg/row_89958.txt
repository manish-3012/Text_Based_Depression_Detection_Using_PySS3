this pain feels like canceri canâ€™t take it anymore. i cry every single day and i get angry at the smallest things. all i do is stay in bed, i barely leave my house. i have no one to talk to. no friends and my family just doesnâ€™t care. iâ€™m so alone. i want to fucking die. i was going to try hanging myself or something, i just need to find the proper way to end it. i just canâ€™t live anymore, i canâ€™t fight this pain any longer.
