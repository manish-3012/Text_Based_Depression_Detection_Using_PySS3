Just press delete...I am trying to find the words. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone or cause my family and friends to worry. I just want to cease to exist right now. Because I am in pain and because I washed my husband shirts without checking the pockets and now there are chapstick stains all over then that I might never get out. How is it that the smallest things just make me imagine that Iâ€™m a character  in a novel and that doesnâ€™t serve any purpose and should just be purged from existence? My sisters suicide attempts haunt me... my brother cutting his throat last year with a steak knife haunt me...the promise that I would never do that to my husband and children haunt me. The fact that Iâ€™m weak both in mind and body just mock me... I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone by dying but I donâ€™t want to keep existing. I guess Iâ€™m trying to fight but am finding it harder and harder to.
