probably just a rant, so far no ballsi (F26) wanna do it but i'm in this sort of relationship with a guy who's previous gf did it and he's a good person who has had a lot of bad luck and he doesn't deserve it.

At the same time i don't deserve to live through this shit i don't think.  I deserve to rest i've been depressed and hating myself since before i can remember. i'm on anti deps, i see my therapist regularly, i'm wealthy, i have a lot of friends that love me, i just cant seem to find a purpose in life or a reason to wake up in the morning. Aside from that, literally everything has been going horribly wrong for over a year now and i don't believe a bottom exists. I am convinced that no matter how bad i feel and how traumatized I am something worse is just around the corner and i'm sick of it. I hate myself for having had so much to live for and so many reasons to be happy and feeling like nothing matters. i kind of wish i could blow myself up. I have no desiire to hurt anyone i cant stand watching people in pain i just want to disappear. I thought about actually just running away, i have the money for it. I think im the problem tho not other people or my surroundings, i cant escape myself and i hate myself, i feel bitter and jealous and gross. i wish i could slip into a coma.
