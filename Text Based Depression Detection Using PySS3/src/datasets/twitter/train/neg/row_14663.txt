My life is over before it started, any advice?Sorry if this is not the right place to post but I don't like directly talking to people about this sort of stuff, it doesn't feel right.

I recently got into some hot soup and I'm probably going to jail for it, I have a possible federal case on my ass and I'm only 15.

I wanted to go into law enforcement, I've been planning on it since I was around 5 or 6, I just recently have been trying to get into the explorer's program so I can start my path but with this federal case on me I've been told by other people that my career plans for going into law enforcement aren't going to happen now.

If I can't get into my dream career then I don't want to live anymore, there's nothing worth living for at this point, my grandma, who I live with, is ashamed of me and I've never had a normal life anyway, I know that if I died people would care and feel bad and be upset for a very very very long time but I can't bother living with the fact that I'm not normal and I'll never live the life I want.
