CowardI have several serious illnesses/issues.  Some caused by doctors.  I have been fighting for years for disability etc to survive.  I lost everything including my wife in the past years.  I worked hard and multiple jobs prior to all this and paid into the system.  Now after years of going through their bullshit bureaucracy I was denied for the final time.   This was my last hope for a means to survive...even that survival would be riddled with pain and misery but I wanted to try.  Now I am fucked. I am powerless....nothing I can do.  No amount of platitudes or prayers to some empty sky or hopeful thinking mattered.  Some fucking asshole judge fucked me over and ruined my chance at making it.  And here I am too fucking cowardly to check out...I will suffer more and die slowly and painfully and I cant muster the courage to end things on my terms.

I dont need esoteric reasons to live...I need money and medical care.  I have medicaid but it doesnt change anything.  The systems are fucked and my  life is fucked.
