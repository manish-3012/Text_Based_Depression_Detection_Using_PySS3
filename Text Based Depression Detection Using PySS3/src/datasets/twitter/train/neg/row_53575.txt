will i?i am 19F and I have nobody, i mean i have a family and stuff and they love me i guess but i have just been feeling so lonely and depressed for a very very very long time, i have a mental disability and it affects me everyday. i quit my job in September and since then I have been looking and looking for another one but canâ€™t seem to get an interview and it has really been weighing on me heavily and also my depression has gotten worse, i have no friends and i just sit in the room all day and sleep and eat and cry and have extremely negative thoughts about myself and wanting to self harm again.....i just want to fucking kill myself already i am such a waste of space and breathing and i just feel it would be better for everyone if i just did it so they wouldnâ€™t have to have the burden of me being here and ruining things for them anymore
