Having a scary momentJust to preface so glad I can be anon.


Feeling a bit angry, I attempted suicide and I have chronic pain now. Been dealing with my injuries for over a year now. Made another two suicide attempts which just worsened the pain.


Don't want to get into the details of the suicide attempt but as far as stressors and personal issues go I'm trans and I'm fucking ugly as hell so I'm always alone dealing with a lot of invalidation, unemployment, I have a bad work ethic, I was dismissed from my university. I feel fucking worthless.


  live in an authoritarian household, my parents are Mormon while I'm atheist. Rather than a relationship with my mom and a relationship with my dad they treat it as if when I talk to one I'm talking to both..


They're disappointed in me, have told me to my face. My parents left me for homeless for a week and a half after my roommates wrote a letter to get me evicted for cooking pot. I have a patch of scars on my right arm from sleeping on concrete. They took my cookware to show the landlord, prior to that they vandalized my property, not sure why but I wouldn't put it past my gender.


My parents insist on using my assigned-at-birth pronouns and name rather than my preferred, I now live under their roof.


I realized another suicide attempt like my past 3 would just leave me in more pain and if I think about suicide I'm just wasting time respirating so now I'm planning something much more long term and serious, have my heart set on a method with very high lethality, it's just a matter of access to transportation and as I improve my life, i.e. getting a job, access to transportation, this method becomes accessible for me..


When I improve my life I'll be able to commit suicide and I'm planning on it. I don't know how to move past this reality. It's over for me.
