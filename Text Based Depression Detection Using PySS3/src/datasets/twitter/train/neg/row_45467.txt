I understand now.No one will miss me and the end just seems to be only comfort nowadays so what's the point if all I'm ever gonna be is a disappointment and a nobody. I understand that my life is worthless. All I can do is just sigh hell I can't even cry anymore. I feel totally empty. Oh well I've always wanted to die on my own terms. When? Who knows maybe tomorrow or the next day but soon.
