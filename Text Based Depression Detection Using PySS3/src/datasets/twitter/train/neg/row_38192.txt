Intervened to stop your suicide, knowing that our 13 year relationship probably ends here.Basically, I stopped my best friend's suicide. I'm a mental health advocate (some of you here may vilify me for that, but to each their own) after my own attempts and psychotic episodes, which after interventions, I've healed from. 

After months of threats from him, he finally set a date, time, letters, and possessions out. The thing is, I'm on the LITERAL other side of the globe from him, and always have been, but he has been a constant in my world for the past 13 years. My belief is that the crushing, brutal, soul-ripping pain and suffering depression causes impairs logic and cognition (wouldn't it do the same for physical pain as well? Why not mental anguish?), but it doesn't have to be this way. There is a way out. 

The depresson had set foot for years now, and years of convincing him to seek professional help have fallen flat. It had finally come to him carrying it out. I have limited information about the new place he has moved to within the country, and I live continents away. As such, it took me 8 hours of continuously trying every personal and professional avenue, but I finally had access to someone who could contact EMS, 12 time zones away. 

Well, it worked. And someone intervened (how, or who, I don't know, all I know is EMS were involved), and he's mad. Very. I know the friendship organically ends with this event. I wish it didn't have to be this way, but I cannot stand by and let someone I love carry out a form of euthanasia without having the proper cognitive ability and counseling, nor properly sought prior avenues of help, to kill themselves. I'm grieving the loss of this friendship. Depression sucks ass.

TL;DR: took 8h from across the globe to intervene on my friend's planned suicide, he's fuming, the relationship probably ends here, and I'm grieving despite feeling I did the right thing.
