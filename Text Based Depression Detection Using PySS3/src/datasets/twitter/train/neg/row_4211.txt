Just found out wife cheated, my core relationships are a toss up now.Just found out my wife cheated. After a long discussion last night and an anonymous text this morning I found out it's worse than I thought.

She seems to be very apologetic/remorseful and in my heart I want to reconcile. But it feels like it'd be easier just to be dead.
