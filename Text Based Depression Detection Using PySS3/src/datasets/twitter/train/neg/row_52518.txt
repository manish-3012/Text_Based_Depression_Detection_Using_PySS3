I feel so helpless... Being forced to Quit transition makes me suicidal, but the prescriptions do too.I'm transgender. I was not remotely depressed before they had me on hormone therapy. I was transitioning fine for over a month and a half before that. Then I started the therapy and it's been a relentless downward slope. There are 2 parts to the medication, but the one that is driving this my depression, which later turned into suicidal thoughts is the "antiandrogen". I have now tried all 3 of the available options and all of them are making me feel terrible (and it's a common side effect of all of them). **At first I was just depressed...** After almost 3 months on the prescriptions things dived and **I now spend hours rolled up in bed, not sleeping, not eating, practically fantasizing about all the different ways I could die** \- there's literally not even a trigger anymore. We tried strafing prescription days 1 day on 1 day off... all that did was make things worse and practically bipolar with a good day with no prescription and then a way worse day with it. I have contacted my healthcare multiple times and I'm being told these are my options because they know my history and I can't take **antidepressants** because we tried all sorts of them in the past and it **literally triggers bipolar mania in me, and some of them make me extremely violent**. I've looked up every possible alternative and the only thing I could find was one minor surgery (castration basically), but since they associate that with "the" surgery, as it's a part of it, they are refusing to treat me for a year plus queue wait times.... But I can't stop the prescription for that whole time or they *still* won't do it. Now I'm all out of options... **So now I've either got to quit medical transition and kill myself, or keep taking prescriptions that chemically make me feel the same way....**
