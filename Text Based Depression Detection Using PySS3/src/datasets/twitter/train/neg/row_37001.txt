I can't do it.I just don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
Im STRUGGLING to just last one more day.
I've been poking at my veins on my wrist, if I wanted to I could really do it right?
The only reason I'm able to stick around is because of them
My dad didn't help, he just makes it worse.
These two people from different states can make me feel more loved than I ever have.
I'm just tired.
I just need a distraction
