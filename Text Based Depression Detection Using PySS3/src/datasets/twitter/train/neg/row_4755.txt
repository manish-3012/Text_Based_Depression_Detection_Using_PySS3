Why should I continue to live?My parents hate me, my very few limited friends mentally and physically harm me everyday, my teacher has called me a waste of space and air in the school, my classmates bully me everyday, I am abnormally short and don't have access to those "Human Growth homone" things, besides those are harmful or whatever i guess?, My face is a odd shape some can't even think of what shape it is, my face is unproportianate. I am terrible at everything I do, i can't do anything right. No one ever checks up on me or thinks about me, but I still do my best to check up on everyone who I know 



So why should I keep living?
"People will miss you!" 
No they won't don't lie to me, and even if so, maybe for a day, right after they'd get back to doing normal things

"So much is there after highschool!"
Ah yes, I have more years to be stupider after highschool and live a terrible life.

"You aren't ugly! Everyone's beautiful!"
Everyone has preferences, I don't fit into those preferences of anyone. 


Sorry if the grammar sucks I'm tired as shit
