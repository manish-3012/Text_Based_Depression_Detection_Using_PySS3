same as the rest here i supposeBut it seems most other people have reasons, like, not wanting to live without someone they care about or being abused or having lost everything or not meeting expectations but like...
I just want to die.

don't really even know why I'm posting here it's not like I use reddit much anymore. 
or even why i'm even posting in such a serious subreddit
it's not like i'm allowed to off myself and i really doubt this subreddit will help
i don't fucking understand why people care so much about suicides and are so adamant against them like sure i don't want my friend to die but that's because it'd mean they'd get to it first and i selfishly want their company
why all you random people who don't even know me are so concerned about this just confuses me
