I'm a worthless piece of shitYou know I usually read alot of these Stories in my free time in school since I have no friends
Well before I lost em all
I suffered a crappy depressive episode in 2016 and 15 and I jumped back on the normal train

Now I'm just hanging on by two hands hoping to not fall off..thought It feels like I will

Im pretty shit in school since I can't let my thoughts leave me alone
It always has to..interfere with what I'm doing and I end up not doing any work at all and my parents kind of just..feel disgusted by me
School is one the reasons why I'm feeling like shit 

I want to become a pro football player
I'm 14 so that means I have to work my ass off because I only have two more years until scouts kind of stop looking for player when they reach over 16

If I don't become a football player then Ill kill myself
I got help and all that until my family..well became what I thought would happen if I got help

So uhm yeah
Fuck me
It seems so chill what I'm writing but I can't be bothered to write the whole of my fuckimg depressing story

But people on here 
Stay alive (coming from this guy lmao)
Realistically at least try everything before you kill yourself
And plus if you ever feel like you're worthless
At least you don't make others like me feel alone..that much

When I read posts on here it helps to take my mind off of things ya know?
