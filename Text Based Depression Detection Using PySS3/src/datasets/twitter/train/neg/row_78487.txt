Contemplating SuicideMy SO and I had been waiting until marriage, I knew how much her commitment to God means to her, but it was our anniversary and things got out of hand.  We went too far and I stopped after 30 seconds because I knew what I was doing was wrong.  She spent an hour in the bathroom crying.  She keeps trying to say that its more her fault than mine, that she shouldâ€™ve stopped me.  But I fucking promised her I would never make her break her promise to God, and then I fucking did it anyway.  I almost did it driving to work this morning, but I swerved back into my lane at the last second like the pathetic waste of life I am.  Iâ€™m not really sure why I posted this, I just feel like if I do kill myself, somebody should be able to know why.
