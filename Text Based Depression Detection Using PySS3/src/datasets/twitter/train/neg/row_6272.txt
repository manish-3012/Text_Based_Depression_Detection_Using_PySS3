TiredDo you guys ever just feel tired of living? Like not flat out wanting to throw yourself off a cliff, but just to like, turn off? not to have to worry about nightmares or about facing reality, about dealing with your own problems? Like when your phone glitches and you turn it off and on again but without the back on part?
