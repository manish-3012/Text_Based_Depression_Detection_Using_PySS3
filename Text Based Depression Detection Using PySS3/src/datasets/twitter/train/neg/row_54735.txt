I will do it tonight.I am not here so people can stop me, i am just here to share my last words because i have no one else to share with.

Sadly my wife of 3 years who always supported me throughout my heavy depression, admitted that she cheated on me because she just needed that release. I am too much of a burden to her. I was staying alive just because she always told me to keep going. I've suffered through my depression for another 3 years just to find out i am being cheated on. She was my last hope and it all turned out to be a big betrayal.

At least i found peace now because finally i can end it. There is no cure to depression and there never will be. I was not strong enough.

Goodbye.
