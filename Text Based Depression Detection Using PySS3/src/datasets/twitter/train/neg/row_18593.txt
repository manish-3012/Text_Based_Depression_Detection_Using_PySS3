I just can't go onI have been trying for months to get help.  Everywhere I turn it seems there are obstacles to make it more difficult than it need be.  I don't want to even try any more.  It is not worth the effort.  Sure it may get better at some point but it is also going to get worse.  The only thing I have holding me on is my fear of failure.  I am afraid of what will happen if I fail.  I don't want to live life as I am now, I certainly don't want to live as a vegetable.  I also do not want to be a burdon to anyone else.  I know it will hurt people, but their pain will lessen over time and I will eventually be forgotten.

I just can't deal with the pain any longer.  It is no longer worth the effort to go on.  I hope this weekend will be my last.
