I finished high school and I think I'm finished with lifeI finished a year and some months ago. My parents are really getting on me to start school or go to work. I don't think I want to. I'm a lazy piece of shit. Hard work tires me so fast and makes me more depressed. 

I wish there was an easier way. The prospect of school and work and life after is so daunting. High school was such a breeze. But even signing up for college is so difficult. 

Basically I wish I could die. I've had plenty of fun lots of good times and I'm ready to check out before things get difficult. But I can't disappoint my mom and dad. I can't leave my brother and girlfriend and best friend. We're a tight knit group. I don't know what they'd do without me.

If it wasn't for my Mom and Brother I might have a bullet in my brain.

I wish life was easy.
