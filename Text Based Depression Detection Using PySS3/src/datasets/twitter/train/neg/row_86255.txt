I once suffered as you all do. It's been a long journey of medication, illegal drugs, solo travel, alienating all friends and family, mental breakdowns, suicide attempts...now I'm back to lend an ear. Tell me anything you want.None of you are supposed to feel this way. I say 'you' and not 'us', because I used to feel this way, but not anymore. A 5-year long quest of going on and off meds, doing elicit drugs, getting myself lost in South East Asia, meditation, exercise, counseling.....

All of those things, at best, helped with the symptoms, but not the cause. 

There's one missing ingredient in all of this, and it is spirituality. Love, light and compassion. And that is what I will provide for you, as somebody who suffered as you do.

I will leave this here. It's early morning here in Australia. But please, tell me your stories. Anything. Tell me why you want to kill your parents, or show off pictures of your kittens that nobody else would look at, I'm here to talk, and I'll be here indefinitely, so if I don't reply, PM.

I'm not like the others. I don't pretend to care and then flake. I DON"T care. Not yet. I don't know you. So, let's start.
