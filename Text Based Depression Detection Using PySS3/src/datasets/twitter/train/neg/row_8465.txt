I'm losing everyone...For about 2 years now, my life has only been going downhill, and I can't deal with it anymore. Before that, everything was fine, I had lots of friends, enjoyed life, went out with them and had fun. Then I developed social anxiety. First, it only affected real life, I could not make new friends, and was starting to lose the ones I already had because I never talked to them, or went out. I lost my girlfriend of 2 years.

Then it got worse and showed online as well. My online friends slowly started to disappear too. I could not get myself to message new people, I just did not know what to say to them or how to start a conversation. I didn't message back when they texted because I did not know what to say and now they probably never even wanna hear from me again for "ignoring" them for so long.

I'm in a Discord with a few kids from my class, but I rarely talk to them, it feels like I'm not even part of the friendship group anymore. They all seem to be getting along so well, chatting and playing games all day. They asked me a few times if I wanted to play with them, and I did join, but it felt like they don't like me. 

Now the only friends I have left, is a dude from school who messages every day on Discord and helps me with pretty much everything I need help with, and a random guy from a server who I don't know in real life, but we talk every day as well. 

No friends or relatives know about how depressed I am, and I'd like to keep it that way, I don't want to put pressure, or potentially lose them. I cannot get therapy because it would cost a lot, my parents probably couldn't afford it, especially during this pandemic. 

Everyday, I keep thinking about how and when I will end my life. Soon I'll be 5 months clean of self harm, but what does that mean anymore? I just want to die, life does not seem to be getting better at all and I don't enjoy it.

How can I get my previous life back? The one that wasn't full of self hatred...
