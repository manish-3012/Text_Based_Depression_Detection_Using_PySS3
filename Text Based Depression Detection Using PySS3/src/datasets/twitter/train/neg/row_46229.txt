My deadbeat best friend is ending it.My long time (15+ years) best friend has told me in confidence he's planning on taking his own life.

I believe in him 100%. He's getting rid of his possessions, erasing online profiles and bought a hose which I believe is for attaching to the car exhaust.

I understand his reasons. He is around 30, has no job or higher education, no close family except mom (who he hates), no girlfriend, no life goals, no friends other than me, his only hobby is playing video games. He refuses to seek medical help, to call Suicide Prevention Line and has stopped taking depression medication (he says it gives him tinnitus).

Oddly enough, his mom won't notice all the signs or maybe she doesn't care, he has been living off of her for as long as I can remember.

He has always been depressed for all the reasons I mentioned. I tried to help him so many times. Told him to study, to exercise, to find a group of people with common interests - and when he got depressed after high school - to seek medical help.

This one time, after a mental episode, he got locked away in a mental hospital. That left deep mental scars on him, he is traumatized to this day. Maybe this is the reason he won't seek medical help anymore.

I know his life sucks, it sucked for the longest part. After high school it was a downward spiral. Nowadays he's just dead inside.

Should I even do anything?
