Kill meAlmost Everyday I pray for something tragic is going to happen to me so I don't need to live in this fucked up place. My trust for God has completely "ran away from me". "God" apperantly helps you, makes you feel better about yourself, but all of that is bullshit. Im so broken, negative, ugly, fat, stupid got no talent. And yeah, I suffer from social anxiety disorder. 

The girl that I'm in love with said that I'm a loser, fat, dumb, and she's right. She is so right. Those words hurt, especially by the one you love... But I deserve those words so much. I have done so much stupid with my life. I disappoint my family with my grades and shit so much, even when I try my hardest. I'm only 15, but I think that 15 years are more than enough for this fucked up place we live in... 

This social anxiety shit has gotten so bad to the point where I shake when friends of my parents that visites our home, and I don't know why. I hate meeting new people. I hate going outside if a lot of people are there. I love going outside at night because there are almost no one and I actually feel good. But that's only at night.
