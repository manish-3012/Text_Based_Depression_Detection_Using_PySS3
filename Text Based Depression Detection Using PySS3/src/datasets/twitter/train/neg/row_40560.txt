Life is hardI'm not contemplating suicide, my infant needs me and she has an allergy to both soy and dairy products (ergo no formula). It's just hard. It's hard being so happy in the moment and it all gets torn down by my innermost thoughts. I don't deserve this happiness, I don't deserve the joy of watching this innocent little human learn and grow. But she needs me. And she loves me. I mean, she genuinely loves me and looks at me as her mommy and not for my flaws. My husband can't even do that. I honestly can't recall whether or not he ever did.

My heart hurts. My soul hearts. Everything aches from the pain of my regrets. Regrets for who I am, who I'm not, where I am in life, my failures, my overwhelming and consuming insecurities and the inability to be an adequate provider for my family.

I'm a piece of shit. I hate myself and everything I am.

Fuck mental health, fuck the mental health care system, fuck my shitty family that isn't there for me when they should be, fuck the people who bullied me and abused me, fuck the world.

Fuck.
