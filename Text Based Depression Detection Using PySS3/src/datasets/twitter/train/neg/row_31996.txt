To no one in particularHello reddit, internet, electronic space, world, etc, Im writing because I don't know what else to do. Im in tough space right now and Im afraid I wont be able to hold on to life much longer. The truth is Im at a path, a roadway that divides in two separate directions. In recent years, more or less in recent days, I come to realize that I like girls. I mean Im attracted to them and I cant explain why. I have always been and always will be a believer in God. I know the implactions that the belief carries and I know I wont be accepted, but I have been trying to fight this for years. I'm at two cross road with two options live and possibly go to hell or kill myself to prevent myself from becoming a disappointment. I have no one else to ask for help because my family is extremely religious. On one hand I dont want to be hated by God and on the other I cant shake this feeling. Please help me!
