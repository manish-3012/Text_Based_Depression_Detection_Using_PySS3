ContemplatingLast time I tried overdose and survived since I'm stupid to think that it was enough. This time I'll just hang myself. The only thing I'm contemplating is whether or not to leave something behind. I don't particularly care what others might think nor what they will think. At most I'm thinking of saying that it wasn't their fault. The other thing is when I'll be doing it. Maybe tomorrow, today, next week from now. My birthday is coming up, I hate that day, it seem appropriate to end it at that time but I don't think I can last for 2 more weeks of this. This time I won't fail.
