Trying to help my brother in need. Please helpMy brother has recently been arrested for multiple felonies, but he has been bailed out for now until his court date. I'm not saying anything about what it was about because that isn't the point here. If he does go to jail after his trial it would probably be for a very long time.

He has had a long history of very serious depression, but last night was the first night he finally opened up to be, and straight up told me all he has wanted since he was a kid was to die. 

Last night I had to force him to stay home with me and sleep at my house because he was going to kill himself had he left my house. He's currently asleep at my place and he'll be crashing here for as long as he needs.

My biggest worry is that he is already struggling with suicide deeply, and even if I am able to get him professional help, I'm not sure how his trial would affect it.

He has told me that I am the only reason he hasn't done it yet, and currently I am kind of using this to honestly guilt trip him into not killing himself for now because I don't kow what else to do other than spend as much time with him as I can, and let him know that I'm always there for him and that I love him unconditionally.

I'm a college student and my classes are about to start again, so I will be going back to class very soon but I'm too afraid to leave him alone roght now so I think I might have to take this semester off to help him.

I am terrified that if I leave back for college that I will never see my brother again, and if his trial goes poorly I am terrified of him killing himself in prison, because he openly talked to me about doing it in prison if he were convicted.

Is there any advice someone could give? Preferably someone who's dealt with the prison system in some way before if possible. I'm just trying my best to help my brother in any way because I love him and I don't know what I would do without him.
