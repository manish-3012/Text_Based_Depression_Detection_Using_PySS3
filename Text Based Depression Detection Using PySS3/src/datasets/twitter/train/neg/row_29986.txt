3...2... 1.I got a hold of some razors and tried to slit my wrist today but I couldnâ€™t cut deep enough so now thereâ€™s just pointless blood everywhere. 
I donâ€™t think that that will be an effective way for me to go.

I can jump in front of a train or car but I find that that may inconvenience too many people.

Guns arenâ€™t sold in my city, so Iâ€™m not really sure where to get one. 

Any of concoction  of the available medications I have will likely not cause me to overdose. 

I work for a suicide prevention hot line, so I talk people out of suicide on a regular basis. All and all, it just seems pretty clear that life is just constant pain for some people.  I wish suicide was seen as a more viable solution. 

Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m writing this, I guess because maybe itâ€™ll help me figure out what to put in a note or something.

Cheers.
