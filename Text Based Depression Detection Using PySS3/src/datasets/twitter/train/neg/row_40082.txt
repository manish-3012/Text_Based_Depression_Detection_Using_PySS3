When my wife was 14, her mother committed suicideA "chemical imbalance" contributed to the whirlwind of emotional trauma that my wife and her younger sister went through years ago. Today, she is such a beautiful soul that you would never be able to guess what she's been through. In fact, she has endured more heartache than I have or ever want to go through. 

She is a woman who typically holds her emotions in and isnt open about her past but I know that the damage will last forever. I am seeking suggestions on how to relate/console her and generally just want to talk about how I can be a better husband without ever truly understanding what she deals with on a daily basis.
