I am struggling to stop self harmingIt's not exacly s\*\*\*\*\*\* but I figured some people with more experience would know how to help...

I'm 16 years old, male student and since I've started trying to stop self harming I noticed I got angrier at people. It's like I need to release my anger on other people, but I don't want to be this way, they are nice people that sometimes annoy me a little, but it's been years since I've felt THIS angry before, I don't want to go back to who I was.... 

And sincerely, as bad as it is, i prefer to keep self harming if it means i'll be nicer to the people I love...
