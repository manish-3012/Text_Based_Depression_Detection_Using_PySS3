My parents have criticized me about school so much when I was growing up, and now Iâ€™m a perfectionist who expects too much of myself even if my mental health is in danger. And I canâ€™t take it anymoreSince I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder at age 13 and started the cycle of trying meds and moving on to other ones in hopes that one would work. It started the cyclical mindset of â€œWhy should I care about my high school work or IGrade Average? Iâ€™ll end up failing and probably dead anyway.â€

And my parents would hammer me for that. â€œyouâ€™re too smart for that!â€ â€œYou can do harder if you just applied yourself!â€ They got upset whenever I said I donâ€™t think I did well on a test, saying that if I studied Iâ€™d be confident that I had passed. Whenever they asked about the test grade and turned out to get a Câ€”more close to doing mediocre than failingâ€”they would get upset at me and tell me that i could do so much better if I didnâ€™t go out with my boyfriend or go on my games or computer or social media.

Even though I was mostly criticized for performance in academics, I feel as if it has translated to other parts of my life.

All throughout my teenage years I was criticized for not working as hard as they expected me to. And now In my adulthood, I find that I have that exact same attitude.

*i make a mistake at work by making one order wrong or not attending to the till correctly. If only I had payed attention I wouldnâ€™t have fucked up everything*. â€” I work at a pizza chain and take the money people pay to get their food.

*i didnâ€™t study for the first exam of the semester. Iâ€™m going to fail this test and all the tests, and after. Iâ€™ll fail the class entirely* â€”I didnâ€™t study for the test, yeah. But I take the test anyways. Half the time I pass.

*if I sit down and study **maybe** Iâ€™ll get the material, but everyone around me will instantly. God Iâ€™m so ducking stupid. I shouldnâ€™t even bother studying, no point in wasting my time and effortâ€  â€”at this point, I stop trying. Convinced that I canâ€™t understand it.

*everyone has so many friends. They arenâ€™t anxious around people and talk to the point of oversharomg
Personal details that no one wants to know**

The fact that I feel so inferior to everyone I me, whether it be school or work or socially. I feel as if I canâ€™t do anything right, that if I canâ€™t meet my expectations of being able to suddenly understand things like computer science even though I can barely understand algebra ; or being able to run 1 mile in under 20 minutes even though briskly walking for more that 5 makes me unable to breath; or if I can suddenly have a hold on my anxiety about nearly everything and not let it bother me...

It makes me feel worthless. It makes me feel as if Iâ€™m a waste of a life. A waste of effort, time, money, emotional investment.

I want to die. I wish I could have died. I want to try...but of course Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to try...

**tldr: parents have expected to much of me (particularly school) so now I do myself in lots of areas of my life. And I feel so inferior to everyone because my expectations**
