Intrusive thoughtsI lie here, thinking about my partner, my degree, my family.... but i am bombarded with thoughts of slitting my wrists. I have stabbed myself before, i know what the blood feels like and i just get stuck on this thought and loose all meaning, determination and will. I think about the many times i've tried to help people and the hypocrite that i am and just remember if anyone knew i felt like this, that would be the end of me. I won't be too explicit on a site where everyone feels low, just know its a guilty thought. The only thing i have left is the ability to pretend and keep these thoughts close to me. This is the opposite of what i tell everyone else to do! i just go into therapy mode and relay all the information people have given me and for what? does it help me? sometimes but only fragments of a sentence can make me think of things in a new way. It's rarely the solution i was given that actually helped. It seems i have to find things out for myself, maybe that's just me, telling people will not help me, i don't want the face to face discussion it hurts more and doesn't seem to help me. So what do i do, leave these thoughts to fester or perhaps more dangerously flourish?
