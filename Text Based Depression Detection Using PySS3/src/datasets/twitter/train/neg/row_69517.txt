I can't keep going on like thisSuffering, indifference, more suffering, more indifference, watching my family wither away and not being able to do anything about it, being almost 23 yet with the mind of a 17 year old at most, having a very small support network, college stress... I just can't keep doing this, I've tried everything...

Fluoxine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertraline, going to therapy, trying to improve and do new things, and for what? Life keeps throwing more and more troubles, it's just too much!
