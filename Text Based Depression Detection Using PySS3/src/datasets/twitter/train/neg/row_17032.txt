Passively Suicidal. Havenâ€™t learned from the past.Been on reddit for a while, but never really posted. Iâ€™ve tried to commit suicide before almost two years ago, Iâ€™m 19 now, but my family has kind of confirmed it for me. 

Iâ€™ve had really bad anxiety and depression since I was around 13 because my mom was a heavy alcoholic and drug addict, and my dad left when I was around 11. Iâ€™ve sought out help, Iâ€™ve been to therapy and Iâ€™ve tried pretty much every medication available and nothing has helped. Before I had always thrown around the idea of ending it but was to scared too. But when I finally tried I thought that after I would somehow get better. Iâ€™ve been the same since the first time. Iâ€™ve tried talking to new people and everyone usually uses what has happened against me, even some of the people that are super close to me. 

I guess this is my cry for help. Iâ€™m definitely going to do it again. No one in my family really cares about me so there wonâ€™t be much to stay for. And sorry for the post being just thrown together, canâ€™t really keep my head straight. Honest anything helps.
