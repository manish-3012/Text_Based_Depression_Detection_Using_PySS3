I am a manipulatorI always knew it. I always have known I've made undetectable suggestions to people to get what I want. I am such a piece of shit. My best friend, who I've loved for so long, is an unknowing victim of this. I would always ask him questions about himself and his life and his problems and offer emotional support at the beginning of our friendship and talk about myself very rarely. I of course care about him (I always have, I would never hurt him) but I know I was partially doing this so he would like me more and stick around. Now I'm pretty sure he's only my friend and loves me back because I tried so hard to get him to stay in my life. He doesn't truly care, he just thinks he does. I said earlier I would never hurt him but I realize I have and he doesn't know. I don't want to do this to people anymore. He is just one example. Every day I manipulate people minorly and I know it's wrong but I can't stop. One of my "strongest" relationships is based on lies! Even if I do get help, I'm always going to be paranoid I manipulated them into liking me! I don't need to be around and hurt more people. It's like I used a love potion on someone and while they do show me affection, I know it's not real. I hate myself so much.

EDIT: I have looked up the symptoms of manipulators and I've never used his "weaknesses" against him. I have never tried to hurt him to gain power. I have never done that to anyone actually. But I still feel fake as fuck because I used tactics to make him like me! I was there for emotional support because I care, but also because I knew it would make him like me. No one likes me, I just make people think they do! Oh my god.
