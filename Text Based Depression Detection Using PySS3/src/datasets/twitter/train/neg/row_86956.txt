Why is it selfish to want to die?I'l preface this with, I'm not actively planning to kill myself, I do have a plan and the means but I'm too scared to go for it but I want a few questions answered for. I often see people say that it's selfish to kill your self because of the pain you inflict on your friends, family, and loved ones. 

My question is, how am I the selfish one in this situation? It's selfish to ask someone to live in misery when it's never going to get better for them, just so you can have that person around. If your family member was dying of cancer and wanted assisted suicide, would it not be selfish to ask them to continue suffering just so you can spend a few more weeks/months with them?
