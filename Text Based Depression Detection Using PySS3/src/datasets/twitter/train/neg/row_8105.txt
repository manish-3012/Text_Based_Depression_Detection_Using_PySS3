It gets betterHi guys, so I used to post a lot on here during April... I tried to take my life. It was a very serious gesture and I almost succeeded. I was in a bad place. I had been struggling with depression for about 6 years. I'd been off and on all sorts of medications. I could not sleep. I would go days without sleeping and physically I just felt like I was having a constant panic attack. 

I spent a week in an inpatient unit in April. My doctor sectioned me in May. I spent an entire month in an acute psych ward. I'm only 18 and was in an adult ward where some patients would rotate through and others just couldn't care for themselves whatsoever. Sometimes it felt like a geriatric unit. I was looking for ways to take my life within the unit. I was pretty rough. I would constantly be thinking about suicide. I thought my life was hopeless and because I had experienced so much trauma that I was forever royally fucked over. I just didn't see the point. I was filled with constant dread and every moment I spent awake I wanted to die. It hurt to breathe.

Well, I don't know if this will comfort anyone. But please hang in there. Take it from a fellow formally super fucking suicidal friend out in the world. Please. I'm so glad I didn't take my life that day and that I failed and someone took me to the hospital. Please. I thought my life was meaningless but I slowly but surely just... I don't know. Something happened. I just landed an internship with my local mayor's office and have decided to reapply to college after almost flunking out because I was so depressed! Please stay strong. I'm rooting for you. Choose life. You have so much time ahead of you to heal. You will heal. Your brain isn't fundamentally broken. You aren't broken. I love you. You deserve it
