Existing for others onlyAs title says. 

I have very dark suicidal thoughts. It all connects to feeling unloved or unlovable. Not just romantically, but via friendships and family. Ironically I actually have a few great friends who would probably do anything for me, but itâ€™s just not the same type of companionship as a real family, or a romantic one. 

I seem to fuck up everything great that comes along in my life. Itâ€™s like I auto destruct and canâ€™t stop it while watching it happen. Then I try to heroically save it and fail, which pushes me back to the brink again. 

The only thing keeping me from ending it is not wanting to hurt those around me. My former fiancÃ©e had her last husband die suddenly, and as much as Iâ€™m hurt by her ending things so abruptly, I still couldnâ€™t bring myself to ever make her feel that loss twice in a single lifetime. Same for her kids, which I essentially look at as my own. 

I could never do that to them, and itâ€™s literally my only lifeline. If not for saving them the pain, I wouldâ€™ve blown my brains out or overdosed quietly on pain meds already. 

I donâ€™t want to live, because I just donâ€™t see the point in it. You breathe. You eat. You sleep. The wild keeps turning with or without you. It all has no consequence. My life, has no consequence. No meaning. No fulfillment. Just pain. Endless pain.
