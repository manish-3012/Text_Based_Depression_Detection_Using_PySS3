I want someone to care about meI've been wanting to die for a while now. Fucked up the first time and I won't get another chance for a while. 

I'm a high school dropout. I'm pathetic and lazy, I don't do anything but play video games, watch anime and listen to music. I talk to a few people online who are around my area. Recently they were talking about how they want to go see a new movie that's coming out and is supposedly really good. They talk about going with everyone but me. I would've loved to go, especially since it's close to my birthday. 

I don't have anyone that cares about me. This is hell. I hate myself for being a stupid fuck up. I could've killed myself. I could've ended this bullshit misery.
