Casually suicidalA bit of a new low rambling like this on Reddit but oh well. 

Iâ€™m casually suicidal. By that I mean, Iâ€™m functioning perfectly fine. Iâ€™m going through the motions of a normal day - whatever the fuck that means right now. I just go through everyday and in the back of my mind thereâ€™s this nagging thought about killing myself. Like. If I walk across a road Iâ€™ll linger just a little too long and Iâ€™ll get disappointed every time I cross the road.

Iâ€™m not diagnosed with anything, slightly odd eating habits, never been incredibly happy, but nothing crazy. I just think I have a bit of a shitty life. 

When I think of killing myself it feels like a rational thought. A choice based on years and years of shitty situations. Iâ€™m not going insane, Iâ€™m sure of it. Which. I guess is what an insane person would say. 

Iâ€™ve been planning it out. I know the exact dosage Iâ€™d need. I donâ€™t know if I convince myself out of it. Ah. Hope this was coherent. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m trying to even express.
