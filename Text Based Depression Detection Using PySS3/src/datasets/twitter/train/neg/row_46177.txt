Breaking PointI wrote another article a while back describing my current situation, and things haven't changed.

I'm living in a hotel, I have 24/7 to think about all the wrong i've done in my life, to my ex girlfriend, and everything in general. I've been contemplating just disappearing, and I honestly believe my immediate family would be hurt the most. Nobody else, attest this to the fact that since i've moved away from home i've had to start every conversation with my 'friends' and I get generic responses at best. 

I have no will to work to support my family I cannot support, no will to live to show my face to my daughter and my ex who I'm still madly in love with, and I don't know what else to do.

Advice or not, I honestly have given up. I'm posting here at 1am because for the last month I haven't been able to get more than 1 hour of sleep at a time from the constant fact I lost my loved one. And my first born child which was completely unplanned but am trying to do my best to take care of her.

I dont know if this is what they call seeking attention, but I'm just a guy who has nobody to talk to about an issue I keep to myself because I feel like nobody actually gives a fuck. Kinda like the internet. 

I wish I could go back in time and get myself a better job quicker so I could support my family faster so she wouldn't leave me thinking I was a mooching bum, and now I actually have the means to be a proper husband and father and I'm curbed out. I think i'm just venting, dont really care for the responses. If I get brave enough I don't think it'll matter anyways. Sorry for bothering you, dont' want to ruin anybody's day.
