Need help what antidepressants to takeStress is becoming too much to handle I've already puked several times tonight. I can't seek professional help due to the nature of my profession, I am the best at what I do, however, if I go to a counselor I will lose my career.  Right now I'm taking a mixture of Lithium Orotate, St Johns Wort, L - Theanine, and HTP-5. They're not helping tonight. I'm running out of ideas. Any suggestions are welcome, for now, I will continue to drink myself a comatose and review this post once I wake up.
