Today is my birthday, and thinking of ending it tonight.Years and months of torment and being alone, im fed up with everything. I tried to fix my life, got back into music and working out. It can only help me so much. Im tired of trying to be happy, or trying to think i do have people there for me. Today didnt even feel like anything important but another lonely day. I think if there is no point for me to have a birthday what is the point of being here. Ive complitated this for over a few months now. Ive attempted suicide twice already. Im just ready to leave, enough is enough.
