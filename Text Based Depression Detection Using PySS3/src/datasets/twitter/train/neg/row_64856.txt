Not sure what to thinkI never thought that I would be submitting such a post but here we are. Long story short, My wife and I will be getting a divorce and we have 2 little kids. One infant, 6 months old, and one 5 year old. I love both of my kids dearly. More than myself even. I made a bad call on a certain topic and my wants to file for divorce. 

The thing is I donâ€™t want to live without them. I donâ€™t even know how I can! The idea of them growing up between 2 houses, going back and forth every week/weekend, seeing their mom getting a BF and their dad getting a GF, not being able to be there to see their milestones is killing me. I am thinking that maybe with one parent out of the picture might be easiest for them. Instead of blaming both of us for the absence of a proper family around house I wouldnâ€™t mind taking the blame for being the â€œweak linkâ€ in the family who took the easy way out. 

It is easier for the moms to make such a decision as the court system tends to side with the mom when it comes to custody and donâ€™t get me wrong I am all about the best environment for the children no matter what. Just the thought of that makes it harder for me to breathe. I have my â€œgoodbye letterâ€ written and hidden somewhere away. I am not worried about taking off I am worried about the idea of â€˜what if I am leaving a bigger mess for mg kids to deal with?â€™. 

I am so fucking lost in every way.
