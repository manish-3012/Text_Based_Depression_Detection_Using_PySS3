I just bought a bladeIm not planning on killing myself I just want external pain distract me from what I feel inside. Ive been dead for a while now, like someone said here if I could give my time to someone who wants and deserves to be here I would. I have no reason to live, no family, no real friends, no love nobody. I look back and wonder what did I do so wrong in a past life that Im paying for it now. Ive tried to get better, go to the gym, eat healthier, my career etc but nothing works its never good enough. It does come from my childhood when my dad called me useless over and over. Mother abounded me etc. I'm giving up
