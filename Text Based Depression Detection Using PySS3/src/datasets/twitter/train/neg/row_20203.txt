I am tired.I am tired.

I am tired of feeling miserable all the time.

I am tired of failing at everything I do.

I am tired of feeling lonely.

I am tired of procrastinating 

I am tired of crying.

**I am tired of living.**

I have thought about suicide for the last year but I don't know what to do. I enjoy many parts of life but I hate a lot of others. I'm 17 and I want to die because I have responsibilites and I have to live a normal life... Its pathetic. I have spent all summer playing games online, If I think about school, I instantly become depressed. I need 80's but I struggle to even get 60's... I tell myself and my family that "I will change next year" but I just end up procrastinating and not studying. I want to end up with a good job but its just not working out for me. My parents want me to go to university but I don't think I can. I have skipped studying for a drivers license for 2 years. I just don't know what to do... I really want to talk to someone but I am to embarrassed to ask my parents. I think I have ADHD but I am once again to embarrassed to ask my parents about speaking with a psychiatrist. I just dont know what to do. Please help.
