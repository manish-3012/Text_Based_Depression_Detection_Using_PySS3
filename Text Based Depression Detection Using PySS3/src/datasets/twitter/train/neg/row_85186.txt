Giving up on life, don't see a reason to carry on any more.For a few months I've been depressed but have no one to talk to, my friends ignore me if I try to talk about it and my family are always too busy to sit down and listen to me, more and more I can't bring myself to get out of bed, I just wish that I would die to end it all, I'm not sure what to do any more
