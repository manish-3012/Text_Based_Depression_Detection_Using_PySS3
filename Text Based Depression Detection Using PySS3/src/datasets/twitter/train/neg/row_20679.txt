Never done it but bought meth for the absolute fuck of it because I'm gonna kill myself anyway lolTitle. Don't ask why, I'm just 1. Super obese and everyone hates me for it and 2. Have no motivation or self discipline at all to do anything to fix my life. I just do not give a shit anymore. 


So even though the only drugs I had tried before this are weed, alcohol, acid, shrooms and MDMA I bought meth. Not joking. 


Best case scenario it helps me lose some weight and focus a little bit on life 


Worst case it doesn't help me at all but I have some fun before I die anyway by suicide. 



Who knows.
