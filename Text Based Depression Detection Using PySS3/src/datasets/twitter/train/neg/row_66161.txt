A chance to better myself?Iâ€™ve lived in a small village (recently turned town) almost my whole life but recently my family realised it was time to move. The kids here have all grown up to be chavs and we donâ€™t want to stay here with the 11 year old druggies and shit.
Weâ€™re moving a few hours away to a town I wonâ€™t reveal the name of. Iâ€™m heading to an all girls school, which is pretty cool considering Iâ€™ve recently figured out that I am a lesbian. We havenâ€™t moved just yet, maybe by Easter.
I want to reset myself completely. No more suicidal thoughts and no more mental breakdowns in bathroom stalls, no more being called into the counsellors office to get asked if â€˜anything is going on at homeâ€™. I want a new me going there.
Iâ€™m going to delete this app the day before I arrive in the new house, not just yet. This app only makes me rant online to 3 strangers rather than talking to real people that actually care about me.
