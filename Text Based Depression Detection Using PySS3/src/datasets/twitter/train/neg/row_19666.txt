I really wanna dieIve been mildly depressed for about 2 years now, but the past month or so its been terrible everyday. I want nothing more than death, i am young as im only 14 but i dont care about what i have ahead of me as many people would say. The only thing that is stopping me from ending my life would be the fact i dont want my brother or my mom to find my body or have to see it in general. Somebody please offer me some advice
