Iâ€™m too far gone. I canâ€™t get better.I canâ€™t get better &amp; there is no point in trying any more. I might as well just press the self destruct button. I feel like I should either kill myself or just go back to drinking alcohol &amp; taking drugs until I eventually die. At least it will mask the pain I am in.
