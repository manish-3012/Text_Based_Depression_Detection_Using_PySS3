My parents got me a stuffed animal for Christmas.Iâ€™m 14, and Iâ€™ve been collecting stuffed animals for as long as I can remember. I have hundreds. For Christmas my parents got me a large cat stuffed animal. But something about this one is different. It feels comforting to be around. I canâ€™t stop hugging and cuddling it. It makes me feel a little bit better.
