It's Tomorrow, and I feel worse than YesterdayIt's tomorrow and I feel worse than when I wrote this. I'm prepared to call a hotline and talk to someone because I have about 100 of my lithium pills I stashed away in case I needed to end myself with a mixture of Risperadol, Zoloft, and Paxil (50 in total) I'm really scared that I will end it all tonight, when no ones awake, like I almost did last night. I didn't sleep, and in school I was more miserable than I had ever been in a while. I've been having delusions of ropes hanging from everywhere because I've heard that that is an effective way to commit suicide. I haven't anything to hang it from, nor do I have a garage to suffocate in my car. I didn't sleep at all, and I am honestly not very tired. Tired of living and carrying on, but not physically sleepy tired. Perhaps this "tiredness" is the tiredness you feel when the time is right. I don't want it to be, but my body is obviously telling me to off myself already, since I've barely eaten in three days and the thought of food makes me want to throw up. I don't get what the fuck I did to deserve this, but I guess it's for the best. Goodbye maybe, goodbye maybe not... More likely yes than no though.
