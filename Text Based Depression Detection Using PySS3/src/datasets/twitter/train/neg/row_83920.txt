I dont want to die but I wish I was deadI think about suicide way too often. I really want to know how to stop this. I dont like cutting myself and hurting myself but I cant seem to stop. 

My friends cant even be my friends anymore. I dont blame them, no one should have to be around me.  But that felt like the only thing I had. Now, I just dont want to be.  No one will even notice I am gone :(.

I wish i knew how to fix what is wrong with me. I think I will be done soon. I dont understand why I feel so much pain always.
