How do I tell people who I love goodbyeJust been an overwhelming sadness growing in me for years. 21 and a college student so all of that doesn't really help. Im just going to get the burden of me out of everyones life and kill myself in 4 weeks. Just want to know how to say bye to the ones I actually love without it being hard for them so at least there is some closure. Any tips are appreciated.
