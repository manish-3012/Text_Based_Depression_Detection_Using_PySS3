Im not up for facing any aspects of life anymoreNothing i do gives me any enjoyment theres no point in investing time in other people if weâ€™re all just stuck in our own minds and nothing lasts forever. Nobody even likes me and i cant even try to be a nice person like i want myself to be because my personality is shit and i cant fix it no matter how many times people have told me i can change i cant because my personality doesnt allow it. I want to end it all for real this time and the fact that if i dont do it tonight then ill have to wake up tomorrow and go to work and have to deal with daily life for another day, makes me want to do it more
