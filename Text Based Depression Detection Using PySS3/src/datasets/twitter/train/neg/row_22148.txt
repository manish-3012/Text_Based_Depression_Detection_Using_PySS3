i think i deserve deathi think maybe tonight iâ€™ll try and see if i get into heaven, but most likely iâ€™m going to go to hell 

iâ€™m in a relationship (or... was... i think... iâ€™m not so sure about the state of our relationship now...) and had sent nudes to someone that wasnâ€™t my partner. i felt guilty and ashamed and eventually told my partner. they said they are never going to forgive me. 

now before you think this is just some dumb person crying like a baby over a relationship, i donâ€™t have that many other people in this world. 

my best friend thought the past school year? bullied me near the end of the year and hates me(and also made several others hate me too, bonus points). the person i sent nudes to? hates me. my significant other? hates me too. 

i understand that my s/o is hurting and that i really shouldnâ€™t have done what i did, they arenâ€™t talking to me and i donâ€™t think they should ever again.  really honestly suprised they havenâ€™t blocked me yet.  i donâ€™t think anyone should forgive me for everything ive done. you know, before all this happened, i always thought i was terrible, but everyone pointed out how i had no reason to think that way. well now i do.
