What do I do when I'm agreeing with her?I love my girlfriend, but she's been on a downward spiral for months. It's been so draining on myself and her. She's on meds, she's seeing a counsellor, but nothing's helping. Every little mistake or thing that breaks or goes wrong she blames on herself, and I've run out of options. The worst part is, I can't see an immediate way out, and I'm starting to see her side of things.

I want this to end, but I can't live without her, and I don't want to die.

We need serious help. Please, I've got nowhere else to go.
