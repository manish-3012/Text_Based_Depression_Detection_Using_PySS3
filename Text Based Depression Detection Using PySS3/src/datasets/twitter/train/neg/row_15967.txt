I got the necessary thingsAs I have mentioned, Iâ€™m killing myself on my birthday, which is rapidly approaching. Only a couple weeks away. Iâ€™m young, a minor, and do not have access to things like guns or pills or maybe a rope or anything. I finally convinced my mom to get me melatonin because I canâ€™t sleep. She got a 2nd bottle for downstairs, too. When the day comes, Iâ€™ll take the 2nd bottle from downstairs and eat all of it along with the bottle in my room, too. God, Iâ€™m so fucking excited. Itâ€™s days like this where I get sad, and then remember how I will die, finally. My tears of pain and hatred stop instantly when I remember that it doesnâ€™t even matter. Theyâ€™ll all be fucking sorry.
