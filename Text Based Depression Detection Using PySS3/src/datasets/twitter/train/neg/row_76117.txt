My life is destroyed but I'm afraid to die. What happens after you die?I have fibromyalgia. I've had it for three years now. My life before this was perfect. Specially in retrospective. Now there isn't one single minute in my life in which I'm not feeling soul-crushing, spirit-destroying pain. I don't have a job. I'm living with my parents at thirty-one since I'm basically disabled. The only thing I think about--that I can afford to think about now--is how will I manage my pain and host of symptoms from minute to minute, day to day. 

But I'm afraid of dying. I had a bad LSD trip once and I'm very afraid of what might happen after I die.
