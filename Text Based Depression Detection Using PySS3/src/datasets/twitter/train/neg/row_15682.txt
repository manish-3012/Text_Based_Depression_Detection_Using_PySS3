I can't fucking do this right nowEverything feels so heavy. Cutting didn't even make me feel better. I feel like sobbing all over again. I don't know what to do. Nothing feels okay. It's all wrong. It's all so fucking wrong. I don't know what I did that was so bad. I didn't mean to make any of this happen. I'm sorry
