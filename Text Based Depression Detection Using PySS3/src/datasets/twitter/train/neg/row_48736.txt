I got close tonight.Iâ€™ve always thought Im an over-reacting drama queen. Iâ€™m an extremely passionate person, emotional and seen as the strong, independent one of my friends, family, peers. Truth is Iâ€™m not. My emotions are heavy, being strong is a facade to either keep people away or avoid being hurt. 

I lost my dad at a young age, close friends, both my grandfathers, and my step-dad very recently. I had an abortion last year, a guy I thought would never be able to hurt me, left me to do it on my own. I didnâ€™t have a great upbringing, which is why everyone thinks Iâ€™ve overcome and really â€˜blossomedâ€™. So I have to keep up the act, right? 
I canâ€™t anymore... I know when Iâ€™m spiraling out of control, I know when I need to reign in my emotions, but I physically canâ€™t, despite wishing I could with every fibre of my being. I hate myself, my personality and my appearance. I wish I could change to become someone people would like. 

This time around it was a boy (cliche, I know)
He went from being the only person that called me beautiful, to wanting space.. my own doing, I pushed him away. 
I didnâ€™t want to die because a boy rejected me, Iâ€™m not completely delusional.. Iâ€™m just a bit broken and unable to ask for help. I know about the helplines, and the counselling at work.. and reaching out to friends etc. But I donâ€™t want to seem dramatic. Im wired to fix my own problems and worry about everyone elseâ€™s. Itâ€™s embarrassing being weak. 

I got so close tonight, itâ€™s like something possessed my hand towards the blade. I ripped myself away thankfully. Iâ€™m scared, it was so strong for a second there. My little 7 yo brother, and the devastation it would cause my mother after losing her husband so recently, is the only thing that pulled me back. 

I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m posting here - I like freedom and honesty with myself that comes from anonymity. Tomorrow Iâ€™ll wake up, and will go back to the strong front, Iâ€™ll probably be embarrassed by this post too... I need to do something about my life.
