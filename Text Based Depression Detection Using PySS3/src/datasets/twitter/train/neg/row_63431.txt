I don't think I'll do itIt's awfully temping though. Just going through a rough patch. Nobody to talk to as I have zero friends. No close family. I'm old and untalented. Not really anything going for me. But I think I'm just being a crybaby. 

But I have been thinking about it more then usual and I find throwing some words into the void sometimes helps. I apologize if this is taking up a real persons time.
