How should I go about this? Want to ODI have been put on citalopram (20mg) for depression by my doctor. This is only the second day and I am feeling worse than ever. I have decided I want to overdose on these, but I don't know if I want to die or not. I just want to wake up in hospital, so that everyone in my life can see what I really have been feeling like. Can this permanently damage any of my organs? I have about 600mg in the packet. I think I might just take it all, wait a bit, then call an ambulance...
