Feel Like The Universe Hates MeFeel like everything hates me with a passion; for the past 3 years even if I get a brief moment of happiness  the universe reminds me itâ€™s gonna fuck things up for me right away. 2018-2019 I was depressed but not suicidal; but 2020 has done damage to me beyond repair. Hopefully I get the courage to end things forever
