I scheduled my death on August 03. Now I'm a future chefIf you look at my past posts,  you will know why I had planned my death. I was so tired and hopeless.  Every waking hour was killing me.  So I was really looking forward to my scheduled death.  I was ready.  I was going to do it. I even spent some more time with my friends and even almost made a destructive decision to reveal all of my enemy's secrets that could destroy their whole life.  I mean,  I was going to die anyway,  so fuck being civil.  

But then, for some reason,  I was lured to enrol to a culinary arts school.  I thought of having fun for just last time.  It was hella expensive but I didn't care since I was going to die anyway,  lol. I was there to enjoy my last days.  There was no passion.

But as days past by,  passion started to bloom in me.  I started enjoying this whole thing for real.  I met new friends,  I became dedicated to serve delicious meals,  I had reasons to wake up! 

Now,  I'm still happy and enjoying my trainee days.  So far,  my grades are high and my instructors are already endorsing me.  We will be having our external OJT soon and my name is already known in that hotel,  thanks to the hype caused by my instructors.

I'm more forgiving,  even abandoning my plan to destroy my ex-enemy's secret.  I said 'ex' since there is no more place for hate in my heart. Our life is so precious to focus our heart for someone who will just keep on breaking it.  They were my best of friends who had betrayed me.  They destroyed me.  But I am not going to do the same.  I am now better than that.  

I was supposed to be dead by now.  But I'm glad I stayed. I hope everyone will find their reasons to live.
