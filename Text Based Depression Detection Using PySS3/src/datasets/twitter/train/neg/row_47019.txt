A friend of a friend going through suicidal thoughtsI'm going to preface this by mentioning that I don't know the entire situation and that both my friend and I are only 14. Recently a friend (we'll call her Violet) has been mentioning her own friend (we'll call him Red) has been having suicidal thoughts again. He's already gotten professional help numerous times, but it hasn't seemed to help him much. He wants to die so badly and he tells Violet to just let go. I feel terrible for everyone involved, but I've never been much good with comforting people. It's taken a mental toll on both of them. Tonight he's stepped down and he told her he wouldn't kill himself, but I'm afraid for both of them. He feels as if it won't get better.  
I know what it's like to feel helpless, feeling as if there's nothing you can do to comfort your loved one. Suicide is common in my family, we've lost so many to it. Last year my sister attempted it, and earlier this month my mom checked herself into a mental hospital due to suicidal thoughts. I know I've drifted off from the main topic, but as I write this I'm beginning to feel like I can't help the people around me. I wish I could just do something.
