I am dissociated.I feel completely disconnected from my own life. Iâ€™m just here, but itâ€™s like Iâ€™m watching myself live; Iâ€™m not really in control of what I do. 
I really feel like Iâ€™m in â€œthe wrong timeline,â€ like everything thatâ€™s happening isnâ€™t right and isnâ€™t real. 
Iâ€™m planning on semi-attempting and going to a hospital next week, is that weird? Is that absolutely crazy, to plan to fail? I just feel like I need to do something extreme to get noticed, to take control, to feel right.
