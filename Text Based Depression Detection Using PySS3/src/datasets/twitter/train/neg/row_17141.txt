Attempted Sunday, still hereI don't know why I'm still here. Self-sacrifice is the best gift you can give someone, right? Watching someone touch a body that will never connect with yours. Watching them experience a lifetime of happiness together. Watching them welcome a new life into the world that you'll never cradle with your own hands. 

Christ, it really hurts.
