Alive alive butI've been suicidal. And I can't help but think how things will still be okay. Once I'm gone. The sun will still rise and fall. My friends will still have school. Thanksgiving and Christmas will still be here. Life will still be here. They will still smile. They will still laugh. They will still cry. Theyre gonna continue with life. Meet new people. New adventures. New people to love. After I'm gone. Can anyone talk about this with me? I'm not blind to the fact my absence will be different and unsettling. BUT LIFE WILL ALWAYS GO ON. Whether I'm alive or in a grave. Any thoughts? I apologize if this came off triggering for others.
