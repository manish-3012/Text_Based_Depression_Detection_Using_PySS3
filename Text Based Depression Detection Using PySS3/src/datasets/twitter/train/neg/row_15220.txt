Please help I want to kill myself but I want to live at the same timeI'm lonely and having bad suicidal thoughts. I can't stop crying and I'm thinking about doing it. I feel at loss. I know things can get better but they haven't in years and I'm trying so hard to make my life better. I just want to be loved but I realize not all people are destined for that.
