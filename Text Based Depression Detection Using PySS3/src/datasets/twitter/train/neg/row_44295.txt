My psychiatrist prescribes me crazy amounts of ambienI had severe insomnia my entire life and ambien was a game changer to my sleep habits, but I also have depression and last year I tried to overdose on ambien but it was about 50mg, not nearly enough to actually kill me, I googled the lethal dose and thought "well, fuck, I'll never have that much" and stopped thinking about it.
I told my psychiatrist about the attempt and he prescribed me mirtazapine (antidepressant), which makes me very sleepy so I didn't need ambien anymore and thought he wouldn't let me continue taking it because of the OD attempt, but he did, and obviously I didn't said it wasn't a good ideia because it's so fucking obvious, and he kept prescribing more and I was just stocking it, now, 5 months later, I have 10 boxes of this shit, more than enough to kill me, and it's completely his fault for not giving a fuck. Now the boxes are just sitting there waiting for the moment I'll do it I just need a bad day and that's it.
