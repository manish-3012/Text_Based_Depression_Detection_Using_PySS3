Need some advice.I've felt suicidal multiple times in my life even though I'm relatively young.

I'm not gonna talk about why I feel this way because it seems rather pointless to me, I would just like to ask you guys if any of you that have felt or still feel this way have actually got even a little better after asking for help. I mean talking to an expert, like a psychologist or therapist or whatever it's called.

Apologies for any mistakes made but I'm not a native speaker and thank you for reading or answerig.
