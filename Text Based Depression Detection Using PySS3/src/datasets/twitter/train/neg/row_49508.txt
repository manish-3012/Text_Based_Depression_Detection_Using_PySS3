Someone please talk to meI don't know what to say. My girlfriend of almost 5 years ghosted me for another guy. I found out she had been cheating and lying to me for months. Even after all that she still means the world to me and I want nothing more than for her to call me and say I'm sorry and we'll be alright, but I know that's not going to happen. I have such an empty feeling, I haven't sleept in close to 40 hours, nor have I eaten. I tried to eat but I physically get sick and throw up. I feel so helpless. I have absolutely no friends, she was it, I tried reaching out to people i somewhat know today but not one replied. I feel so stupid doing this and could go on and on I just need someone to talk to me before I do something I shouldn't.
