If I don't do this essay, I'll lose financial aid and drop out of schoolI had a week to do it. Extended even! And I just fucking can't do anything. Part of me wants to die, and I know I'll kill myself if I get kicked out of school. I can't afford it without financial aid and failing this class would put me out of availability to receive it. 
I don't know what will help right now. I can't find anyone to reach out to as usual
