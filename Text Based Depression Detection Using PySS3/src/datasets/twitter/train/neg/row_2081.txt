I understand it's as much my fault as it is his.We use to be fine but then I started finding out you were cheating on me. A little over a years worth of our relationship was you cheating many many times and disrespecting me many times. You made a huge promise to want to work things out so I figured why not. We are 18 year old parents, so naturally things are hard. 
Maybe it's the postpartum depression that I have and I'm not aware of. I don't know.
I'm sorry that now when I get angry at you I lash out and hit you violently. You may not believe me but I try to hard to hold myself back because I don't want to cause you pain but every time you fuck up its like a slap in the face after everything we have been through.
Last night we both verbally and physically abused each other. I tried not to put my hands on you but you were being so mean.. And I know that sounds childish but it's true.
I was having some kind of breakdown and all I wanted was genuine comfort from you but you were being a jackass to me. You even told me to my face that being nice to me didn't work so now you were going to be an asshole.
When I was crying you were mocking me and making fun of me. You kept saying how you didn't care about me anymore and that I was a waste of your time. 
Last night you punched me in the leg twice, stepped on my get countless times, shook me by the shoulders countless times, head budded me countless times, and pushed me into the fridge where I was hurt lying on the floor and you turned off the kitchen light and left me there. I know you say you did it because I threw your clothes outside so then it is my fault. Everything is my fault. And there's no point in being alive anymore. I've nerve felt so alone in my life. I'm obviously fucked up. Too fucked up to be a mom. I can't do this anymore.
I'm a pathetic waste of oxygen and I deserve to die.
