I know I'm gonna kill myself one day - I feel like I'm just putting off the inevitable.Right now I'm just here cause I have a few documents to sort and some stuff I wanna tidy up and sell. I feel like I'm lying to my family every day because they think I'm here because I'm 'beating' depression. Anyone else feel the same way? Like you know you're gonna end it soon? I doubt I'll be here in a year or two.
