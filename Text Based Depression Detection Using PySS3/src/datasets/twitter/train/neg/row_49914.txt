Male Pattern Baldness is killing meI know this may seem like a silly thing, but I've been majorly depressed ever since I started losing my hair. I'm on all the medications I can be to prevents it and I know I've still got a relatively large amount of hair left. But every time I look in the mirror I get so sad. All I can think about is ending it so I don't have to deal with it anymore. I have good days and bad days, but every week or so I fall into a massive funk where all I can think about is how I'm going to end it. I've gotten close so many times. I just want to be free of this self hatred. I've been to a couple therapists about this and I've tried to follow their advice and just embrace it, but when I think I've gotten there, there's always something that sets off my suicidal thoughts again. I'm stuck in a cycle of self loathing and suicidal thoughts.
