There really is no reason for me to stayThink about it. I kill myself. Worst case scenario: hell, eternal punishment, all that jazz. Best case scenario, there is no longer a "me" that can contemplate the nothingness that comes after death. "I" would no longer exist. That sounds like a hell of a deal to me.


I'm only living right now because I know my parents would be devastated if I killed myself. That guilt is what keeps me alive. But what if, like I mentioned earlier, there is no "me" to experience that guilt? No "me" to see/be aware of my parent's anguish? Maybe I'm not making any sense right now.
