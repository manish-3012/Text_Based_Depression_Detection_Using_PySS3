When Justice Isn't EnoughHi guys,

Have you ever tried opening up to the authorities yet they start to doubt you? That's what I think I've been struggling about lately. Last year I was sexually harassed by a co-worker and I filed a case in court. Justice is especially slow in our country so I also decided to file at our HR. It took me a lot of guts and also had to go to counselling after the incident. Half a year of decision making went by for the managment and all the guy was sentenced to was only a few months of suspension. It hurts knowing that after that we'll be forced to get back to work and act normally again as if it never happened. I love my job, but I find it hard that I have to be the one to suck it up or else my performance will affect my progress. It feels like I'm at a dead end where I tried everything and yet that's all I got that's why my suicidal thoughts are slowly creeping back again.

It feels like if you're tired, there's always this so called "fire exit"...

At this moment, I'm still far from that door, but I don't know...

I don't know...
