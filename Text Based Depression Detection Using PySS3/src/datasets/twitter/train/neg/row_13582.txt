I'm 16 and I think I'm gonna end itSo I have been really depressed for the past two years after moving from a public middle school to a private high school. I had to start over with the whole friend making progress, but that's not was is causing it. All my classes are really hard ad I can only manage b's and c's in all of them, where in middle school I could manage straight A's. My parents aren't used to the change in Grades so they are constantly yelling and threatening to beat me.(they have in the past) I don't know why they don't understand why its so hard. I am on financial aid so I have to do work grant to stay at the school.I'm also in a program on saturdays that gives me 2k a year for going. I have been blowing it off and telling my parents I don't have the program because I have to do work grant on saturdays. I do not know what they will do to me when they find out I am lying. I don't think I can deal with them anymore. Take for example yesterday I put my elbow on the side of the car because I was tired from stuudying and working 5 hours for work grant. My mom goes off on a 20 minute rant about how I'm always tired and that I am ungrateful and never want to help her. Oh and btw we have tons of animals like sheep, goats, and rabbits. I have to feed all the rabbits, which is a 60 minute job. After I get home at 6 and then procede to do 4+ hours of hw. I just can't take it. The yelling, the work, my parents, its just all too much. I think I'm gonna end my life friday after finals, just to show my parents I am not lazy and so people don't think it was because of finals(wouldnt want to put that on my school)
