Life is not precious simply because we live. You have to make it worthwhileAnd I havenâ€™t. Iâ€™m wasting mine and everyoneâ€™s time. I donâ€™t want this anymore. I can see that people donâ€™t care about what Iâ€™m doing with my life, so why keep this up? Iâ€™ve chosen to throw away my potential in life. No one believed in me before, so no one one will believe in me again. I need to throw the rest of my life away. None of this shit is fun and I wonâ€™t contribute to anything, so I should stop wasting time and rip the bandage off
