Living after cancer isnâ€™t lifeIâ€™ve started making arrangements to ensure my family wonâ€™t be left with a shit storm after Iâ€™m gone. Iâ€™ve been living with severe chronic pain that has only gotten worse since remission from cancer.

Iâ€™ve been seeing a psychologist that specializes in chronic pain and her only answer is drugs. My oncologist only offers drugs. 

I canâ€™t sit down anymore. I canâ€™t stand. I canâ€™t have sex ever again. I can barely drive. 

I have plans for each of my dogs, and all of my possessions. A few things to wrap up. A painting to finish for a friend. Some goodbyes to make. Since being diagnosed most of my friends have disappeared so it wonâ€™t be too hard. 

I can see the relief and Iâ€™m so at peace when I think about it. No more pain. No more struggle. Just nothing.
