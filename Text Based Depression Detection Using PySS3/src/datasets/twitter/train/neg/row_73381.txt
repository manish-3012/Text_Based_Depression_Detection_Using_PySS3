Setting a date...I find myself writing long lists of why I should vs why I shouldnâ€™t. The most depressing truth is that I have every reason why I should and no reasons not to other than my own fear. Iâ€™m clinging to the hope that things will change for me but at age 28 it really isnâ€™t likely. Anyway I wanted to share my list with you, weirdly itâ€™s the first thing Iâ€™ve been proud of in a long time because I feel like I have finally been honest with myself.

Reasons why I should

In order to love myself I should shorten my life thereby ending my suffering

Iâ€™m ugly and nothing can ever change that. Even if I learn to hide it behind make up I will never be beautiful

I am not intelligent. I have no ability to memorise anything and therefor canâ€™t learn even when I want to. I will never be intelligent.

I have no talents. I will never be successful or achieve my dreams because I lack the talent to back up my ambitions.

The best I can hope for is mediocre. I will never have a high paying job. I will never be popular. I will never be beautiful. I will never be valued by society. I have nothing to offer and no ability to change.
