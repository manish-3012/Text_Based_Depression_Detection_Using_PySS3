Feeling Really LowI had a failed attempt around my birthday last year and have been seeing a therapist since (couldnâ€™t lie about it after that).

Things were better for a while, but I can feel my head slipping back down the dark hole. 
I canâ€™t eat or sleep, Iâ€™ve stopped washing because I donâ€™t go out. All I can think about is how little my life matters and why itâ€™s not worth carrying on.

I donâ€™t know where else to go or what to do right now, but Iâ€™m scared that if I donâ€™t try to reach out things will only get worse.
