I keep going back and forthI think I need to get cold hearted,say fuck everybody and kill myself.No one will even care,crocodile tears.Iâ€™m never anyoneâ€™s first choice,no close friends,none of that shit,itâ€™s not their fault,I have a shitty and toxic personality.Everyone says I mean so much and shit now when I look back no ones left.Iâ€™ve been talking to two different people recently.Amazing people who actually are able to reciprocate and understand and even go so far as to tell me that they donâ€™t exactly understand but theyâ€™ll try to because Iâ€™m their friend and they care.Knowing me theyâ€™ll probably leave one day too.Life means nothing to me.Gonna try and hang myself while drinking the bathroom cleaning acid or whatever that shit is called and try and slit my wrist.One of them should definitely take me out.
