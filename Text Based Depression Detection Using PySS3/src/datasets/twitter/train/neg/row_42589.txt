Why does my brain keep torturing me?I keep getting flash backs to horrible stuff in my childhood that i was certain I was over. Then my OCD tries to make up false memories to make it all worse. These intrusive thoughts are awful. No one should live like this.

I really donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t go to therapy, I canâ€™t afford online therapyâ€” I canâ€™t burden my husband anymore with this stuff. He is supportive and sweet but tbh itâ€™s not helping me when I vent lately. 

Iâ€™m just keeping the details to myself and itâ€™s killing me.

The techniques from self help books arenâ€™t working for me in my current state.
I canâ€™t enjoy anything anymore.

Itâ€™s making me ill.

It doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™m pregnant, canâ€™t take my meds and I keep thinking of everything that went wrong in my childhood. Iâ€™m so afraid it will all  happen to my child too

I feel like my brain wants me to die. Itâ€™s like having an abuser live in my head. It wants me to reach a point where I canâ€™t take it anymore.

The only thing that comforts me is the thought that once I give birth, Iâ€™ll maybe just end it all whenever I can. I feel like somehow due to my childhood Iâ€™d be a danger to my baby. 

I should be destroyed
