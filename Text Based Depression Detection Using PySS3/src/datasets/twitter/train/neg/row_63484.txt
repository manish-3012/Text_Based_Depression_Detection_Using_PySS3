Not sure what to doI got a really good job, itâ€™s high pay and I love doing what I do. The problem is the people I work with, people talk so much shit about how young I look and I get shit about it all day long. At first it didnâ€™t bother me at all but lately it has really gotten to me. Itâ€™s to the point where Iâ€™m ready to end it all and Iâ€™m just about ready to that here tonight.
