Please helpHello, I'm posting this on behalf of a loved one (my girlfriend). I am in my late teens and she is in her early twenties.

 She has an incurable condition which causes her constant chronic pain and in many respects makes her life crap. She is also extremely depressed and will talk about suicide with me quite openly. She quite often expresses the desire to jump off a cliff or purchase a firearm and shoot herself with it (I live in the UK so this would be pretty hard). She hasn't made any attempts recently but I know that she has jumped off of a building before and that she has tried overdosing on codeine painkillers on more than one occasion. She says that she doesn't want to live (even if her disease is cured) because the part of her that cared about living died a long time ago. She says that she is trying to think of a method of killing herself that will be 100% effective that will leave no chance of her becoming a vegetable on life support for the rest of her life. I have tried numerous times to get her some help be it from therapy or anti-depressants but she has none of it.

After 2-3 years of this I reached my wits end today and told her sister and father all about it because I genuinely feared for her life. I know I did the right thing and hope that they can get her some help but she seems so far gone to me. She also found out about me telling and said that she can never trust me with anything again and for a moment wanted to never speak with me again. I'm really tired and emotionally drained and just need some help here. What am I supposed to do?
