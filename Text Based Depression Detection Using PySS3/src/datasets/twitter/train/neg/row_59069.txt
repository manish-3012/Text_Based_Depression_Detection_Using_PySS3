I don't have almost anyone left because of self-isolation.I see the What's App of my college classmates, having group calls, or sharing memes and joking together... And then I realize I won't be having that anytime soon.

Aside from a few friends and family, I'm on my own. I spend the day eating, working at our family store, playing games/browsing internet, sleeping and repeating the cycle again and again. 

I'm alone, and it's my fault, for not trying to push depression away or to keep in touch, and now I can't even pick up the pieces.

I think I've always done things wrong, as people end up getting uncomfortable around me, or I annoy them, or I make them hate me... Once an outcast freak, always an outcast freak, I guess.
