35. Not sure I'll reach 36.Every day I think vividly about dying. It used to be peaceful but now I think about where I would need to slash my throat with a box cutter to get the best effect. Even when I'm "happy", I'm thinking about stabbing myself in the chest. I'm a coward and all I'm doing is hurting people who deserve better than me.
