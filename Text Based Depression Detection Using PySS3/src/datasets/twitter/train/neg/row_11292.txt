is it possible to just be fundamentally broken as a person?im sorry for the incoherent rambling... i am very not sober &amp; cant stop crying

i dont know exactly what to say other than i feel like there is something really wrong with me. i thought i stopped having these feelings for months.. close to a year. i was rly happy &amp; met amazing people &amp; yet all i seem to do is mess things up and push people away. it honestly feels like any time im happy i cant help but find whatever way there is to mess things up and end up unhappy again. im so tired of it. it really really hurts... im honestly so tired of crying &amp; dealing with the pain &amp; its only worse because i have nobody to blame but myself for it. 

i just really wish i could be happy. thats all i want and yet it seems like i do everything i can to make it never happen. i try so hard to be a good person and be there for others but i always end up doing something stupid and ruining everything. im actually just a fuckup whining about suicidal thoughts on reddit :))) and it feels so unfair because i never even got a chance to be happy growing up..it makes me so intensely jealous of everyone who is normal and can just be happy and i feel awful for being so petty

idk why im even posting this other than venting... it just feels so shitty to be like this and i hate it. i just want so badly to be born as someone else
