tired. i want to end my lifei dont care that others have it worse than me, i dont care that i might regret it. i do care about the people i might hurt, i also care about my cat, my family. idk.

its hard to care about myself. i havent eaten in a long time, ive tried to stay relatively clean though, it helps me feel more comfortable at least. ive been trying to sleep but i just cant.

i dont have anyone to speak to or anyone i feel comfortable speaking to. it sucks. it really does.

idk if i should just try to sleep. i cant ....

thats all i have to say.
