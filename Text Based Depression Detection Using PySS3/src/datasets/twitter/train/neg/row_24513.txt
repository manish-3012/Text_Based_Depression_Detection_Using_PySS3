Need help finding brother-in-lawMy boyfriends' brother disappeared a couple nights ago after leaving a suicide note. Thankfully, he was found safe and picked up by the Phoenix, AZ PD. However, the PD can't tell us (the family) exactly what facility he was taken to--they've mentioned a couple possible places. When calling both suggested places, HIPAA laws prevent administrators at the facilities from telling us if my boyfriend's brother is there or not.

One facility allowed me to leave my name and number, and if my boyfriend's brother signs a consent form, the facility will call me to let me know he's there. I haven't heard anything yet. Boyfriend's mom and sister called the same facility and weren't even given the option of leaving their names and phone numbers. When boyfriend's mother asked what the procedure would be for a hypothetical patient (How long are patients held after they're picked up? What happens when they're released?) she was denied any info.

We (all the family) live across the country. My boyfriend has flown to Phoenix to find/help his brother, but we're at a loss. What can we do to find him?
