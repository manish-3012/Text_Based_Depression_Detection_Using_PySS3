My social anxiety is enough to make me want to kill myselfI canâ€™t talk to my foster family, I canâ€™t make important phone calls and I am paralysed with fear over moving out in the next few months even though I want to get away from my current environment. I am unable to leave my room due to severe anxiety. I am so fucking lonely and upset. This is the same everyday, as it has been for years unless I have to go to school or something. I stay inside my room and only leave it when I have to eat dinner with my family. And I donâ€™t speak a word during dinner unless spoken to, in which case I give short answers. Iâ€™m always self-conscious and think that people are looking at me and think Iâ€™m fucking weird. I bet that is what my family thinks. Every day they are laughing and talking together downstairs and Iâ€™m upstairs just listening and sometimes Iâ€™m driven to tears just hearing them. 

Itâ€™s so fucking difficult not being able to say anything to your family, even if you want to go for a walk and it is courtesy to say that youâ€™re leaving for a while, I canâ€™t fucking do that. Iâ€™m so fucking pathetic and useless. Not to mention that every day I have to plan out when I go downstairs in order to avoid as many members of my family as possible. I often go days without getting myself food or water. What the fuck can I even do except wait until I can get the fuck out of this abusive place?
