I'm getting closer to making the decision. Its the details I need to figure out. Its a bit overwhelming.I have no one to talk to. Even if I  did I bet they wouldn't understand. I have no reason to live, nothing gives me any pleasure. I am sad deep down and yet feel nothing. Try to slog through the day until bedtime. There is no point anymore.
