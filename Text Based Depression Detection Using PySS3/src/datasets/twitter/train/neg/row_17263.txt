I don't think I want to keep going anymore.   My family is either awful, racist, bigots that don't care about me or they actively think I'm a terrible freak who doesn't belong, then there are the ones who abuse me. 
   I have depression, anxiety, I'm pretty stunted socially due to the problems I have with autism, and I've got epilepsy brought on by a brain deformation. 
   I can't be treated for anything but my epilepsy, and the meds make me so sleepy that I literally could sleep for days on end and not care. I then feel sad/guilty/terrible for sleeping a lot when I do and hate myself more.
   My girlfriend, who I'd dated long distance and finally gotten to meet in person just weeks ago, no longer wants to date me. I have some subtle things that remind her of her abusive ex, and she just isn't ready to date someone (she realized this after having a physical date with me and all) but I don't hold it against her. She has good reasons.
   I have school coming up again, and if I fail a very specific class I will be kicked out of my major and never allowed to attempt again at this college. All my work wasted after these years, and I already did poorly enough to have to take the class again.
   I can't find anything fun to do anymore, or enjoy most anything anymore at all. I think I'm going to kill myself, jump off a tall building preferably and swan dive into the pavement. 
   My hopes, dreams, wants, are all about to be gone or already are. I'm not skilled or talented, good looking either for all that matters, and I'm incapable of functioning well without help. Why should I live any longer? What is the point of living with all this on my shoulders?
