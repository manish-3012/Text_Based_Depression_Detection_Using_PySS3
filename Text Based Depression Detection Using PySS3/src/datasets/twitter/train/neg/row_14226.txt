Should I just kill myself?I'm so stupid. I've lost over $20000 investing in crypto currency. And now I've been laid off from my job. I really screwed myself over due to my stupidity. Everybody says to not invest more than you can afford to lose and I did not heed the warning. I feel like I deserve to die.
