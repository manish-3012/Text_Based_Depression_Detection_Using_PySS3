the guilt of my family house fire is overwhelming 

ive lived in a toxic household till the age 18, with parents that refuse to reach out for therapy or mental health care for any of thier 3 non-nuerotypical children and have added to all of thier mental health issues. i couldnt wait to get out but leaving them behind and nolonger being there to be the one who gets up and watches over the younger siblings in my house allowed my brother problems to boil over. after my dog was unrightfully put down due to behavioral issues rather than training, they quickly replased it with a new dog. less than a month later my mother went for a coffee and came home to the dog cage in flames in the front yard and our living room floor in flames. lucky the dogs and family got out with minor injuries and this could have been so much worse, but just as my mom dreads getting coffee that morning i believe if i would have stayed as that crutch for my brothers this would have been preventable. they took all his electronics away and he was confined to the house. the incident was definitly instigated but ever since the incident intrusive thoughts have taken over and all i can imagine is all the preventative steps that were completley looked over. he's an over all good kid not even 15 ,and seeing the streaks on the floor where gasoline was poured blocking the only exit not blocked by a fence makes me sick to my stomach.
