I'm just so tired, how long can I hold on and is there a point to do so ?I can't find it. Everything and everyone tells me that I just have to look in myself to find happiness. I don't know where to look. I don't care about anything anymore. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't know how I can feel better no matter how hard I try. I hate myself. Medicine isn't doing anything anymore. I've tried different ones. Different therapists. I am still depressed. I feel like I'm not even a part of life anymore, like I'm watching a movie, and everything I want I could never get. It feels unreal. And I don't deserve it. And I'm not capable of anything.
