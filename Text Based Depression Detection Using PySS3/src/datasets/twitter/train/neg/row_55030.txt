i wrote a poem 

 

* Tattooed, white smoke, you burn my eyes.
* Burned weed, kiss kiss, light up my life.
* Alaska lights on northern sky.
* Gold chains, cocaine, you're in my vein
* Stay all night up, you're in my brain
* I love your flaws, I won't complain
* Universe changes, I can't explain
* I am on your motorcycle
* Hug you, I can feel your heartbeat tho
* Serotonin, dopa-amine is bursting inside us yo
* Lay on your chest, brains are obsessed
* You are the best, I feel so blessed to have you, babe
