I need to do it to protect othersLast week I sexually assaulted a person I really cared for. I didn't mean to. I saw that her dress was messed up and I fixed it in the bathroom. She didn't see it that way. She said that I sexually assaulted her by doing that. I was so upset at her at first because I have been asualted myself and I would never do that to anyone. However, to her I did. I put my hands on her when I should not have. We may have been dating and friends but I still did something awful to her. I have been having panic attacks all week worried that the cops are going to show up at my house for assaulting her. I keep getting told that I did nothing wrong and I have nothing to worry about. I put my hands on her in a bathroom though. My intentions was to fix her dress but that's still wrong. She is telling people I am a dangerous person to be around and she is right. I am dangerous. I hurt the people around me. I know the right thing would be to turn myself into the police. I just don't think that is enough to protect people. The only way to protect people is to kill myself. If I was dead I would not be able to hurt anyone else. It needs to be done to protect the people around me.
