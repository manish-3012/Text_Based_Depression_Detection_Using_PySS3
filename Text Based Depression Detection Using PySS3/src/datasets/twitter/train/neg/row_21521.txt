My mum called mental health servicesBecause I bought some equipment to kill myself. I went into my sisters amazon account and ordered them last night so it'll arrive today. My sister saw the email and called my mother to tell her.

I don't want to die as such. I just want to give up and stop hurting. It was a cry for help. My mum called me an attention seeker and I guess I am. 

I'm so frightened they'll admit me to hospital. A nurse is arriving shortly to assess me. Mum wants me to leave her house and has said for days she wants me out. She says I obviously need help and I'm letting my mental illnesd consume me and she doesn't want me around anymore. That I'm lazy, dirty and disgusting. 

I've been crying for days and I'm so god damn depressed. I feel completely ruined. All my family are going to find out and I feel sick with guilt and shame.

I just see no way out anymore. I'm better off dead for everyone. I wish i had the guts to end it. Last night I had an episode of calmness when I made up my mind about killing myself. Right now I just feel hopeless
