I donâ€™t know if I can survive todaySorry of the is too cryptic I just canâ€™t think clearly anymore 
Iâ€™m just so tired, Iâ€™m exhausted. I try and try and try and get nothing. My sister found my account and got scared off. Why do strangers care about me more then she does? all I wanted is some distraction but she refuses to come over. Iâ€™m tired of humiliating myself for people who donâ€™t care about me. I tried of being seen as the accommodative one, the helpful one, where is my accommodation when I need it, where is my help when I need? No where thatâ€™s where, and I just feel more helpless and helpless and hopeless and I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s the point anymore and I canâ€™t really think clearly anymore I just want everything to be over already
