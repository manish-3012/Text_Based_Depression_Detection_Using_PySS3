Goodnight EveryoneI hope we can all make it through the night so that weâ€™ll be able to see how silly our thoughts looked in the light of day, and how the sunlight, of even for a second, makes us feel a bit warmer than the coldness of the night.
I hope that we can all use this week to find our footing, take a stand &amp; begin to get back up.
However, itâ€™s completely fine to want to lay down for a while, itâ€™s perfectly fine to want to stay down &amp; build your strength, as long as you know that we can always get back up again.
Always.

I know it feels terrible now.
I know it doesnâ€™t feel like thereâ€™s any reason to keep wasting oxygen.
I know.

Been there, done that.
And thatâ€™s why I can say, without a doubt, no bs or generic crap youâ€™d read in a book, no joke.. it gets better.
We canâ€™t force it to, and it takes time, but in the beginning, youâ€™ll start to notice how things seem not as terrible as before, how maybe that person who cares about you really does care or that you do really have someone who still cares after all this time, or even to the point where you think you have no one.. look around. The fine people on these forums are hurting just as much as you. Maybe say hello, maybe make a friend, maybe itâ€™ll take your mind off everything, even for a minute.
And please, please, all I can ask is that you call one person before doing anything serious.
Be honest.
You might be surprised, you might not, but either way, just know that Iâ€™m proud of you for making it this far.
We both know you couldâ€™ve been gone a month ago, a year ago, an hour ago.
We both know what youâ€™re capable of, but I know youâ€™re capable of a lot more, I just hope you can stick around long enough to see how much the world would miss you.
How much I, an internet stranger, would miss you.

So goodnight my friends.
I hope you all sleep well &amp; I canâ€™t wait to feel the sunshine
