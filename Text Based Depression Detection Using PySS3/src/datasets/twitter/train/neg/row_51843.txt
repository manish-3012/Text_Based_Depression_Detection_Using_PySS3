I don't really feel like there is a point anymore.I suffer from severe depression. I'm in college. I failed my first semester. This semester isn't going too well either. My depression controls me. I'm on citalopram, and it has been getting less and less effective. The counselors here are un-helpful. I can't get in to the doc for new meds for another week, due to being booked. Every day I get more and more tired. I'm so lonely, even though I surround myself with friends. I think about how insignificant I am compared to the 6 million other people on this earth. Nothing I do will ever have an impact, even if I want it to. I really just want an eternal slumber. Nothing in my life has been improving. If I could leave without hurting my friends, I would have done it a long time ago. I haven't been legitimately happy for an extremely long time, no matter what I change. I just want to be normal. I don't understand how people can be happy when life is so meaningless to me.
