Many people die before a achieving their dreams.They get into accidents, get sick or face bankrupcy after unfortunate events. I shouldn't be able to achieve them either. I don't want my suicide to be a culmination of my life, i want it to be a sudden stop. That's what a real death should look like in my opinion.
