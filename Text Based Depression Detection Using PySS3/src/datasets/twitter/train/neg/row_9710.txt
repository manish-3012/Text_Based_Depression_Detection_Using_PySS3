Life seems dark nowTo start off i am currently 18 years old and i have been trough so much physical,verbal and mental abuse.Since i was born i would get beaten for anything wrong i did by my father untill i got old enough to be able to fight back.my father has ruined my family by beating me,my siblings and my mom and cheating on her multiple times.
I was always a good student and I still am im currently in my 3rd year of highschool and i just cant handle life anymore i dont feel happiness unless im drunk or on drugs.and i have been drinking since age 15 weed since 16 and harder drugs(not too often tho) since late 17.i dont feel like i can talk to anyone so this is why im writing here.i really needed a place to vent i just feel like ending it all would be such a relief but also cause i dont believe in god or an afterlife death is as scary as living.i feel so bad cause living is torture and death scares me.Only thing that ever made me happy was love and the girl i loved cheated on me after a long time being together so it has left me scarred and besides that drugs and alcohol seem to help but i always feel kinda guilty afterwards cause i feel like im not normal and that im an outcast cause of years of abuse and bullying lead me to this place where i replace genuine feelings with substances.sorry about any grammar mistakes english isnt my native language.
