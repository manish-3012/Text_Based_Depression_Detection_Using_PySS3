I slit my wrist because I'm sad.It's pathetic. 

I can't bear to be me anymore. I want to hop to another person's life and have every memory I've ever remembered erased. I've slit my arms before, but in the forearm because the pain made the nauseating sadness disappear just for the moment. This time I slit my wrist. But I stopped because I feel guilt. I'm posting a lot on such subreddits, I don't know if it's help I want, closure, a close companion, if I want to die or maybe it just feels good knowing a happier person is reading this. I don't know anymore.
