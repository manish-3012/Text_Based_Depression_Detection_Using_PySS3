Benzodiazepine and alcohol should numb the hypothermia, right?I'm a 22 year old high school drop out with a dead end job and no aspiration to change it. My family abandoned me due to me being a failure. My friends use me for their own gain, probably because I was born to be a failure. It's so fucking ironic that I'm terrified of failing all while being a failure in everyones eyes. On new years eve I'm going on a hike with a bottle of vodka and an unopened box of benzodiazepine. If that shit isn't enough, I'm sure the -10 â°C weather will take care of the rest. This time I actually refuse to fail.
