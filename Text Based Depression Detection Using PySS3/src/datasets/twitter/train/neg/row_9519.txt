Even more suicidal now...I took the time to write out a huge fucking post about my life and no one even fucking commented "aww I'm sorry :(" or some shit like that...the only comment was telling me to lose weight and it had to be fucking deleted. I feel like an attention whore(but looking at my past, who can blame me?) but it made me feel so much more worse, because no one actually fucking cares enough to comment...
i want to fucking die wow
i'm sorry if it seems really desperate but...i mean, I am desperate tbh...my entire life has consisted of isolation, ya know?
