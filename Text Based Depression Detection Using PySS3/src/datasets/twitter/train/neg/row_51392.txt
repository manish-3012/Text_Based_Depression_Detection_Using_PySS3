If anyone actually knows: What policy does the VA have if you report a suicide attempt?So, I was prescribed an antidepressant by the VA to quit smoking. I thought it was good at first. But I had a suicide attempt on New Year's Eve. Totally out of character for me. "Suicidal thoughts or actions" are a side effect of this drug. 

I just recently got off of it, and am returning to my normal, not plotting a suicide self. I hurt my neck, but I don't want to report it if I am going to be committed somewhere for it.

If you know, please answer/If you don't know, please don't answer.
