Can someone help me, I'm feeling depressed.?I know I'm feeling signs of depression, I just want someone to say, Hi!, or Hello, or Hey there! 

edit: Thanks guys, I don't remember writing this, I must have been half asleep - half awake, it has been a tough week, and I'm going through a lot. Thanks again.
