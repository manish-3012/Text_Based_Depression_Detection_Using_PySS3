i have no reason to be this depressedthere is virtually nothing wrong with my life, at least not enough to be this depressed about. iâ€™ve definitely been through some rough shit in my life but in the last 6 months or so things have been relatively good. iâ€™ve been taking zoloft for depression and OCD for years now. took prozac and wellbutrin xl before that. all the sudden this summer my zoloft stopped working. i became massively depressed â€” sleeping all the time, no interest in anything, crying periodically. we changed my dose and i got a lot better. now things are bad again and have been for a month at least. i constantly think about killing myself, how i do not want to be here going through the mundane over and over until something inevitably bad happens some day. how every good and happy and exciting moment is fleeting. and how i am so disappointed in myself, my personality, my body, everything about myself â€” and wanting to die makes me feel even more guilt and shame, like i know people have it worse off than me, which only makes it worse. 

i have been putting dying off for weeks. the holidays, work, things that i knew i needed to do. but i know that i can do it any time, and i have enough pills to do it, and they are constantly taunting me from my medicine cabinet. i feel like simultaneously a coward and a burden, like i will destroy the people around me if i go through with suicide and like i will make their lives worse if i stay. 

i donâ€™t know why iâ€™m posting here. i canâ€™t really share the extent of my feelings with anyone close to me i guess, despite how good they are to me. i donâ€™t deserve it. they deserve better.
