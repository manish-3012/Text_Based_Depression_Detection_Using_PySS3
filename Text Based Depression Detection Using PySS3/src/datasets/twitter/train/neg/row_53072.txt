Iâ€™m sorry if this isnâ€™t the right place, serious emergencyMy mom and step dad had a domestic dispute today, heâ€™s been acting erratic for a while and threatened her several times today and kept talking about how â€œheâ€™s deadâ€. I canâ€™t reach her, and I canâ€™t reach him. This is not normal, and I am seriously concerned about her and my baby sister. Who do I call for a wellness check in Houston Texas? Iâ€™m not in Houston Idk what to do
