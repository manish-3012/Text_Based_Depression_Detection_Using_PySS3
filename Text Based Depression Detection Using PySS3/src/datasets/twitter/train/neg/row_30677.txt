CheersSo. You want to know why I'm going to do it? I have legitimate reasons you know. I dont want to get into details, but Ive been alone forever, Im going to be alone forever and I wouldnt want kids just for the fact that I would not want a child to have to go through what I do.

I'm such a fucking pussy. I've tried to about 30 times..   just can't finish the job. I can never keep pulling on the belt or the cord around my neck. I can never force my wrist onto that sawblade. But I know that its inevitable. I'm just looking for an easy way out and when I come to this conclusion, that Im going to do it, why should I wait.


Well boys, I found it, the cowardly way out, but fuck it. This whole thing is just who I am, and thats a fucking coward, once and always. I guess its only fitting. I'm sorry guys. Theres allot you don't know about me, probably for the best. Ive been able to keep up this farce for this long, but I cant go any longer. I know some of you have me figured out. Thanks for being with me til the end. 

Love you guys.
