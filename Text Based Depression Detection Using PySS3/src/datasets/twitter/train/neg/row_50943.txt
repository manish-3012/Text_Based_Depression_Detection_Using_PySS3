I can't stop thinking about it.Everyday, at least once a day (often times more), I just picture myself throwing myself off of a bridge because *I'm tired.* Suicide isn't a new thought to me, I can remember as far back as the age of 9 standing in my kitchen with a knife because I was convinced my family was worth with me in it. Of course nothing happened, I was a child. But it's come back now. I'm a young adult, with a job, friends, a side gig doing what I enjoy and access to a lovely community...but it honestly all feels wrong.

I've gone through multiple kinds of meds, currently on Wellbutrin, been in therapy (and im trying to get in again but I can't afford the expensive kind and the kind im looking into is AWFUL at returning phone calls) etc... everything seems like such a big hassle. 

I've debated for a long time posting in here- I just feel like I have nothing left to try. The only thing stopping me is the guilt I feel if I do this. My mother is a single parent, she would be devastated. But she doesn't know whats going on. I've never been comfortable talking to her about this. She didn't know about my self harming in high school (i relapsed semi-recently too) and we've still never discussed it. 

My best friend lost someone to suicide recently, so I can't bear to bring this to her...  and everyone else has something else going on. I feel like I have no one to truly confide in. 

It's hard-  but please- can someone give me ideas as to how to stop the thoughts?

The imagery in my head is so vivid. I've  also written some notes for people, but that lead me here. I realize this is dangerous territory now, but I can't commit myself anywhere either. I'm just tired, people of Reddit, I don't know what else to do.
