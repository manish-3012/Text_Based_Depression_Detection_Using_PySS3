How to commit suiecide without hurting loved ones?I have never in my life bin truly happy. i am like my mother naturally pesimistic and depressed.
therefore i want to end my life. i can't see how you could enjoy life it is nothing but a series of disapoinments and pain.
and please don`t tell me that it "isn't all that bad" or "things will get better" because i have accepted this fact that life is nothing but pain and suffering since i was around 11 or 12 and still think this is the most realistic view after 13 years.


the only problem is my friends and family that i don't want to put through the suffering. yet i dont want to continue living without purpuse, motivations or joy (except making otghers happy, i do enjoy that but it is not enough.)


so here's my question: what is the best method in witch i could take my life with as minimal emotional damage for others? what should i say in advance for example? and how can i make sure that it doesn't look like i had alot of pain upon death? (just apperance actual pain is not important just how to make it look smooth and painless)


i apologise if this post is out of order with what is normally posted this is my first time on reddit.
