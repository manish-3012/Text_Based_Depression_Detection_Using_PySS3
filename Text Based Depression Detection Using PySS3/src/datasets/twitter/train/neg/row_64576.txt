You can't do it alone, my friends...We're chained to this world, but we all gotta pull. Who says we have to do it alone? Seriously, now is the time for us to come together, and find our place in this world. If you feel its too tough to fight the battle by yourself, then why not join a greater cause?
 
Too many people die every day, lost and alone, with confusion and despair in their hearts. This can be stopped. 

The system is obviously not working for most people anymore, and a change is imminent. Why can't we be the ones to make that change? There is nothing stopping us from joining forces and healing together... as one entity.
Let me know if my words mean anything to you.

Peace.
