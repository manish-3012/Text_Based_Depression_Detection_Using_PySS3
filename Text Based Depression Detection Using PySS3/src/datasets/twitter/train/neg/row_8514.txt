Just gotta let some things outlet me not even bring the reasons why Iâ€™m crying so much right now because the reasons are absolutely pathetic but holy shit do I deserve to die


donâ€™t know who thought it would be a good idea to put me on this planet but itâ€™s very obvious I was not made to live long. I see the way Iâ€™m ignored by friends constantly or the way Iâ€™m blamed for things that arenâ€™t my fault. it seems like such a minor thing but itâ€™s eating me alive and I donâ€™t know how to stop it.

I donâ€™t even want to think about my classes for next semester. just the thought of taking classes brings me so close to ending it all. anyway :)))
