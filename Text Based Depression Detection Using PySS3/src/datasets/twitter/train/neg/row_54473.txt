is there anyone thereI'm not coping and I don't have anyone to talk to about it, would anyone be able to talk? I cry everyday and feel intrinsically without value as a person. I hate myself and I always have since childhood, it hasn't gotten better if anything how I feel about myself has gotten worse.
