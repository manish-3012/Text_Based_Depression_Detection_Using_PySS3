I'm really not ok.I've lurked hear a lot seeing peoples stories on my main I never thought I'd be at this point. I love my daughter and she's the only thing really keeping me here, but it's coming to a point where even that's not enough and I'm not ok. It sucks because this is really all over her Mom and I feel like such an idiot for letting it get here but. Here I am. My daughters in my arms now but I've never felt more empty inside. I don't know how long I can continue with this.
