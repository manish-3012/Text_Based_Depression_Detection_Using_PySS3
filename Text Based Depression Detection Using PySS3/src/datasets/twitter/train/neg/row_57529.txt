My wife is more than likely leaving me.After just over a year of marriage and nearly six years of being together, my wife has told me that she doesn't think she loves me anymore and she's not sure that she ever did. She joined Reddit and within a couple of months started sending nudes to guys who looked her selfies. I found out about all of this nearly a week and a half ago. She is my life and losing her is losing a huge piece of me. I know it is codependent but every since finding out the urges have become greater and greater. Please, I need help.
