I have never had this sort of urge before.I have never had this urge to take something across my wrist, or swallow pills, or jump off something high. I just can't take the mental anguish anymore. Everyday I wake up stressed and worry. My sleep sucks anymore and I don't have an appetite. Things I used to enjoy, I can't stand to do them for longer than 30 minutes anymore.

I've always been depressed for as long as I can remember. This just feels different though. I want it all to stop. I would turn to drugs and alcohol, but I can't even afford those. They only thing keeping me here is my family and girlfriend. If I were to do it, I can't stand to think the hurt they would go through. 

I just don't want to deal with the stress anymore. I want to sit down and not worry about something for one damn minute. I have no sexual urges anymore as a result of anxiety and depression. The outlook for my future is bleak and I feel, hopeless. I have thought of different ways to do it, and I feel like bleeding out is the most sure way and painless. Pass-out from blood-loss and my heart can't revive it's self without blood. 

Anyways thanks for taking the time to read. I know everyone has their own problems. This just feels therapeutic writing on here. I guess I need help, but I don't want to get any. whywhodo8.
