I don't know if i'm suicidal, but I don't know what to do anymore.3 months ago, My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me, telling me our relationship was terrible and it was all my fault. 

she was my one, and I just don't think I'm ever going to be happy after her. I'm going to pretty much be alone forever.

I sat in my room this week with a handful of pills and sat long and hard about just trying to overdose. I don't know what to do.

I feel like a failure in every aspect of my life, I feel like no one wants me, and I'm just so sad all the time. I'm lonely all the time. I feel worthless to everyone around me, and I just don't want to feel or think anymore. I have felt pain and sadness for a long time, but i'm really deep into this and I have been every day for the past three and a half months.

I just don't know what to do, and I'm really sorry for coming in and just bitching about my life when I don't even know what's bothering me.
