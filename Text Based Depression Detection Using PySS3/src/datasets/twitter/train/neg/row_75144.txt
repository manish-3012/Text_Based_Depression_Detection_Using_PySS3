Suicidal FriendSo me and my friends were talking last night, and somehow the topic came to some depressing stuff. One of my friends mentioned this girl (I will call her Sarah). We all know her, but no one really pays attention to her. He was talking about a talk they had in our Chemistry class. Their lab group were talking about what they did on their weekend, and my friend (Mike) said he was playing with his new butterfly knife, doing tricks and stuff. She said, "I do something like that" and showed Mike her wrists, which had obvious self-harm scars. We found out that she is kinda poor and her parents don't really care about her, as last year they forgot her birthday. Not the date, on her birthday they were clueless. Its her birthday this Friday, and we have decided to decorate her locker and talk to her because we fear she is suicidal. If we bring in school counselors, her parents will get involved and make her uncomfortable. Is this the right thing to do? Are we being stupid to assume that she is suicidal? Please let me know. Thanks.
