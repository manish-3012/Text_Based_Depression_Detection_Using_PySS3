I cant do this anymoreMy best friend doesn't care about me anymore, I cant stand to watch another person fade away into a stranger, its just the last straw on top of years of depression. I cant do this. I'm planning on killing myself, tonight, tomorrow, soon. Wont be hard. I just cant live like like anymore, I'm so desperately alone. I know that I wont be missed.
