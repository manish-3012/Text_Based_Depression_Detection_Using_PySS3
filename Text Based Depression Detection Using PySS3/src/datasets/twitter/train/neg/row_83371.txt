I don't want to die, but I can't make the thoughts go awayI've been down this road before. I'm worried that what comes next is that the thoughts start to seem appealing. Right now I know they're a symptom. I just don't know if I have it in me to fight the temptation when they start to seem more like a solution. 

I feel on the edge, like I'm watching a movie with lighting that's too bright. Every interaction I have seems bright and hard, like a light is shining on every word that's said, in an uncomfortable way. Every thought I have feels significant, and they're bouncing around. I don't really feel like I'm in control of my mind. 

I'm just tired. I'm tired, and I'm scared. I'm tired of fighting this battle and winning, just to find myself back on the battlefield again. If I know it's just going to get bad again, why should I keep fighting? I don't know.
