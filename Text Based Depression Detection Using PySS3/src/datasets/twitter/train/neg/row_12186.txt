Has anyone told their boss about their suicidal thoughts when it's revolved around work? How did you frame it? How did things go?Just talked to someone that suggested I address my depression and suicidal tendencies up-front with my boss since it all revolves around work and work-related stress.

I instantly thought of about a million ways that could backfire and put me in a worse off position but has anyone else tried this? How did it go?
