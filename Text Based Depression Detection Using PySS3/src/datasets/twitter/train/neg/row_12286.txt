Counting the daysIt's July 1st. Seven days until I finally end it all.

Some background.

Last year, my long term friend cut me out of her life, and i was alone. My life sucked. The night of July Seventh, I planned to go to the beach, cut my wrists and bleed to death in the water.

So I flipped a coin, heads, i go do it that night or tails, I wait exactly one year to see if things get better. The coin landed on tails.

That day was July seventh.

I now have one week, to prepare.

Then it's all over.

I love you all.

Goodbye.
