At the hospital for one last chance to see if my life can turn around, if not then tonight is the nightIt's been a long and hard battle with my mental health, having a physical condition has not helped things either. Every time I've tried to reach out for help I get brushed aside and told that I just have depression. But it's more than that and no one will fucking listen.

I am incapable of looking after myself, there is no food or electric at my flat and I have no friends or family other than my daughter who is the only reason I've managed to stay as long as I have. (She stays with her mother so she has food and electric don't worry).

I'm in the hospital waiting room, waiting and hoping that this time I will actually get the help that I need. If not then I think it's about time I finally pulled the trigger. I just hope that this time I attempt it I do a better job than last time and not just end up in hospital for a week again.
