I've made up my mindToday, I'll tell people that I won't send them a complete homework anymore.

Instead, if they want, I could explain things to them or help them with 2-3 topics but... No more free homework.

I'll stand up for myself, for once. I don't care if most people stop talking to me... If that's going to happen, then so be it.
