I hate my complicated fucked up lifeI'm 18 year's old and going to college next month (if I make it) my dad hasn't been working for years and he is on and off and can't keep a job for more than two weeks bc he's lazy but bitches at me bc I sit around and do nothing, I've done more than him than he has in his whole fucking pathetic life, I graduated high school with a diploma, he went to prison when he was 16 (born in '69) and got out at 22 for armed robbery and drug running two felonies
My mom works with disabled children and loves her job minus the shitty pay and wage
My grandma is 80 and somehow still going and my grandpa died in 2014
My brother (same dad different mom) shows up to my (parents) house every once in a while
And tonight is the night I'm thinking about ending it all, either by hanging my father 206 lbs fat ass from somewhere or via gunshot bc it's quick and painless
I don't know what else to do
I've been single for a year or two and can't hold a relationship bc of my personal demons (porn addict and I try to stop but I can't bc I get bored and hate myself more, drugs) I hate the constant verbal abuse from my dad and if I talk back to him I'm afraid he'll kill me or fight me and my mom takes his verbal abuse too ( he calls her a fat cunt and dares her to call the police and he'll kill us all if we do) but I'm their only son and i could give a shit less, my neighbor has a gun cabinet and he gave me his .22 for my birthday with shells I never use
Either I'm going to end my life or take my family with me
I don't care that "someone in the world cares about me" no one does and you don't know me so you don't matter to me
hopefully I can meet you in some weird afterlife
If I pussy out, I will put out a update and try to get help again
