Suicidal and can't tell anyoneI've been to the psych unit 18 times and a long term program three times and I'm only 17. Every time I seek help, 911 gets called and no help is received. My mom says she's worried she'll come home to me dead so she sends me to the hospital so they can watch me. 

The hospital does NOT help. They did some in the start, but now all the workers berate me for having been there so many times. I feel like crap about myself always and I can't tell anyone I know. I can't talk on the suicide hotline because last time I did that, the cops were over there quickly even though I just wanted to talk about it and I was carted off to the hospital. 

The rules on here say I won't be tracked via my IP address so please, please please tell me why I should live. I still enjoy things but on a lower level. I spend all my time on the internet and am attending online school. I barely have any friends and the ones I do have don't really talk to me. 

I'm so sick of therapists, doctors, and stupid psych hospital staff. Just person-to-person, what are some good things that can help me look on the brighter side? Reasons life can be better, not just "it gets better"?

Thank you.
