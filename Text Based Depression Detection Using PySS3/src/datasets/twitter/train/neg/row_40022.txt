Don't know where to go from here.I was doing a Diploma. I had jobs lined up after I finished it. I had living arrangements ready for that job. Basically I finally had my shit together for once in my life. I accidentally deleted my work when clearing up space. I don't have the money to do the course again. I don't know what else I can do. I want to die and stop leeching of my family and everyone I know. I really really want to not be here.
