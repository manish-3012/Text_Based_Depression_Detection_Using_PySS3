I want romance. I want a wedding. But no one could ever love me that way.I know this is ridiculous. It seems everyone has been having dream weddings lately, and theyâ€™re always such beautiful people. Iâ€™m jealous. It makes me feel like life just isnâ€™t worth it.

It feels impossible that Iâ€™ll ever fall in love and get married with the right person.

My boyfriend is an asshole and doesnâ€™t have an ounce of empathy/selflessness, and itâ€™s been bringing me down horribly.

He never takes me out on dates. He never says anything encouraging. He never does anything romantic for me.

Will I ever have it? Why do I want to have a romantic relationship, filled with love and care so much? Why do I want the flowers? Why do I want to hold hands? Why do I want all these couple-y things?

But itâ€™s unobtainable. Iâ€™ve never been interested in anyone that asks me out, except for my current boyfriend, but the honeymoon phase is over, and now heâ€™s showing his true colors of being an apathetic, unmotivated, bitter jerk.

I used to think he was perfect. We had so much fun, and he would do those romantic things for me. But itâ€™s just â€œnot himâ€, and that was only a side effect of the honeymoon phase.

Maybe Iâ€™m speaking out of emotion right now.

I canâ€™t relate to the rest of society. I feel too deep. Iâ€™m fragile. People only ask me out because Iâ€™m decent looking. Iâ€™m a pushover. I care too much. Iâ€™ve always gone above and beyond for the people I love. 

No one will ever love me to that extent.
