I'm tiredI'm tired. I'm just so tired of feeling like this. I hate having to put on the mask of normalcy every morning to act like I'm fine. To push myself to laugh and be happy during the right situations. I'm alienated and alone. I hate myself more than I ever have. If I had a 100% sure way of getting out right now I would. I don't have access to it though. Most of the methods I do have access to would result in failure, just resulting in more hospital time, more people noticing, more people faking caring, more attention to a problem that I should be able to handle myself.

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to all those that love me or may have loved me, but this is getting incredibly difficult. The greatest thing I am looking forward to is the day when everyone alive has no recollection that I ever existed.
