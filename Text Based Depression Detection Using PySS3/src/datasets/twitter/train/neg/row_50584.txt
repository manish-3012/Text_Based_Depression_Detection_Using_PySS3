I sat and stared at pills for an hour.I honestly wanted to do it, there's no motivation in my life anymore, I lost the my abusive gf, who has treated me like shit cause she called me insane for being depressed and wanting to die, even though she caused me to cut and never cared and she knew, she broke 10000s of promises atleast one a day and not kidding she lied once a day but she was still the reason I got up in the morning, I know you will all say that wasn't love, but I loved her, no matter what I loved her, and I wanted to die before her and now do more then ever, I hate how I look I hate everything about myself, I honestly don't know if I can do this anymore it's been like this for years on end
