Writing my suicide noteI started writing my suicide note tonight. The only thing is I doubt Iâ€™m actually going to do anything for a while because Iâ€™m really bad at making big decisions, but its making me feel like a fake and like Iâ€™m only doing it for attention. And then that makes me feel even worse. I really want to die but I donâ€™t wanna DIE you know? Itâ€™s just a lot right now and Iâ€™m in the mood to vent but I donâ€™t really have anyone to vent to so I figured Iâ€™d just get this off of my chest here.
