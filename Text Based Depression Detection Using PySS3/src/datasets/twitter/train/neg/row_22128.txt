Iâ€™m feeling like ending itAll I do with my time is play video games and my dream is to go big and be a pro but every single video game I play Iâ€™m average or below average. I play so much and dump so many hours into video games and Iâ€™m still just a joke. I tell myself that itâ€™s just because of bad teammates, or bad ranking system. But I really just suck. I have no friends. No one texts me first. Iâ€™m all alone. My whole entire life has been a waste
