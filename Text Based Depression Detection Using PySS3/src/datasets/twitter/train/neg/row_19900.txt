Just have to vent, and this seems like a nice place...Sorry for the broken english...
So yeah my girlfriend dumped me 3 months ago... we've been together for 6years and half... went through what normal couples go through, good, bad, ugly and beautiful... I've been a dick and it's all my fault... I've made a promise to myself when we started... I would never let any girl break my heart ever again... For 5 years...5 fucking years I didn't care, I loved her and I still do, I just kept a certain distance... but for the last year and a half, it's been pretty clear to me, even for her, that we would have kids together, grow old together... We even spoke about it the day before she left me... For the past year and a half, I tried, I tried so fucking hard to be what she wanted me to be...She felt it was fake, but it wasn't... She has been so fucking nice to me the first five years that I wanted to show her, but I'm good at screwing things up. She went back to university, so we moved to her parent's place, I went back to finish high school (yeah I know...) And I'm starting university soon, but i'll do it from home (I don't know what's the name for it in english, i'm too lazy to google). So yeah fastforward 3 months ago... She called me late in the afternoon, told me we had to talk... I knew it, I enjoyed every seconds every single breath before she arrived, I knew a shitstorm was comming, I just didn't know it was going to be this big... Basically, we didn't had a lot of things in common, but what we had, was ours... She realised i would never change enough to be what she wanted me to be, felt bad about asking me all these things... Just the usual breakup bullshit. So I took a couple of things, my backpack and left the house. I walked for like an hour or so, found a phone and called an old friend of mine to pick me up. I stayed at her appartement for like 2 weeks, long story short I had to work close to her place and I didn't had a car... So as soon as I got there I called my dad... ( I'm 26 and I found him when I was around 18, he didn't know he had a child) I explained him what happened, I asked him if I could come to his place, since I had nowhere to go. He said yes... He fucking said yes... I bursted into tears. Fastforward to now. So i've been there for 2 months and a half, he lives like an hour away from the city, nice and cozy house in the country. I'm working 2 jobs friday, saturday and sunday nights, for a total of 30hours, and tuesday ,wednesday and thursday during the day for a total of 24 hours. I guess being overworked saved my life, but i'm tired, i'm not thinking about her really, but I keep having these fucking dreams where she's there, dumping me all over again. I just can't take it anymore. She made alot of new friends in school but for me, all of my friends became her friends during the years, I haven't really made any new friends. So now they have to share time between us... Holidays fucking sucked... But I only kept like 2 close friends all those years, they are now good friends with her... I've been trying to make friends since she left me, but I find it hard to relate to people, I'm having a hard time finding people's qualities and I keep seing things that pisses me off. So I basically had 4 people on a christmas party I made at my place, 2 of them didn't really wanted to be there and left like an hour after they arrived. I even had a crush on a girl for the past month, turns out she's a mess. It didn't work out.
* I'm a burden for my father
* I have no close friends that I can share how bad I feel
* I work all the time so I have no time to meet new people (and when I know I can't stand them)
* Every moment alone feel like my head is going to explode
*Seriously thinking about getting the car in the garage, taking sleeping pills, wait for them to kick in, start the car and sleep peacefully.

I know that by doing so I would make my family, or what's left of it, sad. But It's either them or me, that would be a selfish move, but they would get over it, I lost the reason I lived for. I won't change anything  in this world, or at least not something significant. I'm too tired to start everything over with someone new, you were the one and still is...just fucking come back...j'taime caliss
