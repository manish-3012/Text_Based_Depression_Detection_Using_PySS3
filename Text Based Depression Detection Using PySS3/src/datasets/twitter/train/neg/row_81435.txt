doing it soonim so tired of being myself that its makeing me sixk. my mind cut off any connection i had with my best feiends. i loved them. they made me happy and my mind doesnt even view them as people but strangers. i hate my npd. i hate being like this i hate myself more than anything and its so disgusting how i cant do anything about it other than cry. i miss people that are still in my life. and im just going to end up hurting them even more by killing myself. or maybe not. everyone says people like me dont deserve to live. i now realize why i dont. using people to make myself happy then when something happens in my life and they cant be there to comfort me all of the time and have expectations of me i detach. i loved these people more than anythng. one of them was my best friend of 10 years. and its gone. because ofmmy mental illness. i cant wait to be free of this hell. im going to the store to buy some random otc pills and try to overdose. if it doesnt work or i wake up alive at least ill be in the hospital. i like hospirals but ill still be alive. im even scared of dying. i dont want to die but i dont want to be me. so goodbye i guess. 

and if you two read this i love you. deep down i love you more than anything and am so grateful i met you both. im so sorry i couodntt be a better friend. im so sory for hurting you like this. im sorry that im so disgusting and awful. if i was normal i couldve been so much better but im not. and i wouldve never been. you deserve all of the love and kindness in the world that i wasnt able to give you. i'm sorry. please dont give up. please keep living. im sorry that i was such a failure.
