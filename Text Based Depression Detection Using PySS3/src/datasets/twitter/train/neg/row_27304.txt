Friend showing odd behaviorI have a friend that is showing some odd, risky behavior. He is also posting openly about thoughts on suicide on social media sites saying things like, "they always say they never saw it coming  lol" or "almost hit a truck. damn, gotta do better next time." I'm not sure what to do. He doesn't like talking about his own feelings. One of his other friends reached out to me about it and kind of confirmed some thoughts I was having. And I talked to another friend we both have and he said he was concerned too. How can we help him?
