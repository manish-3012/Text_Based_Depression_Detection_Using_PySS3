Some people won't kill themselves because of their parents/family, but i want to kill myself because of mineThe "think of your parents after you're gone" line just makes me fucking furious. I'm in my 20s. If you had a horrible relationship with your parents in your younger years, not the normal teenage angsty one where you have disagreements every now and then, it DOESN'T GET BETTER. IT JUST GETS A MILLION TIMES WORSE. God, seeing or even thinking about my own mother just fills me with rage.
