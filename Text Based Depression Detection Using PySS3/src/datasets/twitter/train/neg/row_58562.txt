I just told my friend that I want to die and she left me on readMy family and my friends wouldn't even care if I was gone. I called my mother to tell her that I was having a bad depressive episode and she told me that she wish that "for once" we didn't have to talk about my feelings. I guess I should start thinking up a plan at this point.
