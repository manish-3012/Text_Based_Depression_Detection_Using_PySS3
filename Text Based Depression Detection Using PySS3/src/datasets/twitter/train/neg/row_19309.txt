I've been feeling extremely overwhelmed, and I can't really stand it right nowI think I've been experiencing anxiety attacks? I'm not sure. I've just been really overwhelmed. I can't stop thinking about my (abusive) father. I can't stop focusing on several different events. I can't stop feeling bad about how I make my friends feel. I can't stop thinking. 

I want to bleed a lot, honestly I don't care if it kills me. I just want to focus on something else. Hurting myself makes me feel better. It numbs me for a while. I already relapsed recently, so its not like I'm ruining some clean streak. I want to bleed so much
