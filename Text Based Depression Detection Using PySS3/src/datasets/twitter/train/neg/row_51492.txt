This pain will never stopI don't want to die, but I'm running out of options. I feel caged by life, suffocating. No one wants to help. I've tried so hard to reach out. My family has their claws in me, draining me of any will to live I had left. All my "friends" abandoned me. Death seems to be the only way to escape this living hell. 

I don't want to die, but I'd rather end it while there is still something left of me; before they destroy what little part of me remains.
