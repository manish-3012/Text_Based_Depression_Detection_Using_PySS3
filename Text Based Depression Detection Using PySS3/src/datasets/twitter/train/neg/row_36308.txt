Have a friend who wants to kill himself, any advice?A friend of mine has been on constant suicide watch for about two years now. I don't want to get into his personal details, but he made an error at his job that cost someone their life, and lost his license and job as a result. That's not why he's suicidal though, he's depressed constantly because of the loss of his job and is suing the company, so it's very hard to have sympathy sometimes. I think his underlying depression issues caused the original "mistake."

He lives with his much older mother and says that if she dies, he'll kill himself without calling. He says if he hears he's never getting his license back, he'll kill himself. He took a whole bottle of pills before. I called the police that day when I didn't hear from him and had them check. He has no idea it was me. A lot of us think he doesn't really want to die and just wants attention, or he'd take more drastic measures, but it's hard to know. He acts very immature and childlike most of the time, and when a close friend of his died suddenly this past week, he constantly says he's jealous of the friend instead of feeling bad for his family. I don't know what to really do, I love the guy but he's to talk to a lot of the time. 

If his problem was guilt for what he did I could help him past it, but it seems like he has zero remorse. I have depression and my own struggles and always try to stay upbeat for him, but he doesn't want to hear anything I have to offer, just wants to kind of complain and mope. Anyway just thought I'd throw this all out there.
