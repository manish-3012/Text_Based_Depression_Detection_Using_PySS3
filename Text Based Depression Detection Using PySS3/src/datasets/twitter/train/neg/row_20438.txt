I dont think I can make itHi,I'm pretty sure I'm going crazy. My life is slipping me by, I'm unmotivated and so tired to do anything. I feel so stupid and so weak every day. Sleeping never happens, and when it does my dreams are full of anxiety. I'm not going to do it today, I'm not going to do it tomorrow,next week or the week after that. But I don't know about next month, or 5 months, or next year or five years from now. I dont know if I'm deteriorating or not. I care about the impact my suicide could have. I don't know how much longer I will how ever
