Existing is painfulI don't know what I'm doing in this world, I'm barely existing, can't call what I'm doing living.

I'm just seeing the days passing by waiting for my inevitable, and hopefully soon, death.

This time of year is worse because being away from my family is painful, but I think it would be probably painful as well if we were together.

My life feels like a cruel joke, like God is some sadist playing around with me. I just wish I never existed at all, that some better person was born in my place.

Last year I tried to kill myself, usually it's hard but I keep going, I'm not sure how long I'll be able to hold myself together anymore...

Hope death comes to me soon, quick and painless if possible.
