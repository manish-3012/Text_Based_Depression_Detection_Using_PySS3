Please someone talk to me.I will not be graduating college this year. Again. This is the second time i've had my hopes up of graduating. It feels so horrible. I tried my hardest and it wasn't enough. I feel so horrible. I wanted this to be a present to my mother. I just wanted her to be happy. 


Last night I gathered my Mother's pills. I cried on my bed and couldn't do it.

Today I stood inside my room and made a noose on my window. I stood on top of a computer chair to easily push away. I stood with that home made noose around my neck and just cried. It all felt unreal and yet I could feel it enough to confirm it was around my neck. It's still tied to my window. And the pills are still around. Please help me.
