Eviction papers finally served. No help coming.The beginning of the end is finally here. Took a little longer than I thought it would, but I was finally served with eviction papers yesterday (same day I had an interview for a job I'm pretty sure I'm not going to get).  I have about a week before the sheriff comes to throw me out.  

A while back I promised God that I wouldn't kill myself even if I had to lose my home, but I'm no longer sure I can keep that promise.  I'm about to lose everything.  Not really seeing anything to live for.  No, I have no family to turn to and the only "friends" I know in real life aren't willing to take me in off the street.  I guess I'm lucky that I have a car I can sleep in, but that's it.

What is the point?
