F datI'm reading other people's stories here. I can relate. I'm having serious breakdowns atm. I do have PTSD and perhaps BPD. I used to think my go to point is to do suicide but I've come to a point where f dat. Imma show them. 

I've been living alone as a single woman. When I was 10, my parents decided to send me overseas alone. It was not a pleasant experience. I was frequently called the stupid American because of cultural differences and being illiterate to their language. My parents then had another child, which I then had to take care. So getting bullied then go home to take care of a baby was not enjoyable for a 11 year old. Came back to the US, and got bullied again for being a "foreigner". One classmate said I didn't deserve anything. 

I was raped 3x. Once a group of two men drugged me. Another time I finished a long day of studying, didn't eat anything, went to meet a date, had one drink and got taken advantage without consent. Every men I meet just wants to have sex. I have so much hate towards them that I feel being alone will prevent unwanted situation. Going out just seems to call for unwanted attention. 

I don't see my parents often. I'd say in aggregate, I saw my dad 5 years out of my 30 years in life. I change friends quickly. Sometimes I breakdown. I feel like people see me as this weirdo and can't relate. Sometimes I wonder why do I even have a cell phone for?

I've probably received 5000 rejection employment letters. Granted, I was applying to these highly quantitative jobs but after 5000 rejections, I finally found a posting that just wanted an algorithm submission that relates to the job. Guess what? I won against several top engineering schools. At the end of the day, suicide isn't the best. What's best is being able to give a middle finger and I can't do that if I die.
