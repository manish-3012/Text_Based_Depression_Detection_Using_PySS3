Itâ€™s my 17th birthday and Iâ€™m drinking aloneGot diagnosed with clinical depression a few months ago. The pills helped for a little bit but itâ€™s just back to the same shit. Wanted to ask this girl out but today I finally realized sheâ€™s got no interest in me. At least I donâ€™t feel nervous about asking her out anymore. Been trying to change myself for the better, daily exercise, better eating, no more alcohol, taking care of myself, but it just doesnâ€™t help. I canâ€™t concentrate on anything anymore so I just do whatever I can to avoid my emotions. I used to use music to escape but now I need liquor. I just want someone to care about me
