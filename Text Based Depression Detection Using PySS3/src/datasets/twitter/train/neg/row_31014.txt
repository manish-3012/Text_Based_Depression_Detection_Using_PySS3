I'm feeling good (but like a good you guys probably wouldn't approve of)I just wanted to chime in here real quick maybe the last time hopefully just share some thoughts. 

So tonight would be a real good day to kill myself, I have pretty much everything in place, a nice last meal, a friend of mine died today, and I picked up my "means to an end" if you will. It just feels so relieving not to have to do shit anymore, or not so much that but to not have responsibility for it. I am real glad to be over with thinking that I'm bad for being suicidal for the selfishness. I forgot a long time ago I concluded everything was selfish or at least self helping in one way or another. 

This is kinda the best day I have had for months. I've been laughing for real at dark death jokes and they aren't even like maniac me not understanding why I am laughing.  
I Think I was going to say more, but I've forgotten. I am not killing myself tonight no matter the preparedness. I got a couple things to write for people and it would be dramatic and meh. Just wanted to say stuff.
