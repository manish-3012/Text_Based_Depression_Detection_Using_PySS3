Help, pleaseI don't know what's wrong with me. I'm only 17 and I feel like an absolute shell of a person. On paper I have everything. Private school, wealthy family, varsity hockey player, goes to parties frequently, social at school, but honestly I feel like theres no meaning to anything. I have been so blessed and yet I still feel empty and alone. I feel selfish that I have been given everything I've ever wanted and still feel low. All of my friends and kids at school like me for what they see, nobody wants to see this side of me though. What the hell is wrong with me that I still feel empty when I have everything I could ever want. I just want to disapear, I don't want to burden anyone with finding me, I just want to leave quietly. I'm only 17 and i already feel this way, why not save myself a lifetime of this by just going to sleep tonight and not waking up
