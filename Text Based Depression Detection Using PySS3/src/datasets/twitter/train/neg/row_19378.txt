How would i get through if Someone i loved committed Suicide?My girlfriend has depression and anxiety and i think she might commit suicide since she told me before that she's trying not to commit suicide and she's been having the worst week because she has been bullied and ignored and cutting herself, I had some dreams about 2 weeks ago that came true last week and this week i have been dreaming of the same thing which is my girlfriend committing suicide and its really bad and makes me sad + making me wanna cut myself. I also told myself that if she does commit suicide then im gonna commit suicide
