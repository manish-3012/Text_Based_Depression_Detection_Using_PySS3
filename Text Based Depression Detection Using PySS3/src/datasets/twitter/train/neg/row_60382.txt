I can't function in this worldI just can't fucking handle it. The bureaucracy of fucking everything. To do any job, however "basic", it seems like you need fucking two years of experience or more. Even trying to make a CV is a complete fucking nightmare and basically impossible for me. I can't hold a real conversation with anyone. I can barely form my own fucking opinions. I'm just a complete empty worthless loss of a person. And I only fucking feel this way because of the world and the way it works. Only recently have I found my hand actually being forced with regards to trying to do something with my life that actually makes money. But when not doing anything with it, just staying in my room and reading, playing music, listening to music, gaming, watching youtube, whatever, I can be happy. I enjoy things. But I don't have what it takes to make money in any conceivable way. I'm convinced of it. I don't have any "skills". I can't play the game. I can't even make art because I never honed any talent like that. 

This is technically one of the least brutal eras of human history but I still feel like some kind of alien species not intended to function in the world as it exists. God knows what I'd have been like in some of those earlier eras, probably just dead as a child or something, but in any case I can't handle this one.
