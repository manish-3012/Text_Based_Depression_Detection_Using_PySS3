I have no oneNo one who is in my corner to help me. I currently live alone and I know if I commit myself my nparents are going to want to dictate the care I get and I don't want them to at all. They will want the docs to medicate the hell out of me and make me compliant with their demands. They don't give two shits about me. All they give a damn about is how much it will cost and cheap out. I have no one I should just end it before they destroy my sense of self well what little I have at any rate
