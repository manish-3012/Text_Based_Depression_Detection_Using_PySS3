My friend is in the hospital right now for a suicide attemptAs the title says a friend of mine tried to kill herself earlier tonight, fortunately the sleeping pills didn't take effect and she survived. I'm wondering what the best thing to say to her or how to approach the issue. So far I've tried to treat her as I normally do, and tell her that I do care about her as a friend. What are some things I should or should not say? What should I do or not do? What are absolute no-nos? I get that this varies from person to person, but I don't have much experience with this at all so I need advice. 

Some things to know: she lives &gt; 300 miles away so I can't communicate face to face, and I don't know the exact circumstances or reasons she had to attempt suicide (I have told her I'd only ask her about it if she felt comfortable talking about it).
