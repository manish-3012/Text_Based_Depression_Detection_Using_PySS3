Is Anyone Else Chronically Bored?Basically just the title. Iâ€™m type 2 bipolar but this probably isnâ€™t an affect from it. With the depression I can justify it with me being depressed, although whenever Iâ€™m manic itâ€™s quite clearly not normal. Energy with a purpose is a *lot* different then being bored but also not able to sit still, so, before i go off on more of a tangent than i already have, does this happen to anyone else?
