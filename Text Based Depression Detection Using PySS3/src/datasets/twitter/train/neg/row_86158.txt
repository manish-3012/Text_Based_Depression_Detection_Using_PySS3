Iâ€™ll never be happyIâ€™ve had the urge to die since as long as I can remember I canâ€™t take much more I have nobody to talk to no friends and I just keep everything bottled up inside me Iâ€™m so nice to other people but nobody seems to like me I know deep down my dad hates me and if it werenâ€™t for my mother Iâ€™d have died by now sometimes I wish I was killed accidentally actually I do just all the time.,, I m so close Iâ€™m ready to leave this world I canâ€™t stop crying I just I donâ€™t want to live please I just want to be happy please
