The loneliness is killing me slowlyThrowaway because I donâ€™t want to be exposed to people who know my handle.

For the last 5 years, Iâ€™ve worked two jobs with 50+ hours a week. A lot of days were double shifts. Iâ€™d start at 3am and get off at 4pm. I only had one day off a week.I didnâ€™t have a lot of time to hangout with friends. My boyfriend (now fiancÃ©) and I barely had time for our relationship. I was exhausted and felt lonely.

I wanted to hangout with friends. I wanted to go on date nights with my boyfriend. I wanted to play my favorite video game all day or get lost in my favorite book. I had dreamed of having enough time to dedicate to following my dream of becoming a photographer. But, my life revolves around work and I literally did not have enough time in the day.

Since COVID hit, a lot of things have changed. I lost my full time job (the money maker) and my hours were reduced at my second job. I have never had this much free time in my 31 years of life. I did get to play my favorite video games all day. I did get to pick up a book and get lost in the story. I even picked up my camera, started a website and began my photography journey - which has been doing well. But, I feel more lonely than I did when I didnâ€™t have enough time in the day. And I donâ€™t know why. 

Maybe itâ€™s the break in my daily routine thatâ€™s taking a toll on me. Maybe itâ€™s the fact that even though I have a lot of extra time, thereâ€™s nothing to really do social wise since Covid has everything on lockdown. Iâ€™m the sort of person that needs consistency in their life and I donâ€™t have it at this point in time.

I thought I would be happy to have free time. But it has made even the simplest of tasks hard to overcome. Itâ€™s hard to get out of bed in the morning. My favorite games and reading do not spark joy. It is hard to exist right now. When my fiancÃ© and I go to bed I have never felt more lonely. I feel as if thereâ€™s a weight on my shoulders and itâ€™s holding me down every day.

I think the exhaustion over the last 5 years of my life has clouded that feeling of letting go, if that makes sense in any way. My heart hurts a lot these days. Thereâ€™s a dull ache in my chest every minute of every day. I just want to feel whole again.
