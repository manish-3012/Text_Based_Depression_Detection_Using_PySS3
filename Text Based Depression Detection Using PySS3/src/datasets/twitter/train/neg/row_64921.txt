Why am I like this?I keep having these thoughts of suicide and I canâ€™t seem to stop them. I keep thinking how easy it would be if my life was just over. Leaving everything behind, my soon to be ex-wife, my kids who could have a much better Dad, my parents and family who take me for granted and look at me as a child. Iâ€™m so pathetic, I hate myself so God damned much. I canâ€™t stop it, I just want to change and be different. I want to stop feeling depressed, anxious, and weak. I want to stop feeling like such a burden. I want to stop feeling like my life has no value and I canâ€™t change that. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m so scarred of everything that Iâ€™m laying here because itâ€™s holding me doe like a heavy weight. I donâ€™t know who I am, I thought I did but it turns out it was just what others expected me to be, or do I thought. Iâ€™m ready to disappear. Itâ€™s selfish but Iâ€™m ready to leave it all behind. I canâ€™t live. I canâ€™t change. I feel like I never will and Iâ€™ll be this fat slob version of me forever, so whatâ€™s the point? 
Some people might say that my kids would be a good reason. I know that they love me but itâ€™s only a matter of time before I mess up their lives and disappoint them too. I never thought my life would be like this at 26.
