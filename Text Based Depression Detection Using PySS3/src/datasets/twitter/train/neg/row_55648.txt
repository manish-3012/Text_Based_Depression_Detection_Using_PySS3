At this point it seems like my only way out.Back to living with my parents again. Back to not being able to open doors or talk at night. Back to not being able to drive anywhere or see anyone. 
Only this time it seems like there really is only one way out. 
I donâ€™t make enough money to move out and I canâ€™t seem to pass any of my classes anymore. I have no skills and no capacity to improve my life, everything that I want just seems so far out of reach that I feel like all I can do is end it now.
