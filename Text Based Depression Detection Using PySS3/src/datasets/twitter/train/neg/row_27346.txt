I was fine this morning..no, I was fine a few hours ago. Then small problems started arising, my mind couldn't stop thinking, I started seeing blocked roads and ways with no escape at all. I felt the sudden need to cry. I felt confused, the tiny problems became disasters and my whole life seemed like a catastrophe my whole life felt wasted. Tears became too much to hold, my heart started aching more. Sadness filled my heart and suicidal thoughts filled my mind. I'm sick of crying myself to sleep, it always happens like this and I have no way to counter it... ever since childhood depression has been chasing me. feels like what I wrote is a mess..
