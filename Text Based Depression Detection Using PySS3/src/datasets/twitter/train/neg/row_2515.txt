im nearly 30 years old and I have never had a partnerim a woman. once upon a time I had a very beautiful face. I had an argument with my mom and that made me shave my head, my very long thick hair is gone now.
Im getting old and my chance for marriage is declining.

Im from a very traditional family and I kept my virginity. I was very talented ,I learnt several language( intermediate level.)

after concussion due to physical abuse of my family members my mind doesnt work as before.
I had attempted suicide several times in the past. I dont want to live anymore.

Im from Iran,I wish someone could take me somewhere else away from this hell since I dont have any place of my own, I dont have any friend. 

my parents never understand me,always out the blame on me while I always tried to be a good! girl. what a fool I was, always avoided romantic situations because i wanted to be a good! girl an to save myself for marriage.
