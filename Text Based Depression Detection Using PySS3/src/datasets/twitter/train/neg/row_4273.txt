A Note In Case I DecideIâ€™m sorry. 
Iâ€™m sorry that I wasnâ€™t strong enough to do this by myself. I was surrounded by people, by family and my therapist and doctor and they love me. I know so. But sometimes, love just isnâ€™t enough.

I know that my asking for help stresses those around me. Especially my boyfriend. And I know eventually heâ€™ll get tired of my need for support and move on to somebody prettier, smarter and more independent. He really does deserve it. Heâ€™s so smart, funny and handsome. He deserves someone better than me. 

I understand that Iâ€™m going to cause pain. I really do apologize. My intent in this life or after was never to hurt anybody. I just always wanted to be seen. I wanted my parents to love me. I wanted boys to love me. And in the midst, it was so difficult for me to love me. The pain I wake up with and sleep with everyday weighs on my chest like a tangible entity. I donâ€™t want to hurt you but I canâ€™t stand feeling trapped anymore.
