Anyone experience this?I'm not suicidal in the sense that I want to kill myself, but I am depressed. I don't want to die, but sometimes I think about how much easier it would be to just vanish you know? I feel like this is common but I'm tired of having it stay in my head and I just wanted to get it out there...
