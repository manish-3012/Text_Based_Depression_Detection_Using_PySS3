DoneI can't take this constant abuse anymore. Everybody in my life is either against me or trying to manipulate me. My "friends" act like they're above me and can control any aspect of my life, even when I detach from them completely, and I'm constantly being harassed and psychologically abused by the places I go to seek help. I'm in constant pain and I don't even have enough money to afford my pain medication. No one believes me about being in pain despite a medical record the size of the fucking bible. I'm so fucking done. I am being constantly mentally, psychologically and emotionally abused every single day and no one gives a fuck, even when I reach out for help. I want to fucking die
