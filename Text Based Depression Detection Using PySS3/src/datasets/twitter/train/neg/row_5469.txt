Noose's are Suprisingly Easy to TieI learnt how to tie a noose yesterday and today my girlfriend and I found an apartment for July. Too bad I'll kill myself before we get there. Too bad I can't stop crying all the time. Too bad I can't stop cutting myself. Too bad I can't feel better. Thankfully noose's are surprisingly easy to tie.
