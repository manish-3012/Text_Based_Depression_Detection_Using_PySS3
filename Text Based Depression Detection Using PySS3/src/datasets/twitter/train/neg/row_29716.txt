A letter for anyone who knows meIf I ever end my life, know it wasn't a sudden snap decision. If you're shocked, somehow, I'll be disappointed. If I even can be, who even knows. I mean, I wouldn't exist. But, if I had the ability to be... Fuck, I'd be disappointed. I've spent years upon years questioning my existence. Why am i here? Why am I STILL here? STILL!? Why do I have to struggle everyday to just BE? I don't know and I'll never be able to answer the never ending questions. What I do know is, I have a tipping point, I have layers to get through and once they run out, it's time. I went sour long ago and I'm just decomposing from the inside out. Humour only takes you so far. It all comes to that inevitable tipping point. I'm not there yet but, don't be surprised. Just pretend I have cancer. Some people live for a month, years, decades. Although most of the time, it comes for you. Not always, sure, but usually treatment options run dry. Some people can't be saved. Some people can. The way I see it, it's better me than anyone else as that statistic. Now? No. But one day, hopefully, I can finally rid myself of that ridiculous instinctual will to live. Why is it there? Because humans, even ones who wish they were dead, would fight tooth and nail to survive...because it's what we do. Even suicidal people look behind them on a dark pathway, worried they'll be attacked or killed. I don't understand it either. Maybe it needs to be on my terms. I don't know.
