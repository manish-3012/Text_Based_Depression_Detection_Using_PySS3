How to create a life thatâ€™s bearable???Weâ€™ve all head the common trope â€œpeople want to commit suicide because they want to end their PAIN, not their LIVESâ€. 

Okay well yeah maybe.... but thereâ€™s no good way to live for someone like me. Holding a job feels impossible because my â€œbad daysâ€ are unpredictable and I canâ€™t be calling off work every time I have panic or Iâ€™m too depressed to move. 

Iâ€™ve been suicidally depressed for 10 years. Meds donâ€™t help, therapy doesnâ€™t help, hospitals donâ€™t help. This is who I am. IF I could create a simple and comfortable life by living off disability, I would DO IT. But the sad truth is that disability isnâ€™t enough to live off of. Iâ€™d lose my car, my credit would go to shit, Iâ€™d never be independent again. 

The sad truth is that money is freedom in our society. Iâ€™m not well enough to make money. So it feels sort of like natural selection. I canâ€™t burden others with taking care of me. 

Suicidal is quite literally the only option. I genuinely REGRET not going through with it when I had morphine available. The only thing the past few years have brought me is more pain and suffering.

Iâ€™m smart enough to know that the older I get, the worse it will get. I just canâ€™t wait for a good opportunity to end it all. I wasnâ€™t cut out for this world and Iâ€™ve accepted it. Itâ€™s sad that if it were possible, Iâ€™d give life a chance. But itâ€™s not possible. Not for someone like me. 

Recovery wonâ€™t ever happen, and misery is certain should I embrace poverty. I guess this is just me realizing there really isnâ€™t a better way.
