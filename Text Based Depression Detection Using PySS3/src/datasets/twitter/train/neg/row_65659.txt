I wanna die but thereâ€™s so much I havenâ€™t done yetI seriously do wanna end it. No one reading this has to worry bc Iâ€™m not doing it tonight or anything, Iâ€™m just sad about everything Iâ€™ve missed out on. If I had a fulfilling teenage life I know damn well Iâ€™d be satisfied enough to end it. Or maybe if I was given a real teenage life/childhood I wouldnâ€™t feel the need to end it, who could say. I could forget all the big stereotypical things like having a girlfriend or a nice job blah blah. Bitch I simply want someone to hold me. I guess thatâ€™s too much to ask for from a girl like me? I wish someone would hold me and tell me my life has meaning is all :( Iâ€™m sure you guys here can relate lol
