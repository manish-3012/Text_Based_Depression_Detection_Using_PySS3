Been considering suicide since 3rd gradeHi everyone, 

I have been considering ending my life ever since 3rd grade. I know thatâ€™s a very young age, but itâ€™s something that I have been considering every day since then. I wish I was kidding when I say that I think about it every morning. (Why 3td grade? Idk, thatâ€™s at least how far ago I can remember) 

I donâ€™t know exactly why I have never done it per say. There were a close times when I almost did, but the thoughts about my family and my religion came to mind then. I have been much less religious than I was then, but I still havenâ€™t done it.

I tried seeking help at my University a few years ago. The Psychologist straight up told me that I wasnâ€™t suicidal and that â€œ I (she) wasnâ€™t worried about me.â€ I was kinda shock, but also left me wondering.

Is this shit even normal? Sometimes it just puts me in a mood where I donâ€™t care about anything. Comes in my way of doing work, eating properly, and being productive. 

This is the first time I ever share this to anyone besides the psychologist.
