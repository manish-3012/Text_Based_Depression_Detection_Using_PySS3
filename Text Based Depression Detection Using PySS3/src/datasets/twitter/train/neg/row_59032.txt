i feel like my life is going no whereso i just turned 18 today i fell like i did noting with my life and noting will change.

as i said before im 18 but dont even have my high school diploma cuz my greedy ass father wasted my school money on something else(his work pays for the school fees but he wasted it on something else,and i forget to mention i didn't see him till 6 years ago cuz he didnt want to see me and yeah he divorced my mom) so because he wasted the money  im staying at home doing not.he keeps asking me to find a uni but i cant cuz i dont have a high school diploma,and every time i ask him to pay for the it he keeps ignoring or i will pay for it later, it has been almost 1 year with same bs. and if tell to find a job an pay for it myself  its 5k dollars and i cant find a job cuz its really competitive where i live and they wont hire and 18 year old guy. for everyone who thinks my father doesn't have the money he just paid for 2 wedding of my brother and sister and he choose the most expensive stuff so he will look better then other people and have face, cuz of this and more stuff he did to me i fell like i wasted my life for noting,and don't know what to do with myself
