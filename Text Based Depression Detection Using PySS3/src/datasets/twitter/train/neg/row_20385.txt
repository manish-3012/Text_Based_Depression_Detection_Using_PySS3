I need guidance.I'm 20 years old. Working most days. I live with my mother who is currently up for disability trial. But being the only one working is starting to drag me down in life. And my dad that lives in a different state has stage 4 prostate cancer. And my family is basically non existent. And we're being forced to move. I don't wanna kill myself but recently it's just becoming to much for me to handle. I have a beautiful girlfriend and she has 2 beautiful kids. And I don't wanna lose them. Or my mother. And I truly wish I could find a mentor or someone to help me through this...
