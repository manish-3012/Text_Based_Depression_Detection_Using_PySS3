I wanna give up.I wanna die. 

I wanna die. Or just completely give up. 

I can't take it anymore. I'm sick of things going wrong. I'm sick of being the bad guy. Sick of never catching a break. 

Sick of seeing other pepoe get away with fucked up shit, but if I do it it'd be a problem. Sick of being punished for calling them out on it, but they'd be praised if they do it. 

Sick of always being punished for everything I do. Sick of always being wrong. Sick of always being blamed. It's always me. It's always my fault. 

I'm always the shitty person. 

I can't take any of it anymore I'm so tired. 

I've been tired for weeks now. And every day it gets worse. 

I can't catch a break. I'm so ducking tired.

I don't know what to do anymore.

I can't take it.

I'm home alone. Maybe it's a sign. 

But I dunno what to do.

I can't take it.

I just can't.
