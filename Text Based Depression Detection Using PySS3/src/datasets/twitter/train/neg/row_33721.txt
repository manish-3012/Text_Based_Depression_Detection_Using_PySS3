I'm sick of it all.I opened up to my friends about how I feel months ago and they shrugged it off.

Every day after that, I try asking for help but everyone fucking ignores me.

I said my goodbyes once and all the fucking sudden everyone wants to "help."

Everyone told me the same fucking thing. I should seek help.

Easy for them to fucking say, most of my friends have the fucking money to do so.

They told me to think about my loved ones. I don't have any fucking loved ones.

They told me "Things get better."

Months pass and everyone still fucking ignores me.

I say goodbye again and I meant it and no one took me seriously.

Hell, someone told me that I'm just faking it all for fucking attention.

Someone fucking told me I'm just using my depression as a fucking fear tactic to keep people as my fucking friends when I'm not.

At this point they all fucking left.

I don't get people. They say they care but they never really do.

I'm fucking done with it all.

There's no point to it all.

I'm probably going to get ignored on here too but oh well.

At least my story's out there.
