Im scared and confusedI've been having suicidal thoughts for the past 10 years. I have so little faith in myself that I don't believe I can even kill myself properly; the chance I might fail scares me. 

I've tried anti depressants and therapy which did not help much. I lost anyone close to me that supported me in the past.

I don't feel like the payoff of trying to improve my life is worth it in the end, but I also don't know if I can push myself to finally end everything with the risk of failing. I'm sick of being a burden to people and being pitied. But this guilt that I feel for being as selfish as I am is slowly disappearing.

I decided to post here because I wish I cared more about myself but I just can't. I'm scared because things are only getting worse. Even in moments where I should be happy I feel uneasy. When my mind is most clear and I am almost content with myself I still arrive at the conclusion that I should have committed suicide a long time ago or I should still attempt to.

My cognitive abilities seem to slip away from me more every year and its hard to really string my thoughts together, remember things, or even format this. I hope what I have typed out makes sense.

I don't believe I deserve any pity or advice, nor did I post this to receive any. But I would like to thank you if you read through this jumble of text I regurgitated. 

If you're reading this, I hope you have a nice day
