Needed to get this off my chestHi so this is gonna be a lengthy post so feel free to skip :). So basically I'm a sophomore and i go to a public school. I'm rather well liked I'm not extremely popular but everyone knows me and I don't have any beefs with anyone and I have a great group of friends and a good family. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts ever since I've been 14(I'm 16 now) and I honestly see it as more of something that's gonna happen instead of an option. I've talked about it with my closest friend before and said she'd be absolutely crushed if I died. I want to leave this Earth but I don't want to let her and my gf and the people who care about me down. But on the other hand I feel like it's such a weight on my shoulders and this is the only way to get it off me. What would happen if I died, how would people view me if I killed myself???
