I think it's time to goIts been a couple of months now since my life went to shit. Details are in my previous post. I've gone through so much and everyone always says "hold on because things will get better". They're not getting better, they're getting so much worse. Friends a have died, family is sick, I was raped. The only person in my life that kept me happy is gone and won't talk to me anymore. It's better to die than live in constant torture. I can't do this anymore.
