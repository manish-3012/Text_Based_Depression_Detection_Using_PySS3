Sick of this gameIâ€™m 12 years old rn and so sick of living no matter what I always feel like everybody hates me nobody talks to me and I donâ€™t have the courage to do it on my own also my aunt has just been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and my parents are constantly trying to keep me from being on the internet and talking with friends my mom makes fun of me for not having friends and I just canâ€™t take it I wanna hang my self but Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll fail and end up being a vegetable also nobody in my family knows Iâ€™m suicidal because if I told them they wouldnâ€™t understand I canâ€™t take this
