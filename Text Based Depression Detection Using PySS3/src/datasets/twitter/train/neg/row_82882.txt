I've thought this through and I'm calm, I want to leave. Anyone have a good method to suggest?Would like as little pain as possible, serious posters only.
I'm not here for consolation, just seeing if anyone had good ideas that's not painful or edgy. I just simply want to leave, I've had enough. 

Situation: dead end life. I'm pretty sure bad things are coming my way as well.
