Why do people want me to not kill myself?My life is an absolute shitfest, I have numerous mental illnesses, uderwhich severe social anxiety, schizofrenia, ADD, severe autism and still my psychiater says I have more...  
I feel like dying is just way easier than trying to deal with all this bullshit.. 
people on the internet always say I shouldn't kill myself,  
but people IRL all bully me or ignore me our beat me...  
I don't know what to do, I've already tried killing myself twice now, both attempts failed and left me scarred, I'm afraid of failing again..
