Falling apart. Help.I've been here before. I know what's happening, I'm starting to lose my grip. I can't keep up anymore. I've stopped going to class and doing homework. I'm usually clean but now dirty dishes are piling up in my room and I haven't done laundry. I haven't been taking my medicine, I don't know why I just can't bring myself to do it. I can't bring myself to do anything. All I can do is sleep. But when I sleep I have nightmares. I wake up feeling scared. 

I'm always thinking about terrible things. I'll try sometimes to find a safe topic to think about, something that will make me happy, but everything seems to make me sad and upset. Like my boyfriend, he's so perfect, but the thought of him makes me hurt. He says he loves me and he's there for me and that he doesn't care that I get depressed. But I know he will care, eventually. He'll care when he realizes how much it hurts when all I want to do is kill myself, when he realizes that he can't do anything to help me. I'm going to hurt him and he doesn't deserve it.  

I'm not going to kill myself. Not now anyway. But I feel like it's inevitable. I just get to this awful place over and over again. I've gotten lucky before but luck won't keep me alive forever. It's happening just like it has before. I feel like I'm being dragged down to that dark place and there's nothing I can do to stop it. I don't know. I'm just scared. I have no one to talk to.
