I've been trying to end my life.I'm currently 17, and just tried to kill myself again. But each time I try I can never seem to push myself to cut deep. I think it's because I'm scared of death, and I just want to stop how I feel constantly. So I try to cut myself badly enough to where my family will notice. Because I have too much anxiety in bring up the subject to them. But each time after I cut myself I get too scared to show anyone and end of just hiding it until it heals.

So I was wondering if there is any advice you guys could give me to try and let my family know.
