Any thoughts on minimizing my suicide's effect on survivors?53 (M) married, white, middles class, enough money ... from the outside a very pleasant life. I'm just done and want out. I Want to lessen the grief, mostly my wife's (42). She will be devastated, but any ideas are welcome. I have taken care of all the logistics, finances, etc... so there is nothing there to worry about - I just don't know what to say other than "I quit". FWIW, I think in the long run (after a year or two) she will be better off as I won't be there dragging us both down, and she will have the chance of finding a partner who has goals dreams and visions other than suicide.
