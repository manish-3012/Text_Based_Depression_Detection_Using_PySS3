No joy in lifeThere's no joy in life, video games used to be my last bastion but I can't afford them and I can't work because jobs give me severe anxiety at how competitive managers want you to be. I just had a daughter and I feel if I killed myself she would be better off not remembering her dead beat dad. My last friend from high school just gave up on me and I'm just pushing my girlfriend away to make it easier on her when the day finally comes.
