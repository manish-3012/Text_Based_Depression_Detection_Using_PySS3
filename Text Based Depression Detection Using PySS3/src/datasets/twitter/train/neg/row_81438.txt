Another One...Hey guys.
I don't know what to do anymore. Everything is just hitting me all at once. I don't find enjoyment in anything anymore. Fuck I can't even smile anymore.
School is fucking killing me right now and I hate it so much. I have major works due for my HSC (I'm Australian) and they are fucking shit. Everything is just getting really bad. I'm failing all of my classes and I just can't keep up. I spend each break at school alone because I'm cancerous to everyone I meet. I tried to kill myself last night but I had no balls to do it. I just need help. I don't want to be like this anymore. 
Thank you
