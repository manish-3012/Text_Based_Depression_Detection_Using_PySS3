Touch starvedI have a lot of issues with depression and anxiety but honestly I think I could deal with them all if I wasn't so crushingly lonely. Apparently one of the biggest causes of suicide is feeling disconnected and for me the big problem is touch. I don't expect anyone to ever want to look at me because I'm so, appallingly, shockingly ugly, but that means I also literally can't even remember the last time I was touched by a human being. I need a hug, and idk. Thinking about how I'll never ever be close to anyone or, yeah, be in a relationship is really getting me down. I can't stop thinking about it and I have an essay due in 24 hours that I haven't even started because I can't stop thinking about it and I just want to take the next train to the coast and throw myself off the cliffs.
