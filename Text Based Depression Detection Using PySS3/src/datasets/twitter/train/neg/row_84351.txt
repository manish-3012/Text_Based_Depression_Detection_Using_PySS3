Lonely, trying to help myself, its not working.I can't seem to make any friends or relationships, and its really hurting me. I live in a rural area, so I don't see anyone unless I go to work or get out of the house. I try to use tinder, but for some reason, I seem to land a date with anyone other than fat ugly women who I am not attracted to. I tried going on dates with them because I'm so repulsed by the time I finish fucking them that I hate myself even more. I don't know what's wrong with me. I dont enjoy hanging out with other people. I get too nervous that they hate me and I stop having fun. I think they really do hate me but I cant figure out why. its like that spongebob episode where he has bad breath and thinks hes ugly. I wish someone could tell me whats wrong with me. or what Im doing wrong.

 I bought a gun today and am just waiting for the background check to get completed so that I can kill myself. in the meantime, I'm stuck in this weird limbo of alive but almost dead. Frankly, it's a relief that I made up my mind. before when I was contemplating it I was miserable, but now I feel a sense of freedom from being in constant suffering. I thought about writing a suicide note but i decided against it. I don't really care if people know that I suck with relationships. the only people who would read it are my parents, but I dont want them to know the details. nobody else knows i exist.

the fact that im writing this means that I have some hope that I can find friends or a woman who loves me eventually, but I think that hope is misguided. I dont know that I will ever figure out what is wrong with me or how to correct it. if anyone has any experience figure out whats wrong with them socially, id love a last resource that I could try out before my new gun comes.
