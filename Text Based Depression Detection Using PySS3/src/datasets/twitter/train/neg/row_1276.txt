Dont readI am really sorry. I survived last Time. No one knew that I tried.
Again this is for the ones I am leaving behind. 

No one could have done anything. Its my fault. Trust me its better when im gone. One less Idiot. Thats the only way to repair the things I have destroyed. And to the Humans I destroyed I hope it feels better without me. And of course I am sorry but that changes nothing.
I hope God tells me to take care of the loved ones.
