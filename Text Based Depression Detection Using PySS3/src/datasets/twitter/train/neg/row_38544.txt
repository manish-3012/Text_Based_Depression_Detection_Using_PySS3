Coming to terms with the fact that I'll never have light in my lifeAll I can think about is repeatedly slamming my head into the concrete sidewalk til it burst open and I bleed out. I hate my entire existence and should have just killed myself already because everything is torture and nothing good will happen to me. Waking up is painful. I don't want to do it anymore. I'm really struggling with my own mind and I don't feel like anyone can help me. I don't know where to go or what to do. I have no friends and no family. Ready to go now.
