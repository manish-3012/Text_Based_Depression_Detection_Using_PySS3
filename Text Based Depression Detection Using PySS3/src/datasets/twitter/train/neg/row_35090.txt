I want to be goneIâ€™m so tired. Mentally and physically. After years of this, nothing has gotten better. Iâ€™m stuck in a cycle, Iâ€™m trapped and Iâ€™ll never find my way out of it. Everything feels pointless, I donâ€™t understand why I even put effort into anything at this point. Iâ€™m only 15, there should be so much ahead of me to look forward to, but I see no future for myself, I have no goals, no ambition, thereâ€™s just nothing. I cling onto the few people that truly love me, but Iâ€™ve never told them how Iâ€™ve felt. The thoughts that Iâ€™ve had, my self harm and suicidal urges. They donâ€™t know that Iâ€™m deteriorating inside. I wish they did sometimes, so that maybe thereâ€™d be a chance I could get help. But Iâ€™m terrified of telling anyone. Not knowing how theyâ€™d react, putting such a horrible burden on their shoulders. Especially my parents. How the hell am I supposed to tell them all of this? I canâ€™t take it anymore, itâ€™s not getting better, itâ€™s just getting worse and worse and itâ€™s my fault. I just want to die without anyone being effected, I want it to be painless and then nothing. Itâ€™s better then living everyday suffering with my thoughts and wasting away like this.
