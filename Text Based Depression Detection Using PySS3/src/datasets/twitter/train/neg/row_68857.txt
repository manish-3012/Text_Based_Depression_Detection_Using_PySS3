What will happen?I was planning my suicide for over 8 years now... Lately I have been on the edge, trying to fight it but its really hard. I told my best friend that I know for a long time about how I feel. I thought I could trust her, but now she is threatening she will report me to the police...  there is no deciding anymore, I have to act now...bye
