My best friend killed himself because of meI use to have a best friend, we knew each other for four years now and a couple months ago i was fed up with him, i just didn't feel happy with him anymore. He wasn't even a bad kid, he was a mistreated and abused kid, for the longest time we had so much fun, but suddenly i felt unhappy with him, maybe he was just too clingy and he was annoying and a bit of a bully at times but he wasn't a bad kid, i just didn't wanna be best friends with him anymore. So two days ago i told him the friend ship was over and we got into a long fight, in the end he just deleted his facebook account, we didn't see him the next day after the fight and today i found out he had hung himself.... because of me. I was shamed by his parents and the students around me started blaming me and my only other friend left me. It's night now. I'm crying, he was on a path to become a good person but i fucking left him, i'm a waste of human space for doing something like that, he was bullied and i fucking knew i was the only one who made him happy and i left him, he lost meaning and killed himself. I'm an indirect killer god dammit, i have a gun close to me, and i'm tempted to pull the trigger...what the fuck do i do? End my life? Continue living a life of shame and regret? Help me....i didn't mean to kill him...oh god what have i done..... I don't wanna dial 911. Help me.
