Getting exponentially worseI live across the street from my dad, my sister just moved out the other week and now I'm in a big house alone. I was doing better with my depression. But now that I'm alone I've taken a nose dive, my dad has noticed. It's not too bad when I'm at work because I'm around other people, although a woman at work is trying to get me in trouble right now, I accidentally ran into her cart with a pallet and after I apologized and made sure she was ok, we got along fine for 2 days and then right when my manager got off vacation she called her yelling about workplace violence and how she felt threatened, this isn't the first time she's thrown me under the bus, I dunno. But when I'm home all I can think about is suicide. I don't live near any of my friends, although they probably don't even want to hang out with me anymore. I've always been able to put up a facade but I can't even do that anymore. I'm just tired.
