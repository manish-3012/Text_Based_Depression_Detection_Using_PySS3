Can't stop thinking about suicide.I just can't stop thinking about killing myself. It's been a few days and it's become all I can really think about. I know that I shouldn't want o kill myself but I can't get the thoughts to go away. Yesterday I almost did it. Where I was mentally was scary and I feel like I'm getting there again.
