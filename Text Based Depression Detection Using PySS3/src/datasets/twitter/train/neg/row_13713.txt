If youâ€™re thinking about ending itPlease read this

Personally, Iâ€™ve had my close family die, had traumatic brain and bodily injuries to the point where I lost my ability to read and move, sexual assault and well the bad things go on. Iâ€™m not trying to say â€œOh well Iâ€™ve had it worseâ€ but set the precedent of â€œYeah Iâ€™ve been through it a bitâ€ 

There are so many beautiful things to love for. Fresh food, vibrant cultures, beautiful people. Shit hits the fan sometimes, more for some of us than others, but life was never made to be perfect. But people are like putty. We get bent out of shape but then we can bounce back. Itâ€™s all about the effort you put in.

Personally, I like to think of life like a video game, with stats. If one of my stats, like my body for example, is bad, I think about the time and effort Iâ€™ve put into it. Did I eat healthy? Did I workout?

Socially, when Iâ€™m not invited to things or treated badly, I ask myself what I can do to stop it. Usually itâ€™s hosting social events myself, so that I can have control, or getting a new hobby and meeting people through there. Once you get past the formalities, you can meet a lot of great people. Moreover, you have to invest ~50 hours for a real friendship to form.

I donâ€™t know if it helps but, see life as a video game. What stat do you want to level up? Happiness? Health? Cleaning? The choice is yours, and I promise that at least attempting to level up will leave you in a better place than before because you gained experience

In any case, I may not know you, but if I did, I would invest points into getting to know you :)
