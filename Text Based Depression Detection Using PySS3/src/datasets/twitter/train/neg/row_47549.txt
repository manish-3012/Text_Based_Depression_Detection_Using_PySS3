I literally fucking despise myselfI'm such a shitty person. I did something no one should ever do to another person and all I do is feel constant guilt. Idk how I could hurt someone the way I did. I was selfish and so fucking stupid and now im stuck in the deepest run that I cant get out of. I just feel like i don't deserve to even be alive anymore and I don't even want to tbh. I know everyone says it gets better but I just can't wait for them to. I have to make a life altering decision and I still dont know what to do. No matter what I do it is either going to make me unhappy or other people I care about unhappy. And I just don't know what to fucking do. I just want to die at this point. 

I'm at a fucking loss.
