I'm Still Alive - SomehowI don't know how I've managed to survive the past few months of constant suicidal ideation. I seriously mean when I say this sub has been helpful, even the trolls who said, "this guy is desperately seeking attention. Ignore."

Do I feel better? Not really, but I know that I've made it months of months of desperately wanting to kill myself. Maybe at some point I won't be a totally miserable wreck, but for now I am stuck every day fighting to not kill myself. 

I don't know if anyone has ever recovered from feeling suicidal for such a long period of time but for now I'm still here.

Sorry for wasting your time with this stupid post but I really wanted to say it. Goodbye.
