Feeling like I'm at the end of my lifeI've been speaking to my gran recently who is in her 90s (I'm 25), and she was telling me how she feels that she is at the end of her life now. There's a running joke in the family about how she's been saying the same thing for the last 30 years.

Recently though I've been struck by how I can relate to how she is feeling. I feel like I've seen and experienced enough of life, and that the end is near for me. I am seeing a therapist which might help explore why I feel this way, but I wonder if this feeling is as much a philosophical problem for me as it is one of mental ill health.
