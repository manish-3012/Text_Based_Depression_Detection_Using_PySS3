Don't know what to doSo I had been seeing a counciler for quite a while. She was great, helped me through a lot, even when I hurt myself for the first time. Now, I can't schedule another appointment b/c she is busy. 

The reason why I hurt myself twice is somewhat complicated, and I don't know the best way to describe it. I call them, "Visualizations". They are scenarios that play out in my head that can cause anxiety, anger, sadness, despair, or even, me to hurt myself. The scenario is always the same: Someone, usually a man confronts me while I am minding my own business and then it leads to a physical confrontation. I then see myself hurt them in violent fashion. Broken bones, faces beaten into a pulp, etc... It scares me that I keep seeing these scenarios, it frustrates me that nothing can stop them. The person confronting me is a metaphor for my condition, because I can never stop them (without violence).

Now, I do have things like my stressball for when I am breathing erratically, and my journal so I can document my visualizations, and medication for anxiety, but to no avail can I prevent them from happening.
