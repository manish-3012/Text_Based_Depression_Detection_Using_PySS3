I'm really bored.Well, you see... I dont know if you'll find this ridiculous but, im just bored of being alive.

I dont like videogames, movies, eating and the love i found wasn't enough for me to keep myself alive.

I'm jealous of people that find everything joyfull, because i cant, and everyday i cant do anything else but think "I have a pistol in the other room... A knife and a tub in the other, what if i bite my tonge and end everything?" It's just creepy now, i dont know if you guys can help me, cause i tried a lot of things but nothing is interesting anymore, and i really want to enjoy my life like everyone else.
