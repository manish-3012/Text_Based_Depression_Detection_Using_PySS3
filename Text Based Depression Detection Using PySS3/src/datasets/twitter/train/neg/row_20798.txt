I feel so stupidI know I have people that are willing to help me but everything just seems so pointless. I have people to talk to everyday and my days aren't necessarily bad but I end up feeling so lonely and pathetic every night. I've stopped feeling motivated to do anything. The only reason I get any work done is the feeling of absolute terror that I won't be able to escape the horrible situation I'm in at home. I try to always have people over or be out doing something so I don't have to be home alone but its so difficult when everyone has their own things going on. 

I know just distracting myself from my problems isn't the healthiest but it feels better to just pretend like everything is going great. It feels better when people aren't always asking me if I'm okay or if they can help. 

The one person I don't mind talking to about what is going on doesn't want to talk to me anymore and it feels like everything I keep unhealthily bottling up is going to spill out in the most inconvenient and embarrassing situation.
