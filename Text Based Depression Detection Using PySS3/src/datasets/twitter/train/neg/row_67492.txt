I think I'm done.I'm tired of being fucked over and used and lied to by people. Every single fucking time I reach out and try and get close to someone they fuck me in the end. And every time is worse than the last.

I'm not sure I'm at the point of killing myself over it but I'll never reach out again. I lost a huge part of myself because of this bitch. I should of stayed how I was before and just been alone.

I don't know how I'm going to get over this.. And I acknowledge how stupid that is. I've always been alone and never needed anybody, but this one hurt.

If anyone reading this is currently lying to their spouse or doing fucked up shit behind their back, even when your spouse has always been fucking good to you, fucking talk to them about your fucking problems and stop being a piece of shit.
