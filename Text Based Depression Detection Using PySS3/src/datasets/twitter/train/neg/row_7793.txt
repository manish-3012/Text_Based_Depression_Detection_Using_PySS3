Prozac is making me crazyI started prozac last Friday. I felt amazing for two days and then Sunday Iï¸ started wanting to kill myself. Psych lowered my dose and suicidal thoughts subsided but depression worsened. Psych decided to stop Iï¸t altogether today and Iâ€™m feeling horrible. 

Sunday, I felt like the thoughts werenâ€™t mine and I was being compelled to do it. I was really anxious about Iï¸t because I thought I didnt want to die. 

I dont feel like that anymore. Now, I think I do want to die. I had a lot of trauma in my childhood and deal with pretty severe mental health issues now (depression, anxiety, OCD, eating disorders, borderline, substance abuse, and c-ptsd). Iï¸t takes so much to maintain mental stability and I feel I cant keep living like this. I donâ€™t feel like I have energy to maintain Iï¸t anymore.
