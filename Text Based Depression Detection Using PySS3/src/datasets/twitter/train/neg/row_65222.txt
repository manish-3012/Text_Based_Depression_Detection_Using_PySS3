I don't want to commit suicide, but I feel like it's my only real option. Is there any other solution you guys can think of?I'm in a weird situation. I don't want to commit suicide, but I feel like it's the only option I have. It seems like the logical thing for me to do.

Long story short, I'm gay. I know, nothing new. I know there are thousands of people who are going through the same thing, and I wish I could make everything all okay for them if I could. 

The way I see it is this. If God exists, I'm probably going to Hell. That's what I hear from people anyway. So, what's the point of delaying the inevitable? Might as well just get it out of the way since I'm doomed anyway. 

If God doesn't exist, then I still can't be happy. My family and friends would disown me or be unsupportive. Plus, I already stand out from other people too much due to other things. I don't want to come out and have my sexuality be another thing that will make me different and disconnected from people. 

I don't really have any hope. I really don't want to commit suicide because it breaks my heart that suicide is even a thing. It's heartbreaking that other people feel enough difficulty, pain, or hopelessness to do that.

But with me, I feel like I have to. I really don't want to do it, but what else can I do? I don't want to hurt my family. I know they'll be heartbroken, and I know it'll stay with them for years and years. 

I just wish I was straight. I hate the fact that the world is so divided over small things. All these things that people discriminate over are so fucking stupid. Racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. It's all ridiculous. But it exists. Why can't people just be kind to each other?

Does anyone have any advice? Maybe any tips on how to develop feelings for guys? I'd appreciate it. I think my best hope at the moment is to try and "become straight". I don't know if it'll work, but other than, suicide, it's my only other idea.
