How come.When someone dies from a painful disease, people are a little sad but say "at least they aren't suffering anymore" ... but people suffer from excrutiating mental illness and suddenly it's "selfish" and people feel wronged. I'm in so much pain all the time, how come if I was in this much pain from cancer it would be all tears and outpouring of support, but because my pain is from my lifelong severe depression, I'm just being lazy and entitled and selfish and making excuses and just need to work harder. Then when I bring up something I feel good about and wanna do that makes me want to actually live and it's nothing but scorn and doubt and discouragement... how come nobody cares or wants to hear about my mental state or help on a normal basis but when I say I'm suicidal it's this huge rush to just say "no you can't do that" and guilt trip me about it but then go right back to not saying shit or caring at all as soon as i shut up about it. People don't actually care about how I feel or whether I live or die, they just want me to shut up about being suicidal and agree to "stay alive" i.e. keep suffering but shut up so they don't have to feel bad and can feel morally good that they """convinced"" someone to stay when really they just guilted them to keep suffering but shove it down harder. I'm sick and in pain and I just want it to stop. I think about it constantly but the guilt for people who I honestly don't owe shit but can't bring myself to hurt keeps me from doing it and it is such a miserable painful existence I feel like I'm going to explode.
