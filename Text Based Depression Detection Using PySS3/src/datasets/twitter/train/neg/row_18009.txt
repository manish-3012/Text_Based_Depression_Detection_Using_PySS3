Stepping to the edgesI am 20 now, have a bf, and life is hard in HK. You can never get cheap food and necessities, or even transit fares are rising every year.

I have seeing clinical psychologist, and the psychiatric. There are tons of medicine that I should be taking to stable my emotion, however I didn't since the medicine will have unbearable negative effect to me. Like brainfucked feeling, and verstile emotion more even. 

Should I just take all those sleeping and whatever pills on my desk...? I just want to end this all and forever, that I can't tolerate or suffer from this for another 3-4 years, 24Ã—7 non-stop brainfucking.
