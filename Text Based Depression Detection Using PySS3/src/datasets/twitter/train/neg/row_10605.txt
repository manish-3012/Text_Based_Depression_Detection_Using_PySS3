My watch is running out of time.I'm homeless because my brother tried to kill me.

I've been staying at my friends parents for almost two weeks. 

The homeless youth agency won't get back to me.

I've applied to a billion jobs and no one will hire me.

I'm at my wit's end and I don't want to be a burden of my friend anymore even though they've been incredibly welcoming, how long would that last tho? I didn't even want to stay here more than one night.

I don't know what to do and it feels like I've exhausted all my options and job hunting is like finding a needle in a haystack and I'm just wondering why I didn't just succeed in my many attempts when I was severely clinically depressed at 13. 

I found a way out then, telling myself to "have experiences" before I died. 

What experiences? I can't catch a fucking break.
