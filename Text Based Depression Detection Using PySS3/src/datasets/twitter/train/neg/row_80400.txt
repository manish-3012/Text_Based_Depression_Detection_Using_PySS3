I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be a good person againFor about a year and a half now I havenâ€™t really been satisfied with my life. In the past few months Iâ€™ve become a horrible person and Iâ€™ve hurt everyone close to me. I have two close friends and a few people I talk to at school. My two friends tell me all the time that I try to be edgy and they donâ€™t care. All I really talk about anymore is my state of mind because I want people to care but all I do is chase people away. I'm ashamed about the weight I've put on but they say they can call me fat if I say I am. I try to understand the emotions I'm making the people I care about feeling but I'm so stupid I make it worse, I just end up being called a bitch. 
I get so hung up one person and I trust them so I talk to them about this stuff. I usually just end up acting like the pretentious white girl I am though. 
I hate everything about myself. I don't want to die but I have nothing to live for.
