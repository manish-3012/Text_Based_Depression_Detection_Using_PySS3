Girlfriend threatening to kill herselfMy girlfriend F26 has been dealing with mental health issues for a while. She has always refused to get help. Now it got bad to the point she wants to kill herself. She just said I will not study for my mid term tomorrow because I'll be dead before the final exam. She refuses help because she says that even if she gets better she will have nothing to live for. I know how it feels I had depression 3 years ago. 


How can I help her? I am totally clueless and genuinely worried that she might hurt herself
