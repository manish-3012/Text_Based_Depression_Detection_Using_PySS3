Am I justified in killing my aggressors?[**PREFACE**: /eatingdisorders is dead and empty. This post has the tone of an /offmychest entry, but I'm putting it here. If any of you have a problem with that, I will stab you in the face.]

Hi. This is my actual account. Yeah. I'm that serious. Things are bad.

I will state how, so that readers may know what the fucking deal is.

From 2005 to 2009 I dedicated myself to fitness. [1][Progress](http://i.imgur.com/szhKD.png) [2][was](http://i.imgur.com/c524L.jpeg) [3][made](http://i.imgur.com/NPTmJ.png).

Then, I had digestive issues, or I blamed my relationship issues on my digestion so I could avoid meals with my father. Wouldn't you know it, [weight loss] (No Pics). The trend continued as I worked like a 19 to 13 hour days &amp; maintained a strict diet of foods that would stay down. 

A good night's sleep was rare. I lost my job, but I looked like [4][this](http://i.imgur.com/FNgLe.png). 

My life got tougher. I [5][reinvested](http://i.imgur.com/zPdSu.png) [6][in](http://i.imgur.com/zPdSu.png) [7][exercise](http://i.imgur.com/HqN5g.png). [8][Too thin](http://i.imgur.com/bfog2.png), not enough mass at 132 lbs, 5' 5." How much body fat? Not enough. 

"Gee," I thought. "If exercises are getting harder with all this extra cardio, obviously *I'm just not lifting enough weight*." So I increased the weight I lifted. While sleeping less, exercising more, and eating less.

Against my better judgement, I then went on a major bike ride that drained all of my body's glycogen reserves for the next week. Since I bonked very hard. Very, hard. As I was accompanying my father on his "recovery ride," I wondered why I couldn't move my body. Why didn't it work? All I understood was that I was very, very, very sad and frustrated. */sadface*

A rider picked me up; a fellow cyclist. Hallelujah!* I was dropped off at the car. I needed food. I asked for it, but my father just got angry. He could not understand why I was so obsessed with food. [BTW, I'm crying right now].

But, eventually after much persistence and begging on my part, he agreed to pay for a trip to the doctor's office, all $74 of it (as I lay dying. hahahaha, weepweepweep).

A few days later, I lay on the bed of - get this - a medical doctor who just so happened to specialize in eating disorders. 

* She weighed me: 126.1 lbs. I had lost five or six pounds (glycogen and water, I'm betting) in a few days. 

* She measured my resting pulse at 37 beats per minute. "Hey!" I thought, "just like the endurance athletes." I knew I was a bad ass.

Then she ran an EKG &amp; told me I had [Bradycardia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradycardia)[wiki]. I did not know what that meant. I still do not. 

She strongly suggested that I see a nutritionist, and that I add more fat to my diet. "Okay!" I thought, "Finally I will be able to eat fatty foods without criticism from my father. Finally. Finally. :(

It took me almost an hour to decide what to eat after our meeting. I regretted the decision I had made over thinking it. Vietnamese was not what the doctor ordered. *yuck, yuck, yuck*

With doctor's writ in hand, I approached my father. With proof that I should be able to eat the foods I wanted to eat, he could not mock me or deny me. **FINALLY!**

Rather than consuming the 1300 Calories + exercise/activity expenditure, I ate about 3600 calories. It was great. I had pizza. 

First thing the next day, I had a full panel of tests drawn at a Quest Diagnostics lab. The results arrived in under a week.

The results showed that everything was normal except for:

* white cell count (low)
* mean platelet volume (low)
* absolute monocytes (low)
* testosterone (*way the fuck* low)
* Mg (high)
* cholesterol (high)
* transferrin saturation (low)
* iron (low)

I understood very little of the results at that time, but it was obvious that if my testosterone was low, then I could not put on muscle, which explained why my workouts had gotten so hard.

*Pre-edit* I have to go now. This wi-fi shop is about to close down. I have wi-fi at my current "residence" so I will update in about two hours. I will finish my telling before I finish everything.

**EDIT 1 20110822 22:46:46 PT**

I've been up for four days in a row. I will finish posting this tomorrow. Not dead yet. Also, I will not name names, so no charges can be filed, or ISPs requested so long as I do not threaten general or specific individuals. 

'night.
