Signs your parent wants to kill themselves?One of my parents keeps talking about death and it's like they prepare themselves for dying soon. My parent keeps bringing up what might happen to their kids (me and my sibling) once they die and how to prevent that.

My parent is in their late 40s. They keep worrying whether or not they might have cancer, but continue drinking alcohol (occassionally). Their behavior has just been very weird lately. It feels like they are literally waiting for death to get them.
