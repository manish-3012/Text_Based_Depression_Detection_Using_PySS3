once upon a time, I loved, I lived2 years ago, she acrossed all country to my city for our love, and we married this March. She have Depression tendency for long time, but I love her so much and give all my heart to her, love her, take care of her. She tried to suicide for 3 times after we get together, every time she did that, I tried everything to save her, and never give up. Now she think I am not good enough for her, because my salary is not so pretty, and I'm too lazy to find any other part-time job, she just left to another city and told me she will never come back, and also told me there's no love between us anymore, because this is no the life she want. She call me every day and ask my result for her divorce decision. Desperation is all I feel.
Every time after she tried to kill herself, I felt more depression. And now, I feel that I can not get myself together any more. I'm in great depression and sad everyday, and still try to get myself together to learn things and work.
I already have a suicide plan and prepared all things I need. Maybe I will do it one day. There's only one thing I can not leave with it, I am afraid my parents will hate her for this.
Today is Nov 30th, my 30th birthday, and I'm all alone as a pathetic man.
Yes, I fear of death and hesitating right now, but I'm also in great depression and pain in every moment.
