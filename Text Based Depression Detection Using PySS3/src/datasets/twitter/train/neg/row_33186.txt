It is all too much right now...Between health issues, my (temporary) living situation and the judgemental conga-line in my head, I am feeling like there are only problems and no solutions. I don't know what else to say, I'm on waiting lists for therapy and am doing what I should to keep afloat. I am losing who I am, and I feel like I am only defined by my problems. I am only a giant, complicated problem. I don't know if talking would help, but I feel like my brain is simultaneously numb and exploding.
