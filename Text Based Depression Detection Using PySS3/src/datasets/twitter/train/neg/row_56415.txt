I am a horrible person and I don't deserve loveI didnt go home when my elderly mother didn't answer the phone because I was aggravated at her. Turns out she was sick and she died a few days later. I had to tell the doctors not to put her on life support (she didn't want to be on mahines, bbut I made the final decision). I basically killed her. Then I took out my grief and frustration on her little dog. i made him sleep outside one night after he dirtied the house, and i didn't pay attention when he stopped eating. Six months after she died, i had to have him put to sleep. i killed the two individuals I loved most in the world, and for that reason I will never allow myself to have a dog, or let anyone love me. I don't deserve it. I am a horrible, horrible person and I deserve to die alone.
