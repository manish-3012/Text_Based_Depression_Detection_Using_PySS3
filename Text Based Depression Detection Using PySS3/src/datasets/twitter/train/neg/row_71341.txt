Will my friends remember me?I'm a guy in my early 20s diagnosed with mental illness. I don't want to die...but it seems like that might be my only option at the end of the year...I hope I make it to 2020. Will my friends miss and remember me? The voices I hear in my head tell me that everyone hates me. I try to not listen, but it can be hard. I live far away from my friends...but I try to talk to them at least once every 10 days. I hope the voices in my head are wrong. I hope I can make it. I know people's lives have to move on, but I want an answer.
