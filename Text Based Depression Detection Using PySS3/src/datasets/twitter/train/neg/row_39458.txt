I want to kill myself, but I don't want to actually dieI know this might sound silly, but my entire life is bullshit, I can't have a stable relationship so I feel so lonely, I'm convinced I'm a horrible person, I don't even have any real friends and life is just incredibly annoying and painful. But on the other hand, I'm afraid to die - what if I'd just kill myself and immeadiatly realise it was wrong. Got any advice? Experience?
