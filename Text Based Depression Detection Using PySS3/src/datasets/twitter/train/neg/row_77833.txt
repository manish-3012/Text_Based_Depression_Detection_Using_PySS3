Really bad highs and lowsHello! I have a problem. For the first part of today I was fine, I wasnâ€™t really happy nor upset, I was just fine. Then my dad mentioned something about my job, which reminded me of the way he talked about me with my grades, which made me extremely anxious. That anxiousness made me feel trapped, and I suddenly felt super suicidal, and in this time frame I fucked up my hand pretty bad. However, now Iâ€™m okay again, in fact more than okay. Iâ€™m suddenly extremely happy and I donâ€™t have a care in the world. Itâ€™s like the only reminder of how I was feeling is the physical pain in my hand. 
But this is my day to day life, almost everyday goes down like this. Sometimes Iâ€™ll be extremely sad for days, sometimes Iâ€™ll be extremely happy for days. And somedays it does what happened today. 
Itâ€™s starting to concern me I guess, what if I finally get the balls to do something Iâ€™ll regret?
