An endless cycleOne failure leads to stress leads to another failure leads to more stress and so on and so forth. I can't break out of this cycle. My grades are dropping, whatever passion I had for my studies is fading. And no matter how hard I work, or what I can muster, it's not ever enough. No matter how much I improve at music, nobody ever comes across it, nobody even listens and tells me I suck, they never listen. They never care. I just hate it. I'm starting to feel indifferent about the things I loved to do. I'm only living for my mom rn, but if anything happens to her, idk if I'll see the next day. There's so much that's draining me. I know I'll be a bad parent and spouse, but I still want to have someone next to me, because I want someone to love me for who I am rather than because I'm related to them. I want them to tell me Im someone worth spending their life with. I'm so tired of everything. I don't want to say it's stacked against me, because I've made mistakes I know. I just want to know if I mean anything to anyone. If I can live the way I want and do the things I love, or if I'm destined to die alone never experiencing the warmth of another, the feeling of a great success or any thing worth experiencing. I'm tired of this constant struggle, I just want to rest now.
