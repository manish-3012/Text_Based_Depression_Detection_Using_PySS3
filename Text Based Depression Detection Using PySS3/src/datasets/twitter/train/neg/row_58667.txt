I can't hold on anymoreMy grip on life is slowly slipping. Every day I live, I just can't wait to leave. I am miserable 99 percent of the time. Recently, a major turning point has happened. I came out to my (mormon) family, and moved in with my boyfriend who I've dated since I was 16. I'm 19 now. I thought this would fill this void that has always been inside of me, but it hasn't. I tell myself that if I act happy, I'll eventually start to be happy. I feel trapped in reality. I was clean from heroin for 3 months, and I relapsed a few hours ago because I'm just that weak. There's no light at the end of the tunnel, this is as good as it gets. Why was I born gay just so I would hate myself for it for 5+ years? I can't do anything with my boyfriend without crying afterwards. I feel so disgusting. I can't hold on anymore. I can't even get out of bed a lot of the time because I just feel so sad. I just lay there for hours trying to distract myself from the existential dread that I'm expericencing on a daily basis. I give up. Sorry this made very little sense, my brain's a mess right now.
