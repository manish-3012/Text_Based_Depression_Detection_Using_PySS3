The beginning of the End.I'm sure he knows it too. My boyfriend. I love him to death, literally. I will die loving him. Sadly.. today marked the start of the end for me. We got into an arguement about him not showing affection and he got mad and started saying I said things I had never said and I started panicking, crying and clutching my head to stop myself when he yells loudly at me to stop. He got out of bed, still very loudly, and told me that if I didn't "shut up" before he got to one he would leave. 

I pulled it out or my ass to be "calm" and talk it out with him. In the end, I came out the winner and the loser. I calmed him down and comforted him so he could go to sleep worry free.. but I couldn't stop crying while trying to comfort him. Even now my head hurts from crying so much. 

He has never screamed at me during my panic attacks.. hes starting to hate me. Hes the last person in my life to not hate me. Once he cant stand me anymore is when I'll make my move. I'll finally ge free without upsetting anyone. 

I'll be staying up tonight. That panic attack made me ill and now I just want to cuddle my stuffed animals and think of suicide. 
No matter what happens, I will love him to death.
