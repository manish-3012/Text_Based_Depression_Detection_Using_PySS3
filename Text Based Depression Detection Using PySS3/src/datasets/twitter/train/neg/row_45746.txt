Life ain't working out for meI've had bipolar symptoms for over a decade and was diagnosed in the fall of 2017. I thought that the diagnosis would lead to recovery and things have improved to the point where I'm able to work part time but I still experience a lot of pain. The way I explained it at my last therapy session is that sometimes I can handle life but I'm never happy to be alive and a lot of the time I wish I were dead. I've read books and articles, talked to people, take medication, been hospitalized, all that jazz. Nothing stops the pain. My therapist says occasionally that he thinks I don't want to die, I want the pain to stop. I don't see a difference. The only reason I'm alive still is because my family is very attached to me and I really don't want to hurt them.
