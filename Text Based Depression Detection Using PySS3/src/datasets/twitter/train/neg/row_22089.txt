I canâ€™t bear living in this world anymoreIâ€™ve had enough. I canâ€™t bear anymore waking up and going to sleep so anxious about my life and my future. Iâ€™ve become numb, I canâ€™t feel anything but pain and anxiety. I canâ€™t see a way out and I donâ€™t know if I wanna find it: I canâ€™t stand how people behave. No one cares about the person standing in front of them, no one cares about the truth, and I get to be abused by everyone and thereâ€™s no way to get some justice somehow, itâ€™s way too frustrating. I am a faggot, I got dumped 6 months ago, thought he was the one, apparently I was wrong, and his deafening silence is slowly chipping away at my sanity. He promised a friendship that I know will never come but I canâ€™t let go of him, even though he was a mediocre boyfriend. Then thereâ€™s my job, I work in customer service, and Iâ€™ve spent the past 3 years witnessing some awful demonstrations of selfishness, and my boss doesnâ€™t care that much (I donâ€™t know if sheâ€™s too much of a pushover or she just doesnâ€™t care).
Iâ€™m only 24, I think Iâ€™ve had time to find what I wanna do in life... but I donâ€™t have any strong passion pushing me to pursue a certain path.
Iâ€™m the most boring person on planet Earth and no one would even notice if I just disappeared. Actually, everyone I know would be better off without me. After a brief period of grief everyone would find that my demise was actually a good thing and they could go on with their lives in a better way than with me. I canâ€™t really see why I shouldnâ€™t just do it, it would be the best option for everyone in my life. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing all this nonsense on here, I canâ€™t find the courage to do it anyway
