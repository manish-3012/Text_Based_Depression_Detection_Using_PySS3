My boyfriend and I are breaking upItâ€™s all my fault. He got upset because I told him how I feel. Weâ€™ve been together for a year. Heâ€™s not trying to get me back. He had plans to come to my house today but because I made him upset because I told him how I felt he canceled. I might as well die, Iâ€™ve already self harmed and it gave me the control I needed, now I just need to find a way to take control of my death.
