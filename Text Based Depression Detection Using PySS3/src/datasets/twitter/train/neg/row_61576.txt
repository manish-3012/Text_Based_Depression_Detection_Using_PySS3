so many of us are feeling alone. what if we just talked to one another? or maybe I'm stupidI'm an OG at depression, attempts, determination. All fail. always back at the same low. hotlines for me are even more discouraging.

  I'd like to talk to someone who isn't going to tell me "it gets better"

any takers
