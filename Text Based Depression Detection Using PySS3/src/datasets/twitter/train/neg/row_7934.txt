i wish she caredmy girlfriend is deciding whether or not she wants to stay with me. she's been deciding for a month and a half. it has been awful. its so pain and soiling beautiful memories we had from the two and a half years we were together. i want to die to save those memories, and make her decision for her. i cant do this anymore and she's starting to get bad too.  maybe she'll see life in a different way if im just dead one day. or maybe she'll be relieved that its all over. my parents have been trying to stay strong for me but i just dont think i can handle anymore of my memories get dragged through the mud.
