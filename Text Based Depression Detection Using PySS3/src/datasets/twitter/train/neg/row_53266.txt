I am trying my bestI have been trying my best to be healthy mentally but i am at nothing to just give up. I am going to a psychologist, psychiatrist, friends who support me, family, smiling all day long even faking it to try to be happy, say good things about myself, deny the bad things, etc....

But every single week i fell into thinking i am no worthy anything, that i should die, to kill myself. I havent tried to kill myself in almost 9 months, but i just feel worthless, useless, just absolutely nothing. My mind is about to win the game.
