I'm scared. Not of death, but of never singing again.I'm sitting here with the acid I bought today. I'm going to drink it, but I'm scared I'll survive. I'm scared that if I do, I'll never be able to sing again. It's the only thing I was even remotely good at. I'm scared that if I survive, I'll be kept on a constant watch, will probably be jailed according to the laws here, and I'll never sing again. I'm not afraid of dying. I'm afraid of staying alive.
