i don't want to die but it feels like there is no other optioneverything is bleak. i wrote a suicide note today with almost no intention of killing myself but now it sounds so, so sweet. all ive ever wanted was for someone to love me. the one i love tells me that he doesnt love me that way anymore and im going batshit over it. i see no end to my pain. I don't know what to do. i don't know why I'm posting here- i genuinely don't think anyone is going to respond. im so confused and im ready for eternal sleep.
