I know I'm supposed to be alive but I don't know whyI survived an attempt in July 2015, only barely, and more and more I hate myself for letting my roommate take me to the hospital.

I moved to another state chasing healthcare and that doesn't matter... it's been months and months, I can't find help, my insurance lapsed, I missed the deadline for new insurance...

and I'll never have enough money to matter, to be able to breathe, or take care of myself. How do you leave fight or flight mode when missing a single day of work could get you fired or be the difference between paying your bills/rent or not?

and my job is bad for me... I spend the entire time there praying for death, or telling myself that if we can just pretend to be normal until lunch or until the end of the shift, then we'll reward ourselves by going home and ending it... and it's getting worse and worse

I've spent my entire life with no agency or control over myself... and then even after I escaped I never had the power or money to matter or do anything I love

and now I'm far from any family I ever built, miserable

I want to die so bad... I made this account for this... I don't know what to do
