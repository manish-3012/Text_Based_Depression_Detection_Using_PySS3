If it weren't for my mother I would've long been gone.My only sister died recently, my friends feel like strangers at this point. I feel so alone, living with a chronic medical condition. 

I know I cannot do that to my mother, to have to experience the loss of both children. 

I feel that It would be better to go to sleep and never wake up.
