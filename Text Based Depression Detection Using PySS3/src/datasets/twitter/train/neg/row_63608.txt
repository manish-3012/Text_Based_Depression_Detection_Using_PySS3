I've been trying to write something for over two hours. I got nothing.The depression is hitting extra hard today ðŸ‘ŒðŸ» it's all over stupid shit too. I feel bad for thinking of dying every time something small happens. I got kicked from several facebook groups today and someone spoke to me kind of harsh *on the internet* and it just destroyed my mood. I hate to be the # triggered type but it got to me. It's stupid. Why do I get so upset about nothing. I KNOW I'm bringing other people around me down. I'm the most useless fucking person.
