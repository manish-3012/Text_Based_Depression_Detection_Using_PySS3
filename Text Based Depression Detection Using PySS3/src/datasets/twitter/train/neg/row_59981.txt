Breakup pain is too realThey say it gets easier. It hasnt for me..ite been 4 months and iâ€™m still absolutely miserable. I just found out my ex started seeing someone else. I dont know how someone can move on so fast.

I wish i had the ability to move on fast. I have used tinder but its so hard for me to like someone because of heartbreak. I hardlt ever like anyone because i knew it woulent have worked out and now im left with months and months of incredible pain. Its so hard for me to open up again.

Ive done all the suggestions like keeping busy, hanging with friends. Everything is just a distraction. There will be many times when im alone with my thoughts. I dont want to wake up. I didnt sleep at all last night after finding out about him and someone else. Im losing hope. I have no idea how to move on. Hes happy with someone else. He was the one who pursued me over and over until i said yes. Then i ended up being the one to be more into the relationship. Then he broke up with me. And now hes happily with someone else. And im here broken hearted and in despair.

I just want him back and try things out again and he wont. This is all i want. I just cant let go. 

Alcohol used to work for all my problems. But not this one. I seriouslt dont know what else to do. I dont want to feel this pain anymore.
