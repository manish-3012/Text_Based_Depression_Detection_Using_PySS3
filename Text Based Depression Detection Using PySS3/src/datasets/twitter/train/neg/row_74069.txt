I don't think I can healI really wish to stop existing right now. 
I hava been physically abused when i was a child
I am also being mentally abused since my first day on earth.
I am used as a servant 24/7.
I don't have friends my abuser doesn't let me.
I have major depression, anxiety, panic attacks, ocd, paranoia

I don't think I can fix the harm that has been going on for 21 years. I'm extremely sad I don't have anyone to talk. I cannot think of a reason to live
