Falling apartFuck it this is not a trough away. I don't care. My wife is gone for a week were not doing well at all. I am 99.9% sure she's cheating. Fuck it. I'm with my two kids which i love dearly. I have no family but a grandmother and grandfather and 2 sisters that are very younger than i. I'm not poor but i am drowning in debt. I. Am starting to see no way out. People will morn me for a few months then everyone can go on with their lives. The question that I've been struggling with the last few months is "will i actually be doing people a favour" and it looks like yes i will be removing myself from the picture and stop holding every one back. So any suggestions from you guys? Any words of "help". I'm at the end of what i can handle right now.
