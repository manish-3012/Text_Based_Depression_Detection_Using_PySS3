pretty sure I'm going to hang myself tomorrow.If anyone has followed my posts ever (some I probably deleted) then it will be obvious that I hate myself. I HATE myself.

Barely had any real friends.

Horrible school experience.

The only one in my family who hasn't gotten into a prestigious university. How much my mental health is to blame I don't know. The fact is I haven't achieved shit in their eyes, and now mine. Plus my subject choice was picked purely with the intention of trying to "fix" myself (psychology) while everyone else is picking things based on real interests because they're not broken and so developmentally stunted.

Constantly distracted by my list of women I wish were my real mother.

Never been in a relationship and never will because I just have "you're a RETARD" blaring in my head.

Sent a thank you message to a teacher I once had but she probably doesn't want to hear it - or I shouldn't have sent it/I said the wrong thing in it, as I usually do.

My therapist just lies to me when he says "it's not your fault" when with everything that has happened, it clearly fucking is. No one goes through 13 years of being the weird retarded gross messy kid if they \*didn't\* deserve rape.

I'm done.
