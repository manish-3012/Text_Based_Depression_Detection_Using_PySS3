Today is the day, no more waiting for something to changeI'm too fucking exhausted to type out the whole story again, but basically I'm fucking hideous and unlovable, I don't enjoy anything except drugs, which I know aren't a substitute for real happiness but it's all I have. I've been trying to work up the courage to do it for a long time, and now that I have the opportunity I'm going to take it. I'm not sure exactly when but I really don't want to wake up tomorrow
