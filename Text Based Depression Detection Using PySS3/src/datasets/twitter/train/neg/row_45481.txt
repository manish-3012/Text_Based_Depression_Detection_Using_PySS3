I gave up on life 5 years ago and donâ€™t leave the house because Iâ€™m Ugly...Iâ€™m male, aged 30 (look younger) 182cm tall (1cm under 6ft) skinny af lanky with long legs etc, pale with a receding hairline and a kissless virgin (never touched a girl or even had more than a few words spoken to me by one)  So yea in the looks department itâ€™s over. I never leave the house and havnt since 2015. Between 2012-2015 I had a bar job,I had girls like me and I wasnâ€™t ugly to some ppl.  I got older and ugly.  I met some amazing people but also some horrors. Horrible women whoâ€™d call me ugly and treat me like shit for it and these were the staff and managers I worked with. The good looking guys could do no wrong and when they fucked up it was pinned on me so many times by a fat ugly overweight bitch.

â—¾ï¸Heres an example: I serve a table of 6 â€˜ladiesâ€™ in their 40s food and try being polite and helpfully nice as I can. Not one of them says thanks and they practically snatch the cutlery and plates of food from my hands when I pass it to them. When they finished eating a good looking guy I work with went over to get the plates and they stacked the plates up for him weâ€™re all saying thanks and weâ€™re laughing and joking with him he was there for a few minutes.  Fucking hags.â—¾ï¸


 In the end I got fed up and left and havnt left the house since to let ageing hit me like a train.


 I do go out to work at football stadiums as a steward and thatâ€™s the same, women staring me down because Iâ€™m skinny like itâ€™s my  fault theyâ€™re fat. Other guys I work with staring at me with a â€˜wtf is thatâ€™ face and overweight short girls calling me a â€˜Mingâ€™ (whatever that means) itâ€™s great when say for example an older male will pass conversation to me and be very friendly and I think â€˜itâ€™s nice when someone looks past what I look likeâ€™. Itâ€™s funny how I succumbed to judging peopleâ€™s niceness to how they judge me on my looks or not. but there isnâ€™t many like that about. I eat to gain weight my face goes fat and rounder but thinner I feel better. Still hidoeus nevertheless. A comment on here once I asked about my hair one comment said â€˜heâ€™s clearly balding and hidoeus btwâ€™ and it got upvoted 17 times. I drink whiskey every night watching cartoons  and Iâ€™m starting to get chest pains. 

Also the only girl who ever liked me was in 2014 which is 6 years ago tomorrow. She was gorgeous too.
She worked in the bar with me. Damn I miss her so bad. Take me back To then please 

I basically live upstairs watching Netflix everyday and smoking weed in a house waiting to die while seeing other guys my age or younger/older have looks on their side and a life to go with it. Funny how most of them are cocky as hell and very arrogant and the girls love it. I have a friend whos like that heâ€™s cocky as hell and thinks every girls he walks past fancies him and you wouldnâ€™t believe how the girls love that persona on him too. 

Itâ€™s not about getting Girls for me, but I could care less about not getting sex tbh etc itâ€™s juts the restricted life I have because Iâ€™m ugly and seeing good looking dudes treated better even when theyâ€™re complete cocky arrogant assoles. 

Lookism man
