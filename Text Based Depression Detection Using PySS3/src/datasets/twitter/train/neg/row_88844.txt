I'm ashamed of myselfI've always had a big sense of shame, a deep embarrassment about anything I can't do well. I've been used to quitting and never going back again when I start failing at something, ever since I was a kid. This means that I only got good at very few things. I'm 24 now and I'm failing university hard. I've been too scared of failure and embarrassment to take my driver's license. I rely far too much on my mother and now I'm starting to feel like I failed at life. And as usual my first response, my first instinct, is to just quit and never go back. I'm not serious about it right now but the thought have been getting more and more insisting. I'm so ashamed of myself for failing I don't want to see anyone. I try to keep up the facade but the shame is so much it's poisoning my life, as I've been taught I'm constantly judged this perceived judgement feels heavy every second of my life. I can't go through a conversation with anyone without wondering if they're internally thinking of what a failure I'm showing to be. I wonder if they laugh about me behind my back. If they speak ill of me. And it's killing me. I want to disappear.
