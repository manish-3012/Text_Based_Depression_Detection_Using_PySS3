My friend told me that I don't have the guts to kill myself.All of my friends are like this. I've never had a true friend. They use me to rant and everything, but are nowhere to return the favor. One of my friends hung up on me when I was suicidal and lost. The other one told me this. I hate my life. I've tried to be as kind as I can be to people. Always helped them in whatever way I can, but this is what I get in return. I don't want to live in this world anymore.
