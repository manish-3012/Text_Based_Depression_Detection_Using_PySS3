I triedI don't know why I try to help myself, like I want to live but looking at everything that's happening to me is just telling me to give up. I tried  getting counselling but it doesn't feel any different and since I went to my university's counselling office, my university decided to postpone my studies and tell me to take a break for the semester. So now I don't have anything to distract myself from these thoughts. I decided that if I don't find any reason to live I'll just end myself somewhere around the end of this year.

I don't really get why I'm feeling this way. It's not like I have a tragic experience or anything. I just wanted to die one day and I couldn't get rid of the thought. It's confusing.
