TiredI'm under a lot of heavy stress, I posted to /r/relationships and everyone told me I was a horrible husband, and so on... I have struggled with suicidal thoughts for a long time and it may seem silly to be that affected by strangers on the Internet, but I am so tired and everything seems huge lately... I know my wife is better off without me, that is undeniable. I could even make it look like a work accident, as I am a firefighter. She wouldn't know. It would be so. Fucking. Easy. And I have good life insurance. She would be set. I don't think I will but who the hell knows if I don't find my way out of the next fire.
