I fucked up for the last timeI had a great thing. I ruined it. Its irreversable. No matter how hard I beg, I cannot get it back. I let my pride, I let my anger get in the way of the best thing to ever come into my life. I am a rash and impulsive person. I have always been that. I always will be that. Ive been a notorious hothead my entire life. I do this everytime with everything. There is no reason to think this will ever change. I  will fuck up every good thing that happens to me. There is no hope. There are no escapes.
