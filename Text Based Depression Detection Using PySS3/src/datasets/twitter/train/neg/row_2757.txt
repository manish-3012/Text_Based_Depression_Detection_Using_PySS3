What to do when the time is upIt's a rhetorical question. Although I think it's really telling that on what I hope to be the last day of my life (God, give me strength to finish the job) I have nothing to do barring the necessary preparations: no Last Meal, no final grandiose words to people I know (I saved those for postmortem), I'm not going to contemplate the beauty of nature for the last time or something like that. Just nothing. This nothingness on the last day justifies suicide on its own it looks to me.


So just going to waste the last few hours in the same way I wasted my whole life I suppose.
