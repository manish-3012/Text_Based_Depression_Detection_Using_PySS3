Just don't want it anymoreThe title says it all. That's the sum of it. I don't want it anymore. Life. I'm done. Each day is harder and harder to get through. I can't make it through another. The thought of it makes me sick to my stomach and my eyes fill with tears. Every day I come home from work and lay down on the couch and stare off into space. I have nothing left to give. Everyone has taken all I have. I don't want life anymore. Everything has lost it's beauty. I feel no joy. This isn't for me. I just don't want it anymore.
