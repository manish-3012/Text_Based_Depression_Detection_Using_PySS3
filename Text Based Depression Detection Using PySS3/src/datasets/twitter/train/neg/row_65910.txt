wish someone would just put me in the ground already :/I fucking hate the fact that I had to be born at such a time to allow me to live through this hellhole of a time period. I had no say in anything leading up to the current situation and presently thereâ€™s not a damn thing I can do to help ANYONE and I have a number of my own issues to sort out that I just...donâ€™t have the energy to deal with anymore because Iâ€™m so burnt out and exhausted from all the shit I see in the news. Iâ€™m only alive because I know my mom would be sad if I ended it. If she didnâ€™t act like she loved me I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be typing this. 

Not sure where I was going with this. Iâ€™m tired as shit rn and most of my rather insignificant and petty issues can be summed up w posts Iâ€™ve made earlier todayðŸ¤· feel free to make fun of em to ur heartâ€™s desire or whatever I really donâ€™t have the energy to give a shit anymore.
