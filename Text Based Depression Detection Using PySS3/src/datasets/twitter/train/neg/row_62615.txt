I have decided to kill myself,thanks redditors who tried to help me. hi dear redditors i have been struggling with this depression now for like 2 years and when i joined college it just beacme worse and worse and i can't take it anymore i have failed my first year in college and failed my parents i dont have any chances of becoming something good in the future i have tried fighting this depression but i failed (im only good at failing) i know im being a coward and my title is such an attention whore title but please forgive me dear redditors alot of u tried to help me but i failed every single one of you,the only thing i will regret when i kill myself is that my little brother would become sad,he is the most important thing in my entire life i would pick him before my mom or dad any day  
but i hope he forgives me i know he wont forgive me now but when he see this bully of a world at least he will understand why i did it.its funny cause in junior school i used to be the smartest kid in the whole school and i used to help alot of my friends in exams which led to the teacher to make me take the test in a empty class alone by myself so i dont help anyone but porn have destroyed me and getting bullied made it worse and being an introvert is bad too  
thanks dear redditors for reading this,i wish you sucess in you live and that you marry the true love in your life
