I want to kill myself so badly but I'm a fucking cowardNo one would care and i'm so angry that they don't. A part of me wants to kill myself so they can suffer and regret not caring about me. Also i just hate my life and my entire existence so there's no point continuing. But i'm too fucking scared to do it. As much as i want to, i'm still a human and death is scary. Fuck. I wish i could get over this fear so i can hurry up and kill myself already.
