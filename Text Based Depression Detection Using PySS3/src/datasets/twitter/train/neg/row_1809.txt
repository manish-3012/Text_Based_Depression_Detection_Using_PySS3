When it becomes too muchI know the way I think and behave isnâ€™t healthy, so when I recognize these feelings I act upon myself to stop it. I threw away all of my razors and lighters and remind myself that if I hurt myself, odds are my boyfriend will notice and I donâ€™t want to drag him into this. But sometimes the urge to scratch/burn/cut/punch becomes too overbearing and it mentally drains me to contain it. I canâ€™t take this feeling anymore and I know I should seek professional help, but a therapist in this economy? Iâ€™m only 19
