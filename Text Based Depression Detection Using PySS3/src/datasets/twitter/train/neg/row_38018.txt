My house is a messI live in a one bedroom apartment with a cat i foster. Its a mess and i dont cook or bake anymore. Im never home. I wander the city because anything is better than going home and being confronted with the mess. I do litter, food and water bowls, keep the cat happy. My bedroom is littered with clothes and my livingroom is covered in garbage. Whats the quickest way to end my life without scarring someone with a mangled corpse LOL
