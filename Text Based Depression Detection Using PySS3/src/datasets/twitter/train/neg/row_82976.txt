Helping a friendMy closest friend tried to kill herself a couple of weeks ago. She survived but has been left with injuries that may not be debilitating but could be lifelong.  I was initially so relieved that sheâ€™d survived and seemed okay. However, she still had the feelings that made her want to do it in the first place and her injuries have added to her problems. I try to be as supportive as possible and give her as much hope as possible - I can see that she agrees with what I say but I can also tell that she doesnâ€™t feel it.  Has anyone else helped or is anyone else helping a suicidal friend? What is the best approach to take?
