I donâ€™t want to do it but I have to.Thereâ€™s a reason why i hate myself, my mother asks me all the time yet doesnâ€™t actually care and talks shit about me and my siblings behind our backs. Now I donâ€™t know about you but i didnâ€™t ask to be brought into this world. Especially not with consequences and problems that keep on building and building for myself unintentionally. I hate living itâ€™s not really fun, especially as a 16 year old that is just expected to be an adult just because â€œyouâ€™re old enoughâ€, most of my life i havenâ€™t really had a childhood, i missed out on having a dad most of my life (8 years of my life actually) heâ€™s been in prison since i was 8, my mom doesnâ€™t like him at all when heâ€™s way more accepting and way more caring and understanding than she is or will ever be. Iâ€™m sorry i feel like iâ€™m just going on a tangent now let me fill you in on something real quick before i continue. Iâ€™m transgender, transmale actually, so for those of you who are too dense to realize what transmale is it just means i go by male pronouns and that iâ€™m a man instead of a female. So anyways where was I, right, i hate myself, my life, and iâ€™m probably going to either be dead before school starts just because i canâ€™t take this shit and arenâ€™t even able to have a normal summer as a kid before i turn 18. I see no point in really trying to reason with myself at all to see what i have or could potentially have in my life to make it better but i can only think of my father when it comes to that but heâ€™s not even here to help me or give me advice. Other than him i donâ€™t have anything to live for other than my false hopes and dreams that have been just demolished by the evil monster that could give a shit about me. I really want to kill myself right now but what i have beside me isnâ€™t going to work as iâ€™m in my room and donâ€™t want to stab myself as i donâ€™t know how to brace myself for the impact and i feel like if i went down that route i would get too weak and not really hit anything important. i only have two tablets of ibuprofen left so that wonâ€™t do me any and plus iâ€™ve read that it wonâ€™t even come close to killing you if you downed a whole bottle. I could resort to cutting again for now but i canâ€™t taking living anymore, i feel like my death needs to happen right now. I just want to die already. I hate living and being forced to not have a childhood. I love how she claims she cares but in reality is only saying that just because iâ€™m her child and lying is always the best option when it comes to understanding and pleasing your children. I donâ€™t know where iâ€™m going with this as iâ€™ve lost track, and feel like complete shit from crying and thinking. I promise you to whoever is reading this, iâ€™m not writing all of this for sympathy and empathy, iâ€™m writing this because it sucks when you wake up and hear your own mother bitching about you and your siblings, even the ones that donâ€™t speak to you frequently. I just feel like iâ€™ve been lied to and betrayed by my own flesh and blood. thanks for reading i guess if you even made it this far idk
