leaving people behindI can't talk about this stuff anywhere I may kill myself when I get to my goal weight. I don't want to live with the loose skin, it's too disgusting. I don't want to be repulsive and unlovable and covered in rashes and wrinkles and infections. I want to at least achieve my goal before I die. But then after I see what I need to see on the scale, I will buy a gun.

  
But at the same time, I am worried about people being upset when I die. I don't love them enough to want to stick around. But I don't want them to hurt at all. And they will be sad for sure. Do I leave a note? I have no idea how to plan for this. I feel sad to imagine my poor niece missing me. Or my confused friends. Or my mom or my husband. I hope they can just be cool and be okay with it. 

  
(Just in case anyone reads this: no, I don't have money for surgery, yes even if it's in another country.)
