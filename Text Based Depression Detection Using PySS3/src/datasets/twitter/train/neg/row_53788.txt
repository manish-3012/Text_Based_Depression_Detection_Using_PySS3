why am i heremy world is falling apart, hypothetical brick by hypothetical brick. and nobody cares either. 

i donâ€™t have friends, they all leave.

iâ€™m lonely constantly.

i want reasons to go through with it. more reasons than the usual. i just canâ€™t do this anymore.  i donâ€™t want it . i donâ€™t want to exist. i donâ€™t want this mortal vessel. i want to die.
