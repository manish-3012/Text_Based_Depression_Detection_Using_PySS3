In Just A Moment (Poem)In just a moment, I was a child/

I opened my eyes and saw the world/

In just a moment, I was a little older/

I was still protected, from the world/

Opportunity, imagination, all sorts of adventure/

Life was joyous and the future was bright/

Fast forward to early adulthood and I saw a dimmer light/

Have hope they say, it'll be alright/

Until the light, is far out of sight/

My neighbor got killed, the cop did him wrong/

Yet the world watched, and played along/

My girlfriend cheated, so did the other/

So did the other, and the other, and the other/

In just a moment, you tried to be in power/

Assuming a false arrest would take over my being/

Yet I came out the other side, and made it through/

But deep inside, it wasn't because of you/

It's myself and how I'm feeling/

"I feel alone in a room full of my favorite people" - Tara Condell

I'm about to be free and let my soul ease/

Into another dimension to sore the seas/

Or wherever it may, I hope I rest/

And God please forgive me, for I did my best/

Please don't remember my final act/

But for the things I did and for the morals I stood.

The debt is over, now I will pay myself/

I hope to see all the kind souls that have departed way too soon.

In just a moment.

Love.
