iâ€™m so fucking uselessitâ€™s been a while since i last posted here, mostly because i thought i could handle things right now

spoiler alert: i can't. 


i annoyed my best friend without even meaning to and i apologise too much for her to even want to listen, it was a misunderstanding but i still didn't communicate with her well and i don't know how to fix it. i'm a waste of space, let's face it.


i'm so consistently a failure that i'll probably fuck up trying to kill myself but i stopped caring after the second attempt. oh well.

i'm just too fucking sensitive for my own good and it's killing me
