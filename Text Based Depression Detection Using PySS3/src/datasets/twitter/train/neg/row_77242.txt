My friend killed himself on Christmas.I'm at work and found out. He was one of the few people in my small town who politically left leaning like myself so we would always talk about things like that and our lives. He got divorced a few months ago after 20+ years in a marriage, but he was always talking about how great his granddaughter was and even though he was in a dark place, she kept him going.

They found him Christmas morning in his parents garage hanging. I wish I would have done something more. 

I'm at work, so I'm fine, but I know once I'm in my quiet house I'm going to have bad thoughts. Has anyone else went through something like this?
