Taking off my alert bracelet.It's a fabric bracelet with a metal plate on it. Has my husband's contact details, my name, the words AUTISM, PLEASE BE PATIENT.

It's got me returned home four times when I've tried to spare feelings and run away to have an accident. I forget about it until a well-meaning passer by or policeman sees the medical alert symbol.

I'd call Samaritans but I'd be practically indecipherable through my disgusting slushy lisp that makes everyone assume I'm low functioning and backwards instead of the opposite and troubled. I made the stupid bracelet for when I'm not in my right mind.

I'm sick of being seen as slow. I'm sick of seeing the uncomfortable look on peoples faces when I start speaking with my slurry, pressured speech. It's worse when I notice this and the stress pressures the speech more.

I'm 20 and apparently since nobody helped me cure it as a child, it's not important as an adult as I've learned to live with it.

I've been sick for a long time and I feel guilty that my catalyst for anonymous suicide is speech, but I can only take so much. I'm alone till noon tomorrow.
