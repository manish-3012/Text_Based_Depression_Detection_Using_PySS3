Fuck my life final textWatching people go Places You Can't afford, watch Them buy stuff You Can't afford, do things You Can't afford.. over and over Just to feel a artifical need for acceptance. I'm tired of my life, i'm stuck and Can't do shot. I m ending it soon. Fuck girls that sell themself online - i Can't do shit, fuck SJWS (where is my voice) i'm the one sitting at home no one cares About me, i'm thinking About Doing a crime, i'm tired of whores that lure men and deluted mods on Twitch That silence us who are right, Fuck it i'm Doing it.
