There's a hole in my heart that I dont think I'm ever gonna fillI keep trying and trying to be happy, be it with someone or on my own, and it's not working. My parents dont show me that much affection, nobody'll give me a chance anymore. Hell, most people wont give me a chance in the first place. I didn't get that much attention from my parents when I was younger, and I guess in trying to fill the void that was left there, I've just been hurting myself more. It feels like there's only really two options: find someone who'll love me for me (which I doubt will happen) or kill myself. I'm in so much emotional pain and quite a bit of physical pain and I just want it to end.
