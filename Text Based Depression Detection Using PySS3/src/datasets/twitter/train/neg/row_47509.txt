Toying with the idea of suicideI spent my 17th birthday with a bimbo who just wanted a free dinner. Then I went home alone got drunk and cried because I have to pay for someone to wanna spend time with me. I don't wanna kill myself but I feel like it's the only form of redemption and im afraid ill go down a self destructive path. I must be fucking repulsive.
