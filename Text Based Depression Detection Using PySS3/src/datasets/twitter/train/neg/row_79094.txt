My total list of reasons to do it before I hit adulthood, and my reasons to do it. Not sure which to go for.DO IT:

- Neuroatypicality. I'm a generic cluster B personality disorder of some type. This is not something that can be cured or aided in my current state. This causes a lot of suffering, pain and confusion and severely limits my enjoyment of life. I'll never understand what it's like to have a normal brain, but I do understand it's better than this. Mood swings. Severe irritability. Inability to relate to others. Simultaneous hatred and yet love of myself. Dissatisfaction with things that are not completely perfect. Impulsivity. Criminal behaviour. Easily distracted/difficulty focusing. Etc, etc.

- The future. Uncertainty. I could be kidnapped tomorrow and made a rapeslave. I could (and with my shit brain, there's a chance I will) end up a drug addict criminal. A wageslave working a dead end job with too many comittments to end it. A vegetable. An acid attack survivor. But on the flip side, I could also end up a famous millionaire. 

- Ugliness. I am disgusting to look at. I want to be beautiful. I want men to fall in love with me. I want to be able to look at myself and feel proud of this body that I inhabit. I can't. And my face itself - as well as being horrific - is a reminder of what's forever out of reach. 

- Lack of effort. Most of the time, I have very little motivation or feeling of obligation to do things that come easily to most people. 

- I have no core. Most people have a near constant morality, near constant likes/dislikes, near constant demeanour. I am a new person every month. It's like I've already died.

- Permanent sleep just sounds nice. 

DONT: 

- Spite. I don't want my enemies thinking of me as weak. I don't want to be thought of as Suicide Girl. I won't be around to experience it, but I can consciously understand the things that will happen, and I do NOT want that.

- No more pleasure. I like pleasure. I can't get that if I'm dead. It's like picking between a fluctuation between -1 and +1 or  0.

- All of this suffering will have been for nothing. My existence will have been for nothing. What seems like a great setup will fall flat into darkness.

- My pet rats. They sort of hate me, but I'm the only one willing to care for them. They won't be "mine" if I die, but you get the point.


I don't know. I'm at a loss here. What do I do and why? I won't take offence if you think I should off myself (although you should PM so you don't get banned). Thankyou.
