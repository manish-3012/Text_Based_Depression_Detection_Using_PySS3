I almost died last nightI overdosed and didn't throw it up this time. I started to twitch badly. I hit my head on the walls and even fell off the bed and bent my neck. Thing is, I hate life. Just seems like nothing works. 

Delete this post if it's not allowed. I just need to vent. I saw a white light in the dark. Anyone else seen this?
