I finally did it.I had several panic attacks and i just couldn't stand the pain.

I was shaking all over, pain, confusion, rage.

I tried it. I did it.

All I could think about was just getting away from the pain.

I felt trapped and i just stopped giving a fuck anymore about the consequences...

Obviously it didn't work. I thought it would.

I cried when i woke up.

I'm happy but also fucking pissed. I know its a gamble.. I know its a risk. I just don't want to be afraid of that risk. I just want to get out.

But because It didn't work.. It made me realize there is good.

It's not my time yet. 

So I started a list. A list to get me the hell away from this house, from these people who couldn't care less if I died.

This relentless emotional/physical pain. 

I know life can be beautiful. I've had amazing days. They were short but they happened.

I just didn't want to see them..

I can't say im happy, I wish I could smile. But making this list. 

Realizing its possible. Realizing if I just accept the nervousness and the anxety and the shittyness as a whole. That it's ok..to not be ok. 

I can actually think. I can fucking breathe.

So I encourage anyone feeling this way, and feeling alone, to make a list.

If you don't want to write, make it in your head.

A plan that makes you happy. Start small and then do everything you can to get there.

I'm sorry this was so long. I just really needed to tell someone. You're not alone, i get it.. 

I hate that I get it, but i do.

I'll leave you with this. I wrote it a long time ago, and I've been rereading it all day..

(Only \*you\* can make things better for yourself. If you aren't happy make yourself happy. Get rid of the people and things that make you upset. (leave them or drop them) Things wont get better until you have a better outlook. You have to believe its possible, and do it. Things get better, you can make them better)
