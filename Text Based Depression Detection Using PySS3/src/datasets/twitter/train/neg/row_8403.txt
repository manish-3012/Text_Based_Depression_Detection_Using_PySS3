The inevitable...I can't sub to this Reddit or I'll spend too much time reading about others suicide thoughts and then tens times longer thinking about them. 
Anyway I've comfortably come to the decision my life will end at my own doing. What bothers me rather profoundly is the when. This year, next year, tomorrow or next week. Fortunately I've not had a feeling when I know it's today. I fear that. I don't even know why. Maybe it will be a regrettable decision and ofcourse it's too late by then. Maybe it won't be a decision at all and more of a desperate reaction to the darkness of my mind.  Does anyone else think this way?
Talk about mental health they say. Next joke.
