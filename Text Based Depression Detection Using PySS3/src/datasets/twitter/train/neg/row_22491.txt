I'm just really tired.I'm not going to commit suicide so maybe this is being posted in the wrong place but if a car were to hit me, or if someone shot me dead, or if some other event were to end my life. I wouldn't complain. 

Guess that means I'm just a coward who hopes to pin my death on someone other than myself. But at the point where I am, I don't feel sad, depressed, angry, alone, or any other feelings that people who have it much worse than I have. I just feel so tired. From when I wake up to when I go to bed. Tired of life, tired of who I am as a person, tired of what a waste I've become and just tired in general. And, I'm really tired of being tired.
