What motivates you to stay healthy?I... have a m decently ok at helping people (who want help) but I can't seem to help myself.  It's like I almost need someone to do it back for me, talk me past my own stubbornness and self destructiveness, and... just with all I've had to deal with in life... I always expect people to leave.  In some cases when it becomes obvious they barely have time for me, I kind of leave to spare myself the final "yeah I'm leaving" thing though I am pretty much dedicating myself to not doing that anymore.

But the point is I have been doing very unhealthy things lately.  Eating like pure garbage.  Smoking a little.  I don't feel good that's for sure.  And I don't know how to motivate myself to take care of myself.  It's like I don't see the point in it if I expect people to leave anyway.  It's getting to the point where this will kill me eventually so any advice would be gratefully accepted.
