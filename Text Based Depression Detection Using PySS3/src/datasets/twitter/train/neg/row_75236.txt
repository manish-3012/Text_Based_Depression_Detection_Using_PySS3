Sexual Assault ruined my life, and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever feel clean againFirst time on this sub (17f) and I donâ€™t think anyone will even see this

I really thought this year would be better, I really did.
I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting this Iâ€™m just so fucking lonely and tired of the ptsd. Im so embarrassed about how fake I am. Everyone thinks Iâ€™m fine and over it when Iâ€™m so clearly not, even after multiple calls for help to my parents, therapist, suicide hotlines

I donâ€™t even feel sad thinking about my childhood sexual assault just rage towards every man I see and fear of every man that looks like him. I want them to ache like I ache and feel as used as I do. 

If there is a god he better have a good reason for how much suffering Iâ€™ve gone through or else Iâ€™m going to rip out his fucking eyes
