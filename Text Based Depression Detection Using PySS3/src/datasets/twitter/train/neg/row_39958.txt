Does anyone hope to die all the time?Does anyone else hope they died by accident all the time throughout the day? Do you play through little scenarios about getting into a car crash, getting stabbed by a mugger, getting shot, etc etc?

On my commute for example I'm always wishing someone would come the wrong way head on into me and that would be that! 

Ahh wishful thinking....
