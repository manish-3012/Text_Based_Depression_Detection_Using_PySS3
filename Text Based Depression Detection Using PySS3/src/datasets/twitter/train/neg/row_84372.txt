Isn't it hard sometimes?You know there's people that make you so happy, but things just seem so difficult you think it's better if you're dead. I feel like I have no drive for life what so ever now. Everything seem so bland and dull, there's nothing that sparks something in me anymore. I really don't want to feel like this anymore, I don't know how to stop feeling like this. I just feel so empty and feel like I'm existing than really living.
