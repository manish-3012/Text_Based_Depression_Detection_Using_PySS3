Hi I have bipolar disorder.Hi, I'm Mary. I'm a 20yo girl and I have bipolar disorder. Even with weekly therapy, DBT treatment and medication I can't stop it from destroying my life. Things got a little better for a while but life got super stressful and I have episodes so much. I can't stop feeling guilty about it but I can't stop the episodes. I was at my exes house today because we were going to try to work it out. I found someone else's bra in his room and I'm so heartbroken. It's going to cause me to have another episode. I feel it coming and I can't stop it. I want this to end. I can't take it anymore.
