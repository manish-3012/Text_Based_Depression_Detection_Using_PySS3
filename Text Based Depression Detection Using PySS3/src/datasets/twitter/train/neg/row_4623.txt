I think I'm gonna do itI managed to push away the girl of my dreams with my controlling and manipulative behavior. She just told me how she absolutely hates me and that I'm a shitty human being and I agree.  I don't see any reason to keep going. I feel unwanted by everyone in my life and ive felt this way for too long. I'm 18 and I've ruined everything I had going for myself and don't have the will to keep trying. I wish I wasn't the way I am so people would like being around me. I wish I didn't feel so alone and I wish I never existed. I have my final day planned very soon and I've never been so sure of something in my life. I know I'll never get over myself ruining everything I had with the person I love the most.
