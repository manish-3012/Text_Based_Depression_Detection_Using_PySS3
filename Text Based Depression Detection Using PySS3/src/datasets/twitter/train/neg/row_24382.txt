TiredI'm mentally tired, everyday it gets worse my will to live keeps getting less and less. I struggle to talk to people about this because my parents wont listen because technically I have a great life but yet I'm still depressed and constantly have suicidal thoughts everyday without fail. I fail to communicate my feelings with therapists and people In my life, because I push everyone away. I swear I just want to kill myself, I'm a pathetic excuse for an almost 27 year old. This time of year my depression worsens. Idk I'm just sad and want to die
