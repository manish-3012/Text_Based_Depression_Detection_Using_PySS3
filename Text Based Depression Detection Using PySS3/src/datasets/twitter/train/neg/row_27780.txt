I need help desperatelyI am a 46 soon to be 47 year old man.  My father died 10 years ago of cancer and the pain I feel from that still runs deep.  My mother who has been recently diagnosed with dementia has been living with me wife and I since he died.  

Iâ€™ve not been able to work in those 10 years because of my need to not be away from home for more than a few hours at a time due to my motherâ€™s health.  My wifeâ€™s job has been our soul source of income for she and I this whole time, and now she is leaving me.

My wife of 25 years is leaving me right now, when I am at my weakest and most vulnerable state, right when I need her the most.  Please understand that I am not trying to vilify her.  I am not blameless.  I have placed too much stress on her and on our relationship and she finally canâ€™t take it anymore.

Yesterday, my motherâ€™s doctor decided that she is not likely to be able to stay home any more.  My mother is being placed in a skilled nursing facility and when my wife is finally gone, I am going home alone.

Alone.  Unemployed.  No income.  No way out of this hell that I find myself in.  We live 45 minutes from the nearest town of note.  I havenâ€™t had much of any contact with any friends in so long that I can no longer reasonably call them friends.  I am alone in the world.  And I donâ€™t think that I can handle it.  All of this at once.  It is too much.  My world has ended.  

Please someone help me.  I donâ€™t know what to do.  I am lost.

UPDATE
Iâ€™ve spoken to my primary care doctor and heâ€™s convinced to check myself into the ER.  I want to thank everyone here for helping me take this step forward and not take my life.  The pain hasnâ€™t ended but I am going to get help.  Thank you all.
