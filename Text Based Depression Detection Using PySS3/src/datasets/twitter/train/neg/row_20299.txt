Too mentally ill to continue living. Too much damage has already been done. Realistically, what sort of opportunities do I even have?* I have a plethora of mental illnesses that have been progressively getting worse and worse. My abilities to function at work, drive, focus on things, and have conversations have taken a nosedive.
* My physical health has started to take a tumble as well. My metabolism has noticeably slowed down, I'm exhausted more frequently, I have moments of "brain fog" and forgetfulness, and I'm unable to distract or pacify myself with entertainment.
* I'm uninsured and unable to get any type of treatment for my issues. I almost went broke seeking therapy previously, and it didn't work in the slightest. I cannot afford any type of medication, any type of hospital visit, and certainly any insurance.
* I'm in danger of losing my job and despite looking for jobs all over the place, I can't find any that would pay well. I have plenty of work experience and some relevant skills, but I'm underqualified for most 'real' jobs. The aforementioned mental illnesses and inability to drive are also a major factor in this.
* Due to my faculties getting worse, I'm unable to learn things and learn skills. I've tried a number of different creative hobbies to no avail. I've tried getting into computer programming, music, writing, among other things, all to no avail.
* I have no friends or family. My only relative is a parent I live with who is also mentally ill, who treats me as if I'm some sort of high-functioning special needs child. I'm stuck in a toxic relationship which is draining the energy out of me, and making me only more exhausted and anxious. I have a perpetual fear of my partner.
* I'm getting old and I've had a fraction of the life experiences and knowledge that people 5-10 years younger than me do. I'm constantly embarrassed by my age and how I've achieved and amounted to nothing, not only compared to my peers, but compared to teenagers at this point.
* I'm sexually "broken" and unable to fully enjoy intimacy. Because of this, my relationship is strained, and I'm deathly afraid of the prospect of finding another relationship, because I know nobody will want to deal with someone like me in this situation, especially considered all my other problems.

Everything is getting so much worse in such a short span of time.
