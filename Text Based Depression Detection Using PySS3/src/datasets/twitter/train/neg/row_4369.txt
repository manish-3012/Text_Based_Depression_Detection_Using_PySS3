Worst loser everI sometimes wonder if there are any others who are as horrible as I am at life. I've had severe depression for decades and my life experience is less than that of a 15 year old boy. I recently turned 34 but have never drove a car, kissed a girl, or had a job. It's too late, but I never had a chance anyway.  


 I fantasize about death constantly. I wish a serial killer would put me out of my misery. I beseech God day-in day-out for rest from this absolute Hell. I know it's insane to think any Gods exist, but it's somewhat of a helpful cope, as I don't have ANY family or friends, so begging the ether for annihilation is a good second best.

Medication doesn't work for me; it just dulls my brain and makes me more weary of life than I already am. Heroin works pretty well, but it's too damn expensive and I'm already a poor slob who goes days without eating (no money for food when you're a welfare loser.)

I think I'm starting to get health problems (circulation, infections) from not taking care of myself. Hopefully that'll kill me soon.   


Have a wonderful midsummers, ya'll.
