Every day is worseToo much fucking stress from online school, exams every other week, too much work.

I wake up with less energy every day I go to sleep way earlier than before and I still get no sleep I think Iâ€™m dying in the inside, itâ€™s getting out of my hands, too much for me too handle. Every day I think much more seriously about those negative thoughts.
