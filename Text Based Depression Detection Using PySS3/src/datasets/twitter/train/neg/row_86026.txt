I don't care about my life. Everything just feels like I'm just going through the motions but not really living.When I was 18 I got raped. After that my mental health spiralled. I have a lovely bf of two years whom I adore but honestly I just don't feel alive. Yesterday my car nearly got into a wreck and I didn't care. I could've died but I didn't care. No therapy in my area cause the school therapists said I have too much trauma. 

I eat a lot even though I'm trying to lose weight because I probably won't lose weight and fuck I'm probably gonna end up offing myself eventually either way. My parents don't care. I have no friends. And I can't even leave my parents toxic home until a year from now when my bf is ready. 

I want to care but I dont know how. All I know is that I don't care about my life.
