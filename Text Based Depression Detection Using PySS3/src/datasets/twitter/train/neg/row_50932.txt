Iâ€™m at the end of my rope hereI feel like such a piece of shit. 

Iâ€™m tired of my depression and anxiety
 
Iâ€™m tired of telling a few of my friends and family about my problems because they have their own issues to deal with and I donâ€™t deserve to have them try and carry my burdens as well as their own.

Iâ€™m tired of sending out blatant cries for help and having most of my friends ignore them or think itâ€™s funny and that Iâ€™m trying to meme or something.

Iâ€™m tired of having to see a counselor and talking and telling them my problems but leaving not feeling any better even though I say â€œit was a good sessionâ€.

Iâ€™m tired of having mood swings from cripplingly depressed to enraged and irritable.

Iâ€™m tired of generally being emotionally dead to the point where I canâ€™t cry anymore if I feel sad.

Iâ€™m tired of remembering my rape and the pain and anxiety and depression it caused me.

Iâ€™m tired of hating myself because I let all this happen to me. I chose to be this â€œstone-coldâ€ figure because I didnâ€™t want to open up or trust anyone with how I really feel.

Iâ€™m tired of posting shit like this on my social media because itâ€™s nice at first but my feelings generally never change.

Iâ€™m tired of being alone because I donâ€™t want anyone to have to deal with my issues and just choosing to be alone instead.

Iâ€™m tired.
And I just want it to end.
Maybe it will be later tonight, or a few days from now.
I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™ll have the guts to go through with it.
Maybe Iâ€™ll just drive off into the horizon and never look back.
Probably not though, killing myself is a lot easier.

I think Iâ€™m done.
