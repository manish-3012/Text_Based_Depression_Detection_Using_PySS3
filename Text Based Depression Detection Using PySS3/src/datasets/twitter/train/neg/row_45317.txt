I wish suicide pacts were a bigger part of society here. I'm envious of people who just happen upon others willing to die together. I feel like I would be much more likely to actually take my life if I went out with someone.Just unfortunate. As far as I'm concerned i should be able to get my psychiatrist to kill me, or any of the dozens of health professionals i have. Someone here should be able to administer a lethal injection in the form of medically assisted suicide. Ive considered suicide by cop. Im just not violent enough to hurt anyone, so no go there. This system is so fucking broken, I'm never going to be fixed by it. Im either going to be a useless drain on resources my country doesnt have or I could just die now. Why is society anti suicide? I feel the right to death is as much a right as the right to life is.
