considering giving upI currently have nothing for me. My mom doesn't want me on medication because she thinks I've just been acting "lazy" and I need to "fix my habits" so I've stopped trying to get help from her. I don't have many friends, either. I don't have a problem making them, but I always seem to lose them easily which hurts me. I'm always stressed out by school (the people and work) so I've just been slacking recently. I can't focus on anything no matter how hard I try. My mom gets mad at me because I normally do very well in school, but I just can't do that anymore. I'm not sure if I have the balls to kill myself, but I get closer to it everyday. I don't really have anything to fight for. Some days I think about having a good future, but I'm not sure if I have the strength to make it to those good days. I overthink everything and I can't do anything. I feel useless. If I died, I could be easily replaced. I  know my family would be sad, but other than that I feel like I only have 1 friend who would genuinely care. I just don't feel like there's a point to anything.. But that's why I downloaded reddit. I know there's lots of people feeling what I feel, so I decided to give it a shot and just talk about it. I normally keep everything bottled up, and whenever I'm finally able to say something about it I just get ignored. Soo.. yeah.
