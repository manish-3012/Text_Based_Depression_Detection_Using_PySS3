â€œThe best slave doesnâ€™t know they are oneâ€This is my problem and a big root to my depression. Someone posted on here a few days ago, something like â€œwhy does it cost money to existâ€. Iâ€™ve been feeling that way my whole life.

People on the outside will see me as unmotivated- but I simply donâ€™t care for this world. I donâ€™t want a share in it. Canâ€™t take anything with u when u die, so why bother.

I never asked to be brought in this world- so why do I have to conform to these stupid stipulations?

I feel like we are all slaves. â€œOnly things certain in life are death and taxesâ€. I donâ€™t think anyone can change my mind, for my sake, I wish they could. But I have felt this way for so long. Like, there is no difference between a home owner and a renter- if u donâ€™t pay property tax- your house gets taken away.

You have to pay money just to be in this planet. Only other option is to be homeless or nope the fuck out of this situation.
