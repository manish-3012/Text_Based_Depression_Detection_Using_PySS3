I don't want to dieI've struggled with suicidal ideation for longer than I remember, more than 10 years at least. I realized not long ago that I don't actually want to die, there is too much beauty in life, too much to do and see.  I don't want to live my life anymore. I don't like my memories, I don't like my day-to-day, I don't know if I like the people around me. 

I don't want to die, I want to kill my current self to be reinvented and I don't know what to do.
