Im done with this lifeFound a good sub to share my burden,
Until recently im living a good life, im 30yo, moved to bali island since august,
Work as chinese mandarin tourguide, with unstable income,but i felt so good, for the first time in my life i feel i can manage my own life,no need to live under anybody.
Nigthmare begin since nov, bali's mount agung eruption,
No more chinese tourist comes to.bali, since then until now i hav no job, no income,
More and more desperate when im running out money to living, i wake up on my dream life.
In my lowest point of my life, for the first time i dont.have anything to eat, my rent is coming, my phone bill, 
I realize in this world im all alone, some of fellow tourguide is back to their home, 
Im shivering, i dont have home to go back, 
Im.all alone, to survive, i sold my watch, tv to pay rent
Now more desperate really run out anything, maybe will sold my phone, me n my dog already 3 days not eat well,
I cant see the future ,maybe will kill my dog then i hang myself,
I felt so tired,,,,with everything, with my life, so many unhappy, abused childhood, not well educated, arggghhhhh!!!
