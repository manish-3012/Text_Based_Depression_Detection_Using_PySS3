I can't deal with this shit anymore.I feel sick. Got so much crap going down and I can only see one way out.

I hate myself so much, but admittedly for the most part I don't know why. I was bullied a lot as a child to the point that I didn't just believe that I was hideous and disgusting, but it was all I knew. I can't take compliments. I never believe people when they say them. Not even my own fiancÃ©. 

I have so many money problems that I can't cope. I can't even afford to pay for my prescriptions. I'm in so much debt with the bank that even when I get paid from work I have no money I can use. I can't pay bills and my partner can't cover then on his own. We're supposed to be going on holiday later this year but as it stands we can't afford to pay for our hotel, my passport,  or have any spending money. We're supposed to be planning our wedding but at this rate it is never going to happen. 

Because of this my health is suffering. I can't afford my antidepressants or my inhalers and I'm 99.9% certain my vaginismus is back and I can't go through all that shit again. I'm too ashamed to admit all this to anyone, let alone my GP.

I'm away from home for Easter and I have never felt so alone. I should just go throw myself in the river and be done with it.
