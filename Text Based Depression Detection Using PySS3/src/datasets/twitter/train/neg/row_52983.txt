Got broken up withSo I traveled 3000+ miles during a pandemic to meet a guy I thought loved me, only to get trapped there for an extra week because of wildfires and for him to break up with me over the phone the day after I got home, after sleeping on an airport floor. 

I spent so much money to get broken up with. He said he loved me and then told me he just said it because he didn't want to make the trip awkward.

Also, my best friend and I are going through a rough time. 

Also, I hate myself. Lol. 

I am. Just ready for it to be over. Genuinely. I tried to tell three of my friends. I told them "I'm not doing well, friend" more than once. I told them I was an 8 on the suicide scale. 

They listened but I don't think they understood how serious I am about ending it. 

I am so ready. 

I don't want to be here anymore. 

And before someone suggests that I'll feel better after a few days and that I'm feeling this way because big the break up -- I've been depressed and occasionally suicidal for almost a decade.  I'm tired of fighting. I think it's time.
