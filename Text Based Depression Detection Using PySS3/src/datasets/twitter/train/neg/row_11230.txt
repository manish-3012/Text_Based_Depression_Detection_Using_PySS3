How much agony is normal?Really, how much pain is expected to be tolerated? We all have a breaking point, whereâ€™s the happy medium?

I have been stuck in intense pain for extended periods of time without respite and thinking how long can I keep this up. Iâ€™m only human. The predicament is beyond my means of control, Iâ€™ve done all I can externally to change it for the better. 

The physical pain eventually bled into depression so now I have a cocktail of both to contend with. Hopelessness canâ€™t ever be conquered it seems, only mitigated time after time.
