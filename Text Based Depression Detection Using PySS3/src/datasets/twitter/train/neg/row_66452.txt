Best friend wrote a suicide note. Should I be worried?Iâ€™ve known my best friend isnâ€™t having the greatest time with her life but she confessed to me that she wrote a suicide note this week. I have no idea if she has plans on killing herself and going through with it. Because sheâ€™s tried cutting herself before but freaked out and never touched a razor again. Iâ€™m just really worried and Iâ€™ve never seen her so low. Is there anything I can do to help her?
