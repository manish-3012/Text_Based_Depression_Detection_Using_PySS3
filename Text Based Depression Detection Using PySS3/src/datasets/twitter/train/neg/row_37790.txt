Out of options.I've struggled with depression since I was fourteen I'm 24 now. Recently I've been really struggling with suicidal thoughts. I have no friends. I've never been in a relationship (although I honestly don't really care much for this It's the least of my problems). I have no motivation for anything. I might get kicked out at college for flunking. My family does not know any of this they think I'm doing well. I come from a poor family and I never wanted to disappoint my Mom. Honestly it seems like the only option is to commit suicide. I honestly want to end it all but I'm hoping for some magical advice to change my mind.
