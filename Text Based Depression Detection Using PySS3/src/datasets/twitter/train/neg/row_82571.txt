I know I'm not gayI got head from a guy I was desperate wanted to feel somethingÂ  and I was also veryÂ  high, homeless at the time and miserable also.i was at the point where I just wanted to die. 
After he did it. He asked if I wanted to kiss also I said no I grabbed his ass for a second and I didn't like it. I also wanted to find out if I was gay . I honestly didn't like it and now and I know I still like girls in fact I've gotten really close with one right now and we want to go out soon we both admitted we like each other. I haven't been the same I'm trying not to think about it. I was at a low point in my lifeÂ  I just wanted to get to my friends house to sleep on a bed and he agreed he could order me a lyft after since then we haven't talked and I hate myself because I let a gay guy get close to me he told me he liked me after a few times we hung out and I didn't wanna be a douche and shut him out.
