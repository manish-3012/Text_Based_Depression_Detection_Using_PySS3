please take me awayI want all the bullets to find me, all the cars to pass over me, all the diseases to catch me. I want to wake up tomorrow and die â€” in pain, without pain, it doesn't matter. I want all the people who are going to die tomorrow and would like to stay alive to stay and I go in their place. I just want to go.
