Help me kill myself. Please. Please. Please.Iâ€™ve been suicidal for about 5-6 years now. I struggle with identity issue and hate every bit of my life. 

I have no one that understands my struggle and see it as something easy to overcome. 

I donâ€™t see any mean to be alive, I canâ€™t imagine living for many + years. I canâ€™t... 

I donâ€™t consider myself LGBT. I have nothing against them, Iâ€™m just not a member. However, I get the same treatment as them. 

Life sucks. Please kill me. Take my life. I wanna be gone. Itâ€™s been going on for too long now, and I wanna be gone. Gone forever. Gone. Gone.
