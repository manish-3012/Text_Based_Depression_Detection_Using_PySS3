Itâ€™s been almost three years since I lost my best friend and I am honestly surprised Iâ€™ve managed to hang on this long.My mom died suddenly in March of 2018 and everything that has happened since then has just been one catastrophic set back after another and I think Iâ€™ve finally hit my rock bottom. I miss my mom. I donâ€™t believe in heaven or hell but I canâ€™t help but feel like there is a special sense of unity I might experience in my last moments. Like that Iâ€™ll finally feel for just a moment that she isnâ€™t gone and that we are on the same astral plane or whatever. Iâ€™d like to feel as though I am NOT motherless just one more time. Even if it means having to die to achieve that feeling, thatâ€™s okay. Iâ€™m really extremely unhappy and disappointed in myself anyway, and so is kind of everyone else, so I mean it works out for everyone if I just got away forever, yâ€™know? I just wish I werenâ€™t such a lazy good for nothing piece of shit because then I might have already done everyone the favor of killing myself a long time ago...
