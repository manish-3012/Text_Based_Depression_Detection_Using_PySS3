Dream job turned to living hellI took a job and relocated to the other side of the country. I'm indebted to this job for a long time without financially ruining the rest of my life.

I have impossible deadlines I'm meeting I'm working constantly to the point I skip sleeping and eating for days. I've been tasked with more working than is capable by one person. And every day there are misconceptions about what I'm able to do and berated for not delivering expectations not defined by me. I work so hard to deliver the best I can and an capable of and it's never good enough because those directing don't understand what I'm doing or the limitation of the tools I have. When trying to explain I'm incredibly disrespectfully ignored.

I feel like everything I've ever known is a complete misconception about life. Everything I've ever worked for and towards was a complete waste. My goals and ambitions to climb to this point are a giant waste of my life and a horribly dark cosmic joke.

I feel trapped and owned by a corporation. I emotionally break down nearly everyday driving home after work. 

I don't have an old life I can go back to. I don't have the financial resources to start over. I don't have the belongings of my old life and no idea where they are. As of now my entire 30+ year life fits into a suitcase and backpack. 

I've dealt with chronic depression and anxiety my entire life and always felt a bitter sadness I could never overcome. But never once have i felt so trapped and alone this was my only option to escape until taking this job.
