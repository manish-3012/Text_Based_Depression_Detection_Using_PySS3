Really want to kill myself.I've been depressed for an extremely long time, and I have gotten so tired of it. Everyday I wake up and dread the day that is to come, I go to school and don't say a word all day, because no one cares. I come home to an abusive father who constantly abuses me verbally and sometimes physically.

Night time is the worst for me, I let all my emotions out and it's when I feel the most depressed. Almost nightly I think about just taking a gun or swallowing some pills just to end all of my shit. I'm sick of having to live my terrible life.

I have no one to turn to for help, and I feel so abandoned all the time. It's like a constraint struggle to gain just one friend.

No matter how hard I try, I can't get this depression out of my head, and it is getting worse and worse. I'm really having a hard time finding a reason to stay here.
