I want to leave all this behindI feel very alone.  I've met so many people, but no one who I feel close with.  I've felt alone for so long that I don't know what it's like to just feel relaxed with someone.

I made a mistake moving here.  I ruin every place I've been because I keep doing dumb shit and killing any chance of real friendship.  I'll move again, not tell anyone, and start the cycle over.  I'm depressed and think about just killing myself daily.  I joke about it and it's getting to me.  I don't like anything about me, I'll never be someone that people want to get to know.  I make people laugh fine, I'm outgoing, but not in a way that anyone would care to know who I am.

I feel desperate for an escape.  I just want to go away for good.  It was my birthday and not even my parents even sent me a text.  I feel like I'm always starting over.  I just don't want to start over anymore, I just want it all to end for good.

I try to workout regularly, stay fit and eat healthy.  Wear clothes that fit and keep a smile on.  But at the end of the day, I'm just gonna be sitting alone in my room until the next social event happens and I put on another smile.  If I left, I don't think it would hurt people much.  They might be sad for a moment, but I'm not close enough to anyone for it to be a big deal
