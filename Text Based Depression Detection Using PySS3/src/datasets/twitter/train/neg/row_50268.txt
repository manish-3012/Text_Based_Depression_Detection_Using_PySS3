Fuck it all.Everyone sucks

When your supposed â€œfriendâ€ is a fucking dick to you. Then, after a few days, you give them another chance. But then, you both get locked out on your balcony. So now you have a broken window AND you have forgiven a fucking bully. Now Iâ€™m going to have to pay my apartment a shit ton of money that I donâ€™t have. 

So what is this whole point of friendship?

Letâ€™s just end it fucking all.
