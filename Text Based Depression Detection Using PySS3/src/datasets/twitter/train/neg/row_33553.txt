I just need somebody to talk toI've been very mentally unhealthy for nearly 6 months now and I've been trying so hard to hold back on suicide since November 21, when a close friend blocked me as soon as I told her what I was feeling when she asked what was bothering me. 2 weeks later another "friend" did this to me and now I feel as if I cannot talk to anyone about it. I am 16 years old and have been diagnosed with depression, general anxiety, social anxiety, OCD and anxiety induced anorexia. I am a 5'10" teenage boy and weigh 120 pounds because I physically have not been able to eat. I just switched highschools and today was day 4. That was a bad fucking decision because I can't meet new people because of my social issues. And the few friends I have now I can't talk to about how I'm already past the point of suicide. The only thing that can make me smile is the thought of killing myself. I've began to self harm and currently have 16 lines on my right thigh. I've started to become involved with drugs and my depression and constant anxiety are driving me over the edge. I've already ordered a tank of helium off amazon and I plan to kill myself with it. I have all of my suicide notes written and I've thought long and hard about it and decided this: I am ready to kill myself because I genuinely hate my life. But if I have 1 reason to keep on living then I will do so no matter how miserable I am. For a long time my reason was having people to talk to and now my therapist, anxiety meds, and parents aren't even making a difference. I need somebody to talk to
