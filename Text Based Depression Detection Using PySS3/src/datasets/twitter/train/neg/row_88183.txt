I'm doneI've had mental illness since I was 6, I'm 19 now. I'm done feeling like this.

I remember when I was younger and was suicidal it was always very intense and in the moment, but now it feels like more of an acceptance, which scares me more. It's like every second my thoughts drift to ending it, but I dont feel anything about it any more, just numb.

I only have my boyfriend to talk to, but hes said about how selfish peole are when they commit suicide when they have someone that loves them, which means I can't talk to him about this. I've recently made a comment that I would like to have a friend to talk to as well (I dont have any friends), but his only response was 'am I not enough any more' but not in a worried way, in more of an annoyed way. We keep arguing and it's really scary because hes the only person I have, I really dont want to be alone, and I love him incredibly so. He says the arguing is normal because we were in a new relationship and had just settled with us being long distance before lockdown started, but it doesn't feel like he loves me much any more, he keeps accusing me of things and taking things out on me.

I'm in my first year at university and I'm really struggling with that too. I moved into a flat with 11 people I didnt know before hand, and they were all horrible to me, the people on my course just fuck me over all the time.

I'm sick too, I have bad flu and an infected wisdom tooth now as well as being chronically ill anyway.

I'm just done with everything.
