Something to sayUhm...hard to start a note isn't it? So I guess I'll start by saying I'm sorry. I'm sorry to all the ppl I've ever known, because quite simply I wasn't good enough. I'm sorry to my family and friends especially,you've always been there and I know that you'd move heaven and earth if you knew but to suffer in silence is my gift to you all. I'm sorry to you A. I only meant you good fortune and wanted to see you happy. Thing is about happiness..it's difficult to come by and sometimes you don't find that one person that makes you truly happy. I found you. But today has been one mess up after another and I'm being selfish for once in my life,I'm going to end this pain that we call life. I hope you all remember me fondly because in my last moments I'll remember you. So many  mistakes in my life and the worst part is I know that I can fix them...deep down I know that I can fix it all but my life's just not meant to be as smooth.
I am the kid who lived his pain in silence,for all those reading this rn I wasn't you to do me a favour...talk to your friends. Talk to your family. Talk to any kind soul who'll lend a ear. Don't make my mistake because bottling that shit up just makes it worse.
I love all of you :) and I wish y'all the best.
