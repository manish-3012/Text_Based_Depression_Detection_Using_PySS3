Why haven't I been able to successfully hang myself?Is the rope that I'm using too thin?  A lot of you have stated that youve passed out quickly even on failed attempts. I've tried 20 times and never made it that far. I've tried both slipknot and hangman's noose. Is it a matter of finding the right spots on your neck? How do how locate them?  What's the problem? (partial suspension)
