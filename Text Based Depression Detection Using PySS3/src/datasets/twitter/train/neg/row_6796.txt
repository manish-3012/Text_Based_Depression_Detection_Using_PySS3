Ashamed of what I am.I don't even want to write this, I just feel shame and guilt.  I can't be bothered to put in the effort to live.  I thought going to college would help me, get an education; get a better job, or so I thought.  Here it is, the middle of summer and I'm working part-time at Wendy's, unable to keep up on rent.  Student loans up to my eyeballs, nothing and no-one to fall back on.  The only person I speak to on a regular basis is my counsellor at the college, but between that and anti-depressants they don't seem to have any affect.  The only way I can get though the day is to get high, or drunk and space out on the internet/games.  And now my landlord has let me know that he has a friend that could move into where I'm living as early as Tuesday.  


I actually tried cutting myself for the first time.  Only welts as I was to chicken-shit to actually end it.  It's not so much that I want to die, I just don't want to keep living this life.  I wish I could just lay down and fall asleep and not wake up.  I'm sure my parents would look after my cat, lol.
