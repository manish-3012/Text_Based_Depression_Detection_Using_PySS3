Going to be dead soonI've made some final preparations, got rid of my girlfriend and friends, got rid of projects and clients... last step is to get rid of my job which is one email send click away... going to grab some money first so i have enough to buy the supplies needed to follow thru... 

just wanted to say goodbye to all, hope to God for forgiveness
