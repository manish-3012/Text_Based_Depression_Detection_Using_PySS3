Iâ€™m just so tired. I need help. Someone please read. I just need someone to understand. I feel so alone.Iâ€™ve already been to all my friends an family. I have tried just keeping busy. I picked up hobbies, gotten a job, made plans to work on myself. I simply cannot keep going. Itâ€™s been so long since my mind hasnâ€™t forced me to find something to hurt about. And now my depression and anxiety have ruined the best thing that ever happened to me. My relationship which was a literal fantasy is now over and has been for 2 months all because I couldnâ€™t believe that I could be happy. Something had to be wrong. Now I spend my days working off a computer screen, clawing at some semblance of peace. I alternate through phases of hurting so much I cry uncontrollably or feeling so empty that I beg to hurt again. Iâ€™m so tired of asking for help. I donâ€™t like the way the world works. Why does it all have to be about practical. Thereâ€™s no fucking magic here, itâ€™s all money, drugs, sex, and worst of all: practicality. Iâ€™m so tired. I keep getting flashes of how Iâ€™ll end it. Iâ€™m so weak, Iâ€™m so tired of being weak. 22 years old in my childhood room. There is no growth. I only plummet deeper into this fucking disease. Iâ€™m so tired. Can someone please just talk to me and understand? Iâ€™m just so tired. I donâ€™t feel at home in this world.
