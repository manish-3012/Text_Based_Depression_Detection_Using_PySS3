January.I'm on the verge.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything is really hard right now, but I'm trying my best. I really am. Good things can still happen.

If they don't by January, well. I've made up my mind about what I'm gonna do because I can't live like this anymore. It's just not possible to feel this much pain. It's not human. I'm too tired and I feel like I won't miss out on much anyway. Anything but feeling this pain. It's overwhelming, I can't do it.
