Why Do ppl keep telling me to stop doing drugs when they were the only time I did anything fun in my lifeI dobt undetatand seriously. When Iâ€™m not doing drugs I just stay in bed &amp; think about all the things Iâ€™ve lost over the years &amp; regret everything. If I sont end up killiyy myself I might as well just do drugs &amp; have a good time once in a while. Because withput them it is impossible for me to enjoy anythint.
