I'm a failureI ve never fantasized about dying the way I have this past week. My life is worse than it's ever been. My wife and I live in a motel,  barely have food to eat. Christmas is just a joke this year. We have lost our vehicles and the bank account is severely negative. I feel like such a fuck up. I know I'm riding the pity train but death sounds so welcoming. The only thing that keeps me from putting a bullet in my head is I don't want my wife to have to clean up the mess. I put on a smile for her and tell her everything is going to work out but inside I'm just falling apart.  Does insurance pay out if it's a suicide?
