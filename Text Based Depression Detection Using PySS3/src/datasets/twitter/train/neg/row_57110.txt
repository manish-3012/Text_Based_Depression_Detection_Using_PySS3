Three more monthsI'm giving it 3 more months to get better. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for nearly half of my life. I hear stories from people who got better; how years down the line they're happy they didn't kill themselves. Things got better for them. They've stabilized. They're happy. I've been waiting. I've been trying. I work on myself as often as possible. I try my best in school and at work. I push myself everyday to be better, to convince myself things will get better. I've been trying. The last time I broke down like this was in 2015. I've held on hope since then, but nothing has changed. There have been temporary moments of relief, but the lows hit so much harder. Things have become so much more difficult. I'm at the end of my line. I feel as though I've burned through every last bit of energy I had. 

There are a few things holding me here. I don't want anyone I know to clean up the mess. I don't want my pets to go uncared for. I don't want my partner to be burdened with me. I want to slip away from them in a way that doesn't harm them. I love them so deeply. I don't want him to have my death hanging above his head. I don't want him to be associated with me when it happens. I want him to leave me. For it to be his choice. I'm too much of a coward to leave and I hate myself for it. 

If things are better in 3 more months, great. I'll continue working on myself. If nothing changes or it gets worse that's okay too. I don't have high expectations.
