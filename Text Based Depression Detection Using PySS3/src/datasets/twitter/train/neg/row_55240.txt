I found my fatherâ€™s guns and i dont know who to get to hide them from me.I donâ€™t trust myself not use them on me, especially because iâ€™m getting drunk so often and so heavily. Iâ€™m living alone at my parentâ€™s house while theyâ€™re on vacation (they wonâ€™t be here for some months). Ever since i found the guns i donâ€™t feel safe from myself. I donâ€™t want to tell my parents to hide them because i donâ€™t want to get them worried or mad or sad or disappointed or repelled or disgusted about how close I am to suicide, but i also feel to ashamed to ask any of my friends to take them away. I cringe at the image of any of my friends coming to my house, taking the guns away, and thinking â€œsomething is horrifically wrong with this personâ€. If i throw away the guns or even the ammo, my father would get so fucking mad at me.
