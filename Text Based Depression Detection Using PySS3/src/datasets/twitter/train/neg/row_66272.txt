DistraughtI am in a terrible place, right now. I feel like no one can hear me because I donâ€™t have anyone to go to. I am very lonely and my thoughts are the only thing I have. I am not doing well and wish there was a way my pain can stop. The only way is suicide but I canâ€™t do it. Sorry if this sounds insensitive but I think it would be so terrible if I chose to end it while others doinâ€™t have a choice. I fear for my future. I wish I knew for certain what was on the other side. I regret speaking or even interacting with the world daily. I think to myself how little impact I have on this world. I would tell someone to keep moving on and never give up yet I donâ€™t believe that for myself. If I died, nobody would care except for my family. But, I plan on never speaking to them once I go away. I donâ€™t believe in their faith and I am unfortunately a homosexual. I post this problem a lot but holding this in and never acting on it has caused me so much stress. Being looked at as untouchable and pathetic by my own family because they donâ€™t know If would ever find love, they would reject me. Being this way is such a joke and a miserable experience. I would do anything to be born normal. I am just so depressed and so fucking worthless. I have no friends. My life just angers me and I find no enjoyment, anymore. I am shell of my old self. Contemplating cutting as my only sense of punishment that I can hide from the world &amp; that I would still feel.
