I have a friend in need, who is not strong enough to reach out for helpHello. 

You guys here do some amazing work. Just that you are out here helping give me hope for life someday. However, i am not reaching out for myself.

I have a friend who just confided in me that he wrote his 3rd suicide note today, and was close to using a pistol to end himself.

He is a wonderful person, with many awesome skills to help others, but no way to help himself.

He currently lives in palmetto FL, and i told him i would see if i could find someone to hang out with him, that would know nothing of this whole escapade.

Just wondering if there was anyone in the are who would maybe want to go get a beer with an awesome guy, (ex military also) under the pretence of being a mutual friend. He doesnt need charity, though he is looking for a change of scenery, thats alot to ask of a stranger.

So if you could help, that would be awesome, even if its just throwing ideas at me to get him to seek help himself.

Currently, i have him signed up for "cat facts". He is not particularly fond of cats, and i have shared with him numerous stories of cat frustration. Lots of laughs had. I am using these stories as segways to remind him of good times, under rediculous pretenses, to hopefully catch him off guard in thinking about good times of his past we have shared.

I live in oregon, and i wish i was local to help him. 

Thanks for reading.
