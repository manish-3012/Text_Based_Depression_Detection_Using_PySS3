Had my heartbroken and finally gonna end this lifeToday I was heartbroken by someone I truly felt was "the one". I told her I had feelings for her and she said that they weren't the same and she did not like me like that. I feel like I am going to die alone. I have been friend zoned all my life and I have finally realized that I am going to die alone. I do not want to wait till I am 40 or anything like that. I have wanted to kill myself for a while and that this is my sign. I have no one else worth living for.
