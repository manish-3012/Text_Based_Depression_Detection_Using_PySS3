I don't know what to do...I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 10, been dealing with them for 8 years, but it's never been this bad. For the past 3 months I've been trying to find ways to tell someone, but I can't... Instead like the pathetic person I am I've been taking drugs to keep my mind off it, which hasn't helped. I'm starting to tighten my belt around my neck daily to see how hard it would be to do it, but I just keep thinking about what my mom would think, and what would happen when I'm gone. I'm slipping away and I don't know if I'll be able to keep pushing on...

I'm sorry to bother anyone who reads this...
