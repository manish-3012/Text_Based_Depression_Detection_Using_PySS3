21/m loooking for exitHey guys my name is Alex and i wanna die. i have written dozens of suicide notes over the years and have finally settled on one. My problems started when i was 4 years old. my mother died and i found her corpse in the shower. she had a lose valve in her heart that just popped. and poof. life is fragile. ive dealt with sexual abuse from my step sister and physical abuse from my step brother. in and out of mental institutions my whole life. i want to die and but im a coward. i want to know what is the most painless way for someone to take their life. i cant afford nembutal, it costs alot and im barely living.
thanks,
Alex H
