Failed attempt #4I cant even succeed at fucking suicide. I am sick of living. My life is a series of docotors appointments and giving councollors lip service so that they'll leave me the fuck alone.

My SO of 7 years left me because I was too depressed to feel or show her any love. Guess I missed my one chance at happiness. Im too broken and ugly to ever love again.

I have no prospects or goals. Everytime I try to come up with something I can do to feel good about myself, I end up coming up with 1000 more reasons that its futile.

Im scared to die. But I cant do... this... anymore. More than anything I just want one person who understands. One person who has been through it and came out on the other side. But lets face it, we all end up miaerably half living life forever, or we actually succeed in killing ourselves.

I just want her back. I just want value in myself. I just want respect. None of it is going to happen.

I always feel this miserable after a failed attempt. And the sad part is, it doesnt get any better
