I made a pact with myself that if my life isn't better in a year, I'm done.Yesterday night I made a list of 100 things I hate about myself and how to fix them. The entry was about 10 pages long. I'm 31 and I have no real close friends, never had a serious boyfriend, or a job I didn't really hate. It's not going to get better. I love my mother and brother very much and I don't want to hurt them. But I'm a pretty worthless person.

The only slightly meaningful thing I've done is lose a bunch of weight, but that meant nothing since I can't even afford the plastic surgery get it fixed.
