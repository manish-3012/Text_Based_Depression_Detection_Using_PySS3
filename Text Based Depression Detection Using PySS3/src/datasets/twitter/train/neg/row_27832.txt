Recruiting for a research study on suicide in SeattleWe're now recruiting for a study focused on youth and young adult suicidal thoughts and behaviors. This study is funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and involves participants (16-20 years old) coming to the University of Washington - Seattle campus (with their parents if under 18) for an initial appointment and evaluation, and then participants filling out surveys administered over cell phones for 14 days. Please go to [ariseuw.com](https://ariseuw.com) to learn more about the study and fill out a screening survey to determine eligibility. Participants are compensated up to $125 for their time.
