SIL accuses her daughter of making devil pact by self harming.I have a 15 y/o niece (Sarah*) (my SOâ€™s biological niece, mine by marriage) who suffers from major depression, suicidal thoughts and also self harms, sheâ€™s in therapy and on medication.  I found out this past weekend that my SIL who is highly religious told Sarah  that every time she cuts herself, she is making a â€œblood pactâ€ to the devil. I myself am an atheist and also suffer from depression so of course I was absolutely livid with this news. Sarah is now absolutely petrified that what her mother is saying is true. I sat Sarah down and explained to her that depression and/or self harm has nothing to do with any form of religion and her mother is only saying this to try and scare her into making her stop. I know SH is not healthy, I know she needs help but surely what her mother is saying is wrong? My biggest concern is that saying these sort of things may push Sarah over the edge and she may end up committing suicide.  Because of my non belief in her religion I donâ€™t have the greatest relationship with SIL, itâ€™s not that we fight or anything but I know I canâ€™t bring this up to her without her telling me to mind my own business.  My only concern is for Sarahâ€™s mental state. I always try to be the aunt that will treat her as an adult when she needs it and give her advice and make sure she understands that she can always come to me about anything. What would you suggest I do in regards to this situation? Should I stay out of it and let her parents deal with it or should I bring up my concerns to her parents knowing it will start a major family row.
