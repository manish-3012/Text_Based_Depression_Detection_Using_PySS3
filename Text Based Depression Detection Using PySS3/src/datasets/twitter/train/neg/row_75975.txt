He left. He was the reason I wanted to get better and keep on living. I want to die now more than ever.I can't take this pain anymore. I was in a really bad place before this anyway, and still he chose to leave and leave me alone. He said he loves me but can't take the emotional turmoil of our relationship, so basically my depression. I begged and told him I'd do anything. Finally I made him say that he never wants to be with me ever again, because I was so confused about his intentions and wanted to hear the truth.... But now that I know that we'll never have a chance with each other again, all hope is lost. I can't eat or sleep or enjoy anything anymore. I can't take this, if only he came back. I can't live without him, I have no choice but to die.
