I'm killing myself next month. Try and convince me otherwise.I don't really want to die, but I have no other choice. I'm tired of running away and hiding. I have things to live for but I can't have them with all the other things in the way. There's no point to anything anymore

Edit: Thank you to everyone who tried to help me. I still don't think it's worth living anymore but I really appreciate everyone who tried to convince otherwise nonetheless.
