Lack of jealousya few weeks ago I decided to starve myself to death. That lasted about a week. It turns out starving yourself is much, much more painful than slitting wrists, or a gunshot to the head. anyways, I said that I had been robbed of whatever it was that drove people due to my father having died and my mother being two clicks short of a psycho. maybe one click short. anyways, after years of intensive zazen, I know what was missing. I've never been jealous of anyone. I'm 24, and have lived my entire life without jealousy. It was suppressed (every day I practice zazen, it becomes slightly clearer to me what exactly is "wrong" with me). I'm not sure how that sounds to people, but imagine living your whole life without jealousy of other people. everyone I know likes me, for sure, but it puts me in an absolutely horrendous position. Without jealousy, it's hard to want to be like someone, or not be like someone. it's hard to like this kind of music, and not that kind of music. Jealousy of other people, is to a large extent, what we base our entire identities on. and I've never had that. not from before I can remember. how exactly am I supposed to start now in my mid twenties? This life just seems like a lost cause.
