I don't even know(feel free to remove this post)Due to various reasons being halfway through my life with no friends or family, been living isolated and alone for the better part of my life getting away from schizophrenia abusive drug-addicted mother and did the whole foster care/angsty metal/recreational drug use thing. Met her again this summer and 1 week later I was a witness on trial having helped save her partner from a violent/potentially lethal burst of rage but that's not the point

Some philosopher guy said the only real question is whatever to live or die and I honestly don't think life is for me, I could probably turn things around in a couple of years with hard work but I just sorta don't care at all, it doesn't appeal to me. I just to shut down, every second of every fucking moment is absolutely overwhelming. 

I don't know what I'm expecting by posting this, I imagine you guys would say something understanding but what is even the point of that, where does it lead. I wouldn't say I'm a suicide risk because my dog is way too important for me to let some plebian mess up his training. I just absolutely no interest in life and I would much rather not have it all, it's wasted on me and It feels like I should just donate my organs to the nearest person with any will for the world whatsoever
