Failed suicide notetonight I thought I was ready to end it, so I sat down in my closet with my chemical cocktail next to me and started writing my suicide note. This wasn't my first note and it most likely won't be my last, but writing it convinced me I didn't really want to die. While I wrote every sentence I could imagine my friends or family or even cop just reading it in their voice. And you might be thinking oh so the guilt stopped you? Well yes partially, but to be honest all I could think about was someone critiquing my letter and my syntax while looking distastefully at my cold body. My fear of irl grammar nazis kept me alive tonight
