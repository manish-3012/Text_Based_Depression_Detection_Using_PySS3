I don't wanna go, but they gonna make me do itI wish I could get into details but I can't. I love my family, I love my pets, I love my job, I love to be alone in my bedroom all day long. But then, "they" came and turn my whole life upside down. My family still supportive but I'm not ready to go through all of this. God forgive me, I have been praying for better days but when I stop to think about everything that I'm facing now I feel so powerless. I want to live, I don't wanna go. Why is this happening? I'm so sorry.
