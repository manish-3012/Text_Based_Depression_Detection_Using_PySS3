I knew I was a burden to my father, but him basically saying it to my face hurt more then I expected it too..I don't know how I really feel right now, tbh, I've been emotional as fuck all day and I don't know if I even want to think about trying to sleep tonight because I know that will just end up with me crying in the dark feeling even more alone.. 

Onto what happened I guess, bit of explaining first though, I have a weekly needle that is on a spring basically activated by a button on one end, I can't press that button so he does and we have never had an issue but lately he has started bugging me every week to press it and yesterday when we were going to do it, he did and I got upset at him for not just doing it. He went on about all the fucking BS that I "need to be a man" and what the fuck ever else, eventually he did it and I thought we were done with the bullshit till next week. I was wrong, when I got up this morning he started with more of it..

I guess what I really just want to hear right now that it isn't my fault that I can't press that button and that I'm not a fuckup.. because I feel really worthless with everything going on right now in my life and now this I just want to die even more then I normally do and honestly, I'm quite close to doing something, I don't know what but..
