I WANNA DIE EVERYDAYI can't even encourage my friends who tell me randomly that they wanna die not to do it or listen to them. I just tell them that we should do it together. This has been years of battle but makes things easier as well because whenever I think something fails in my life, I can just die. I am also not afraid of death. Thinking of writing my will as well and giving my savings to my bro tho it's very small. At this point nothing can help me tbh, all I see is the world is doomed one way or another. Just waiting for a trigger to finally do it lol.
