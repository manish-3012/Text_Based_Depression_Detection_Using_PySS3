I feel a hundred times better now that I've settled on a planLegit I now feel like everything's finally going to be okay and I'm so damn keen. It's like a weight's been lifted. Whether I go through with the swan dive or not is an issue for tonight, but right now I'm on top of the damn world. Relief and freedom. =\]
