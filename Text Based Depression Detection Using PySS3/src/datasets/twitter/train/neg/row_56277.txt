why am i like thisI'm so pathetic. I am constantly in a state of self-loathing and despair, despite the fact that I am privileged compared to people in my country. My family is really caring but I feel like I am slowly becoming more and more of a disappointment to them. I don't open up to anyone in my life. That is 100% my fault as I am such a fucking narcissistic person I expect people to suddenly flock to me and start interacting with me. My piece of shit brain is wired so that I can get good marks in school but have 0 work ethic, 0 EQ and 0 fucking worth to this world. the only hobby i have is gaming, which i am complete shit at. even this reddit post is just so that i can g et attention for my lonely, lazy, selfish, POS life. maybe one day i'll become a statistic. that statistic will be more useful than anything else i have done in my life
