School is so frustrating I want suicide because of it. This is serious.I'm in 7th grade right now, I'm 13 years all and I've been lately considering the option of jumping off the window due to the frustration of having to go to school. This may come off as a bit ridiculous, but all I want is to become an attorney.. I have to get through algebra to become that, right? Even if it makes no sense? Not only that, but I also have to memorize the periodic table of elements, when to use certain pronouns even though I know how to speak languages, draw shit, and a lot of random, pointless stuff. If I fuck up and suspend either maths, English or Spanish, I have to repeat a grade. I've been genuinely considering this since 5th grade, but I've never thought of asking the Internet for solutions. I study regularly, I was one hell of a good student back in the day, but now I've gotten worse. Please send all help you can. I'm next to a window right now, and I can do it before I get any help.
