I feel hopeless about the future.I am 18, and, from time to time, I get some thoughts that go like this:

I have never achieved anything, not good at anything at all, simply useless, I just believe that I am a waste of resources and that I won't be able to even maintain myself in the future, since I can get no job, because it is too hard, and I just can't commit to anything, and if I do, it's no use, because I'm just too much incapable of doing whatever it is, everything I try goes wrong, even the simplest tasks that people do well without much effort. I feel like I have no future, I mean, it'll be just pointless suffering. The only solution I see is taking my own life.

What can I do? It's just hopelessness, I'm feeling it more often as time passes, almost daily, actually.
