The girl I love passed away a week and a half ago and I need to talk about it.It's hard to talk to my friends about this because they have never had a similar experience to this before, but my mostly-on sometimes off girlfriend of nearly two years passed away recently and I feel like I need to just take a walk and talk to someone on the phone. If anyone is available to chat right now it'd be lit. Thank you.
