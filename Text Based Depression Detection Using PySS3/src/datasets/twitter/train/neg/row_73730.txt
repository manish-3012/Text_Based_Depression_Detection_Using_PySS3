Been talking about it too long. It's time to end it.For the past six months of so I've been heavily contemplating suicide. I have no friends, no job, my family is embarrassed by me, and I'm at least 20k in debt from student loans that I couldn't even manage to get a degree from. I'm sick of trying. Really the most useful thing I could do is to swallow a bunch of pills tomorrow so I can stop breathing and not be miserable anymore. No one will care after a while.
