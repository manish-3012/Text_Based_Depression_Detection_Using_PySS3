I have everything I can ask for. Why do I still want to fucking end it?I don't know what's wrong with me, I don't know why I feel this way. I'm just empty. I'm in love with someone that gives me the most love I can ask for and at the same time doesn't give me the time of day. I don't even have the motivation to wake up in the morning for school, let alone do any school work. My parents don't talk to each other and my mother gets mad at me for sleeping all day and not spending time with her. I have an ex who seems to be out to get me and she harasses me at school and online all day.

The whole world is against me, everyone hates me, i am lonely and i have no one. The only thing that has kept me from ending it all is seeing my girlfriend one day, but even there it seems like im fucking that up, and I don't blame her for one day leaving me because she doesn't want to deal with my problems. She has no idea i am like this. I put on my fake happy face and pretend like nothing is wrong with me, and i help her through her issues she's with. BUT I CANT FUCKING HELP MYSELF. She said she's the best thing that's ever happened to her this year and shes had suicidal thoughts herself. I just can't bear to think what she would do if i was gone.

I want to die. I'm just too much of a pussy to do it and i dont want to see anyone who i still have hurt because of me.
