I think this is itI was in so much emotional and mental pain earlier this afternoon that I almost screamed and I started cutting myself a little which I donâ€™t normally do and then forced myself to sleep with sleeping pills and melatonin and just woke up and I think Iâ€™m going to do it tonight. 

Thereâ€™s nothing left to live for. Iâ€™m just sitting around killing time, and all my friends hate me. Itâ€™s time.
