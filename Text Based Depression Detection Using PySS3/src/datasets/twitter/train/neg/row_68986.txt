decided it's time for treatment but I don't know where to startI think I need to get counseling soon, but I'm not sure about it.

I'm still on my parents' insurance plan and they do not have the most enlightened outlook on depression. I would prefer that they not know.

At the same time I feel like they'll eventually find out, so I'm wondering whether I should open up to them about my issues.

Either way, I just feel a little stuck at the moment. I'm afraid about taking the next step towards treatment. Is this normal?

I think I just need a plan and some resources and I have a lot of questions. I'm willing to keep posting here if someone could help or if you need more information.
