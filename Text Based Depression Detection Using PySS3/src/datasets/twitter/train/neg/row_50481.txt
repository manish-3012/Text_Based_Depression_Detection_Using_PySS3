Best distractions?I know that distracting isnâ€™t always the answer. For some reason my urges to end it all have gotten so much worse in the past couple months. Talking with someone doesnâ€™t help, I only feel guilty to have wasted their time. Therapy is useless and would only make me realize my worthlessness more. What do you guys do to keep yourself distracted??
