Life is awesome, but despite best efforts, i'm done.Priviliged upbringing, good family, educated, and 'gradually but suddenly' isolated and alone.

Found cycling, and got hooked. Life was good, until i got injured archilles a year ago, then a knee 6 months ago. No one can fix either. The one thing i had has been taken from me and despite spending 10 hours a week rehabbing and reading about my injuries, i can't do it any more. I've become to overweight from no training to be fast on the bike anyway, so guess thats life.

The medical profession is incompetent. The amount i;ve spent on "specialists" is profound.
