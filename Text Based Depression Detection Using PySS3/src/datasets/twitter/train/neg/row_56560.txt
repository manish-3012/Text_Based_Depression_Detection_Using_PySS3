i cant do thisLast week I tried my to commit suicide by inhaling carbon monoxide in the garage but when I turned on the car a song came on that reminded me of my ex who is the love of my life. She ended the relationship because she wasnt ready to be in one and i am fine with that but she completely cut off all contact and I can not handle that. She helped me through everything. All people are saying is it will getbetter and you will find somebody that is better then her. There is nobody better then her, she is perfect and meant the world to me and now I have nothing. I just want her back. My depression is getting worse and I am about to fail four classes in college so its going to be a rough road ahead of me. I want my best friend, the love of my life, and my world back. I want to tell her she literally saved me but I know she would not respond. I do not know where to turn or where to go. I am lost in the wilderness of my mind and I want out. I want to be happy again, I want to be myself again.
