Sitting here with bottles of pills in my handIn the heat of the moment (and BPD rage), I sent a message to my exes wife and she wants a restraining order. This will ruin my life. I want to end it right now. I want to take these pills and never wake up. I dont want to be in the hospital during christmas though if it doesnt work.
