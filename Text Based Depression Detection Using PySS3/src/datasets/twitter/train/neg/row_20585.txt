is it even worth livingI came into this world without my consent. I didn't agree to come into existence. So why am i forced to live. At this point im living for other people like my parents, family and freinds. Am just living not to put people around me in grief. Other than that i dont mind dying on this very second. I am in severe depression and severe anxeity. Medications seems not to work. And at this point i dont have the energy to even wake up and go to school let alone try exercising. What should i do to get out of this scenario?
