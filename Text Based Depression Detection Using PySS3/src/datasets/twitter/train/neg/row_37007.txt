Living is a chore and I'm tired of feeling alone.I've always had body image issues and have had orthorexia for years. My anorexia has made a comeback and I'm constantly starving all the time to the point I have to take naps from lack of energy and I work out to the point of exhaustion. I just want someone to notice me and love me and I feel like I need a nice body to do that. Ever since I've entered college I've been unable to make a connection with anyone and feel isolated. I feel like I was born with an inferior body and am unlovable. I've struggled with bad depression for years and it just keeps gettinf worse and I constantly miss the days of my childhood when things felt simple and easy. I guess this post isn't very coherent but I just feel absolutely awful.
