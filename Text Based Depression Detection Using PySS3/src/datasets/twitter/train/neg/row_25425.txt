Diagnosed with genital dysesthesia at 19 - an inccurable disease that causes extreme pain in the penis at all times. Could anyone really blame me for killing myself?I've had this for about 2 years now.  I tried to kill myself last year, but ended up in the hospital for a week.  After seeing at least two dozen different doctors across the country, it seems as though this is it for me.  Out of embarassment, I haven't told many people about it.  I feel like I might leave it in my suicide note, just so everyone knows what I'm going through.  please help i don't want to die
