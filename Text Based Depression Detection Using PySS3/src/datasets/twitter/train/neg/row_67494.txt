Iâ€™m feeling so not goodIâ€™m trapped in this life. I feel imprisoned. Stuck. Like Iâ€™ve already died in enough ways that Iâ€™m decomposing and rotten, but alas Iâ€™m forced to march on smiling while the decay takes its hold. 
Iâ€™m a worthless, stupid, fuck up who only ever had potential going for him. 
You know what they call potential when you get old? No? Thatâ€™s cause they donâ€™t call it anything. Cause itâ€™s fucking nothing.
Just like me. Pointless to consider.
