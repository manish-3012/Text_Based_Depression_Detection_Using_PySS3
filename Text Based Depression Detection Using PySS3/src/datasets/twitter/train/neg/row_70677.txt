It kills me to watch the show Intervention. It seems like everyone can find love except meI canâ€™t get a boyfriend because Iâ€™m fat right? No itâ€™s because Iâ€™m an alky junkie loser right? No itâ€™s because Iâ€™m mentally ill and therefore forever damaged right? No itâ€™s because of my background, something I have no control over right? Fine. I can accept that, but then I see people with my exact same â€œbadâ€ traits, sometimes even way worse yet they still have people who love and care about them. They have loving partners and families. I have nothing. Itâ€™s rejection after rejection and perpetual isolation because I did something wrong, because I am bad. Other people with my traits arenâ€™t, itâ€™s just me.
