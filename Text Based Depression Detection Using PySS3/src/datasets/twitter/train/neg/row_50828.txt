EmotionlessI really just want to off myself because I feel nothing. No emotions, no feeling of life. I can't feel anymore except the darkness of depression and sadness. I used to be happy when Thanksgiving and Holidays came around and I'm just miserable rn. I don't see the point of living, I just want to drink bleach and die.
