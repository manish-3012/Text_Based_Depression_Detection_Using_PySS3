Wish I could give my life to someone who'd actually put it to use.Like the title says, I wish I could give my life to someone who would actually make use of it rather than fucking waste it like me. All these chances and opportunities have passed me by, and for some reason I don't even want to "get better". I try to explain how I'm feeling to others but it's pointless since people only understand from their level of perception. They don't know how broken and empty I feel on the inside. They don't have a clue.

All my life I've just wanted to be a good person and do good things on this sad and doomed little planet, but when I look at myself in the mirror all I see is a disappointment. There's just so many things wrong with my life and it's getting to be too much to handle for me at least. If someone else was given my life they would probably find a way out of this shit but not me. I'm just so damn lonely, tired, &amp; broke.

I could rant on for hours about how fucked my life is right now but I'm just too tired. I just needed to get this off my chest before it all consumed me. I don't know what I'm going to do now. I don't know how much longer I can endure this and I might just make plans to end it before I just get hurt more down the line. That's all though, thanks for reading. I wish I could just cry myself to sleep but I'm too empty and numb for that.
