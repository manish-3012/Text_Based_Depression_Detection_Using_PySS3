Failing at my DreamAll my life I've wanted to be in EMS.

I have my undergrad degree and years of experience me. I've been the final stages only a few two weeks left until I get my licence to practice. The only thing is I choke under a lot of pressure, and people don't take me seriously. 

I relocated for this opportunity to work and practice in this field. I'm smart enough and deal well with most patients. However I am in jeopardy of failing, I am financially screwed if I fail. It's a hell of a lot of stress.

I used all of my father's money that he left me after he died on this goal. I've had a lot of struggles in life from my father's suicide to romance, chronic pain and not being accepted socially. 

If I fail I don't have any money or a career, I need to move out within a month and I have no place to go. I don't think I can take the failure, I'm at the very end of the program and am failing. I was working two part time jobs and got fired from each on the same day. I'm getting evicted because I can't pay for anything. 

If I fail, suicide feels like the only option. I know the cost of suicide from my own family. I already have a plan to make it look like an accident just to make things a little easier. I'm failing at my dream, I just want to be better.

Tomorrow is my next shift and I can't even think straight.
