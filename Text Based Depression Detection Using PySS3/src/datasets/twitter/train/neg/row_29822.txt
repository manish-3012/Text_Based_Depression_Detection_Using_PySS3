I did it, only by a fluke am I alive now.I had it.  I got home and knew that "tonight was the night".   I went up into my room and got my belt.  I made a loop and put it around my neck.

I threw the long end over my bedroom door and closed the door.   I leaned forward.   I had a slight sensation of my own pulse and a little gasp of breath.   I concentrated on my breathing and that is the last thing I remembered.  I am sure it was the lack of blood flow that caused me to pass out so fast.  No real problems breathing I can remember.  I had to belt low on my neck, this was the perfect spot.

I don't know how long I was out.  I remember feeling an incredible pain in my leg.   My leg got twisted under me as I was hanging on the door and it was the pain that brought me back.  Leg hurt so bad I could not stand back up and rehang myself.   I also must have cried out in pain because people came to see why I yelled.

I was gone.  Damn leg.  Now I know that the next time I do it, I just have to be higher.  It didn't hurt, it wasn't scary.  In fact, it was peaceful.   It feels quite calming knowing how easily I can get rid of this pain and rid the world of my cancerous/septic existence.

This may be my last post.
