Thoughts about hanging myself latelyMy anxiety is bad and Iâ€™ve just been choking myself till my face turn red and choking myself till my eyes turn red with a belt, I sometimes act like Iâ€™m hanging myself with the belt, Iâ€™m hoping if all else fails in life as it is now with school and feeling hopeless and depressed every day that Iâ€™ll soon be ready to commit suicide in the future.
