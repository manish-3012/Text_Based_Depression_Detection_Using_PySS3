I feel alone and life seems pointlessI can't handle my flashbacks...I can't handle my panic attacks....I feel alone and unlovable...I can't seem to find a trauma therapist...I am going to try it again soon, hopefully this time I'll succeed. If I had to describe my life in one word it would be pain. I hate myself
