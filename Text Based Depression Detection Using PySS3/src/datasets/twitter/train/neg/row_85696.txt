Split personality wants me deadSoo, I think I might have a split personality that wants me to kill myself. I mean Iâ€™ve always been suicidal (attempted 3 times, twice by sleeping pills, once by slicing wrist) but the thoughts have gotten so normal to the point that I donâ€™t fear them anymore, and that seems scary in its own way. I honestly say something along the lines of â€œfucking kill yourselfâ€ 30 times a day, sometimes more. Most of them being before I fall asleep (no longer followed by tears). Anyways recently I started living by myself instead of with roommates so Iâ€™ve been more alone with my thoughts and noticed a pattern 

For example recently I thought to myself 
&gt;god youâ€™re such a piece of shit just fucking kill yourself
&gt;you already tried and failed
&gt;donâ€™t be a pussy and get something that you know will actually work like a .45 magnum you faggot

Then I thought

&gt;yeah youâ€™re right
&gt;Iâ€™ve got nothing to lose anyways
&gt;The longer I wait the harder it will be on my friends and family
&gt;the sooner the better

Then I thought 

&gt;yeah donâ€™t tell anyone you know either
&gt;theyâ€™ll just tell you not to do it
&gt;why ask them something when you already know the answer you fucking retard

Last part is kind of being why I made this post. Even when making this I started shaking and tried talking myself out of it 3 times. I really canâ€™t tell anyone I know so it might as well be to strangers on the internet

But yeah, I never noticed how much it would seem like Iâ€™m talking to another person in my head till recently. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m just talking down to myself in third person or if itâ€™s more complex
