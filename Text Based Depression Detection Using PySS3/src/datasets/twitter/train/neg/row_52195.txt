There's nothing here for me.I'm 21, jobless, living at home with a mother that-- I feel-- cares for her dogs more than her own child. I have no income of my own, a measly two friends (both of which live hundreds of miles away from me), no car of my own. Most of the time, I'm perfectly happy living like this, contacting my friends via Skype, putting on a happy face for all to see.

But sometimes, reality catches up to me, hitting me like a freight train.

My friends have better things to do than talk to a low-life like me. 

My mother is only keeping me under her roof because of some sense of familial obligation-- that, and she needs someone to do all of her cooking, cleaning and dog care. The instant I show any emotions around her, she starts interrogating me as to why I feel the way I do.

Everyone else my age-- from my graduating class-- has a job, has a house of their own, is able to drive.

I've been isolating myself from the world more and more, detaching myself from my two friends and my mother. I've even thought of all the different ways I could take myself out... but I don't have the guts to even do that. They're either too painful, take too long, are too easily noticed, or any combination of the three.

I just don't want to live in a world where I don't matter to even those closest to me, that's all.

(I'm sorry if this is borderline illegible. I'm not exactly in the best state of mind and I really needed to get this off of my chest.)
