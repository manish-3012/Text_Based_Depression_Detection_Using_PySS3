I can't escapeNothing I do can make the pain and anxiety go away. My whole life, my motivation for going onward and continuing to fight was "one day, I'll be in a much better place in life and I'll feel better." And now, here I am. Just graduated college at the top of my class. I have a lovely apartment in the city I've always wanted to live in. I have a job I'm about to start which will pay quite well.


But none of that helped me. I guess I should have known that my issues run too deep. I feel like a fraud. I'm a nurse - just passed my boards with flying colors - but I don't feel like I can safely care for anyone. My crippling lack of self confidence and anxiety will always come back to bite me in the ass. I still feel like I can't trust my own assessments, even though I've done them countless times. I can see myself assessing someone, doubting my own assessment data, and missing something important leading to their death.


I just can't think of a reason to keep going, besides stupid temporary things like video games I enjoy, and television shows I'm watching. I "made it," but I didn't, really. I've been running from my depression for so long, and I can't keep trying to get away. I'm tired. Feeling nothing would be so much better than feeling this way.
