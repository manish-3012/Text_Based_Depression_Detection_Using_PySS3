Iâ€™m doneI donâ€™t even know why iâ€™m writing this, i just feel like i need to let my feelings out somehow but i also donâ€™t wanna bother my irl friends. Iâ€™m only 15 and iâ€™ve been through some really messed up stuff over the past two years, and i constantly feel like iâ€™m burning out or iâ€™m close to a mental breakdown. Honestly now I understand why Britney shaved her head in 2007. Every other day I get thoughts like â€œthis is it. this is my breaking point, iâ€™m finally gonna do itâ€ but i never follow through with my plans. I just wanna get away from everything thatâ€™s stressing me out right now, and suicide honestly seems like a tempting option because I would literally have 0 worries after iâ€™m dead. I donâ€™t even know where I was going with this, but I just felt like I needed to write this out somewhere. iâ€™m seriously so close to doing something really bad to myself :(
