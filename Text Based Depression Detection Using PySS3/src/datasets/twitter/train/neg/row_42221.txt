I dont have the strength to keep goingIm so tired and defeated. I know what I want to is selfish and not the right thing but i dont care anymore. I dont want to live a life where everyday is a constant struggle. I'll always be alone, but thats ok because im toxic and unlovable. I know the pain I'll cause to my mum and dad and my friends. 

The black dog of depression has been at my side for most of my life. I lost my only brother to suicide, something ive always hated him for. The hypocrisy is not lost on me at all. There are a few reasons for me to live but I dont care about them anymore. The world will still turn once I've gone and my family and friends will move on and forget me in time.
