Every time I see an attractive woman, I want to kill myself.First is intense feelings of longing. Then intense anxiety over the thought of trying to talk to her. Then intense pain when her partner arrives or when she leaves or when I overcome that anxiety try to talk to her and get rejected. Then thoughts of suicide.
