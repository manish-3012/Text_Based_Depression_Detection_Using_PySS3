I'm ScaredSo last night was the closest I have ever come to ending my life. If I had found my knife, I honestly don't think I would be sitting here this morning. I realized last night, everything I thought was real is fake. I live behind a mask that I constantly maintain, a facade to all my "friends" and family...but I can't take it anymore. I'm done pretending. 

Last night all I could imagine was a knife running through my throat, and damn did it feel good.

What is wrong with me...
