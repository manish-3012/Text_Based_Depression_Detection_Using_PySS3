I made an appointment for therapy but I canceled.I was going to go talk to someone at the local university Psychological clinic, but I called back and canceled a day later. I just couldn't bring myself to whine to someone half my age about my problems. 

And I didn't know what to tell them if they asked me about suicidal thoughts or feelings. Truthfully I think about it daily, but I don't want to tell that to someone who could have me locked up.
