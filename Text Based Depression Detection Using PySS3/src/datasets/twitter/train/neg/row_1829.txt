Self: Not sure how to approach professional help...This is a throwaway account

I feel as if I have fantasies of jumping off the third floor of my university quite often and though I don't necessarily feel as if I will do it in the near future some days I just wish there was some sort of trigger that just makes me go and do it.

I want to seek professional help like a therapist but I just don't know if I could afford someone that is meaningfully relatable. I feel as if my depression continues like this for a few more years I will come to an end inevitably. Instead of therapy I mostly self-medicate my depression with weed.

What options are there for long-term therapeutic help? Someone I could develop a close connection and understanding with, like a friend.
