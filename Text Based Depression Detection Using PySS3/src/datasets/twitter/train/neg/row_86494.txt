I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m depressed or just a burden to myself. (F17)I guess what Iâ€™m doing here is a last resort. I donâ€™t post on here or on Reddit whatsoever. Iâ€™m currently F17 and Iâ€™ve always struggled mentally. I remember beginning to feel consistent sadness at 2nd grade and beginning to have suicidal thoughts since around 7th grade. In addition, Iâ€™m on antidepressants, I am one year in recovering from an eating disorder, and 5 months in from self-harming.
To put it shortly, I have extremely high and unrealistic expectations for myself: 
- My brain tells me that I have to be productive 24/7.
- Iâ€™m very competitive.
- However, my attention span has decreased rapidly and I can not sit still (in fact, I use a standing desk) or watch a 10 min Youtube video.
- I believe 100% that I am a waste of food, water, money, etc. A failure, never good enough, useless, will NEVER succeed.. all of that shit. You name it. Also, Iâ€™m self-destructive. 

Extras:
- I am a â€˜therapistâ€™ for everyone in my life but I am the devil of my own.
- I canâ€™t imagine still being alive after 20 years old. 
- Iâ€™m never in the moment. Iâ€™m always thinking about the future and growing old. 

Nonetheless, I am self-aware that my head tells me complete lies. Also, I understand that I am young and that my life hasnâ€™t even begun yet. But if I think about it, Iâ€™m not sure if I want it to begin. Some back story, Iâ€™m on the creative side. I am a rising audio engineer and I use Logic Pro X. I am decent at digital art and I have a mother who wholeheartedly supports my passions. Recognizing that, it sounds nice and as if I have a path set for me but itâ€™s never that simple. As my friends and peers watch me work, Iâ€™ve even had a handful tell me they wish they were me. Yet, I feel like Iâ€™m just grasping the basics and somehow theyâ€™re impressed? No, you do NOT want to be me. Iâ€™m never satisfied with myself and I canâ€™t seem to feel satisfaction at all from my progress. Youâ€™d think with a mindset like this, youâ€™d find me wide awake at 3AM watching Youtube tutorials on how to improve on my passion. For some reason, I fall short with my attention span and so many thoughts fire in my mind. I realize that the job that I truly want in the music industry is undoubtedly difficult, very social, and a constant grind. Right place and right time, go outside to events, know people.. As an introvert, just thinking about it overwhelms me and I donâ€™t even want to try. Nevertheless, itâ€™s my craft.. I know I have to â€œJUST DO ITâ€ and work my ass off but I canâ€™t.. I JUST CANâ€™T. This life is too much and donâ€™t get me started on my personal life or the things I donâ€™t even want to MENTION.. Or the thousands of questions I canâ€™t seem to find answers to.. â€œAm I just being lazy?â€ â€œIs life even real?â€ â€œHow can I stop being a fuck-up?â€ â€œUse your privileges god damn it and be the person you want to meet someday.â€ Thoughts circle and circle and circle.. they never seem to shut up.. Iâ€™m always thinking.. 

The only thing holding me back is my dear mother. In second, the fact that this choice Iâ€™ve been contemplating for years is permanent. In third, the agony of bearing an untold story inside of me. I donâ€™t want to have to make another mistake, not meet my expectations, and then when I do, I feel NOTHING. But donâ€™t mistakes help you learn? Yes, absolutely! Do I want to believe that? No, absolutely not! 


Since Iâ€™ve rambled and whined too much, I donâ€™t mind if no one responds to this. I just want to be heard.. I just want to be able to say how Iâ€™m feeling without being a burden or ashamed. 
If you read this, thank you for letting me share a part of my story. Whatever ends up happening to me I just want to let you know that youâ€™re doing great. Even though I donâ€™t know you, I believe in you. I really do. Try your best for me, okay? â¤ï¸
