trust yourselfmy gut was right again, its never let me down, my instinct on whats happening or happened is always right. she left me for another man, i know i deserve better but i just cant take it anymore, ive tried to kill myself before but im a coward, there is no easy way or simple button to press. i tried again but this time im going to try and get help, im vulnerable and sensitive with an inability to not feel pain constantly because of my past, present and what negative view i have of my future, because i am 30 and the same things happen in my life since i was 15. ive learnt a lot, and one important rule is trust yourself and your feelings, because its probably right. i wish i could feel less, so i didnt get inevitably hurt after its no longer good, and to take so long to cope normally again, but this is the way i am. the feelings never go away, i just learn to cope, get used to the pain, live through the struggle, since i cant end it or prevent it, i hope professional people and science can help me, because relationships have ruined me from what i feel is unrepairable, but i will try, again, for me, they are not worth it but i am, one day the pain might stop.
