I just tried to overdose on Xanax and alcoholI don't want to live anymore. I'm 21, nearly a millionaire, and I'm still not happy. My whole entire family died off when I was 18 and it still haunts me every day for 3 years. If I had a gun no matter how painful it might be I would end it in an instant. I really need help and someone to talk to. Not just those shitty hotlines or anything I just need to get some stuff off my chest. Thanks for reading.
