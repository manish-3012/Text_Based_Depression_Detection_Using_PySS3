i just want to talk (i'm sorry my english isn't good)i don't know if you can understand what i'm trying to say but here it is, in scale 1 to 10 i would say i'm 4 in term of having suicidal thought. i have been suicidal for 3 to 4 years, there is only 1 one thing that keeping me from killing myself.

sometimes i feel lonely but lately i don't really care, i only have 3 months left before i get drop out of college, my family keep pressuring me if i don't graduate (i guess that's a good thing). i know it's my fault that i'm not good at college. i don't know what to do if i dropped out of college, i guess just get a job right :) ? i just don't want to burden or make them embarrassed of me. thank you for reading this, i hope you guys have a great day

i'm sorry if you are having a hard time by reading this, i wish i could tell you more about me.
