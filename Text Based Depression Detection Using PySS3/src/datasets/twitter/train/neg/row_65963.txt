Day OneSo I decided to give myself a second chance at making things work. I am gonna try it for a year and recording each and everyday. Hopefully this works and I feel like telling some one even the smallest achievement I make every day. Since I dont have that many friends to share irl I decided to post it on reddit. I hope this inspires other people in positive way too. 

- I finally went grocery shopping 
- I bought a lottery ticket ( this is keeping hope for me) 
- I met a friend (who just got back in town) 
- I also paid some of my bills 
- I actually fell asleep for 9 hours 

I know this isn't  a lot or even typing this here would seem weird for some one. I don't know if this crazy, but I am trying to make change and this kind of makes me feel good about accomplishing something.
