Friend broke down and wants to die. Need advice.Background: We've been friends for a few months and tried to start dating thanks to mutual friends and gossip that she was interested in me. It's only been about a week though. Two days ago, we were alone and I kissed her. She reciprocated heavily but stopped and started freaking out. She told me that everything was wrong, that she's sorry for leading me on, and that she has no self control and I should deserve someone better than her. She kept switching between talking/crying and grabbing and kissing me so there was clear emotional conflict through it all. 

After some minutes, she told me that she has wanted to die for a long time. She knows she's going to hell for being a bad person and just wants to get it over with. It would be so easy. She has no interest in her future or in trying to change anything since there is no point. And she's never told anybody this because she hated being a burden and didn't want them to worry. 

I know she's unstable and I'm quite worried. I read the a few of the threads under helping someone with sucidial thoughts to start off. I guess I just wanted some more advice and for someone else to know. 

We're all her friends. Should I tell her closest mutual friends anyways? What can I do to support her?
