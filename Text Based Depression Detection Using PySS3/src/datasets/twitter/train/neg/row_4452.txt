How do I tell my friend about being suicidalAlready posted on of these but no response. Just someone respond. Iâ€™m scared to tell her because she wonâ€™t care. Iâ€™m not one of her close friends but sheâ€™s my only good friend. I hate all my other 4 friends. They donâ€™t care about me. Iâ€™ve donâ€™t trust any of them. I only trust her. Even though weâ€™re not close, she knows one of my big secrets that Iâ€™ll probably not tell anyone until I write my suicide note. 

Canâ€™t talk in person about because Iâ€™m on holidays and I donâ€™t want to just dm her asking her if we could talk about it because sheâ€™ll probably be doing something else. Then when we see other back at school itâ€™ll be awkward. 

Not sure why tf Iâ€™m writing about all this shit but  how do I start the conversation and do I dm her or do I wait until she dms me about something?
