I'm suicidal okay....Another suicidal post oh no...... don't read it if you don't care downvore away
It's all my fault, everything. I knew it would come to this point and I still don't fucking care...why don't I care? Because what I do either: Feels good or lets me live how I want. I've developed so many bad habits, put myself through so much self caused paronia, suicidal thoughts, years of depression and FOR WHAT????? Just run away from responsibility and do as I please......wow...and now that I think back on my choices and trying to justify what I did only to realize that's it's all bullshit and I've wasted YEARS of my life and went through so much pain just to "Live however I want" I'm dons with myself. I tried to help myself but I literally just don't care anymore. If I can't do something as basic as getting it through my head as to take care of myself and assume responsibility for my life and give up the stupid dream of " Fuck the world, do what I want" then why should I live? Since I don't care so much why should I allow myself to live?.......
I'm 20 and I need help please :( somebody help please
