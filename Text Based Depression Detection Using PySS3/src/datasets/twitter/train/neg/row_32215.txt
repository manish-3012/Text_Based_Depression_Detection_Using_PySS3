i decided i will try one last thing and then i will do iti have been a failure in school and life since i was little  , often got failed years in school because i got sick and doctors ignored it for months 

and now i have been trying to get on hormones for a year aswell . without any success 

 i will just go to the local psychiatry and tell them im transgender and highly suicidal and that i will only stay if they promise me to help me get hormones and other things , otherwise i will just run away and actually do it 

im sick of everything going in circles . my trans issues make me depressed , my depression makes me not care about school or anything because its pointless anyway , me being bad at school (or home for weeks because wheres the point i will fail anyway) makes my mother verbally abusive again . i feel worse and more sick and so on

if they send me home , or tell me they dont care about my trans issues i will do it
