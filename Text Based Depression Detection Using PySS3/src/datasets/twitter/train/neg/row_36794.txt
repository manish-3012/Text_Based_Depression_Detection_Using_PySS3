I'll be 21 in 11 months. I'll give myself that. I'm still a horrible person though.I really can't take this shit anymore. I'll be blunt and kind of an ass right now, but it's what I feel. If I feel the same way about my life after this upcoming wasted year, that's it. I'm done.

I was supposed to kill myself by now. I've let everyone down, and I don't really want to do this anymore.

So for context, I'm some bratty kid with a nonexistent social life, crippling anxiety, and a massive inferiority complex, and I'm slated to graduate college when I'm 24. I already flunked out my first semester, and being the retard I am, I decided to drop out to community college instead of powering through. Logistics wise, I'm pretty sure everything won't transfer over, and I will have to make up a lot of things I couldn't take, so yeah.

I'm sorry if I struck a nerve with many people who struggle, and it is not uncommon for people to take longer to graduate, but I have zero excuse for it. I just fucked up. 

So I'll give myself one more chance. Here's my stint at community college. From what I've garnered, this should be the easiest year of my life. Having literally no social life, and being unemployed and living under my parents roof, there should be no problems here. 

A 4.0 is doable. If I can't procure the ethic/ability to ruin curves here, then I have no reason to believe I'll survive in real school.

Tl;Dr: Yes I'm literally going to kill myself over a bad grade.
