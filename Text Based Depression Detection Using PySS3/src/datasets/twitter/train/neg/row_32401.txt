I'm about to catch the busI've lost everything. My boyfriend, my apartment, anyone who ever cared about me.

My boyfriend was going behind my back to make plans to move out Christmas fucking weekend.

I have a court date coming up that I'm terrified about.

I went to the store and bought what I needed.

Straight razor blades, and a 1/2" thick 15' long rope which I plan to tie around my closet door handle and throw it over the top. I'm bringing in a patio chair that I can kick away when I'm ready.

It's probably going to be painful

And I better not fucking survive.

I hate this life I've completely ruined
 I'm a loser, an alcoholic who's just lost the best thing she ever had

If there's an afterlife, I hope it gets better.
I wish I could go back and fix things.but I can't.

I'm not sure if I'll do it tonight. J wanted to spend one last night with him.

I don't know why.i know he doesn't love me anymore.but five years is a long time to be with somebody.

I'm sorry
