Real Talk: The Suicide Hotline sucks. Let me explain why.A couple months ago I almost killed myself. Went to the ER then was put into a psych ward the whole sha-bang. The one thing I look back on was the moment before I was about to make my attempt was the call I made to the suicide hotline. Was the wait long, yes. Doesnâ€™t matter. The called was connected a good 40 mins later and I was speaking to a very nice woman. 

I felt uncomfortable I guess. I told her what was happening and she got very quiet. She didnâ€™t really know what to say or what to tell me. In the awkward silences I would speak up so it would be too awkward but then it would just end up with me rambling. She would try to refer to places to go but she didnâ€™t really know what exactly to do due because of the differences in states. Iâ€™m not saying the hotline is bad just that, it was like being forced to talk to family you donâ€™t want to talk to. Very awkward and uncomfortable. Didnâ€™t make me change my mind at all, and actually made me feel bad for putting her in this position. I ended the call saying I feel better and will go to the hospital so she can hang up with the idea that I would be okay. Yeah I just need to end the awkwardness as fast as possible. Iâ€™m still here now. Surprisingly, but things havenâ€™t changed for me sadly.
