Why is it i feel like i want to make myself suffer purposely?Spent all day planning to buy some otc painkillers to go with with my anti-depressants and overdose on either tomorrow or the day after, not nessecarily to kill myself but to make myself really unwell, maybe writhe in pain, throw up, whatever anything as long as i am suffering. If i die in the process then its a happy accident, i dont deserve life anyway.

I feel like im always trying to make myself suffer, filling myself with energy drinks and sweets, preventing myself from eating or eating well. Stopping my anti-depressant meds cold turkey (werent helping anyway), listening to sad depressing music, thinking things that upset me, purposly drinking loads before bed so i wake up in the night more, each time drinking more (I wake up alot even if i dont do this).

Its like i dont want to feel like this but at the same time i feel like i deserve to suffer. Trying to get help in the form of cbt therapy at the moment for anxiety but considering not turning up because i dont feel like i deserve the help when im not exactly helping myself in other ways. I don't know if to ask my therapist about it if i go because im there for anxiety not other crap.
