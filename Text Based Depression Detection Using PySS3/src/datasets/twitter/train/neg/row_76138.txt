Suicidal thoughts every second of everyday.I am on depression medication, I am "high functioning" and very few people know that I struggle with severe depression. Recently I began having vivid, specific suicidal thoughts increasing to the point of every second. I went to the hospital, and was referred to talk therapy. I can see a psychiatrist it about 6 weeks, until them I feel like I am barely surviving.
