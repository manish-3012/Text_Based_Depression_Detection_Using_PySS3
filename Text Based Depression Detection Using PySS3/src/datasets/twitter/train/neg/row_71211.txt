t h e r e i s n o e s c a p eitâ€™s been a year. iâ€™m doing everything they tell me will make me feel better. no self harm. taking seven pills a day. have a therapist. and yet, here i am, the same person with the same mentality. nothing good ever lasts. even if i feel hope for a day or a week or a month, i always come back to this. thereâ€™s no escaping this feeling of utter emptiness. i donâ€™t want to do it anymore. thereâ€™s no point in loving another day. i canâ€™t talk to my friends anymore about how i feel because they are tired of it, and iâ€™m barely holding onto them because they want to escape my sadness more than they care for my wellbeing. but i donâ€™t blame them, i donâ€™t see why anyone would want to deal with me. so i have been keeping this inside. iâ€™m slowly closing off again. i donâ€™t think i can keep doing this anymore.
