If I give up on life and nothing interests me do I need to go to a hospital?Nothing interests me. I have no desire to get out of bed. I have no desire to eat. I have no desire to see people. I donâ€™t care whether I live or die, Iâ€™m tired of trying to OD and kill myself only to end up in some shithole psychiatric hospital. I just want to waste away, nothing interests me anymore. I would rather die than go back to another facility my insurance covers. The shit Iâ€™ve seen and felt in those places hits me like a train every morning.
