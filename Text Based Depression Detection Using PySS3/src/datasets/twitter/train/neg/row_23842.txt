Might die in a couple weeks or soDear Reddit.

It has come to my conclusion that the war inside my head can not be beaten. Iâ€™ve considered many possibilities that may occur.
There isnâ€™t anything for me in this world anymore. Iâ€™ve always been bullied and Iâ€™m 16 today. 
2016 to now is shitty. 2016 I was in grade 8 at. 13 years old. I was always bullied for how my character was in the god forsaken world. Many toxic people from my world.

Grade 9 2018, moved to high school at age 14, was the silent kid just growing had a couple friends. They became toxic so they became dead to me.

Grade 10, didnâ€™t really have anything or anyone to cling onto at the time so I was all out of options. I believed I didnâ€™t matter in the world so I attempted suicide on March 10th 2019 by pills and that pretty much failed.

Grade 11... wanted to commit suicide multiple times waiting for the right day but I guess that never came. My teacher found out I was self harming and suicidal. She helped me for a while and got me through a semester. Once last semester hit, I was happy for a bit with life then it just went down again when summer hit.

Summer time now... just thinking about all the past things that have happened in this life.. it needs to end cause Iâ€™m done living with it and I donâ€™t need this struggle anymore. Iâ€™ve been thinking of maybe pushing people away first, giving them some last words to remember me by before I go.

Not really sure what Iâ€™m gonna kill myself with though. Might just cut myself, overdose on some pills again, probably go somewhere far never to be seen again. Still thinking about it though, not like anyone will remember me or even care. Just thought of putting something up before I go into the bottomless pit of this post feed.
