Wath do you do when you just are so tired of being sad and you just want to die?This is my story, sorry for my bad english. I had depression since i was little, i had two attempted suicides at 15 and 16. I have eating desorders since i was in college. I was kidnapped tow year ago for 10 days. After that i leave my house and my parents and went to another city to start fresh, the problem is i am 33 years old and i cant find a job, also i gained 50 pounds, my eating desorder came back after my kidnapping, and the worst of all is that the sadness just dont go away, i try to have positive feelings, i try to diet, i try to go out on dates, but feeiing so sad all the time  and my eating desorder and my weigth gain and not finding a job and everything is so stronger that me. I am just so tired i  just want to die and end  all the sadness. I been fitightn it since i was in my twentys and when i finally thoutgh that i have it under control i was kidnaped and everithing is now again like i havent improved at all. I cant count with my family. So, please, tell me what to do, because if it was for me right now i am spending these last days researching ways on the internet to kill my self with little pain.
