I failed to kill myself 2 weeks agoYh somehow I'm retarded and failed. I was going to go out the classic way of hanging yourself, I went to a park and into a forest (or rather just lots of trees I guess it's not really a forest). It was night time, so I had jumped the fence. It was dark and I didn't choose a strong branch, after I tied it to the branch, placed it around my neck and got off what I was standing on, the branch broke from my weight. I ended up going home with a noose around my neck, and just crying. Eventually I got it off when I got home. And I still want to die.
