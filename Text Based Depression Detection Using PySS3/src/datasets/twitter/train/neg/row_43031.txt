I'm doneEverything's too hard. I can't study for any of my tests, so I probably won't pass the AP test at the end of the year. I still haven't started on my long term project that was assigned last August and most people already have done, and I have a presentation in a couple of weeks, and the last time I had a presentation I fainted in front of the class. I've thought about it for over a year and I've decided to overdose on sleeping pills tonight.
