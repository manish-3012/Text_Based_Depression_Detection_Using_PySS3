What's the point going on!I've been utterly depressed for over 6 years now and I'm just sick of it all. I CAN go on, I have been for 21 years, but it doesn't seem to be getting any better, in fact, it seems to only get worse. Don't get me wrong, I have days where I'm content, even happy, but the shit certainly out ways it.

 All we are is a cluster fuck of atoms and bacteria trying to survive. Free will is a just a concept, your brain makes decisions before you even consciously know you've made it. Humans are designed to just "keep going". Eating, sleeping and mating. The "ego / personality" is merely your brains collective memories and decisions. I don't see why I should carry on. I've spoke to doctors, psychologists, family, friends but nothing changes. My only hesitation is leaving my family behind, although the longer I go on the easier this decision of suicide is becoming as "existence is pain" - Mr Meeksees.

I doubt any of this makes much sense, but I'm sure you all understand. Life can suck my balls.
