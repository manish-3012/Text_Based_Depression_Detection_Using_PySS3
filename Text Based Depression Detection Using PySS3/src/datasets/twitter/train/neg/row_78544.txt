just want peacesometimes iâ€™ve gotten peace. i donâ€™t have a clouded perception of the past- i know i have been happy before. it just simply doesnâ€™t outweigh what happens when iâ€™m not happy. i donâ€™t know what changed, but i was doing fine after the rpe for about a month, then on christmas day it went downhill. maybe i hadnâ€™t been doing good and i was hiding it from myself, but i had a complete breakdown at the christmas dinner. ever since then, itâ€™s drink, be happy for an hour, then cry until i fall asleep. or if iâ€™m sober that night, just cry. and stay up until 5. even at work iâ€™ll see a guy who resembles him and cry in front of my coworkers. it is literally humiliating. i hear a rpe joke, i cant stop thinking about it for the rest of the day. i get with a guy, it reminds me of him, i start crying. i cant escape it. itâ€™s in everything i do, everywhere i go. it didnâ€™t go to trial. he is facing no punishment but â€˜his ownâ€™. whoâ€™s to say he feels a single ounce of fucking guilt? i used to want to stay alive to prove he couldnâ€™t kill me, but i donâ€™t have that fight left in me anymore. do you know how fucking tired i am? i know people have it worse than me but i really cant do this anymore. all i do is try. constantly, every day. i hide it from nearly everybody. family, therapist, college friends. none of them know i even think about it anymore. if i tell someone how i feel, they wonâ€™t send me back to college. and i need to go to college. living at home is killing me. but then again iâ€™m sure iâ€™ll want to kill myself at college too. i just really want to give up. iâ€™m so fucking sick of this. i cant keep doing this every fucking day.
