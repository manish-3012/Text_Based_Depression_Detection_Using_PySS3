i cant escape thisBeing in comfort zone is the worst thing in the world. Fucking i became such a loser, i cant fight anymore for anything i can just wake up, go in front of my computer and spend my day doing absolutely nothing just being thinking how sad i am. Is it worth living like that? its not its worthless i hope to end my life in the next moths.
