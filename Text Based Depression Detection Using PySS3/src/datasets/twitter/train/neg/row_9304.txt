I got my hopes up, such a stupid fuck.I had a job interview for the first time in ages, same place my dad has been working and from what I was told, getting this job was a done deal. Its nothing big, minimum wage when you start there, but it would have been the first stable job of my adult life.

Just got the email telling me I didn't get it. No reason.

Also, I recently got a letter from Mind in Bexely, a mental health group here in the UK. I have been on their waiting list for over a year now waiting for a councillor or therapist or whatever to help me, but this letter says because I have not used their services in 6 months my case has been closed. I might be able to get back on the waiting list, but I'm certain if I were put back on, I would start from the bottom all over again.

So yeah, what I think may be the last chance I had to get help and/or pull myself out of my current life just died in the last week. I wish I had a gun so I could shoot myself in the head.
