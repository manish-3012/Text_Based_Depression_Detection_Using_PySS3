Happy New YearsEntering 2021 with another suicide note,Iâ€™ve been writing a lot of suicide notes but never got the courage to actually make it a real note...As Iâ€™m writing my note a thought just pops into my head,it keeps telling me somewhere out there someone is going through worse than I am...that thought alone helps me from ever completing my note...but Iâ€™m afraid one day if Iâ€™m writing my note,that THOUGHT wonâ€™t pop back in my head anymore and then I might actually make my suicide note a real note....2021 happy New Years
