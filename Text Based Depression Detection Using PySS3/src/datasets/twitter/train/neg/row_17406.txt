I'm back again...I wish I wasn't so chicken. Nothing in life makes me happy anymore and I feel completely empty and connected to nothing. It all feels fake. I want to die so finally people might feel the amount of pain I have felt my entire life. I used to tell people I felt suicidal. Now I don't so no one will stop me. I just wish I could work out the best way to do it...
