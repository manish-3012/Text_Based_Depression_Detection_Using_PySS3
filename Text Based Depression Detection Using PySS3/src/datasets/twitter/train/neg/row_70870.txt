I've fucking had it.I'm unable to do the most simple of tasks.
I'm so fucking stupid that everyone thinks I'm a joke.
I have too much social anxiety to be social in public, and I fucking hate it.
My own mom treats me like I'm an idiot.
I'm fat, I'm stupid, I'm ugly, I hurt people, and I just want to die.
