I'm seriously considering suicide in the coming days.Throwaway
I'm a junior in highschool. I have depression with borderline tendencies. It's struck me recently exactly how pointless everything I do is. I'm normally a good student but I have a 50 and a 30 for this quarter because I can't muster up the motivation to do my schoolwork. None of my friends actually care about what I'm going through. My girlfriend is just using me to get to one of my friends but I'm so starved for affection I don't even care. I've started self harming again. I've attempted suicide before but this time I want to do it right. I've done so much wrong and I can't deal with it, I can't cope with it. I'm sorry if this didn't make any sense.
