My best friend has been chronically depressed/suicidal and I'm really worried.Throwaway for obvious reasons here - she also frequents this sub and I don't want her to maul me later. Sorry to the mods if I'm posting to the wrong sub or I've misread the rules. 

I've known my best friend for a couple years now, and she told me that she was suicidal/depressed/self harming about a year ago. She recently attempted suicide and thankfully failed about a week ago. A couple of days ago she told me she was planning her second attempt about a month from now, and I'm completely at a loss for what to do or how to help. I want to be optimistic, but I feel like I'm trying to delay something inevitable - she completely has the means to go through with it anytime she wants. I'm worried that there's nothing I can do to help her or even push the date back at all - she's easily my favorite person and she's helped me through so much that I wouldn't know what to do without her.  She has tons of friends who all adore and love her and she goes to therapy, but her school, work, and home life put tons of stress on her on top of her depression. I really want the best for her but I don't know how to even start to help.

I'm hoping you guys here can help me out, even just a little. I'm at a complete loss of what to do and how to help, and I'm really worried for her safety. I really don't want my best friend to die. Any suggestions/tips/comments are really, really welcomed!
