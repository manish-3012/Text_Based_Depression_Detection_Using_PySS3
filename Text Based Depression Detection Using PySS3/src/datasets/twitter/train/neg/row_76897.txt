I'm not gonna kill myself, but if something happens I won't exactly mind it eitherI can't remember feeling happy or alright for an extended period of time, my brother knows my reddit so this feels like a bit of a gamble, it's not for attention but it might as well be as far as he's concerned I guess. It's weird. I wouldn't kill myself, I've been clean of self-harming for like 2 years? At the same time though, I feel like I just go through the motions with college and life. I'm bored and unhappy and suicidal, but I don't want to act on it, I don't want it to be my fault. I feel like I depend on my cat and small things to make me happy, or at least to hold on longer. I'm going to a sushi restaurant with a friend, I have to wait until that, there's a fanfiction I like that only has 10 of the 18 chapters planned currently online, I need to wait until the end. I don't believe in the afterlife, I don't believe in god, but I'm always afraid I'll end up in hell, and be in a worse version of life than I'm in now. It doesn't feel really fair to live depressed and suicidal and to be tortured once I die. I can't make sense of myself, and I know it's okay, but it doesn't feel like it is. 

I know I'm not gonna kill myself, but it sure as hell feels like I might when it's 2am and all I can do is cry and wait until I fall asleep. I have a good life, but I'm scared of the future, and I don't want to become old one day. I just wish I could get hit by a car and actually die from it this time around, but also my cat wouldn't understand why I'm suddenly gone and that idea hurts more than the idea of putting my friends and family through absolute hell. I don't know, maybe it's just "dumb teenage hormones" but I'm almost 20 so that feels like a reach. Fuck man, it's not even about death, it's about the lack of existence. Not existing would have been easier. Stopping to exist, just vanishing into non existence, not hurting anyone, that would be ideal.
