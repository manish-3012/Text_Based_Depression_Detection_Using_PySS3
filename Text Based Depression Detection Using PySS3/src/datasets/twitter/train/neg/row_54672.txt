Just can't do it anymoreI just don't feel like living anymore. I have gone through so much in the past 5 years and my life has been ruined because of my own goddamn fault. My wife has left me as a result. I live in new york.. i dont know anyone here.
I just feel like the best peace I can have right now is to jump out of this window. Its the weekend and every place I have called to seek help is closed. 

All my hope has been lost. I have fucked it all up.
