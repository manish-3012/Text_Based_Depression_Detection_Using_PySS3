Always feels like an optionI feel imposter syndrome being here.


I always think to myself â€œIâ€™m not that suicidalâ€


But everything feels like itâ€™s becoming this massive big mess that I just donâ€™t have time to sort out. Everyone else seems to be sorted and I keep looking at myself and asking why I canâ€™t even just get these small things done that will make me feel better about the big things.
 

Every time I have a night like this, where I canâ€™t sleep because all those things I shouldâ€™ve done months ago are whirring around my brain I think â€œI can always die. If it gets worse, I could die.â€ And then, when Iâ€™ve decided I could die if I really canâ€™t anymore...I can sleep again.


Iâ€™ve had this thought since I was a teenager - when I was much much MUCH closer to what stereotypical suicidal is.  But itâ€™s becoming a thought that repeats itself more and more frequently. Itâ€™s not working like it has in the past, enough comfort, enough of a â€œplanâ€ that I could sleep off of the back of it.


And here I am, awake again, trying to use that fucked up thought to comfort my poor overwhelmed brain enough to sleep.
