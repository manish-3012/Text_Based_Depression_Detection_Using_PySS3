Comparison is a thief of happinessTodayâ€™s a bad day and itâ€™s only 11am 
I feel so empty, drained and emotionally heavy. 
No matter how hard I try to focus on positive thinking, it isnâ€™t working. 
Comparison truly is the thief of happiness. 

Why does my body look like this and hers look like this? 
Why does my hair sit so shit in comparison to hers? 
Why am I so short and petite? 
I want to have an hourglass figure
I have nothing 
No one wants to be me or look like me or have something I have etc. 
No one. Not a single soul. 

I know Iâ€™m fortunate in a lot of ways. I have a job. An education. Shelter. Warmth and food. But that means nothing if Iâ€™m not happy. 

I just want it all to end. I have to live in this body for the rest of my life and I hate it. I canâ€™t stand it. I donâ€™t feel sexy. I feel like a poor attempt as a woman. Thereâ€™s nothing feminine about my figure / frame. Iâ€™m dainty and have size 4 feet. Thatâ€™s the only ladylike thing about my appearance. I just hate it all. 

I feel so low and my body is screaming out all of these shit things about how it looks. Idk if this is a suicide watch post or if it should be on here but I needed somewhere to vent because Iâ€™m not sure how much longer I can go on in this horrendously ugly shell.
