how to make sure my best friend survivesi already made up my mind and i won't stop myself anymore. my best friend in the world has so much potential and i just know they're going to have a happy future. i promised i would stay alive but i'm too tired. when i go, i know it's gonna suck a lot. for a long time we only had each other, and we've also been through a lot together. i just want them to be okay. they're the only reason i made it this far and i don't want them to feel like they failed me just because i wasn't strong enough. is there anything i can do to help them get through it before i go? 
don't say "just don't kys" i'll block u
