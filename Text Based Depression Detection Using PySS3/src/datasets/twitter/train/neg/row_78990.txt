Suicide Due to bad breathSo I'm 22 years old now.Graduated from high school in 2015.Went to University but had to dropout in April 2016 for financial reasons.One of the reasons that low-key encouraged me to dropout and not have any high interest in seeking financial help was my bad breath.I applied for the military and went for the interview and was never called,I think my chronic bad breath played a part in that.I applied for a bursary and was accepted into university last year and during the registration I got involved in a situation where my bad breath embarassed me and got depressed and felt like killing myself.I then lost interest in looking for work or institutions to study.Attempted suicide on July this year just the night before my birthday but hesitated asking myself what if this problem will go away eventually.I hasn't but has gotten rather worse.I dropped out of church,I no longer go to town or shops,hate public places and meeting people.The only thing I've been hoping for in the past 3 years is to die.I can't afford to go to a dentist since I don't work.been thinking the problem is my tonsils because they're impacted and have stones but I have sinus and post nasal drip problem as well.

I am naturally a social anxious person and this condition has made it worse for me.I cry every night.my future doesn't look bright.I feel like I'm good as dead and have no purpose in life.been practicing good oral hygiene but it's in vain.I spent the rest of the day hiding in my home and my peers are doing good things with their lives.

This ruined my life. I've lost my personality and character.My naturally low self-esteem got below zero now.I live in fear like a criminal.I can't comment in conversations I would have liked to.

This might sound stupid and simple but I just felt I just had to lay it here since I can't share it with anyone else I know because of fearing embarassment.
