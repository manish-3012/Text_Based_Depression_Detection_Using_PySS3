I'm Mentally and Physically Ill Unable to Work and I Need To DieI am a burden to everyone in my life. I stress out my loved ones with my complaining and paranoia and my inability to perform basic tasks or work. I don't want to be a burden I just want this to end and as soon as I figure out a way to kill myself I will get my affairs in order and do it. I don't think other people who are 'burdens' should die but I should because I don't have and can't find the support that would help if it even exists. I'm going to leave as little as possible behind for people to deal with and if possible not even a body to be found. I've been looking at assisted suicide in the Netherlands but that's a fantasy. How do I just end it? I know it's selfish but it'll be better for everyone when I'm gone they'll forget me soon enough.
