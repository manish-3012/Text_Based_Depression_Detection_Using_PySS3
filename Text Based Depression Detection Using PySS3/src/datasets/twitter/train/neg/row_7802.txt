I have nothingI caught who I thought was my future, talking to the girl he's having/had an emotional affair with for the 4th time (that I can count).

I have nothing.

The only thing keeping me going today is that i need to make sure his car makes it "home."  It's not my home anymore.  It never was I guess.

I guess I just.  I don't know.  Tonight I will go, I feel terrible for the Christmas gifts wasted on me.  

I'm lost and I have nothing.  My future with him was keeping me alive.

It's all gone.

I wasn't worth it.
