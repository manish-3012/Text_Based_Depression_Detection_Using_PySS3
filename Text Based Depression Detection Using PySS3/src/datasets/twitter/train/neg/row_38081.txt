I am lost.Hello, I do not know if its the right place to write here, but i think i have suicidal tendencies and i feel like it is getting stronger. I am afraid of phisical pain. If i had a gun or ability to have one i think i might have done it already.  The reason for     wanting to do it, is quite stupid. I do not think that staying alive just to be alive is any good  I am sorry to inconvenience if this is the wrong topic for this subreddit.
