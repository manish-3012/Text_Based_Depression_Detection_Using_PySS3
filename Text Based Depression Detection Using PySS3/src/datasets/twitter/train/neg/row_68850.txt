Contemplated suicide for 10ish years now, now considering counseling/drugs, but have no financial resources. What do I do?Hi everyone,

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am a 22-year-old college graduate, with a generally successful life for my age and big, positive things ahead of me, yet I am still miserably sad. No one around me knows except for my best friend, who ignores me when I try to talk things out, because "you're always sad". 

I have no one to turn to. My parents don't believe in "help" (my dad is manic-depressive schizophrenic and refuses treatment) so I have no mental support there. Everyone at work comments on how friendly and bubbly I am. They'd never believe me if I told them.

I am very strapped for cash, so I have never sought help, and I don't even know if I believe there is "help" for me, but I'm hoping. I don't know what to do or if this is even an option for me since I am so poor, but I thought if there was, you guys would know it. It isn't normal to have to come up with a reason every week not to kill yourself. Right now, mine is to not leave my parents with a $55k student loan that they've cosigned on.

I don't even know where to begin. I am at the end of my mental limit and have nowhere else to turn. Everything I read seems to involve living in a city, having tons of cash, or having parents to help, and I have none of that. Please help me.
