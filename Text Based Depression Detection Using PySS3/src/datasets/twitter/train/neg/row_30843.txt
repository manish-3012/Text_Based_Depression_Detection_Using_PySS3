No one will miss me when I'm deadThey'll be surprised, maybe. I don't know a lot of people. It'll be a brief conversation at work: "you know /u/DoNotMatter killed himself, right?" "Wow, what a fucking loser." 

There won't be any eulogies for me, no funeral, no nothing. I don't know what they do with bodies who no one has claimed. Maybe they just cremate them or put them in an unmarked grave. I'll be wherever they put the bodies that used to be people that no one cared about.

No one cares about me because I'm not someone worth caring about. My family doesn't care because I'm not worth caring about. I've failed them so many times in every capacity that they'd have to be delusional to see any value in me. My few friends don't see anything in me because there's nothing to see, I'm just one more body. I'm a profoundly boring and forgettable person to begin with. I'm not attractive or witty or charismatic or funny. You get nothing from talking to me. I'm a literal cipher. 

I'm pretty sure people at my job won't even realize I'm dead. It'll go on for months until someone finally remembers that an ugly person used to work there, who wasn't particularly good at their job. Who had no talents or abilities to speak of. An absolutely pathetic person who made no impression on anyone.

I won't be missed. Check my post history, is that someone you'd have sex with or talk to or fall in love with? Is it even possible to love someone that repulsive? Read my post history, and you'll agree with me that I deserve to slowly be tortured, slowly have my skin peeled off and my organs pulled out with no painkillers. I should've been in a concentration camp, I should've been trapped by a serial killer, those are fates that someone like me, with no value at all, deserves. 

I hurt everyone in my life. Every time something good could've happened, I ruin it. I'm just so fucking empty and it's killing me. I'm so goddamn tired of being me. I would give anything to be anyone else.
