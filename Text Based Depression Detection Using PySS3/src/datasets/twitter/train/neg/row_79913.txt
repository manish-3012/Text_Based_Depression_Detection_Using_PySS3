Why the fuck should I go on?I am a complete fucking 27 year old failure.
My parents talk about not knowing what they could additionally do because "they've tried everything". 
Friends don't react and I haven't seen most of them for quite a while. 
In the beginning of the year I met a girl, the first one in this miserable life who would like me more than a friend. I haven't heard from her in 4 weeks. 

While thinking about all those things, I watch the successful people advertising their lifes through social media, struggle with my university studies and try to dose myself with video games, series and movies.

I hate everything of this.
