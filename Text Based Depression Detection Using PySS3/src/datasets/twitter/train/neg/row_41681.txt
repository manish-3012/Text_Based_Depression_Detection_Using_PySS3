Today sucked.I feel like I've told the story of what happened today a thousand times, so I'll try and keep it simple. I said some things in anger. They got blown out of proportion. I lost friends, or people I thought were friends. I realize now they never understood me anyway.

Everyone kept saying, "you need to go to therapy," as though I could just get up and go and be cured of all my ills. The healing process is not instantaneous.

I'm having thoughts of putting a gun to my head. I am not a problem to be solved, but clearly others don't see it that way. So, perhaps I should just solve the problem for everyone and remove myself from the equation.

I don't care about my projects anymore. I have no one to apologize to but my dog. I am so hollow and broken that I no longer care about anything.

What if I go to the hospital? I was in a psych ward of sorts, once, because I was afraid that I was going to kill myself. It was years ago. The doctor said I didn't need that level of care. I considered that a victory. But maybe now I've become so distorted that I do need it.

I guess what I'm wondering is, if I go to the hospital, will they release me by Tuesday so I'm still covered by my PTO hours? Heh.
