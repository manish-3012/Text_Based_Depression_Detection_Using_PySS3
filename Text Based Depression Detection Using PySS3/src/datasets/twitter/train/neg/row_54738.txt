2nd time I feel really depressed in my lifeIt just feels so stupid. I am so pathetic. The only thing that really kept me from drowning last time was this memory I have... when my sister was having her birthday party... when she was 1. That day, my mom let me hold her for the first time. I was 8. And it's just such a stupid thing to keep living for...

I am such a mess right now... I broke up with my ex around 2 weeks ago. She was sort of manipulative I guess but she had a point.. I don't really have friends. Today I just got refused for the nth time to go somewhere and hey, I like watching films alone and stuff, but it's just so fucking sad.

And I hurt my ex to the extreme that time... her tutor even threatened to call the police and made them expel me from my university. I had a counseling meeting at my university, showed the hateful emails I had sent and the girl that talked to me said she thought that they couldnt expell me since I really didnt make any death threats or stuff. 

Thing is... I really don't want to either go to jail or be expelled, not for me but for my mom and sister's sake. If they were not alive, I wouldn't give a fuck. 

Yesterday I was walking home after being unable to swim (the pool was not open) and I crossed a bridge. I really wanted to jump, I took a photo of it and started typying a text message to my ex. 

And then I stopped.

I looked at myself, had again the memory of my sister when I was holding her and... I just felt so ashamed of even thinking about 'announcing' my attempt to my ex and of even thinking about suicide.

Thing is... I can't kill myself. I really REALLY wish I could but I can't. My body won't let me. That memory won't let me.
And here I am, posting this on reddit.
