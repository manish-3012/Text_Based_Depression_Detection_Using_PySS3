My partner yelled at me â€œGod, why do I still have to be nice to you???â€Being nice has always been a challenge for my partner. Sheâ€™s an external processor, and she gets pretty mean when things are bothering her. Itâ€™s been hard for me, especially over the last six years. 

Iâ€™m medicated now. Iâ€™m really depressed. I love my family, especially my kids, but I canâ€™t help but feel like once they move on with their lives, all Iâ€™ll have is this person who is bothered by me. Sheâ€™s so rude to me - every day. I try to deal with it, but Iâ€™m breaking. Iâ€™m broken. I think I made a mistake, but thereâ€™s so way I can leave the place where my kids live. 

I just donâ€™t want to wake up anymore. I go to bed sad and wake up to someone who acts like she canâ€™t stand me. She says she can - that sheâ€™s just processing - but... I just donâ€™t want to live anymore.
