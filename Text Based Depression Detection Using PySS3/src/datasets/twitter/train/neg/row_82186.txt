What is wrong with me?I have been struggling with depression for a year or so and it has only got worse. I try to talk with friends, despite the support they give me I carry on reverting back to this endless cycle. I sit in bed sometimes and dream about suicide, my life after death (as ironic as that is). I have never had anything "bad" happen to me, or not that I am aware of at least. I spoke to several counsellors, but it always felt like they were interrogating me and i hated it. The only times I am at peace or happy is when I write poetry, the ability to express my inner emotions without fear of judgement. Even while writing this I feel a bit better. I sometimes lay in bed and wonder what is wrong with me, why I feel so terrible and guilt ridden, like a disappointment to everyone around me. I wish I would start-over, or at least erase my memories. I feel sick to my stomach and constantly romanticise death and suicide. I know this is wrong but I cant help but still feel it. Sorry for the long wall of text, but I don't know what to do and how to cope, and I am worried the more I am contemplating suicide I can see myself going through with it. 

Not sure if this was the right way to post or the right place, but any support would be greatly appreciated.
