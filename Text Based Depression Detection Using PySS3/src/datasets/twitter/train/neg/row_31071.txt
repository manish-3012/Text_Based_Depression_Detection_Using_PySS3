I(16M) ruined my own life and I need help on how to fix it.I want to die. I really want to. But I can't. 
Those who are close to me, those who I love will not be able to bear the pain. I feel guilty even thinking about suicide. I don't want my parents to feel that pain. I love them a lot but this pain inside of me hurts so much.

I failed all my classes last semester. I had no motivation and I just wanted it to end. I always try to improve, but it just comes crashing down every single time. I feel like I was always destined to fail. I didn't ask to be born. I hide behind a facade of happiness and good advice, but I can't seem to help myself.

I just want to live out my life as a game developer. I dislike school. In my school, it feels so competitive and I can't handle it anymore. I just feel like I want to run away and rot away in a corner. It's unbearable to me and I have this sense of almost crippling fear and anxiety for multiple classes every day because I don't do my classwork. 

How do I fix my life?
I've been searching for so many ways but I don't know how. 

Please. Someone, please help me.
