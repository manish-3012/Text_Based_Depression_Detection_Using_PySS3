can't do anything right, failing at work/job/navy shit (throwaway)So yeah, I am having a shitty time at work. Joined the navy 4 years ago (where did the time go), and now its gone to shit. I can't do anything right, I mean I can't even qualify my senior in rate since I speak and stupid shit comes out. I pass tests, I can do some maintenance, and well, everything I do is shit. 

I'm literally only not dead because I don't want to fuck over my coworkers (they are cool, my leadership is mostly cool, its just, I'm a burden, and if I died, at least it would be well more qualified people.


I'm sorry, its just, I go from feeling happy, to shitty and self destructive, but I put on the external happy face even though internaly I want to die every day I drive to work. Sometimes I go home and think of using my guns, but then my parents would be sad, and then I go in my office alone on duty, and make a noose, and put it away.

how do I stop this, I literally found myself making a noose and standing on a chair before I went on my last watch, and I don't want to, but then I hear something else went wrong and I'm like.. "welp I want to die."

I'm sorry, its just well, I don't understand my emotions besides the constant background noise of "I want to die", and no one else knows this (they all think I'm mister happy forever, when I just make this face to not die.

sorry for the wall of text everyone. I just.. I don't know what the hell to do.
