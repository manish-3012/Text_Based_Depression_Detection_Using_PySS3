Can't sleep...I hate insomnia. All night I have been feeling depressed and *so lonely*. Right now I'm mindlessly playing video games, trying to distract myself from this feeling of emptiness. My bf is sound asleep in the other room, completely unaware of how I really feel...

Thought I would cast a message out and see if anyone else is finding it difficult to fall asleep?
