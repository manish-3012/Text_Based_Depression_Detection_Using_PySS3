Donâ€™t know what to doI tried calling a help line, hang up after they finally pick up, donâ€™t have the courage to share there. Tried webchat help didnâ€™t connect or work. Tried texting no longer available. Everything I do just makes things worse. I donâ€™t trust anyone not even my self, whenever I finally get the courage to try it always back fires
