I never believed this!!I posted a few days ago,I was going through a break down!! Everything just overwhelmed me. Starting over after leaving an abusive relationship,having difficulties at my soon to be job and needing help with clothing! 

Well a bunch of wonderful reddiotors gave me kind words. They said it would get better but I doubted it.

Well, things did get better at the last minute,really.


This past Friday I called my boss to explain my situation,I did not have work appropriate clothing. She understood but did not emphatize. She gave me until Monday to get everything in line. Well I was unable to so I knew what the consequences would be. Well my sister went over to speak with her,since they are girl friends and my sister got my boss to reconsider. I have as much time as I need to get my clothing situation in line. I still needed to hurry as my sister cannot support me but I'm relived I'll have a job when I do. Woohoo.

Don't lose hope&lt;3

If anyone needs a friend to talk to pm me :)) I'll be glad to hear you out.
