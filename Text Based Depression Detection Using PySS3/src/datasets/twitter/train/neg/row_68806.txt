I just want someone to care for meTime and time again I get attached to people, but in the end I always mean nothing to them. It hurts so much. As dumb as it is I just want to be important to people. Why am I so unloveable? What am I doing wrong? The people around me wouldnâ€™t care if I were alive or dead so why not just off myself ?
