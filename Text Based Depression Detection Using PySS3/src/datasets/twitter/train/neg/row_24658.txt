Will someone spend some time with me so I'm not alone when I die?I am amazed at how many are still here trying to work with my through my arguments and pain. I feel that I was right coming here. I no longer have the same will to finalize my intent, however I don't know how long it will last. Please keep me believing that I could survive on my own. I wish I could help you understand just how down in a hole I am but it's a lifetime of buildup. 

Edit: As you can see by the edit I am still here. I'm able to smile at that. I may not know if I can continue to sustain myself or at least for how long until I fall/if I fall back to that horrible place. It felt so much like a roll of the die. Like I gambled on a chance by coming here and just...not being alone. All of you - Every single comment in this thread and ever single message I received was positive and compelled me to respond. Because of that I believe it held me back long enough to grasp onto reality. 

I made some friends here and I will try harder to not let that be in vain. So here's to us. Cheers.
