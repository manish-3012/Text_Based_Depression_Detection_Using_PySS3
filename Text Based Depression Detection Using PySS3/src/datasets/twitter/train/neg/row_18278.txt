If I didn't want to kill myself before, I definitely do now lol.So last night I was asking random people on Omegle for suicide suggestions. Like how should I do it, etc. Then I met this Indian dude. He told me to drink too much water and land-drown. So I thanked him (cause I genuinely like that idea) and as I'm saying goodbye he tells me to wait. He thought I had been joking. So now he's telling me why I shouldn't. This, that, and the third. After an hour arguing with this man, he tells me that he skipped an important class in college. Might have fucked up career opportunities. (Which I highly doubt) But I got mad at him and told him he was a moron if he really did that. Why waste your time on a waste of life? So anyway, I made him feel like a hero I guess. Told him to tell his professor that he saved a life. Told him I wasn't going to kill myself. But that's a lie. Just wanted him to feel like he didn't waste his time. But now, the desire to die has intensified tenfold. I feel bad for him. In the sense that he just wasted his time on someone who's going to kill themself anyway. Even if the whole school thing is a lie. It's something no one has ever done for me. Or should ever do.

TLDR; Guy tried to prevent me from commiting suicide. I told him he was successful. But he wasn't.
