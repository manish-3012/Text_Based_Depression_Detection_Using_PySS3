You know you're getting close to doing it whenYou don't give a fuck about "proving people wrong" or other people's opinions of you when you're dead. 

As a teen I imagined all these scenarios of people in my school "finally being sorry" after I killed myself, but now I don't give a fuck who's sorry. I don't give a damn about getting revenge, or living my miserable life just to prove some random cunt from school wrong. 

When I'm dead I'm fucking dead, i don't care about what ugly picture my local newspaper is going to use to report my death, I don't give a fuck about what random people post on my Facebook wall. I don't care about people making sad posts acting like they were my friend to get clout. They can go right ahead. I don't give two shits about them.

The only peoples feelings I care about are my family's and I just want it to hurt as little for them as possible. 

Otherwise, I'm over it. My life is done, I have lived long enough.
