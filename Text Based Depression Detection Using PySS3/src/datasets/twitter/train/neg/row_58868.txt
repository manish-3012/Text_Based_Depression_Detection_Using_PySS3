I've always met the wrong kind of people which sucks. Every person that I met made my life worse so far.And my life already started close to rock bottom. My mental state has been shit forever. Fuck this, I really hate my life. Also someone broke into my room and stole a shitload of stuff today. I'm now broke and I want to die.:
