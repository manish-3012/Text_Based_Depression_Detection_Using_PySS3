Iâ€™m too afraid to die, but I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.Iâ€™m 26f and Iâ€™m in my final year of my PhD. If you looked at my life on my insta or Facebook, youâ€™d think I was happy and living well. I canâ€™t even cry. It takes too much energy to cry. I canâ€™t even eat. I weighed 138lbs two weeks ago and today I weighed 121 when I stepped on the scale (which is a lot when youâ€™re only 5â€™1) I currently live in a state where I have no family and friends. Honestly, I donâ€™t really have friends out of stats either. 

None of this is an exaggeration or me not thinking clearly. If I died in this apartment, *no one would ever find me.* Itâ€™d probably take months before someone realized I was gone. Since Iâ€™m in the dissertation phase of my PhD, I donâ€™t have classes. I write it independently. Which is another reason why no one would notice if I died. On the bright side, at least no one would be hurt if I died. Sure, thereâ€™d be social media posts written by people who havenâ€™t spoken to me in years, but thatâ€™s about it. 

Over the past 2 weeks, Iâ€™ve called and txted just about every â€œfriendâ€ I thought I had. No one answered. No one texted back. So I guess that was my test or maybe my â€œsign.â€ They donâ€™t even care when Iâ€™m alive, so they donâ€™t definitely wonâ€™t care (or even know) if Iâ€™m dead. I know Iâ€™m way too miserable to live, but I really donâ€™t think I have the courage or the strength to die. Not to mention, the anxiety of what will happen to my dog scares me. If I die, idk what will happen to her. I would hate for anything to happen to my dog. Sheâ€™s the only one who cares right now.
