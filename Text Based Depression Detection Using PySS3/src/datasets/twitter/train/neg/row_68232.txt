I donâ€™t think my mom understands how secrets workA few weeks ago my cousin told my sister (20), who Iâ€™ll call R, about something (I think it has something to do with lgbt) and she didnâ€™t tell anyone, but my mom heard her and decided to tell my other sister (24? Iâ€™m not sure). Anyway, R got really mad at my mom because it my cousin wasnâ€™t ready for it yet. My mom said â€œI have a gay sonâ€ and in my head I was asking what that had to do with anything. They stopped arguing and I went to my room. Later she said that she told my family that I was gay and I was fucking pissed. I donâ€™t know if she cares about me or my siblings and only cares for herself.
