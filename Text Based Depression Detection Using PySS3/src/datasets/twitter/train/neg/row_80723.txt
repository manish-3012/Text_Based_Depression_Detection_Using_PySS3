i feel like a burdenI feel like i'm burdening my family and friends. All i do is bring them down. I made them all lose sleep and sanity by driving to the hospital everyday to see me during forced involuntary eating disorder treatment. And now that I'm home, 'treatment' has driven me even worse and now I'm relapsing (even though i never recovered) and lying and snapping all the time. Today i was going to go out with them but then i got really anxious about having a panic attack so i cried and stayed home but now they feel stressed out leaving me here like this. 

I stopped hanging out with my friends because they would make fun of my eating disorder, too, and I didn't want to eat around them so i always declined invites to hangout. I made them feel like it was their fault and that they were bad people when really i am the shit person and friend. 

I never do any good. I make everyone angry and hate themselves or feel bad about what they're eating even though I don't make comments on what people are eating. Everyone feels uncomfortable eating around me. My sister always makes fun of my eating disorder and calls me stupid and dramatic for having one.

My mother recently got my sister a job and I feel so useless and left out. She refuses to try and get me one. 

When it's just my mum and sister, they're so happy and relaxed. They talk to each other all the time and ignore me. When i try to join in, i get yelled at by my sister or she calls me stupid. 

I just feel everyone would be so much better without me because i've caused nothing but pain and stress and anger. 

I wish i had died that night in emergency like i wanted to. Everything would have been so much better if i had. My family is so much happier without me.
