How I wish I could start againI have never wished for wealth, or power, or any of the typical fortunes people generally hold in high regard and would demand if they ever had the chance to ask for a wish.

All I want is to erase my past, and begin again. I don't care if I have to abandon everyone I know and everything I have lived, I just want to begin again.
