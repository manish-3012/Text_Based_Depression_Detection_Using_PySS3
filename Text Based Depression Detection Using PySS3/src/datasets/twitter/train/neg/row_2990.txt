iâ€™ve given upevery time i get close to my dream the universe tears it away from. i feel like my life is just a toy for some sadistic more powerful being. this last time was the last straw. i have no energy to fight anymore. 3 weeks ago i was living with my best friends doing what i love. today iâ€™m working at a chain restaurant on the opposite side of the country making minimum wage.  why even keep trying anymore if itâ€™s all for nothing.
