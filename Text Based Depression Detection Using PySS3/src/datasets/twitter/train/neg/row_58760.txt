16 and my life is overHyperthyroid. Depressed. Can't sleep without drugs. Dissociated. Vision impaired. Body feels like shit. Won't stop waking up for random fucking reasons. I just want to fucking end it all. I want all of this to end. I'm not me anymore. I'm not a fucking goofy kid anymore. It's all fucking crumbling and I'm so ready to die. Haven't been this suicidal since fucking middle school. I'm hopeful to get some kind of relief today, but everything is still so shit. Everything. I feel like a paranoid schizophrenic. I feel like I'll never be me again because of all these fucking antidepressant drugs I'm being put on. I feel like I'll never fucking get the sleep I need again. I feel like my body is just slowly going to deteriorate as the days go by. I'm in hell and there's only one escape. I want the gun and the bullet. I want the rope.
