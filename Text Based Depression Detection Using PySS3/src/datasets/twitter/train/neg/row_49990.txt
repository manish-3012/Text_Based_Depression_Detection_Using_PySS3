God if youâ€™re real please let me go.I wish I could erase my memory and feelings.

I just want to stop thinking for awhile. I told myself that I would never do drugs etc to become numb, but then again I told myself that things would get better but that ended up being a lie.

Ugh I hate myself so much, even while typing this I feel like Iâ€™m being so dramatic or edgy. I hate it I hate it I hate it.

I feel so alone. I have no hope. I wish I was religious or something.

Why do I want to die so badly when Iâ€™m only 16?  Whatâ€™s wrong with me?
