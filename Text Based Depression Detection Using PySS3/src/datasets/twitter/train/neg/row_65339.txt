Gave it a try.So I waited 6 months after my birthday to see if Iâ€™m missing out on anything and it actually seems as if my life has gotten worse lol. I know my last post I was supposed to go out for my birthday but you guys were sweet and gave me a lot to think about it. But I have to be honest. Thereâ€™s nothing the world could offer me. Iâ€™ve accepted it. Right, thereâ€™s so many things you could do until itâ€™s time for you to go, but we all go one day. I am sick to my stomach of sorrow depression, anxiety they all kicked my ass. Iâ€™ve figured out the pros and cons &amp; it could never work for me on earth. Maybe I can be a guardian angel for you all above. Not sure whatâ€™s after this but thumbs up to the end of all opportunity. Good luck everybody. I LOVE YOU ALL.
