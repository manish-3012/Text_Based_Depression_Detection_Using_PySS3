2018 will be there year I finally go if things don't turn aroundI decided 2018 is going to be my last shot. I have had severe depression, anxiety, and ADHD my entire life. Never have had many friends, and when I did, I was clearly the least important of the group, and always the first one to be cut out. I have been working my ass off trying to save my own life. But nothing ever pays off. I go to my doctors, take my meds, eat healthy, and even get adequate sleep... exercise could be better but its not completely lacking. I am a healthy person overall but, I really really REALLY fucking hate my life. I have been drawing the short stick my whole life. Born into a nasty, selfish, racist, ignorant, horrible family. Brother has disabilities so my parents give him most of their attention and barely give me any. When I try to date, it is as if I compeltely repel people like a magnetic repulsion. I think people can sense my mental state without talking to me much, and when they do, they run for the hills. If I had a dollar for every time I've been "ghosted" by someone, I'd be a very rich man. The only people I attract are people clearly trying to abuse and take advantage of me. I hate my job. When I went to college I was so depressed I had no idea what I was doing. One of my professors suggested I take a research route, so I did, now I have a job in it but I cant stand it. Its so boring and meaningless to me and I am stuck here with no where else to turn, no other skills, no other way to pay all my bills. 

I am just done. I am sick and tired of life. If 2018 doesn't bring me any hope, I am ending it. Fuck it. Fuck this world and fuck this life.
