Why shouldn't I?I lost everything I have, and my friends act as if everything is just fine, knowing I am no where near okay. Debt, loss of friends. The person I love more than anything, lied to me about feeling the same way so she could use me. I have no luck finding anyone or anything. All I see is everyone being so happy, and I never have truly been. I wake up in pain, live my day in pain. I go to sleep every night wishing I don't wake up. I am destroyed. I am tired. I am alone. I shouldn't have to suffer so other people can feel good.
