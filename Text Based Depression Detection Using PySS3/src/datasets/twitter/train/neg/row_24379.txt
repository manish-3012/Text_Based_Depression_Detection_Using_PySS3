Rambling.So I've been sent to the hospital by my school,  for making suicidal comments (no one in my family cared btw) but everytime I have the opportunity to ask for help, or (what feels like) I'm interrogated on it, that I clench up, i feel alot of pain, and anxiety, I've shivered, and shaken before. i feel like im going to pass out or, like I, what I immagine low blood sugar feels like on a diabetic (I've seen it first hand, alot of times) I feel like I'm going to start slurring my words, and shake, and shiver. But somehow I manage to act normally, and I convince everyone that I'm okay (or they just don't care, which is probably more likely) I've heard that it feels good to get help but all I feel is pain.
