I'm going to buy a place to live, get high on benzos or drunk as one last act of pleasure, and commit suicide. Then this will all be over.I'm tired. There's no purpose to fighting. There's no reason to try anymore

I will quickly slip away into nothingness and have relief.

EDIT: idk why people downvote my posts. if you think i'm stupid or weak or whiny just say it.
