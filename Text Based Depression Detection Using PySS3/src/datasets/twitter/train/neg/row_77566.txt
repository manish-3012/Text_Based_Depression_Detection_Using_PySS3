I'm uhhhhhh feeling really badI can't stop thinking about killing myself!!!I usually end up sleeping all day and getting really drunk during the night so I don't have to deal with it. I've only gone to a therapist once, but we didn't really click so i stopped. Idk if I can stay alive long enough to find one I can actually talk to!!!!! I really don't want to die tbh I have two sweet cats, and I don't want to leave them.
