I don't want to die but I feel like soon it'll be the only option.I got sick about 6 months ago. I was trying to study for 2 months but I wasn't doing much so I thought it'd be better to move home and go to a doctor. Doctor diagnosed me with a flu(!). I'm still feeling sick. I was on EEG already and doctor said that they didn't see anything unusual. I'm in a queue for MRI but I guess it won't show anything either. Now I'm sick for about 6 months and I still don't know what's wrong with me (I feel like I'm living in the worst country in the world). I skipped about 4 month in University and some teachers just told me that they don't care about my problems. I kind of understand them but I think it was kind of mean. Summer break is going to be over soon and I still feel unable to continue studying. I hope I'll feel better before I have to move back (September) but my hope is slowly fading away and sorrow fills the gap.

After all idk why I've decided to post this. I don't think anyone cares about me. I think even I don't care anymore... I feel like there's nothing that can help me.
