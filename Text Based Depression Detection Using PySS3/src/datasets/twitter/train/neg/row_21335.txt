I made a plan, I wrote my note, yet... I'm still here. And I have no idea why. I read over my note and see that it all makes sense why I should follow through with ending my own life. What is it that is keeping me alive, what is it that is making me come to this subreddit and post? I dont know! Some inherent strive to stay alive? 

I had my plan all set for tonight. Straight up suffocation by pulling a cable tie as hard as I could around my neck. I suppose the fact that I would struggle for breath terrified me a bit, but I had no other means. I felt a peace today as I knew (thought I knew) that I would be ending my life and not having to deal with it anymore. Yet when I printed my note out and was on my knees with the cable tie around my neck, not having pulled it yet, I was so hesitant. My family would be hurt, my friends even, but I know eventually they would get over it. Why should I have to be such a burden on them for much longer? 

I've been struggling with depression for 5 years now, 22 year old male. With two other attempts under my belt, I told myself that I would be successful with the third. So far I'm not, but I can still change that. I lost a good job a couple weeks ago and broke up with my girlfriend yesterday. Its hard to see any bright future out there, hold on to any possible hope that would help me. It looks to just be a continual cycle of pain and suffering. 

I feel as though I just cant take it anymore, and why should I? I hate going through this and I hate thinking these thoughts. So why not just end my life and not have to worry about it? Why can't I just do it? Why?
