I dont know where my life is goingI've been depressed most of my life (undiagnosed), I'm 16 and i just wanna end it all, my dad told me today that I'm the biggest mistake he ever made, I don't understand why he would say that, I loved my dad, you can't just say that to someone like what the fuck, if you didn't want me you should have kept it in your pants you fat shit.

i don't know man, him saying that shit is like the final nail in the coffin for my psyche, im actually disgusted with myself that I had an immediate thought of killing him in his sleep and committing suicide after he said that, I don't know what to think, my life is going to shambles.
