Ending it hopefully soon18, Germany. Escaped from home the 4. time now because I fucked it up with my girlfriend once again. Now I got caught while driving under thc. My parents which I ignored bcs i didn't want to come back home until my gf messages me (i don't wanna live without her) have to drive 250km to pick me up and to take my car back home. My driving license is gone. I'm out of money and my gf ignores me. I lost the only 2 things what kept me alive, i don't know how but i'll take my life as soon as possible. I waited so long now but this never ending pain will never stop unless i take my life.
