no way outthis might sound ridiculous but i just had a really bad fight with my boyfriend. iâ€™m in a different state visiting family but staying with him and his moms house. him and his mom want me to stay but i donâ€™t want to be here anymore, i feel trapped. they were talking about me like i couldnâ€™t hear them. earlier he offered to take me to someone elseâ€™s house but when i told him yes he didnâ€™t want to. their house is pretty far from anyone else i could stay with. iâ€™ve been asking my family to get me or let me stay at their house but theyâ€™re all asleep. i have to take my medicine soon (anti depressants) and it would be so so easy just to overdose. i donâ€™t have an escape right now, trust me i know it sounds ridiculous to kill myself over a fight with my boyfriend but i literally have no choice but to be trapped here right now. i feel suffocated. i just want it to end. iâ€™m so sorry for how everything is formatted and typed like shit but i really canâ€™t bring myself to correct anything right now. iâ€™d be embarrassed about the suicide attempt if i survived but at least it would get me out of this fucking house. i donâ€™t expect anyone to read this whole thing but i feel so hopeless and trapped i just want our
