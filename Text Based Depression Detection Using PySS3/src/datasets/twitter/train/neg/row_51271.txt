Why shouldn't I kill myself tonight?I am a worthless human being with nothing to offer anyone. My depression has returned, I'm losing my energy, am losing a lot of weight... I was boring and awkward already, and now my depression is here to make me moreso. I'm a sad sack of shit, it's why no one wants me and why I'm better off dead.
