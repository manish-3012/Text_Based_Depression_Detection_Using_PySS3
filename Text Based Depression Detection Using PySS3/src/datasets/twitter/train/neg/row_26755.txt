I fucking wish I had a bottle of pain killersIâ€™m going to be dead in a week anyways so fucking I may as well post here. The love of my life left me last month. I never even met her but I know what her wedding dress wouldâ€™ve looked like, we decided that if we had a girl her name would be Azura and Tyler if it was a boy...


I havenâ€™t cared about anything since she left me. Iâ€™m getting evicted next week but I honestly donâ€™t care at all. Iâ€™m not trying to be tough or anything, Iâ€™m just resigned to my fate. When I get kicked out for real the first place Iâ€™m going is to is a tall parking garage near me and Iâ€™m going to fall off. I wish I had a more peaceful way to go...


If thereâ€™s anyone here that is willing to talk please message me
