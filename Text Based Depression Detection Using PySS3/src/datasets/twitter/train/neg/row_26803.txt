I'm having a mental breakdownI am in panic and donâ€™t know what to do. Last week I was in mania and feeling great. Today I just want to die. I feel like Iâ€™m having an existential crisis. Idk what I want to do with my life. Iâ€™m 21 doing terrible in college working a job that I hate and never had a real girlfriend. I just keep thinking Iâ€™m such a loser and at this point I donâ€™t see any reason to continue. I feel like I could just explode and donâ€™t know what to do!
