It never gets betterGetting kicked out for the 20th time now ive exhausted all my resources and have no where to go i cant repeat this cycle of sleeping on the streets then being begged to come back only to have all my things thrown to the trash and having to start anew. This has to end tonight it never gets better no matter how hard you work it can all be taken away from you in an instant. Ive lived a miserable 19 years and ive had enough. tonight i join my father tonight i set myself free goodbye.
