I dont want to live but I dont want to dieI have spent the past 5 years thinking about killing myself. I've gone down some paths that I shouldnt have especially for only being 16. But I'm scared because anytime that I have a bad habit and I think I get rid of it it comes back worse. In grade 6 my parents divorced and I thought I would be fine. However in grade 7 it hit me and I started self harming but I didnt think it was serious. My mom found out and I stopped, until grade 8. I started again and I also started not eating. That's when i really started debating killing myself. Grade 9 i was alone a lot and my self harming got really bad and i also almost never ate. But i got back on track and for a little while I thought that I was past everything and I thought I didnt want to killy myself anymore. But then grade 10, January of this year my dad killed himself. I wanted to be angry at him amd to be able to yell at him. But I couldnt be mad at him. I was so mad at myself for not noticing especially because he was always there for me. He was the only one who understood me. Since then I have only self harmed once but I had also started drinking to deal with it. At times drinking was the only thing that made me not hate myself. There were a few times that I did almost kill myself, once i almost walked out on ice that was melting so i would freeze and drown. And even though i feel somewhat ok now i still dont want to be alive. I dont want to have to deal with feeling this pain for any longer. I cant feel guilty any longer. I'm sorry if anyone took the time to read this, I know I'm just a waste of time and I'm sorry for wasting yours
