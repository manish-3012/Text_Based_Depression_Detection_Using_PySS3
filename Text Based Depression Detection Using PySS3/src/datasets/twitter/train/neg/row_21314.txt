My aunt committed suicide just now.My family and I just got the news that my aunt just committed suicide. She's on my moms side. I knew her very well and we were close. I feel guilty for not feeling bad about it, but my mom is taking it pretty hard as my aunt was practically a twin to her. This is her 2nd sibling to commit suicide. I'm just wondering what I should do to comfort her.
