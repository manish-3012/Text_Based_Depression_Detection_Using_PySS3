my antidepressants aren't working &amp; my dad is still dead....and i want to be too.I'm a 19 year old girl who's stuck in some shitty Texas town because my father didn't have a will and I'm stuck doing his estate two years later. i'm running out of money to my lawyer/family so i don't know when I will ever get out of here and go to college. My father was the only person in my life who supported me and wanted me to go to school. I'm surrounded by my drug addict brother and mother who leech off of me every second for groceries, bills, etc since neither work and just get disability which is why I got stuck as the executor. I do not want to be on this earth anymore but i've created this image that i'm trudging through with a smile to my therapist when I'm not. All of my friends are out of state at school living their lives while i'm stuck here and she is my only friend and i don't want to disappoint her. I just don't have any hope anymore.
