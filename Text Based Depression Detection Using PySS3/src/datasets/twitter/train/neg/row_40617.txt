My Dad is talking suicideHey all, not sure if this is the right place, but a few days ago my mom called me saying my dad was talking about leaving her or suicide.

Today he texts me saying the same thing. I call him and he says he feels lost, doesn't want to get on antidepressants because he has his CDL and its extra work. Says he doesnt know if its a midlife crises or what needs to be fixed for him to feel better.

I asked him to talk to his doc and get on antidepressants. Told him I always feel better after talking to people and to call a friend and go out to dinner.

I dont know what the eff else to do. Ive been worries foe YEARS that he will commit suicide. He has never once said anything like this, only in passing mentioned that he isnt really happy.

What am I supposed to do?
