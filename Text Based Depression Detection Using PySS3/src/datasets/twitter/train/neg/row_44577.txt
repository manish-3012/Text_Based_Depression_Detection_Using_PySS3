I don't see a reason NOT to go through with itBasically my life has gone to shit in a short time span and I don't see it getting any kind of better in the future. Only worse. In 6 months I've lost my job, my money, my friends, my pets, and most of my family. I only have 2 people left barely clinging to life. I just turned 27 and nothing seems like a good option or worthwhile to pursue. If anything they would only make things even worse. I also see a world turning shittier and shittier with each passing day, and the science seems to back up that assessment. 

So in other words everything is bad, and I feel worse. In fact I barely feel anything at all besides sadness and hopelessness. I really don't see why taking my life would be such a bad thing at this point.
