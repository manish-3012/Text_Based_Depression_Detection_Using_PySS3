This is not where I thought Iâ€™d beIâ€™m turning twenty tomorrow. 

If my younger self could see me now I know heâ€™d be disappointed. I always thought that by this time in my life everything wouldâ€™ve worked out, Iâ€™d be happy, healthy, going to college like any normal person my age. But Iâ€™m not.

Iâ€™m still sick, bound to my house by an illness that nobodies figured out. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s physical or psychosomatic, all I know is that I canâ€™t see myself ever feeling better. My future is bleak, Iâ€™m going to waste the rest of my life stuck in bed while my friends and family move on without me. 

My step-mother told me the other day that these are the best years of my life, she reminded me not to waste them. 

I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m supposed to break free from this, Iâ€™ve lost the past decade to this illness and I donâ€™t see any way out at this point.

I donâ€™t want to exist like this any more. If this is all I have to look forward to I think Iâ€™d rather die.
