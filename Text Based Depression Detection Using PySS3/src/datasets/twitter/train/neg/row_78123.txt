How can I stop feeling suicidal and depressed pls I hate feeling like this I want it to go awayEvery single day I feel suicidal its this anxious feeling in my stomach like a sudden wave of panic that lasts like the whole day or a few hours and like I feel like I have to kill myself or end it or I will miss my chance to. Its so overwhelming and like I actually almost tried these three weeks. Like i actually almost took the bottles of pills out of my house to bring with me. Or I tried to hang myself. I had the pills in my hands. I don't know I feel like I cant even fcking escape this feeling I feel so messed up everything that happened to me I don't want to feel like this anymore I hate feeling so miserable or sad. I don't enjoy life anymore at all and I feel hopeless. I always think down on myself and put my own self down and I feel like none of my siblings or friends wanna be by me, I feel like a bother. The only time I ever feel abit of enjoyment or happiness and stress free is when I smoke weed but it only lasts like a hour or so and then i just feel the exact same feeling as I did before. I know this is so much but I can never tell anybody like my family how i feel its so scary and I feel I'm just bothering people with my problems I'm only a 15 year old girl should i be having the best teen years were i can feel good about my self and hangout and talk to all my friends. Not staying in my room crying for hours being to unmotivated to shower or brush my hair. I feel so alone I'm ccryign rn I want help but I feel like I don't deserve it or I'm just making it up but I'm not i really need help
