My Grandfather Used To Like Me (elaborated below)My Grandfather is a replacement for my father, who left before I was born. He is one of the greatest people I know, and I love him a lot. 

But, I dropped out of middle school. Yes, I am too young to be dropping out. And what Iâ€˜m doing now is technically illegal, but I wonâ€™t go into those details. 

Back in Elementary, I missed a lot. like, a lot. And then in Middle School I just did my want to stay in school, and mother decided to â€œhomeschoolâ€ me. This made Grandfather super bitter. Which is understandable. 

Grandfather started getting mad and psychical with everything I did. He started telling me very bitter things. Telling me how I needed to get out more (despite how Iâ€™m literally just 13 and my mother quite literally doesnâ€™t let me step a single foot outside even just for a few seconds) how I am just pathetic. He started pushing me around. 

Of course, I donâ€™t blame him, I should be in school. 

But itâ€™s to late to go back now. Too much money. Way too late. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. I have a bunch of pills in my drawer.
