Don't do it.Last Thursday I tried to take my life. Life was causing me so much stress. Work, living alone, a boyfriend I shared with another person, and my recently discovered pregnancy. I drank about a mouthful and a half of kitchen cleaner, before my partner caught me and I spat out the rest. He broke up with me, and went to the police. I resent him for doing that, because right now I'm stuck in an awful place, a psychiatric ward, and I don't know when I can leave. I am scared, and alone. However, I've been talking to people and there is so much to live for. One of the nurses that's here has been showing me photos of all the beautiful place as he's been in this past year. He's been to Japan and Hobbit town, travelled all across Australia. Another lady was telling me that she gave birth at 19 and it was one of the best thing she ever did that the child has grown up to be an award-winning engineer. 

I'm glad I failed, that I wasn't able to take my life. Because now I see how much there is to live for. I'm going to try and go back to school, learn coding for video game design. I'm going to eat healthier and exercise, so I can deliver a beautiful baby boy or girl. I'm going to save, and travel the world one day. But for now, I'm taking life one baby step at a time. 

So please, take it from me. Don't do it. Find that little spark in you, and fight back. You are the only person who's going to be there for you 24/7. You need to be your own best friend. You can pick yourself up, I know you can. For your future, for your happiness. Don't do it. Don't give up. 

I love you, you are strong, and you can be brave. I love you.
