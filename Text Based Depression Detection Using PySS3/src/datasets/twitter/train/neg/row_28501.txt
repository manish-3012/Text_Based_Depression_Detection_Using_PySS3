Freaking the fuck out. HelpI don't know what the fuck is going on. I'm 16, and i've been mentally ill all my life. But things started getting fucked up in 2013. I began hallucinating, not leaving home, sleeping at 6am, bitching at the friends I actually HAD for no reason. During 2014 I was admitted to hospital 5 times. They put me on anti-depressants which made me excited as hell.

Those drugs gave me the motivation to do productive things, and also helped my anxiety a bit. But they also made me more motivated to kill myself. I ended up stopping them after 7 months. Those 7 months I was on them were filled with police arrests, ER visits, mental breakdowns and attention seeking episodes just because I felt so much energy and didn't know what to do with it. I got myself arrested PURPOSELY a few times because I wanted the "excitement" of being handcuffed and being driven to the hospital. I felt giddy when all of the other people in the ER saw me being brought in by the police. It was a fucked up period of time. 

After stopping the anti-depressants, sure enough I fell back into my old ways. Never leaving home, sleeping at inconvenient times, never socializing. Its been about 4 months since i've left home. I'm nauseated and fatigued every day from anxiety and depression. 

I can't do this anymore and I have nothing to live for.
