Scared of an afterlifeI know it's completely irrational since i'm not even spiritual and never has been religious, but the closer i get to the edge the more afraid i get of an afterlife. 

The thought of killing myself and then having to continue to live (although in a different way) terrifies me. I'm so scared that i'm just trading this miserable exitence for another one. 

I want to die so badly that my whole body aches for it, but it won't be worth it if i'm not met with darkness and nothingness afterwards. I'm so scared that i'll be forced to continue to live on forever (i guess that would be just my luck though).
