I guess goodbye?Iâ€™ve been walking around my town for about an hour now, I think I know how to do it. I know the train passengers will hate me for it, but I feel like itâ€™s the only solution. 

I havenâ€™t written a goodbye note because mom doesnâ€™t deserve that.

Only thing I need to know is how to properly say goodbye to my friends so that they wonâ€™t feel guilty or anything. So any suggestions?
