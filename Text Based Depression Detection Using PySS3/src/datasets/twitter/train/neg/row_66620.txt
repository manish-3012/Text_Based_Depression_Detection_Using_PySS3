28m can't handle this anymoreI don't know where else to turn anymore so I come here with my story.

Backstory in short: had a house, furniture, a good job and a gf. In the end she left me and because i'm a little simple I never checked the paperwork and I'm left with nothing but my two cats and a fridge/freezer/computer/some furniture. I have around 8k â‚¬ in debt from the house renovations that I have to pay.  
Lost my job and now I've used up my cc debt to buy food for me and the cats. I live at my ex-step fathers place (no father, and my mother is an abusive bitch who doesnt want anything to do with me, she also left this guy), he was kind enough to take me in for a while but I cant stay. I couldnt pay for my car insurance/technical control so I cannt drive it anymore. I live in the middle of nowhere now and I cant get to anything on foot. My mind has been driving me crazy lately and i keep getting these thoughts that scare me, scare me of myself.  
At night i cant sleep ever, Im just awake until i collapse. I tried contacting all the places that offer help, but because i'm not a woman or child I'm number 12000-something in line to get help. I can't manage another week and i cant talk to people... I just shut down when i try, ive tried sending letters to instances, doctors, organisations but most of them dont even reply. I call them but I cant make any words come out when they answer. I guess in a few more days my internet and phone will be shut down.  
It feels as if there is no way out anymore and im so scared. I cant even cry anymore at this point and my chest hurts. Im fucked up, i dont communicate well anymore and m yworst concern is my two cats who need a good home, that's all thats keeping me up for now. I'm so tired, theres so much morre to the story but this is a start i guess.
