I'm really lost and confused. Would you guys talk to me ?I think it's gonna be a long post, sorry. Also, forgive me for any wrong word/phrase, I'm from Brazil. Well, I've been into depression for a long time alone, I never told nobody. I've learned how to pretend I'm always happy and smile when what I want to do is cry. The only thing that keeps me alive is the love I feel for my parents. I know they're gonna be really bad if I die. I mean, I'd destroy my family. So, 10 months ago, I met her. We fast became friends, and somehow she relieved my pain. She would tell me everything that happens in her life, and I, for the first time had someone in which I trusted. She helped me  make the past year easier to live, since I was in the vestibular year (vestibular is the exam to join university). You guys don't know in how much pressure I was. My dad didn't understand how tiring it is to study under pression. The funny thing is that he always got home when I just had studied everything and was going to take a little nap before going to classes (I went to school by the morning and by the night). Anyway, under this pressure, I got into depression again. And my friend isn't the same with me, it's like she only thinks about her. Now, i'm not sure if I'll be able to enter university. I chose an option for low income families, and they refused my registration. I'll discover tomorrow if that is by a lack of documents or anything like that. Going to university was my only hope to get rid of this feeling. I know the text is kind of confused, but so am I. I really need help, I can't handle this anymore. I wanna die but don't wanna hurt my parents. But I also can't feel this anymore.
