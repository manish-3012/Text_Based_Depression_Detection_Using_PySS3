There is no God, life has no meaning, and the story of humanity is the story of suffering, oppression, and death.so... now what? I'm sitting in front of my computer talking to you guys, I've got a .357, and I just loaded a single round, spun the cylinder, locked it, put the gun to my head and pulled the trigger. twice. I'm still here, but I don't know why, and I don't think I want to be any more.

I have a masters degree and two bachelors degrees, I'm married, and I own a house,  but I haven't been able to find full time work for the past 2 years. It seems like the world is now, as it has been for 4,000 years, controlled by the wealthy for the benefit of the wealthy, and everyone else can go fuck themselves, and if they die, so what, there's someone else to take their place. We live in a world where at best we're cogs in a machine that fills the pockets of the wealthy, but when you take a moment to really examine things, you recognize that there really is no point to any of it. God clearly does not exist, and anyone who thinks otherwise is deluded. We're thrown into this world without our consent, we live meaningless lives, and we die alone. Why should I prolong that process?
