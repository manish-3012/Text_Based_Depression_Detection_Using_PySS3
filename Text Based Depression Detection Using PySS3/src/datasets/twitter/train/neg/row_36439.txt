Why bother......Being transgender in bumfuck Indiana is beyond stressful. I have a great career and have none of the typical roadblocks that most transgender individuals deal with; lack of medical care, lack of funds,  overt discrimination. But still i find myself in a soul crushing depression. I see my therapist regularly but it no longer feels that it is pertinent or helping. I know the coping skills/strategies because I help clients develop them for a living. I have come to a point where I think that it's ok for me to die by suicide. I dont say commit because in my mind it isn't a crime.  MY family doesn't understand me due to transitioning. My colleagues think I'm "weird". My friends are distant because of the differences in socio-economic status. So realistically if I complete suicide then no one will notice that I am gone. My puppies might. They are the only ones in my life that i think are aware that  there is something massively wrong with me.  My local friends are kind of concerned but think "She's strong; she'll pull through this". I'm tired of being strong. I have multiple plans in my head and I dont see a reason not to go through with them. I dont feel a connection to the world. I'm not even that lonely. Being an introverted therapist gives you all of the personal connection you could want in life.  I guess I have come to the realization that my death wouldn't amount to anything in the great scheme of things. So why continue to fight a depression that keeps me from ever feeling. And yes feeling. I cant remember the last time I felt anything. I got drunk last night with the plan being to hang myself. But I ran out of alcohol before i had enough courage to do it. My friend noticed that it was weird for me to be bumming alcohol that late at night so she had me come over. I regret coming over; yes spending time was fun. But I am ready to DIE.  My life isn't worth anything to anyone. I am useless.
