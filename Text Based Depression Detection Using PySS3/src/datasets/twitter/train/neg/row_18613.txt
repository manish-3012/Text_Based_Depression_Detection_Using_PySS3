My dog almost got crushed by an elevator and I didnt even reactWhat the fuck is wrong with me? Why didnt I even flinch? Scream? Just nothing. My hands are torn up from trying to stop it but I couldnt. I could've jumped in the elevator but the door on the elevator is old and has no safeties, so I was too scared. If there hadn't been a lady in the elevator to save her she would've been dead now. And I did nothing. I didn't even thank the lady for saving her because I am too shy. Why am I like this?? My hands hurt so bad and I'm having another panic attack
