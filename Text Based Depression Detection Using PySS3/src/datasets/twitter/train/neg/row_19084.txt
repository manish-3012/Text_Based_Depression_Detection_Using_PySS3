I resent my family for forcing me to liveI just hate that I can't just be done with this existence without them being crushed by it too. This life is pointless. Just going from one painful experience to the next and it just gets worse every time. I wish they would just not care about me at all. Having someone who believes in you would be nice if that was rooted in reality but they just blindly believe that I'll be able to pull myself out of this hole. Nothing proves that. I'm a fucking loser. When are they going to realize? There's no future. They're just torturing me because they can't take that I'll be gone and that would be best case scenario. Worst case is me leeching off of them for the rest my life never being able to support myself and in general just being a huge nuisance. Is this life? Is this all there is? I don't fucking want it.
