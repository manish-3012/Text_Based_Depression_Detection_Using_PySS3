Is this what it means to grow up?
I guess my question/title boils down to the fact that I don't feel happy anymore. I can have good moods, but I don't get that rush of joy anymore. Like everyone else, I assume, I used to get these little burst of happiness when I would think about stuff I was looking forward to, almost every day, and sometimes lying in bed I would just not get up and get small pangs cheer or joy thinking about the good stuff in life.


I haven't felt that in a year. They just stopped. First the lying in bed stuff and then no bursts of happiness. I started smoking a lot of pot, got more anxious, and then eventually had some serious trouble and it all just went away. I started getting panic attacks and then here I am, trying to reassure myself that I won't kill myself, struggling just to not feel awful.

So back to my question, is this what growing up is? I used to think the "happiness" would come back one day, but then it dawned on me that it might be gone for good. I thought that trope about adults all being deeply miserable and unsatisfied wasn't true, but I guess it is.
