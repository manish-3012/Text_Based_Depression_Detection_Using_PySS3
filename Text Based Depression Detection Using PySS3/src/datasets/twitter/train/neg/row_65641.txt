Keep giving myself ultimatums about killing myself if something gets any worseI hate living so much. The idea of my life becoming any worse whatsoever is too much. So itâ€™s more calming to accept that I can just end things if it gets any worse.

Right now, despite over ten years of previous dental work and jaw surgery. My teeth are colliding once again and Iâ€™ll probably end up losing my front teeth as a result. All that pain and time wasted because thatâ€™s what I get. If it happens Iâ€™ve already decided to end myself. Iâ€™m so tired.

Does anyone else give themselves these ultimatums. Feels better than accepting Iâ€™ll have to live with something even worse than it is currently.
