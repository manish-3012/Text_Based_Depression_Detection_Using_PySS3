I am scared.i'm scared shitless .  i thought about killing myself several times,over the years( but now something came up,and if it's bad then I might just do it. ). i do not know why i havent done it yet..im tired of being a failure,of disappointment to my family,especially my mother.
Maybe it's the thought of her finding me dead and probably wondering what did she to do deserve this? what did she do wrong? she is the only family I have as my father works overseas and he didnt impact my life very much,I see him just the one that sends us money so we do not starve. if there was another person to do that I wouldn't really miss him. My sister lives 2h away and I hate. she said some terrible things to my mother after she went drinking  because she wouldn't pay her some stupid debt (we couldn't afford it) and spread the rumor in our natal town ( rural town ) that my mother is a whore. my mom knows it and she got over it. she dares to look my sister in the eye and tell her "i love you". it's stupid.  
my mother is everything to me,but this world is just stupid to me. im thinking about the peace that may come one i close my eyes.
black. silence. no more pain,no more...anything. I'll let this life behind ...but that's scary. and I'm a guy that gets scared easily. I may die quick,or slow,or with huge pain,or no pain at all. but that's impossible to know,right?
