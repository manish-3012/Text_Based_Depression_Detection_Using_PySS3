i'm too tired to do anything but the urge is strongi want to cut, or bash my head into a wall. everything hurts so much and all i really want to do is kill myself but i'd make my family sad so i can't. i'm so tired and i have an early morning tomorrow but i can't sleep. i just want to die. sorry i shouldn't even be here i'm not at active risk right now, but i just wanted to tell someone i guess. 

guess i'll try sleeping again idk
