Lonely and scaredI'm just gonna spell it out right quick. I'm fucking sad guys.

&amp;#x200B;

I like plenty of other people around here just got out of a relationship and I'm finding myself fucking lost and scared. Was with a wonderful gal for 2+ years but it crumbled due to many factors(many being my fault) and now I've moved half away across the country for a fresh start. It turns out so far that moving was a fucking terrible idea. I'm fucking struggling to find a job and just living with my parents again currently. I'm having a horrible time of meeting new people, and I'm just so fucking sad and lonely. I left my whole support network back in WV hoping that a change of scenery would pick me up but it's fucked. Now I'm just fucking isolated down here without any friends and lack of a job so I'm broke except for what's left of savings. I don't even need a lot at this moment, I just want someone to talk to and hang with down here as friends. I'm glad I left my gun behind because I genuinely don't know if I would make it another night or two of this.
