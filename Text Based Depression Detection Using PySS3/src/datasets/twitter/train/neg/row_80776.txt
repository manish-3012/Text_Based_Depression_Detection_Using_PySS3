iâ€™ve got a lot on my mind and iâ€™m scarediâ€™m scared of loosing someone right now but thatâ€™s that and thereâ€™s nothing i can do which makes it a million times worse. i feel hated and i feel sick, physically sick. i canâ€™t sleep or think about anything else and iâ€™m so scared. and yeah. i just want a hug while i cry.
