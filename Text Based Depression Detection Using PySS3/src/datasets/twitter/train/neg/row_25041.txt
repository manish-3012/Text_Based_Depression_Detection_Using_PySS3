Need some quick adviceIâ€™m going to kill myself later today.

Donâ€™t really want to die just want my many issues and pain to end

I have no family or friends although I have about 60 contacts on my phone. Mostly old coworkers from the job I quit 8 months ago.

Iâ€™m feeling extremely lonely.

Should I reach out to one of these coworkers whom I havenâ€™t spoken to since I quit?

Iâ€™m scared theyâ€™ll call the cops.
