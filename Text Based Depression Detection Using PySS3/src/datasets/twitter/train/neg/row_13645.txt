Being really drunk is the only way Iâ€™ll go through with itDrinking a lot changes every single person in some way and I donâ€™t believe anyone who says it doesnâ€™t. You donâ€™t wanna be in your state of mind when you finally end things. Everything will be too real and too anxiety provoking. If Iâ€™m really drunk I think things will be easier to go ahead with and maybe it will all blur together like a dream.
