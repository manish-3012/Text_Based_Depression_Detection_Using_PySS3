Iâ€™m fucking done lolI got blackmailed into thinking my girl was texting me but it turns out to not be, I said some vulgar stuff, and she as a Christian didnâ€™t like it and she broke up with me, she was the most sweet, supportive person ever, she helped me, I made her cry, I feel so bad, Iâ€™m alone. Thatâ€™s it.
