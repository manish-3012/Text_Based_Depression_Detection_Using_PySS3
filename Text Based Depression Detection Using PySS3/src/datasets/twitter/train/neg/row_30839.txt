rip lmaolike 20ish days ago i was set on killing myself. now on monday iâ€™m going to a clinic program thing. when i went there for my intake it was nice though. it was nice seeing a bunch of other ppl who wanted to kill themselves lmao. hopefully i can make some friends..? i feel like iâ€™ll fuck it up though :( i donâ€™t think anyone can genuinely like me bc i over share so often and cant read social cues and am a social mess. i bet theyâ€™d understand but deep down think iâ€™m a weirdo :/ anyways kinda excited. been a long time since iâ€™ve looked forward to something that wasnâ€™t killing myself lol. if u got any tips lmk ðŸ‘
