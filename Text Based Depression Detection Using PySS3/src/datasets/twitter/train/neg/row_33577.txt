I literally created an account on reddit for thisTomorrow is my birthday and i most probably am gonna end my life.
Most people dont even know its my birthday tomorrow, and i am just fed up with everyone and everything. My family are indifferent about me, which is because of me always pushing them away. I have no close friends as when people start getting close to me , i always cut them off. I am messed up in the head and lonely to the point where i dont have anyone to leave a note to. I just wanna write on my wall "have fun living this nightmare" and just end my life, just for the fun of it. I fail at goals and deadlines. I get late to everything cause i cant muster a single ounce of motivation and i quit school two years ago because i just couldnt stand sitting alone anymore, and opted for private education. So yeah thats my entire life. Goodbye world
