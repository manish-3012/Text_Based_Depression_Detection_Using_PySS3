Why not kill myself?I don't know if this counts, but im reaching the conclusion that there's literally no reason to still being alive. I mean all the emotions we feel is just a bunch of chemical reactions and the bad ones last more the good ones. If I just kill myself I literally wont feel shit, which I think is better than waiting for the right trigger to liberate the hormones that make me feel good. The only reason I don't do this now is my mom, like 90% of the people. I am currently storing some money, so that my mom's life will be at least a little better. Goodbye my dudes.
