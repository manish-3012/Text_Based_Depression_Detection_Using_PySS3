IDk If I can take it anymore.Everyday all I wanna do is jump in front of a train. The thought does not go away. I am Trans. Closeted. Poor. I have a stressful job that makes me no money. I am 80k in debt. I haven't had a relationship in 4 years. I have a kid. If it wasn't for my kid. I don't want to hurt her. She is only 11. I can't do it to her. Kill myself I mean. I buy lotto tickets just to feel hope. I'm so sad. I cry constantly. I just wish it were all over.
