I want answersI'm 16 and for my whole life I don't remember my parents ever saying I love you to me. I get good grades and never get in trouble and all of the time i never get any respect from them and they treat me like shit. I'm usually a happy person but I'm so many occasions they'll just find something to yell at me for which are always the most stupid things and hit me which then ruins my whole day and I'll usually just sit in my bed which isn't even a bad just a shitty hospital mattress thrown on the floor. I'm honestly running out of things to look forward too in life and running out of reasons to live
