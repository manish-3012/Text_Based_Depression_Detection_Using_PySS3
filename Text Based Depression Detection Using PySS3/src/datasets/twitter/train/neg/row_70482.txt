I really fucked up last night...Got my car stuck in a ditch. Cops came. Said he saw smoke inside my car. I consented to a search like an idiot. Got a possession marijuana charge and a paraphernalia charge as well as an $80 tow. I feel like a fucking moron. I just keep thinking of ways I could have gotten out of it. I can't eat or drink anything. I'm terrified of what's gonna happen. I feel like the world is falling down around me. We're getting a good lawyer and everything but it still makes me feel like a burden on my family. Sorry if this isn't going anywhere I just feel like it would be easier just to end it all rn.

Edit: forgot to mention it was a marijuana charge
