Hate myselfI have the most boring personality ever, I hate being an introvert, and I don't have an outgoing personality. I need time alone to recharge and I don't even have friends, I am terrible at conversations. I wish I could give my life to someone else. I am a robot, depression, no personality, no friends, not outgoing, spend time alone. I have no need to have conversations, yet I crave being able to talk at ease and make so many memories.

I wish I was extroverted, I would have been able to do so much more with my life. I wish I could have friends that I spend a lot of time with, and have conversations that would be funny and interesting.
