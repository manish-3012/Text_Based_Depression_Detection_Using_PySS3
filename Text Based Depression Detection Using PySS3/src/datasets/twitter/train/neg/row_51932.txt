I canâ€™t even explain what is wrong any more... there is just too much and I feel overwhelmed and lonelyI feel useless and helpless. I contemplate suicide every day, thinking about what the best place to hang myself would be. I can hardly enjoy video games or reading or watching YouTube or anything because I canâ€™t concentrate on anything hardly because of my depression. I have been suffering this way for way too long and there is no end in sight.

I have a million different things wrong with me. I donâ€™t even know where to begin... thatâ€™s why I want to kill myself, to free myself of this overwhelming burden that is making me feel as if my head is going to explode.
