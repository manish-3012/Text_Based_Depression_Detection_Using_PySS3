I finally called the Suicide HotlineIt went surprisingly amazing.  I've heard so many stories of police being called and I was so scared to take this step. This was my last resort before suicide became the only viable option.  Anyone who's scared that they will commit in the future should definitely call the national hotline (sorry I'm not sure what it is off the top of my head).  One important thing to note is that they will only call the police if you are in danger of committing suicide immediately after the call or even during it.  Thank you for all the love and support you guys have given me in the months I've been in this community.  Hopefully, this marks the beginning of the end of my suicidal tendencies.
