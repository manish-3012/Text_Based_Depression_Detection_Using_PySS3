I have a bottle of vodka and bottle of painkillers... ready to do the deedMy boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me today. I should be happy. WHY THE FUCK AM I NOT HAPPY? I was depressed this whole relationship. He was abusive, mean and made me feel worthless. Why do I feel like I need to keep trying to make it work? That my life is not worth living without him? Please help me. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a long time but today was the trigger.
