I want out. Lemme out!I feel so broken and lost. I just want out. My NDad is a piece of shit whom doesn't love or appreciate anything about me and my Nmom just lets him trample all over me then asks why don't I cooperate.  I'm not going to bend over and take it up the tail pipe. I will kill myself before that happens. On top of that some people think I should apologize for a massive electric bill to him but after what he did to me Monday night. Killing myself sounds like a better option. I am tired of not receiving love and or affection from them. They don't give a rats asshole about how I feel. They just say stuff to placate me and never follow through. If this is how sobriety is going to treat me. Next stipend I end it. Gods doing nothing. I'm pissed off hurting and just sick of it all. Not gonna take it any more
