wow im depressedi dont even want to get out of bed man. i have therapy tmr and im just gonna end up saying yes im good. i really dont know how to put my thoughts into words(at least in person)
whenever my therapist ask me how's my week i'll just say it's ok. i dont even know how and what to elaborate on.
i dont even eat much now because i really have no motivation to.and when i do eat i binge a fuck ton that makes me feel guilty
