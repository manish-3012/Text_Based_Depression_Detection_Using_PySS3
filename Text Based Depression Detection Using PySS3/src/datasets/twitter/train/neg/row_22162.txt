nothing to hold on tothings are getting to be way too much, and this seems to be the only way for me to reach out right now. i'm sure no one will see this anyway, so what's the point. i just wish something bad could happen to me, someone come and fuck everything up. maybe then i'd have a reason to be like this, a reason to do it.

i have exams coming up. they're not that important apparently but even the mere thought of doing them make me shudder. you see, if you told me a year ago that i would have lived to the point where i would do these exams, where i would prepare for next year, i would have been shocked that i'm still alive to see them. if you ask me where i see myself in five years, i'd probably say six feet under.

i'm losing everyone around me. the tension between everyone in my friends is honestly unbearable at times but i question whether it's all in my head, if it's just the overwhelming hatred i feel for myself that is seeping into everyone else around me, infecting them. i'm toxic, and i know that. they'd be better off without me.

i have one thing to live for right now, and i'm trying to hold onto that thing with all i can. my close friend. she might even see this, she follows me here. she's amazing, and the only person i trust right now. but i can't help but think about what happens if we drift apart, like i have with everyone else. if i lose her, i have nothing left.

i don't know how i'm gonna carry on. nothing is gonna change, and i've accepted that whatever it time i have here, it's gonna be miserable and painful. but hopefully that can end soon. i want to be happy, or have a reason to be as fucked up as i am. it's all in my twisted head, all these issues. what could anybody do to help that?
