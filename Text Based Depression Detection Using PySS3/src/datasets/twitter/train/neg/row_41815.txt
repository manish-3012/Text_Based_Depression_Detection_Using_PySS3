17 years old, uselessim 17 and i dont have a fucking job, im scrawny and can't gain weight, i look like im 14, parents dont understand me. i dont say anything to bother them and whenever i feel like talking to them they shut me down and call me useless or  they cant stand me. its fucking annoying what the fuck am i supposed to do. i have anxiety going out in public and talking to people i cant make eye contact i cant fucking get a job. its fucking awful. my only way to help my self is to play video games and stay in my room but i get yelled at for staying inside too much. if i go outside i get fucking told, im so lazy im so fucking slow. what the fuck am i supposed to do cant do anything anymore. my younger brother is bigger and more respected its fucking stupid. i get judged everywhere and i just cant handle it anymore. whats the point of going to college just to fucking work 24/7.
