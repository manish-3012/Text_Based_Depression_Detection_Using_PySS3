Thank you-the last text to my best friend
hey, i know we havenâ€™t talked in a while but i wanted to check on you. I hope youâ€™re doing okay. i really hope youâ€™re going okay. i just want to know that someone is. But i just want to say that iâ€™m sorry. iâ€™m sorry if there was ever a time where i made you mad, or upset, or anything. And iâ€™m sorry for every fight weâ€™ve had over the years. i wish i could see you again but weâ€™ve all been really busy.  Thank you for everything.

-the last word said to my family
â€œnothing?â€

-the last thing i was wearing
a black t-shirt with Dr. Hooves on it, colourful pajama pants with dodos on them, and a black hair tie on my wrist.

-the note
â€œim sorry i couldnt have been better. i made everybody mad every other time we spoke. it didnâ€™t help that everybody thought i hated them too. but its always been like this. its better i go now so that i dont get worse later. i dont see myself making it to 14 this year. its been to much to fast. ive made everybodyâ€™s lives hell because i wasnt good enough for my own parents. i feel horrible on a daily basis thinking about all the time,money and food youve wasted on me. its not your fault i turned out so bad. you couldnt stop it but thats not your fault either. ive hurt a lot of people and a lot of people hurt me. but hey, thats life. Of course this will be saved for another day because i can never go through with it. but one day. youll never have another worry for me. good nightâ€
