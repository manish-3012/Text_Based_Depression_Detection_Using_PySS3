just needing to express myself.I'm not confortable talking to people about me, nobody knows my life, even my closest friends. But now, I just feel like writing, and reading your stories makes me feel less sad and i remember that i'm not alone, suffering.

It's been as long as i can remember that i hated (my) life, the first time i really wanted to die was when i was 11, but i never had the courage to do it. I'm not even scared of death, it's more the "what if it fails?" that scares me. I failed so much in my life, and keeps failing every day, that i just can't do it. I don't know, i feel desperate, but there's still a very little part of me that still have hope, actually i don't even know if i can call it that way, it's more like "i can't be worst anyway" feeling, except it does get worst almost every time.

I have been diagnosed bipolar a few years ago, so it's even harder cause i struggle every day to fit in even tho i have a very strong personality, because i had so much personal issues in my life (grew up with a schizophrenic dad and narcissistic pervert mom who abandoned me when i was 16, bullied at school, depression, burnouts, had a pregnancy denial at 17, months of sexual harassment by my ex boss, got homeless in early 2015 until last month, not to mention money and health problems etc.), and it never gets better. I don't know, i'm at a point where i think it's my fault, maybe i'm a bad person. Even tho i try so hard to help others in order to make me feel better, it just does not work, and i just can't find the courage to die, so i'm just stuck here, no even 30 years old, tired as a 90 years old and crying myself to sleep every day and not knowing what to do...
