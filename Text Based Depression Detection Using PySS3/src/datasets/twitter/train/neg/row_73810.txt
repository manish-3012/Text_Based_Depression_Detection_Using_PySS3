All I wish for, everyday, is to die in some accidentWhen you left, you left me with depression and never ending panic attacks. 

All I wish is to die in some accident because even I don't have the courage to kill myself in case I fail. 

In case I survive the fall and wake up worst than death. In case I survive the cuts and wake up worst than death. 

You left me feeling like a dead person walking on earth. 

And I never used to be like this.
