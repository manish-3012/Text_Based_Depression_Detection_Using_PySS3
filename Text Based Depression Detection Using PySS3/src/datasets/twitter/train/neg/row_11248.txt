Suicide ideation increasing month after monthHey guys

I've noticed my suicide ideation getting worse and worse, it used to be just apathy and now it's a giving up on life and increasing to potential methods and escaping from my reality

Is there anything I can do to take a different exit off this current road?

Otherwise I can't see myself lasting past new year 2019
