Who can help?I've been in a very low place since July. Something happened in my life that caused me to really shrink away from everything. I didn't want to go back to school. I wanted to take a year to sort out my thoughts, but the parents put the pressure on. They have a stiff-upper lip sort of keep calm and carry on attitude and didn't understand that I really wasn't up for it. I went back and end up spending almost all of my time alone and failed all but two classes. Drank alone to escape feeling of isolation. 

Came home begged parents to help me if I transfer. Nope, they'll only help if I stay where I am. So I go back. I do well for a little bit. Fall into old habits. Drive back from friends house; get DUI. Knocked around and taken to prison, locked in a cell. Call parents, bailed out a day later.  Luck out and accepted on probationary program. Then I just quit. Stopped going to class. Stopped leaving apartment. It's been three weeks, another failed semester. Have seen professional "help". Have taken an SSRI. Parents are all about seeking "help". I have thousands in fines, if I don't pay them I go back to jail. No job, no options. 

I love my parents (Dad/Step-mom) and they've been there for me, but I feel like they're unable to understand. Always throwing money at a problem. Leaves a residue of guilt and debt. Have Mom too, mentally unstable, difficult to visit. Makes me sad to see her. She's no longer the person that raised me. 

Always told to get help. Feels like nobody can help.

edit: and student loans for a degree I'll never have...
