Never ending sadness.Iâ€™m a few months in from a break up... perhaps third but feels like fourth depending on how u count. Just when I thought I was over the feelings of in and out sadness, today Iâ€™m in a funk of gloom. I just want to apply myself to the ppl who want to be around me. Still Iâ€™m thinking of everything about my ex who could give a shyt less about me. Even if he says he does. 
Whereâ€™s the button that lets us forget them
Whereâ€™s the rewind that stops u from meeting them or before the tragedy struck. 
I just want relief because I thought I was pass the feelings of sadness... still they persist. 
Still I wish I was dead and I probably have every reason to live. 
Except for the most important one, which is because I want to. 
I donâ€™t.  
Iâ€™ve nothing to live for. 
Life will go on
Ppl will meet new people. 
Why am I here

Dad Iâ€™m so sorry. I thought we got pass this. Out of everyone u are the one I donâ€™t want to disappoint although it may be because of u I choose who I choose. 

What is my purpose. Fuk I hate this heavy feeling, worse being someone else is the trigger to my gun.
