Lost a dear friendNot to suicide, but to cancer. 

I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts a lot lately, but now things feel different. 

A very dear friend of mine lost a long battle with leukemia earlier this week. He was 33 and came out of remission after 10 years last October. He never gave up. He never lost hope. He never stopped fighting. But that's not what changed things. 

Seeing everyone who loves him suffer at his absence has given me a change of heart about taking my own life. I may feel like a burden, I may feel like a curse to everyone I'm close to, but this terrible grief we all share is something I cannot leave in my place. 

Thank you, dear friend, for everything you have taught me.
