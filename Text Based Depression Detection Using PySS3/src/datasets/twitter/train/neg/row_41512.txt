I'm very tired and drained. I don't know how to find strength anymore.For the past 5.5 years, my life has been on a hard downward spiral.  I got kicked out the Air Force for fitness (lifelong struggle), moved back home to find my family apathetic towards me, had my second marriage end, failed out of nursing school, developed chronic back and knee problems that the VA can't fix, got engaged for 2.5 years and lost that, moved in with my grandparents, only to be ridiculed by my family and called a leech, had my kids severely emotionally abused by my family while I was at work on multiple occasions, met someone and moved in with them, she turned out to be crazy and abusive, just got out of that situation, had to quit my job because it wasn't making ends meet, haven't been able to secure a new job, no money in my account at all, almost no food left in the house, and can't afford my bills or house come the first of the month.  

I'm facing the reality that I'm about to be living in my car, buried in more debt because from losing the house, not having a job, not having a place for my kids to stay with me, and being utterly alone.

I'm so ready to just give up.
