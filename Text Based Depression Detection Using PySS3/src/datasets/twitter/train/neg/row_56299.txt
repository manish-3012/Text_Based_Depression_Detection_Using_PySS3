There is nothing to doNothing to do   
No one to talk to  
No will to keep going  
There is no way out of this hell that's called my life other than jumping off a bridge right fucking now. I am delaying the inevitable. I've failed in every aspect of life, school, friendships... Nothing but an ugly 188 cm, 85 kg waste of life walking around wasting everyone's time.  
  
I've tried therapy, it didn't work. So what do I do now? I know my brain is broken but there is now way to get help anymore...
