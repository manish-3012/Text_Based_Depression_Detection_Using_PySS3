I have nothing to live forI like most of the people here are basically totally done with life. My life has been in a downward spiral for a while and I decided to sit and think for a moment to try to recenter myself. This was a mistake. I asked myself what makes me happy in life and I realized I didn't have an answer. I have an binge eating disorder and I was going to say food makes me happy. But I can to realize that I also hate it. Food as made me hate myself. I asked myself about my dreams and aspirations and found myself even more depressed. I love the film industry and have my whole life. Acting is so important to me and I would love to work in the movie industry. But My dad gave me a pretty harsh reality check and explained how dificult and almost impossible it is to make a sustainable living off of it. Its a lot of luck and the right connections. I know he meant well because he doesn't want me to be disappointed and do something rash but it was really crushing. My lack of self esteem and the 20 pounds I've gained in the past month have made me feel like I have no value. No one could love me, no one could care. I'm alone with no friends. I have no life. I work an awful and because my fucked up relationship with food makes me an uncontrollable monster I end up pending my money on awful uncontrollable binges. I have no one I feel like I can share this with in person and I don't have motivation to do anything. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't want my young cousin to be at my funeral. He doesn't need to see that. I love him too much.
