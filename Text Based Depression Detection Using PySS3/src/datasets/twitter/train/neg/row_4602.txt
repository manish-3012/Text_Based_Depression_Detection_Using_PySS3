At least do something worth it before youâ€™re inevitable end.If youâ€™re gonna jump off a cliff, do drugs,take years off work and never speak to family or friends again etc. Try doing something that youâ€™ve wanted to do your entire life and think about the emotions it gives as you think about it. I know it might be hard , maybe even fucking impossible but at least do something worth your time before planting yourself through a bloody floor. :/
