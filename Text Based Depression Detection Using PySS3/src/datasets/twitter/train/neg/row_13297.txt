What's on the other sideI should be so happy.
I have literally everything going for me right now. A wonderful spouse, a beautiful caring family, an amazing career ahead of me, the snuggliest pets I could ask for.
Why am I so unhappy? I don't understand.
I want it all to end right now. Just be over with. I wish it would happen in a random way so that I'm not to blame.
Why me? Why did I get chosen to be here? Why can't I just be happy with this life? Help. I don't understand.
