I can't stop thinking, is this the right time to do it?It's getting harder and harder to wake up, to do anything, to be alive. I don't have the energy to do anything anymore. And because of that, I'm destroying the last good things that I have in my life. I'm failing at university and if I'm not able to be lively my boyfriend will most likely break up with me. My life is not at its lowest point YET, I have good days, but it looks like it will only get worse. It has been worse before, and I can't go through that again. I can't help thinking that maybe I should...do it before I lose everything I have and everyone I love, before I watch everything crumble...
