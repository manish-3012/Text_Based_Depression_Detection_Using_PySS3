I'm ScaredAt school, I'm bullied everyday and beaten up by more than half of my year. I have a single friend I like and could actually consider a friend, however when I am seen near him his friends abuse him and I really don't want to put him through that. I am a triplet and have two sisters, one who outperforms me at everything and I feel like I'm in the shadow of, and another who regularly tells me that my one friend isn't real and that I should kill myself. I have pretty much no life, I'm incredibly lonely, and all I do in my spare time is play computer games. I regularly get angry and break stuff that isn't mine, which I deeply regret later. I have massive mood swings, from just a general grumpyness to a heavy depressed mood where I often contemplate killing myself. I am only 15 years old, and I am terrified that in one of these mood swings in the future I will kill myself. Please help me.
