I think this is it. Feeling calm and ready to go.I have received so much support and help on here in the past. I went and got professional help. I was "ok" for about a month or so, and it just all came back all of the sudden. Ive realized this is something that will never go away and I do not want to live with this the rest of my life. So I think I've made up my mind. The depression, anxiety, cutting, eating disorder, suicidal thoughts, flashbacks, nightmares... I just don't want to live with it anymore. Meds, therapy, it's just not helping. I've tried. I'm not sure I'll make it through tonight. I feel ready to let go. The support and advice here is amazing, but I have no strength left. Feel like I've tried everything. And I have no close friends I can talk to. And no support from family. I just don't know what else I could do.
