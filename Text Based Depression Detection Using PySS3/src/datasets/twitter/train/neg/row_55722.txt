Well, fuck.I am lost. I dont know what to do or cope with what i am feeling. I am an 18 year old man, so of course the "man up" shit keeps me from talking to people about it. Almost every night i stay up and think about stuff that make me go fown a rebbit hole of sadness and suicidal toughts. I dont really know what to do. I dont do anything to make me happier or at least not as sad. World just dosent have color for me. 
I really dont know what to do.
