i can never find friends that actually care because my sadness drives them awayall of my friends grow tired of me because i canâ€™t fucking get better. iâ€™ve tried. and maybe iâ€™m not in therapy right now because my schedule is so full that i donâ€™t have time or the money. itâ€™s my fault. i deserve to die a horrible death. i have no one to talk to about this because i am a burden to everyone. i enrage people, i make them mad. everyone talks about how annoying i am behind my back and everyone agrees. itâ€™s happened all my life. i want the pain to end. i want to stop being trapped. i hate it here and i want to end my life
