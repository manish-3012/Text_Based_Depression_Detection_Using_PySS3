I'm so sadI really, really want to kill myself but I just can't put my mother in that situation. I don't want to live anymore guys. I'm crying as I type this. Had a major row with my girlfriend but this isn't about her. 

 I've been feeling this way for so long.. God, so long.. Bipolar 2.. On Lithium and methylfolate.. I wish I went to sleep and never woke up..
