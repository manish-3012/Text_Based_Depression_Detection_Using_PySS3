I want to dieI'm tired of being a burden on everyone around me. I'm tired of constantly needing help. I'm tired of putting out fires. My son deserves better. I'm holding him back. I don't see a future for myself anymore. I just want it to be over. I don't have the guts to do it myself because what if I don't die? I feel like I'm only here to see how bad i can make things. It's not like I'm not trying either. I work so hard and I have nothing to show for it. Idk what to do anymore I'm just ready for it to be over.
