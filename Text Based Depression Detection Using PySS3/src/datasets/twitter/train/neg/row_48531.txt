I think I might be morally obligated to commit suicide?Iâ€™m not a rapist, murderer, pedophile, or anything crazy like that. Iâ€™m a pretty average person with a lot of issues that often cause me to emotionally depend on and hurt other people. I do have BPD.

I know how disdained people like me are and I donâ€™t really blame people for it, Iâ€™ve often been an abuser in my life. I havenâ€™t had an easy life, but thatâ€™s no excuse for the way I am, only an explanation. Iâ€™m an emotional leech, some might call me a black hole.

Now, I know BPD can get better with treatment and thatâ€™s always the response I get when I say I think I should kill myself. It can get BETTER, not disappear, and most relapse into symptoms after finishing therapy. Even then, finishing therapy can take a long time, sometimes years to see improvement. 

So youâ€™re telling me I should continue to live in agony, while causing nothing but pain and worry for others, for possibly years to come EVEN IF I get treatment and treatment works? To me, that sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through to get to the realization that thereâ€™s essentially no hope.

Doesnâ€™t everyone wish for less bad people in the world? How can you hate bad people and turn around and tell me not to kill myself? Iâ€™ve never heard an actual good argument against suicide for me and I donâ€™t think I ever will. The only feasible other morally ambiguous option would be to isolate myself from others as much as possible.... but isolation would make me kill myself.

Anyway, getting harder and harder to convince myself this isnâ€™t the right choice.
