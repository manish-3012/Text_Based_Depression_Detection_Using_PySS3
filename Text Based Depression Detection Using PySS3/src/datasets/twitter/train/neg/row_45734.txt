Need advice
Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for about two years now officially. Itâ€™s gotten better the past 6 months. I gotten back together With a girl that genuinely care about. Itâ€™s a good relationship but Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™m too depend on her for my happiness. Most of the time I feel incredibly lonely when Iâ€™m not talking to her. I know the answer is to try things that makes you happy. Put yourself first and love yourself. Iâ€™ve tried all of that! But when Iâ€™m talking to her I just feel whole. And the problem with that is I know Iâ€™m putting a lot of pressure and Iâ€™m afraid that she doesnâ€™t feel the same way back. Iâ€™m planning on ending our relationship tonight because I know she doesnâ€™t need someone who struggles with depression in her life but Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™m going to kill myself afterwards or in a few days because I canâ€™t stand this feeling. I tell myself I wonâ€™t do it. Iâ€™ll be strong and Iâ€™ll get through it but depend inside I feel like thatâ€™s just a lie
