I want to kill myself.I wanna die. I hate life. I hate everyone. I canâ€™t even think straight cause Iâ€™m crying so much.

My life at home sucks. My mom and my dad are always fighting, theyâ€™re always yelling at me every single day on â€œrespectâ€ and how I should talk, my mom always hits me, I hate her so fucking much, I donâ€™t even wanna call her my mom.

I hate my dad too. I hate my family. 

At school, thereâ€™s those popular girls that always fucking judge you for what you wear, what you do, who youâ€™re friends with, and more. But of course, I have to fit in dont I? 

Sometimes Iâ€™m so happy and I feel so good, other times Iâ€™m crying and cussing and I want to cut. I just went through 4 tissues.

I canâ€™t even explain it, I know there are people out there who are in much worse situations, but I havenâ€™t genuinely laughed in a long time. I havenâ€™t gone out in a long time. I just havenâ€™t been happy in a very long time.

I have so much to say, but I canâ€™t get it out. Every time I cry my heart hurts. I feel like no one cares about me, and everyone hates me.
