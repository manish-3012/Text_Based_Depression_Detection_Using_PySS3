Need AdviceI'm 21. I have no talents, interests, or hobbies, or personality, I literally sit around doing nothing because I'm not sure where I should begin digging out of the hole I've been in my whole life. The fact that I have none of the above renders me paralyzed and I end up doing nothing all day. I'm afraid of meeting people because I have nothing to say--the only thought running through by brain is in fact "I have nothing to say, oh my god..this silence is awkward." I'm depressed because I have no talents, interests, hobbies, personality but I'm paralyzed and not sure where I begin on suddenly gaining these things I lack. For example, I have no plans for the rest of the week, in fact I have no plan for my life at all, I just sit around all day paralyzed thinking to myself "gosh, I have nothing to say." I'm contemplating suicide because I don't know where to begin.
