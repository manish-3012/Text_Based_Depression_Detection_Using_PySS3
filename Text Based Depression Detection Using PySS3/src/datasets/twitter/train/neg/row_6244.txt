I can't find love and fail at sexlifeI'm 32 and its been 5 years now since I've had sex. The last time was with someone who really didn't care about me at all.   
 Since then its been a steam of confidence destroyers. A lot of ghosting or just harsh rejections. I feel like I'm not worthy of love and I'm worried that I'm going to die alone. (please don't tell me everybody dies alone that doesn't help.) I just keep going through the motions of life trying to pay bills and all but when I have a job I have no time and when I'm broke I have no confidence. I just needed to get the words off my chest, nobody seems too interested/ possible to talk to about this. Thank reddit for the safe space.
