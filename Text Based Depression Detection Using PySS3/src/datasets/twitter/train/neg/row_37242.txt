Itâ€™s real now.I know itâ€™s real now.

I know my suicidal thoughts are becoming real because Iâ€™ve stopped sharing my thoughts with people even though theyâ€™re louder every day. Iâ€™ve prepared and organized all of the little things, to simplify things for whatever happens of my stuff. Iâ€™m in three conversations right now via text, and none of them suspect a thing. In one case itâ€™s just the opposite. Iâ€™m doing particularly well in that conversation. Weâ€™re talking about a trip next summer. I know very well I wonâ€™t last that long. Iâ€™m not sad about what I know is coming, Iâ€™m sad that itâ€™s come to this. Iâ€™m sad that my mental illness is stronger than I am. Iâ€™m sad that my heart canâ€™t move on past the people that didnâ€™t invest in me the way I invested in them. Iâ€™m sad that I let my heart believe that forever actually meant forever. Most of all though, Iâ€™m sad that my past is present enough to end my future.
