Strong urges to kill myselfIâ€™ve struggled with depression for most of my life and recently it has been evolving in a bipolar disorder (diagnosed, but waiting for â€œofficialâ€ diagnostic). I also have OCD, ADHD and GAD. The thing is, despite increasing my SSRI dosage, it seems as if Iâ€™m getting resistant to them and becoming more depressed as days go by.
I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because of depression or anxiety, but I feel a drowning emptiness that basically shouts to me to kill myself, when it comes to it I start looking for any weapon in my room or something to make feel better.
Itâ€™s like an external force calling me to harm myself/end my life.
At this point I donâ€™t know what to do, I canâ€™t stand that suffocating feeling, I donâ€™t know if instead of killing myself I should start doing drugs or cutting myself. I really want to try keep going, but it sometimes feels like an impossible task to me.
Iâ€™m 16 and I have no one Iâ€™d like to talk to, I donâ€™t have dreams, desires or goals, I even try to make people hate me (maybe because, if everyone hates me, itâ€™d be easier for me to end my life).
I literally have no reason to keep going other than not to hurt my family.
I feel like Iâ€™ll never be happy, any advice?
