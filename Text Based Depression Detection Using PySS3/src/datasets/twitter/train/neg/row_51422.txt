I want to die like seriouslyLife isn't worth living anymore. I hate all of it. I just want to die and be at peace but the only I'm alive right now is cause of a promise I made with my friend that I wouldn't try to commit suicide again cause it will "leave them heartbroken". I want to say screw that and everything but I've never broken a promise in my life so I don't know what to do. I have my note thingy for when I say screw all of it and finally succeed. So tell me if I should ignore the promise and keep trying or keep living my life that is horrible and gonna stay horrible as long as I'm alive. 

If my grammar sucks I don't really care
