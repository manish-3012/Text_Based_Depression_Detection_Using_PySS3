hi. highly suicidal. need someone who understands.hey all,

so, ive had depression and anxiety ever since i can remember. literally. added to that ive been through a lot of things and dealt and have to deal with many, many things (including various other mental illnesses/conditions/disorders, traumatic experiences and harm done to me by others, etc, etc), which i wont mention or enumerate here. anyway, im very, very lonely. live with my parents. unemployed. see a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who doesnt really help much, but my parents wont let me look for another one or pay for it. 

lately my depression and anxiety have been taking over me completely. its difficult for me to get out of bed, shower, cut my nails, etc. everythings wrong, nothings alright and i see no way out. saw the shrink today. i cried rivers there. he doubled the dosage of my antidepressant. 

after getting home i just laid on my bed and thought: "its time to stop bitching and whining and start making an actual plan. i have to die. i have to plan an effective way to go forever" and then fell asleep for like 5 hours.

today i saw a message from an online "friend" telling me i "focus too much on my problems" and that i should be grateful ive my "five senses" and wasnt born in a horrible country in "the africa". needless to say, that only made me feel worse.

i dont even know where the fuck im going with all this. im just in a lot of pain and really wanting to end it all already. dont know what to do. im just lost.
