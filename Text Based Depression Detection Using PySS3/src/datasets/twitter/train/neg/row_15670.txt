I haven't wanted to be alive since 2018I don't expect typing this into the void to help anything, but fuck it. I'm embarrassed that I joined an organization that cares so little about it's people, and I'm embarrassed that I didn't know better than to join. I'm not in a job that I can quit, and I don't know if I could look anyone in the eye ever again if I *did* quit. Not that leaving my job would probably even rid me of depression, but I can say with certainty my job is a really shitty place to be depressed lol. I've vented to almost everyone in my life to various degrees about how I feel, with the exception of the one person I really care about, my wife. Because why would I make her feel bad that I feel bad, making me feel even worse? Its no one's fault I have the big sad and there's nothing she can do about it, so why bother. Idk if there's a point to this post. Or life. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far. Reasons to Stay Alive by Matt Haig is a really good read btw. Obviously I'm still depressed if I'm posting here, but its *kept me here*, for what thats worth. Anyway. I hope we all fell better, collectively. Best of luck with life, yall.
