I started the clock, and all I hear is ticking.I said I'd give it some time. I said I'd try everything to get better physically, even if it involved extreme pain. I let them shove needles longer than my hand into my spine and burn off my nerve endings. I let them hold me down while I screamed, and they didn't care. I let people shove needles in my neck and back over 100 times this year. I let a surgeon slice open my throat and fill it with metal. I said I'd try more psych meds and counseling. I said I'd try to hold on. 

And I did. I waited. I thought about it. I got help. I experimented. I waited some more. I tried some more. I took more medications. I saw more doctors for my health problems. 

I'm broke from medical costs. I've been berated by so many doctors and endured so many painful medical procedures. I said I'd wait until another round of appointments this week, hope someone had...not answers, but a reason to wait. Some vestigage of hope. 

I walk into my neurologist's, scared, in so much pain, and she yelled at me. She yelled at me so loud the receptionist in the lobby heard it and apologized. They sent me away, and I've just been crying for hours, and hours. 

If she doesn't cancel on me, I see my psychiatrist in the morning. She's kind, and really wants to help. 

But she can only do so much. It's not her fault my body's broken and half of my doctors are somewhere between callous and abusive. 

Hope's on pause, but the clock has started. A few days, a few weeks maybe. That's all I have left in me. I want so badly just to do it tonight, but I want to give my psychiatrist one more chance; not as an ultimam--she can only do so much, and I'm essentially a lost cause, but maybe if nothing else, I want to thank her for being the only one who's really tried to get me through this. 

I feel guilty, but I can't do this anymore.
