Everything ends in suicideEvery single conversation or train of thought, every subject or activity ends in suicide. Every points to it. Every time I think about doing something, every time I see anyone (especially men, I know it's sexist and I hate myself just a tad more for that) all I can think about is how much better suicide is as an option.

Everything points to a clear answer. Why haven't I solved it all yet?
