Will it get better? What's the point in staying?I'm a senior in highschool. Up until this year I never considered myself 'suicidal' and I never wanted to /die/ but lately I'm not sure. I'm very unhappy and just want it to stop.

I keep getting told it gets better after highschool and that it'll be worth it. 

I work part time and go to school the rest. There's no one in my life willing to hang out with me on the off chance I get a few hours to do something and I don't really get along with my parents who tell me to just 'stop thinking' about the things that make me stressed or anxious. School just keeps getting more demanding as does work but I can't stop doing either of them. I get no sleep and feel unhappy every hour of every day.

I want to think it will get better if I can just make it through this year but I don't think I can get any financial help for the beauty college I'm interested in. Nor do I think I could afford to live out of my parents house. Leaving me stuck in a retirement town for who knows how long.

To put it bluntly; is there any reason I shouldn't just grab the gun out of the closet?
