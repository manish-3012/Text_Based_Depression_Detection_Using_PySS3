I'm not sure that I can fight this much longer..About three months ago I took this medication that really fucked me up. I went from being the happiest a person could be suicidal overnight. It was so strange how my brain chemistry seemingly morphed in such a short period of time like that. It took away my ability to feel good or confident in myself, all my optimism, it even made me look like dead in the face. I can't even smile anymore without it looking incredibly forced.

I never wanted to die and I still don't but if the alternative is to live like this, well it's like I'm already dead. Yeah I'm breathing and talking but it's like I'm not actually there, it's like the real me has been locked away and I don't have the key. 

I don't know why I'm posting this here, I highly doubt there is anything anyone could tell me that would help in any way. Ugh.. It's just so frustrating because I know if I didn't take that drug that everything would be great. Fuck..
