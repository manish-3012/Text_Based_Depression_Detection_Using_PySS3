I've come to peace with my choiceSo I am finding myself to be at peace now that I have finally made my decision to go. I've written out my goodbye to my loved ones and gotten a nice noose ready and happy that it's my time to rest finally. I just have to wait for the right opportunity to be alone and finding that hard as my partner wont let me be, I wish they could feel the peace I do with this choice and let me go and be okay for me knowing I'm happier and better off.
