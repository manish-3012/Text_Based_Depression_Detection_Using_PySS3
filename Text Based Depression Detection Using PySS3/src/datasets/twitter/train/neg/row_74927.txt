How do you get help when you don't even know how to talk about your feelings anymore?What if you know it won't matter to talk about them either way because you know they won't change. Because the thing that would make you feel happiness again is impossible?

What if the thing causing it is grief, but for a person who's still alive? So there's not really anything to make peace with, just a big hole in your life?
