I feel like a complete fuck upThis week I have crashed my car without insurance, lost my apartment due to a three day notice (my apartments illegally raised my rent, confronted them, so theyâ€™re now evicting me yay). My doctor thinks I have lymphoma, so theyâ€™re doing a cat scan Thursday (theyâ€™ve already removed a few tumors out of my neck, they donâ€™t want to keep cutting me open), and on top of this, the only person who I have is my boyfriend who doesnâ€™t even give a shit about me. I feel like Iâ€™m just losing everything and I canâ€™t handle this.  I have bpd and honestly all I can think about is dying, the past few days thatâ€™s all I think about and I just wish I had someone who cared about me.
