I dont want to feel like this anymoreso first of all im gonna use a throw away account because i dont want people i know to know this side of me.

So to start im a 21 yo male and i've been feeling like shit lately. I have no idea or reason to feel this way as im really having an easy life and a have it really well set up for me. I go to a good college and i nearly finished up my bachelor's degree in engineering. But i just have this feeling that nothing i do really gives me long term satisfaction. i have no long term ambitions and overall i just feel like shit on a daily basis. 

ive been felling despressed for the last few years with some up and down periods. i always thought this depressed feeling was because of my failing love life. ive never really had a girlfriend for a long time and everywhere i looked i saw happy people together, so i figured love was the magical ingredient. however, i recently found out that thats is not the solution. i have a beautiful girlfriend that i love very much, but this feeling that i just want to end myself and everything around me still haunts me on a daily basis. my gf wants me to go to a doctor to get it diagnosed but i dont want to. im just too scared to be confronted with the problem that i have.

lately the suicidal thoughts have gotten worse and i've actually had visual fragments of how and where im going to kill myself. ive stopped telling people about these dark thoughts as i dont want to bother them with the negativity. the only thing holding me back from actually doing it is the fear of hurting the people i care about.

i really dont know what i should do at this point. i dont know whats wrong with me but i just want this feeling to stop, im tired of feeling like this everyday, i dont care how it ends. i would have bo problems with dying, as long as it is not me doing it, i dont want to hurt those around me too much.
