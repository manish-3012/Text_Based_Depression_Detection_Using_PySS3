I cant keep onI can't keep on. I need to seize to exist. I've tried too many times. Mental illness has me dead, and my life is worthless and shitty. Anyway I see it, I'm done. I wish the first time I swallowed pills, that I would of died. I just want to not exist anymore, and there's only one way as far as I see it. Every breath of my life is painful. Don't you guys think there is a point where, to be completely honest, death is the best choice?
