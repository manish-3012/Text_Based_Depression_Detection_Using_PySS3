I don't know who I am anymore.When I was a child, I was fucking brave. I used to just say what was on my mind and then not care if I was judged. I used to speak about my interests and not care if people thought they were weird and a waste of time. I spoke to everyone. I loved being social. I couldn't think of anything more valuable than happiness and being alive. 

Now, I'm a shell. I spend most my free time crying and looking back. I am AWARE that I should look forward and create a better future. I can't. I wish I was dead. Every time I think i'm making an improvement in my life, everything falls apart and I don't understand what the point is. I wear masks with people and I'm afraid that one day, I'll be exposed as a fraud and a failure. 

I'm sorry. It just really hurts at the minute.
