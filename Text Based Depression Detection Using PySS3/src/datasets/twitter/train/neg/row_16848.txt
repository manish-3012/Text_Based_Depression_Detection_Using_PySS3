Really StrugglingI turned 22 this year. Itâ€™s been 6 years since my last suicide attempt and those years have definitely had their ups and downs. Iâ€™m a senior in college now in a major I hate, because I wanted to make my parents happy and be an engineer. Iâ€™m struggling with my classes which in turn makes it hard to keep motivation to keep trying. My sleep schedule is absolutely fucked. Iâ€™m just broken mentally at this point. I was a â€œgiftedâ€ kid growing up and my mom always expected me to do great things. Sheâ€™s reminded me a few times about how Iâ€™m technically a genius and I have to keep reminding her that IQ doesnâ€™t really mean anything and I took that test when I was a kid. This year she finally said she was done with her expectations for me since sheâ€™s never right. And on one hand thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve wanted and on the other it kind of broke me more. My dad knows how much I hate my life right now and heâ€™s always there to support me to just get through it so itâ€™s over. I appreciate that. But it hurts to see the pain in his eyes when I talk to him about it. I feel like a failure even though I know Iâ€™m not. I do know Iâ€™m a disappointment though. I had a great relationship a year ago. I slowly destroyed that with my toxic and unhealthy tendencies, one of which was major emotional management issues when it came to being angry. But from that I learned and actually grew a lot as a person. I donâ€™t blame her for leaving, but I was already beginning to change in the end and she still walked away. She went on to date her friend she always told me not to worry about a few weeks later. This was a year ago and Iâ€™m still alone. That is what it is though. I hold no anger over it. I guess Iâ€™m just trying to give context to the situation or maybe Iâ€™m just talking for myself. I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t get angry anymore. About anything. I guess I changed too much I donâ€™t know I just canâ€™t find it in me anymore. I get breifly angry sometimes, but it never lasts. The problem is I donâ€™t really feel anything else either. I try to get out and talk to people but Iâ€™m so busy with school itâ€™s hard. My best friend Emma says I should just get a girlfriend but Iâ€™ve tried. Iâ€™ve talked to so many people over the past year and they all just stop talking to me eventually. I just feel so alone. Funnily enough sheâ€™s the closest thing I have to a relationship. She wanted to make a marriage pact at 30 years old since weâ€™re at different parts of life right now and of course I accepted because I fuckin love her. I just donâ€™t have it in me to tell her Iâ€™ll probably be dead long before then. Iâ€™m rambling Iâ€™m sorry. Drugs help deal with my problems but I only get high when my roommate isnâ€™t here so I donâ€™t get paranoid. Iâ€™m just ready to die. I see no future. Sometimes I wonder if that gun really did go off 6 years ago and now Iâ€™m in hell. 

Sorry for wasting your time with all this. Iâ€™m just gonna go get a little higher, turn on some music I listened to when I was younger and happy, and watch the sunrise. 

If youâ€™re reading this I hope you have a wonderful day. I love you. I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll die, but I keep getting this feeling itâ€™ll be soon. Exactly how I donâ€™t know. But if I do letâ€™s grab a beer on the other side. I love you.
