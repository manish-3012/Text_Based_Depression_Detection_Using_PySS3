I'm confused and distraught  My life was great until recently.  I had a wife and kid and I was a rising biologist about to become a professor.  It was literally my dream.  
  Two years ago though my 3 year old was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer and given a year at best.  We were devastated.  My wife was a devout catholic but I was an atheist.  Our difference of religion tore us apart in our son's last days.  She convinced me to agree to her family's Christian funeral and divorced me shortly after it.  
  I fell into a depression and bombed the interview because I couldn't sleep.  I landed a half ass 7th grade teaching job last year with students that don't give two shits about it, and to top it off I just got laid off on the last day of school because parents though I treated the students like shit.
  For the past week all I've thought about is my son and what it's like to die.  I don't feel suicidal but I keep imagining what it's like to not exist.  
  I don't want to be any worse than I am, so I just want to talk to somebody to help me put things into perspective.
I also want to remain anonymous, so just call me John.
