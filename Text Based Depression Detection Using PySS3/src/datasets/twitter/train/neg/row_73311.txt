I just thought I would let you guys know that tonight might be the night...when I get depressed,I want to write down everything I think, but the words go by in my head faster than I can write/type, I have to force myself to go slow just to do this. when I start writing I start getting happier but before I'm actually happy my brain speeds up and I stop writing. Then I just feel even more alone and more depressed than I did before, and I start OD'ing on advil. the pills make me feel good enough not to kill myself. I ran out of my last bottle this morning though. I took the last ten 10 midol (I was out of advil and midol has simalar affects) and they're wearing off now. When they wear off completely I don't have any more pills and so I cant numb my thoughts of suicide... it might do it tonight... if only I can slow my brain down long enough to write my last goodbye...
