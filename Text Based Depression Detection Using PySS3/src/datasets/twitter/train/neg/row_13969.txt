Should I tell my therapist I'm suicidalThe tile says it all. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a long time. I haven't attempted in years but I still feel this impulse/want to end my own life. Everything I just too hard, depression is kicking my ass, all of that stuff and more. Recently, I have gotten closer to killing myself than I have in past. On the way back from my lunch break I almost smashed into another car, on purpose, I sped up to make it so I'd finish me. I thought about how much money my parents would have to spend to fix the car and stopped before I hit the car. I have a therapist I meet with once a week over the phone but I:m afriad if I tell him he'll silv the big men with big nets on me. My mental illness already hurst my family, and I don't want it to anymore. Should I tell my therapist I'm having these thoughts?
