A 16 year old's storyI'm josef, I'm 16 and I've been suffering depression. I was diagnosed from 13 and treated on Prozac, Zoloft and many others which have failed to work. I'm a huge self harmed and I buy surgical scalpels online to use. I've had two admissions to a psychiatric hospital and currently I'm in one. I've tried so many suicide methods ending in me being in hospital or sobbing without anyone noticing. Last Tuesday I was found wandering on railways waiting to jump under a train. I was taken in an ambulance and given an antidote. I suffer anxiety and depression and PTSD, all have been diagnosed by my psychiatrist. I face great difficulties and currently being assessed for Autism! I give up hope every single day, at night I research methods, in the day I just smoke away and self harm. Everyday is a struggle and I don't know how I've stayed alive this long.
