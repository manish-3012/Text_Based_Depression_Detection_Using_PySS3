TiredI don't know why i'm posting here but I just don't really know what to do.  I am just exhausted.  I'm 36 and I've been having suicidal thoughts for a long time now.  I used to always have reason's why I wouldn't do it.  Lately they are starting to mean less and less.  It has just been getting to be so much worse lately.  I have no patience anymore with anything.  I find myself snapping at people like I never have before.  I've always been pretty laid back and it would take a lot to upset me but lately the smallest things set me off.  I am not getting any sleep.  I end up laying in bed and coming up with reason's that everyone in my life would be better off without me.  I know that there is very little that anyone can do to help, I guess I just needed to get it off my chest.
