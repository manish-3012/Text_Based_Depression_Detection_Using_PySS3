I plan to die at the end of this year if I'm still alone. It's too hard to keep going.I'll be moving back to the US at the end of the year. I'm going to take my dad's gun, go out in the backyard and shoot myself. I wish it didn't have to be like this. I wish I had a choice. But there really isn't one. I wake up every day and just lay on the floor stare at the ceiling.

I want to be strong enough to keep going. I want to be able to keep living with everything, just for long enough to meet a girl who will love me and make life worth living. But I just can't do it. I can't take anymore of this. I want out. Everyone telling me I have to love myself first or be happy with myself first just makes it worse. I'll never be happy on my own. I need someone else. I just need one person. That's all it'll take. One girl to come along and make everything worth it. I wish I could live for long enough to meet that girl. But it's just too hard. There isn't even any guarantee I'll find someone no matter how long I live.

I'm scared to die. I've been trying my best this year to be good enough for someone. I'm so afraid. But I'm more afraid of having to live like this for even another year.
