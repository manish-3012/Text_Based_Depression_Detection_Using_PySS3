I'd feel like a fuck up and hopeless but I'm too scared to dieIt's such a strange feeling, being passively suicidal. I want to not be alive anymore but I don't actually want to die. Sometimes I do get so far as trying to figure out how much of my medication I would need to take to end it all but I've never actually done it. I've been battling with depression over the last 15 years but this past year has been especially hard. I don't think my meds are working anymore. I feel like I just want to sleep through the rest of my life and that the only time I'm truly free is when i'm unconscious. I don't want to hurt my family and wonderful partner, but every day is a struggle. The worst part is the endless hopelessness. I can't comprehend how people go through their entire lives complaining about work, their lives, money, their families and knowing it's just an endless cycle of hardship with little reward. There's so little in life to look forward to and so much to dread. I just want to curl up in a ball and ignore it all.
