My first post on redditAnd it's on this forum or whatever you call it.. I feel like I'm probably quite bit older than most of you.. im 36, I have 2 kids but one of them is 18 and goes through suicidal thoughts just as much as I do and I have my whole life!  I've had some real shitty things happen in my life such as a lot of  sexual abuse at a young age and then the same shit happened to my older daughter by my piece of shit ex husband (oh he got 25 years by the way!!!!)  resulting in a heroin relapse and I've lost everything I've ever owned in the past 4 years so here I am sitting at my moms house going through dopesick after just leaving Chicago now in mid Missouri 

I wish I had some fentanyl so I could just end it all!! Believe me I have tried to end my life many times, I have been in psych ward after psych ward.. the first time I was 14, when I was 21 I tried 3 times within 3 months why am I still here???

I was brought back with narcan 5 times!! Ughgggg I hate my life 

On the other hand, I love my 8 year old daughter soooooo much and I want to be here for her but I also feel that someone in my family may be able to raise her better than I can since I am such a damaged soul.  I dont know what to do anymore. 

I used to have a happy life once.  I had a career, a beautiful house, a nice car, I even was going for a masters in social work but that's the past I lost it all and now I'm just a failure and I feel like I will never get it back.  I just want to go back to Chicago go find me some fentanyl and end it which is not hard believe me no narcan bringing me back this time
