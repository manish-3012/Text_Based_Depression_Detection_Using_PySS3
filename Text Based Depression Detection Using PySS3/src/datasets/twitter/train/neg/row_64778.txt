I don't want to get betterIt's a lot easier to just keep buying alcohol and drinking it. Making the conscious effort to not constantly drug myself doesn't feel worth it in the end. When I'm happy and productive, it doesn't feel as good as being completely blissful. Nothing does, and that's all I want. I just want to be blissful constantly, even if I feel nothing at all.
