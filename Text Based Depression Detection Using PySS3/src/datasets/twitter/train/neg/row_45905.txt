hi. my name is naomi.Hey Reddit. 

I hope it doesnâ€™t come off as â€œattention seekingâ€ but Iâ€™ve decided to kill myself. I realize this is weird to post on Reddit but I donâ€™t have any friends in real life to leave a note for, or say goodbye to. At 28, I feel like I have lived enough to reasonably be able to commit suicide and not â€œmissâ€ any major milestones in life, I feel like Iâ€™m at the perfect age for this decision. I have tried my very best to make my life work. I have an eating disorder which drains me mentally, on top of this I experience extreme highs and lows in my mood. When I am down, I get very stressed and when I get stressed I have horrible obsessive thoughts play in my head over and over and can only get rid of them by self harm. I realize this is not how well adjusted adults behave. I realize I will never be able to be the type of woman I want to be because I cannot focus on my life due to my brain. I cannot afford any treatments (I have looked into it) and have no choices. I feel like this is the kindest thing I can do for myself. 

Thank you for listening.
