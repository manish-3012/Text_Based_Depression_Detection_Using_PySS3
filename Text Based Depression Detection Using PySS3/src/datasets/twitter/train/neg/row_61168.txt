Lost HopeI feel like absolute shit everyday.
Lately the feeling of not being real has gotten worse than ever before. 
Iâ€™m not happy and I donâ€™t see any hope. Years of attempts and methods of sh and Iâ€™m still here. Why? 
Iâ€™m a fucking coward. 
I used to get by with distractions but of course nothing has interested me in so long. I am pathetic and behind in life
Eighteen, hs graduate, licenseless and jobless, car is currently not drivable anyway.
Everyone around me is living life and all I can do is be miserable.
I canâ€™t sleep till like 5am everyday because Iâ€™m so scared and sad at night. 
So of course Iâ€™m either weak and tired all day or sleeping the whole day away. 
I am worthless and everyone around me thinks it, they are just too afraid to admit it. I want a to get my license and a job so badly, but canâ€™t get a license without a car to drive for the test and my car is illegal to drive rn. It may take months to get it legal. I want to move out of this shitty town but I canâ€™t. 
After years of telling myself just to wait it out itâ€™s getting harder and harder to just wait for life to get better when it never has.
At this point after it just being one thing after another I think Iâ€™m tired of trying and waiting. 
I want to die so bad, just fall asleep and not wake up. 
Fuck I want that so bad
