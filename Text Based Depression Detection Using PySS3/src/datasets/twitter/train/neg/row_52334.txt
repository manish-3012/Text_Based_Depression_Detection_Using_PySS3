Dying with dignityAt the age of 35, it's been about 20 years, my entire adult life, that existence has been a chore and a burden. 

I suppose when you're young you always think things will change, you'll "grow up" and everything will be different, but honestly I'm done, I'm so exhausted, I've fought the urge to go for as long as I can take and with each day that passes my future gets more and more bleak and my suffering more and more unbearable.

I'm just incapable of being happy, any notions of joy or happiness I've ever experienced are so far outweighed by the constant misery and suffering that I'm just ready. I don't want to continue, I just want to no longer exist.

But what's kept me here this long is the thoughts of how to kill myself, how to get out. I don't want a particularly violent death, mostly because of the fear of survival, but also for those left behind, I wish I could just go out dignified.

I had to put my dog down a few years ago and as heartbreaking as it is to think about, I'm glad I afforded him some dignity when it was clear that living had become more painful than it was worth for him.

I really wish we afforded each other the same level of dignity and could choose to end our own life and be supported in that decision by giving us an option to say our goodbyes, receive an injection and fall asleep never to awaken.

Ironically that dignity is reserved for only the worst in society who receive a death penalty.

Can anyone suggest a peaceful and dignified way to go? Everything is such a risk, the risk of survival is too much and as I say, I don't want an awful, violent end like a gunshot to the head.
