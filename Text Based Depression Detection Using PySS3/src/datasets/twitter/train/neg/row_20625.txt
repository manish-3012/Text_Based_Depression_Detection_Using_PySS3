People always say thereâ€™s plenty reasons to stayBut what if all those reasons are the reasons youâ€™re so tired of everything. The things that youâ€™re suppose to hold close are the reasons that I hurt so much. The ones that love me are the knifes in my heart. Iâ€™m being split in the middle with my fucking depression. I love everyone in my life. And I know they love me. And care for me. But itâ€™s those reason that make this so fucking difficult to just end it. Iâ€™m the reason so many of my friends have met and become friends. But Iâ€™m scared my death will tear them apart. That I was the glue. But itâ€™s not fair that Iâ€™m stuck here while the live their lives. I canâ€™t tell whoâ€™s selfish here anymore. I just want this world to end me. Iâ€™m 22 male. This isnâ€™t my first rodeo with depression but man did it come back hard this weekend.
