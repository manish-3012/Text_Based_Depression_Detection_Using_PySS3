I'm losing everythingReally, im losing everything I care about. My family, my house, my dog. My heart is broken and hurts I don't have anything to live for. I've got some time to get some stuff in order. I just don't know what to do anymore. After it's all gone, I'm gonna be gone too. I'm going to be gone too..
