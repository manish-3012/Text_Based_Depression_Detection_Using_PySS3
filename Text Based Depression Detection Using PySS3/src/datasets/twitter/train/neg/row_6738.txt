I'm so broken and fucked up from my childhood and I don't know what to do with myselfMy mom fucked me up pretty good when I was little.. I still can't function properly.. I'm apparently a manipulating and ghosting piece of shit like my mom, and I don't even see it myself. I'm cruel and mean and I have the same anger issues as her.. I feel like I'm way too much like her.... 
I want to give in to my depression and just kill myself. I have wanted to many times but never tried. I suppose there's always a first time for everything.
