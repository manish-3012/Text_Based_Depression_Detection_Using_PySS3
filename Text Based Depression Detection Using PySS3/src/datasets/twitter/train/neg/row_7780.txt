Some people have all the luckYou know them, the ones that have some health problems where they could easily die if they do X, Y, or Z. 

Then thereâ€™s us, that do everything we can to die (short of a gun in the mouth), and it still doesnâ€™t work. 

This world is fucked up. I would, in a heartbeat, trade my health to someone that actually wants to live.
