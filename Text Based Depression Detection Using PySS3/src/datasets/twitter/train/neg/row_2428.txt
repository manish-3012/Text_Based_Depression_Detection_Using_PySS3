There are a lot of posts on here everyday \[context - wife died a month ago\]

Counseling hasn't helped.  
Talking with friends and family hasn't helped.  
Being alone **definitely** hasn't helped.  
I don't really want to take pills to function or use anti-depressants. My sister has been waiting for a reason to 5150 me, and frankly, maybe that's what I want. Being forced into therapy and medication I don't want. Housed in a place I can sob and just exist because I really don't want to do anything else for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, I don't know the costs of being in such a fine institution for the rest of my life, and I don't want to burden my family with that. In my mind, once my wife's heart stopped, my time stopped too. So I just feel like I'm floating around in this stressful wasteland just trying to exist, but life wants me to be a functional part of society already and be *responsible* with the life that I have. In my mind, I no longer have a life and am just living on borrowed time because I literally do not want to do anything because everything reminds me of what I used to have with my wife. I've researched and even contemplated if I should just learn the DNM bible and trying my luck with all that. One of my more understanding friends said maybe a goal for me is to save and get to Switzerland for the assisted suicide thing. I wish this was more available in the US. I'm just thankful the a very select amount of friends understand how much pain I am going through and that I do not want to be here anymore.

I'm agnostic so whether I go to Heaven or Hell is beyond me. I don't even mind if I don't get to see her in the afterlife cause it's just darkness or nothingness or whatever. I just want to stop suffering here all alone without her.
