So a â€˜friendâ€™ did somethingI broke down, crying in school threatening to kill myself the next time I crossed the road and it was one of the first times she really ever saw me cry and being the â€˜understandingâ€™ friend she was she said â€˜I felt thatâ€™ while snickering. Nevermind dying later, I shouldâ€™ve died right then and there, but itâ€™s in the past now. She has her own problems as well, so I felt like an asshole for telling her to just â€˜shut the hell upâ€™. I donâ€™t know what to do and Iâ€™m already at the brink of actually going to attempt it. All because of that one stupid comment. iâ€™m a joke.
