I don't know where to post this, but I'm getting frustrated I can't fucking die.I've done research, I have tried hanging myself last year, but the one thing I can't fucking do is jump.  
I live in a seaside town there's plenty of fucking cliffs about.  
I know I can't hang myself I can't tie knots properly cause of my dyspraxia.  
I' have CPTSD and Psychotic symptoms this is going to be my life even when I do get help my meds aren't helping anyway.  
I'm done but there's no way out.
