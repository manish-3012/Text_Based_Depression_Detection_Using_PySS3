How am I supposed to do this anymore?Honestly every single day I wake up is a fucking struggle. I'm massively scared to leave my home due to my social anxiety, a fact which seems to be lost on my family members. I have no friends left in my hometown pretty much due to them all moving on in life with work, and I still don't even have my college degree because I had to drop out due to my social anxiety and crippling depression. I'm at a loss as to how I'm supposed to continue.

I've never ever been happy in my hometown. I've had thoughts of suicide for the last 10 years, with a small spell of relief when I transferred to my college and met a girl who I dated for a short period. That ended and then my depression worsened by tenfold. I don't really see how I'll ever find someone again as I can't even approach people when I am able to leave the home. I feel as though I'm a fundamentally broken person. I've been told I'm decently intelligent and I'm good with my words, but I absolutely don't find any good in myself. I know for a fact it would feel better to just end it right now because I don't think I can be fixed. I've tried therapy, exercising, giving up substances, but nothing works. I'm at the end of the road with this shit. Waking up in my hometown, a place that's done absolutely nothing but reject me from the moment I was born, every morning seems like the absolute worst thing in the world at the moment. Sorry for the venting. I just figured it might be better to get it out before I'm gone.
