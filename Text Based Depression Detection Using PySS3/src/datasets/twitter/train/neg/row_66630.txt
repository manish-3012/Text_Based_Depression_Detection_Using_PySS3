trying to stay positive about the future but feeling aloneI keep waiting for life to get better. I have been fortunate and I have had my good moments so I'm not going to say everything has been shit but I have never felt accepted for who I am. I've lost my friends over the years, mostly my fault but not always and in the times its not its clear its just my personality. I don't know if I'll ever find my place in the world. I feel like I'm on the cusp of being good enough. 

I feel stupid. I am starting to become unhappy with my body, though I know that can be changed. My life is changing rapidly and while it's in a positive way, I am not sure I am happy enough to wait, which is sickening. I think it's because I'm scared of the what-if. I'm disabled. People's every sentence to me is laced with judgement. I come in to work visibly emotional and it's "how bad can it be here?" It's like once people get to know me they change their minds about me... and the thing is, I can't be like everyone else. I just feel different. Never cool enough. 

Mom, you did this to your other daughter first and now me. I am suffering for many reasons but you play a significant role. Too bad you couldn't break the cycle. 

Sometimes I battle with preferring to die by accident in my sleep or making the choice myself. And sometimes I wish I would die either way to prove a point. It would hurt my dad though who loves me but he's so far away. And probably the sister I mentioned earlier. I think the other one might be a robot. Mom loves her!

She keeps saying I could move in with any one of them anyway. Problem is, that's uprooting my life or also being with someone who I would fight with all the time. I am not in the place to support myself. Scared of the changes right now. Just wishing I could give up
