I switch back so quicklyHi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a good run for the past couple of weeks, my relationship was stable and we enjoyed our time together. That ended yesterday and suddenly my life makes no sense anymore. Some very harsh things were said to me and I feel the nice times were a lie. I live in my boyfriends country, speak his language, I've adapted my entire life to suit this. I feel crushed and am back to wanting for the pain to end. I'm tired. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, he believes my cries for help are bullshit. It's very lonely out here.  


I hope the people reading this are having a good bout. Please try your best to be well. I am rooting for all of you
