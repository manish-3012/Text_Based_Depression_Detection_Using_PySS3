Looking for inputI recently crossed a threshold. The biggest thing holding me back from suicide previously was guilt over how my friends and family would feel over it. I've grown isolated enough over the last year that this doesn't really factor in anymore. I find myself making plans and beginning to act on them on a daily basis, but decide to go do something else first, and just perpetually putting it off.  


Is anybody else at this stage right now? I'm pretty torn up emotionally, and essentially ran to my only real friend to hang out of fear of being alone. I'm usually pretty ambivalent to the prospect, but lately it has seemed like a much more inviting choice, and my willingness to kill myself is really scaring me. How do I make it out of this?
