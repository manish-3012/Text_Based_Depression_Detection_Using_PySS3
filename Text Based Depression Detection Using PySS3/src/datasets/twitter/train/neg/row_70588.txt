And that was itWhat a long and a strange journey it was. I never felt like I achieved something, was always greedy, hungry for more. Even when my parents praised my successess, it was not enough for me. All my friends were jealous for my standard of life, some pick careers in same industry. Kids, nice, normal life in 4bed suburb house, good car and salary, friends and praising me parents - all gone. Vanished.

I've lost everything that was important, and I realized too late how "little" I need to be happy. 

My fall was sudden, but it was a process too. I was too blind to see that Im hurting everyone around me. When my ex told me shes leaving and is taking custody over kids I didnt oppose. Not because I dont love them. Just because I do. I'm just selfish and arrogant and if you ask me for my morality... what would I need it for? At that very moment it was my last concern to be moral. And kids deserve better. 

Last year was quick, drugs, alcohol, debts. Still wonder when will my car disappear due to overdue. And I dont really care about it. If I go to jail for my latest recklessness, fine let it be. Im not worried at all. Just a numb, empty shell. I've lost that drive for life, I know it will be better for all if I die. My family would get a closure. And as I'm a good professional I take care of details for my 'thing'. I will hang myself, snapped neck sounds most reasonable to me. Ok, fingers crossed. Got to go back to burn all remaing bridges. If theres any left
