somebody give me a hand, plsi feel like i have no purpose to be alive... i have no willing to do nothing, i just stay home alternating between my bed and computer. i know what i have to do, but i dont feel like doing it. i want to change but i cant do it. i have no motivation, i dont know what to do.

my biggest wish is to wake up in a hospital bed to see if things could be better, i cant stand my life no more, and i say it serious. sometimes me and my friends play that we are going to kill ourselves, but sometimes i wish that it was true. fortunatly, i have no courage to end my life.

but again, i think that my biggest problem is that i have no motivation to do anything. not even going to a psychiatrist, having a diet or going to gym. i just give up things, everything. i tried all these three but i cant continue them and i really wish i could. can somebody give me a light?
