Suicidal for most my life (from 12-30 years old)Iâ€™ve been suicidal almost 20 years now, for my entire adolescence and adult life. Iâ€™ve tried:

1) individual therapy
2) medication 
3) rehabilitation
4) partial hospitalization 
5) intensive outpatient program 
6) 2 stays in a public psych ward due to suicidality
7) group therapy 

(All for severe depression, trauma, anxiety)

Iâ€™ve read educational books, forced myself to exercise, and eat healthy. Iâ€™ve done CBT training and mindful meditation.

I feel like Iâ€™ve done almost all I can. My doctor wants me to try TMS but because of a recent brain injury I may only qualify for â€œsuperficialâ€ TMS IF the TMS specialists think itâ€™s safe for me to do, I met a specialist who only offered non-superficial TMS and he told me I could possibly be at higher risk for seizures. He also discussed ECT with me, and ketamine-therapy (unaffordable).

Iâ€™m tired of trying, honestly. Iâ€™ve done my very best for my family and friends. But at some point itâ€™s unsustainable to live as a shell for others, suffering as an empty ghost for god knows how many more years. Iâ€™m like a puppet dancing for other people, but wooden and dead inside. 

I would like to have some dignity and choose something in my life. I did not choose trauma, abuse, or a lifelong mental illness.

I would like to choose death finally. People have told me â€œif you were really going to commit suicide, you would just do it already.â€

Iâ€™m ready. My 20â€™s are over, itâ€™s time to make a final decision. Fighting suicide does nothing. Once I accept my death, I can prepare for it and have something real to look forward to at last.
