I didn't even get out of bed this morning.I was so depressed I couldn't get out of bed this morning. I only got up when my parents made me go to church. I don't want to deal with life anymore. I was so mad and depressed. And my boyfriends mom took his phone away for no reason and I didn't know until about 16:45. I needed him so much and he wasn't there and unable to tell me why because of his jackass of a mom. I just want to die.
