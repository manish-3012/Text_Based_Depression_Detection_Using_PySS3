I never expected to be here...Never, not once, have I actually considered acting on one of these thoughts. I am 15, and have been depressed for 4 years, and in those years, I never have. Iâ€™ve had thoughts of suicide obviously. Everyone with depression does, itâ€™s just the voiceâ€™s thing i guess... but not once have I ever truly thought about how I was going to do it, what would happen, what I would tell everyone before I left this terrible world (from what Iâ€™ve read I guess people write notes?)... Iâ€™m not even sure what prompted it, today was just the day I guess... to actually consider being dead, thinking it would actually be better... I donâ€™t know what to do now... I havenâ€™t stopped thinking about it since this morning... 

Please donâ€™t fill this with the â€œit gets betterâ€ or â€œI want to help, and I care about youâ€ comments... there are people that need that more than I do on this sub...

I guess in case anyone is worried I should mention that if I were to do it, I wouldnâ€™t plan on doing it anytime soon, there are still a lot of things I want to make up for before I leave... donate as much back to my parents as possible for one, considering how much they have spent to make my life as perfect as possible is the best thing I can do... plus I canâ€™t handle the effect it would have on them...

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore... Iâ€™m just so confused and need to rest for a long, long time...
