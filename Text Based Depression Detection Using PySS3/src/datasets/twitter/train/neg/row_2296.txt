I want to die, even though I'm not depressedI am bored.  I have no friends and no interests.  Well, I do have interests, but I'm unemployed and have no money, so I can't do any of my interests.

I'm 24 and have never had a real job.  I am trying, but I just can't get one.  I think I've reached an age where no one in their right mind is going to hire me, having no previous experience.

Today I spent almost the entire day laying in bed staring at the wall or staring at the wallpaper on my computer.  I have no friends to talk to.  I can't play any games because my PS3 is broken, my computer needs a new video card, and I have no money.

I just can't take this meaningless existence anymore.  I'm scared, I don't want to die, but I can't stand living.  Every moment is miserable.
