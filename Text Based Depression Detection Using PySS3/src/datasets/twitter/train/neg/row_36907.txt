I think I am suicidal..I donâ€™t know if I am suffering from depression or not, or if Iâ€™m bipolar or not.. Iâ€™ve never been at a psychiatrist, psychologist or things like that so I have no such diagnosis for this. All I know is that there are days where I really wanna die, and other days where I am kinda happy with the life that I have... and honestly I really donâ€™t know what to do, or why I wanted to post this
I think I need help or maybe not I donâ€™t really know, my bf is telling me to stop with this bullshit.. i kinda wanna stop but I donâ€™t really know how, I donâ€™t have any friends, I only have him and my family.. I don't really tell anyone how I feel because I don't want to bore others with my nonsense
