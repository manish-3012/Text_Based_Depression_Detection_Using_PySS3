Another failed attemptI tried to hang myself using simple suspension method but failed. The first time I ever tried I began to lose consciousness, but it seems all of my subsequent attempts have been futile. Maybe I need a softer rope? Or Iâ€™m not tying it tight enough? Or itâ€™s positioned at the wrong place on my neck? I wonâ€™t give up, I have faith that Iâ€™ll be successful one day, then Iâ€™ll finally be in peace. :)
