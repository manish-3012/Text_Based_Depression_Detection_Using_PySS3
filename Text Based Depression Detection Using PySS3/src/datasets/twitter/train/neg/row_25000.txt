First time actively planning for a whileI had a number of suicide attempts around 5 years ago and kind of pulled through. If I was to be totally honest, ever since then it's a rare day when the thought of everything ending everything hasn't been attractive if I'm given just 30 seconds to think about it.

This last week has been a serious elevation though, and I just got back from a walk to check out if a tree near my house is  sufficiently strong for a noose and far enough from the main path to be subtle. The answer to both questions was yes.

The one thing that's stopped me planning or attempting anything these past years has been a knowledge of the suffering it would cause to people around me. But having been to a BLM demo just now, plus the knowledge of looming ecological collapse I get from my work, and my complacently in all of this as a well-off 35yo straight white guy who has almost every privilege possible (accept remotely stable mental health), I really wonder now whether me dying would actually do any harm at all, overall.

If that's true, it just leaves the question of whether I want to live. And honestly, fuck that -- I have so many friends and good health and awesome people all around me yet still I feel that overall, life is so much more shit than good it isn't remotely worth it.

This leaves me in a bit of predicament, with an obvious answer. I've never imagined I'll make it another, say, 10 years without ending my life, and I don't think tonight will be the night I'd decide to go, but Jesus right now I can't imagine making it another week.
