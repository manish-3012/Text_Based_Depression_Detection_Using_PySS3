I fear my end is near.Been struggling so much with work &amp; anxiety with how complicated i find it.

How I flip flop about whether Iâ€™m ok where I am Iâ€™m this job, I think not but some days I get by just about ok &amp; maybe itâ€™s not so bad.

Been having suicidal ideations a lot  more frequently lately. 

Think the only solace in life atm other than cannabis is my girl &amp; unexpectedly tonight I found out itâ€™s likely to end soon. I also work under her dads management so itâ€™s gonna be awkward anywayZ I know itâ€™s selfish for me to feel like this compared to some peopleâ€™s pain but here I am just thinking about the perfect place to jump off.
