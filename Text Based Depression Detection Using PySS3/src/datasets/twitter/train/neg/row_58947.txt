Someone please give me advice /helpRecently my borderline has got bad and now I am going on a two week vacation away from my girlfriend of 9 months in two days and I can't take it. This is too much pressure and sadness all at once. I have never been away from her this long. I don't want to end up self harming again or something similar. The thing is, she is my pure existence, she's like my energy, without her I am only a mess of depression and bpd. What can I do to help pass the time, distract my mind or keep me busy? Anyone had similar?
