I've stopped doing amything, it's a sign. I need to end things.I have become incapable of anything. My world isn't just small, it doesn't exist. I don't exist. I shout and no one hears, or if they do they don't want to and tune me out. I don't have any solutions, and neither the strength nor stability to find them. There is nothing left giving me a meaningful existence.

I'm already dead, you see? Of course I should kill myself. It's the only thought that makes any sense. The only thing that elicits any positive response at all in me. Everytbing else is either numbness or anger. If that isn't a clear sign I don't know what is.

I have no one. Someone tell me something. Anything at all. Make me want to matter. Because right now I don't.
