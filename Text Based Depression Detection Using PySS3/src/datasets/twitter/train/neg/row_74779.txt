Please suggest a way to end things peacefully.Hey guys,
I've been dealing with my toxic parents for 20 years now and I don't think I can take it anymore. I've just completed my undergrad and idk if I should do Master and leave them or just leave them now. The main reason why I'm with them is because they're funding me atm as I don't have enough saving. I am even depressed due to the way they treat me and I really need your help on this. How do you get along with such parents? They always make me think that I don't have a opinion and I must do everything they say, like for example, I must watch the TV series they tell me to watch, and can't play games (even during my vacations), can't talk to my friends without them listening to the call and many more. I've even considered suicide as life really doesn't matter anymore for me. So if you guys know some quick and painless way to end all this, please let me know. Sorry you had to read through a lot and thanks in advance.
