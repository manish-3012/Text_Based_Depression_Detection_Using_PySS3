all ive been able to think about these past few weeks has been suicideum i guess heres the whole story
starting from late february-early march, ive been starving myself. i lost weight - a lot of it - in about 2 month, but 2 or 3 weeks ago i started binging like crazy. ever since then, i eat normally like 5 days out of 7. ive nver felt this bad, about myself, about my weight, about life itself. everything seems really pointless, and its all because im eating. all i can think about is how to kill myself, when to do it, where to do it. i'm still slightly underweight, but i cant even look at myself in the mirror without crying, usually followed by cutting.
ive been self-harming for about 3 years, last year i attempted suicide (by overdosing on prescription drugs) 7 times, this year, this past week actually, i tried twice, the first one not even making me sick, the second one being taken about an hour ago. im pretty sure this isn't going to do anything either, im hoping i at least throw up so i can get all the shit i ate out of my stomach, but, again, its not likely. 
i think about slitting my wrists, hanging myself, taking hundreds of pills all the time. i cross the street without looking, hoping i get hit by a car. ive stopped seeing my therapist, because she never helped, she didnt even prescribe me anything, she just 'assumed'. i want to die but at the same time i dont want to die fat. i dont know wha t to do, really, i just want to keep destroying myself little by little.
