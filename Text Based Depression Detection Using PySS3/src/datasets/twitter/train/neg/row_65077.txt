Can't do this anymore.I already have a date set, don't worry it's not soon or anything but it's comforting knowing that it's there and always an option. I'm running out of reasons to live, my therapist tells me that I have so much to live for as I'm still in high school and that I will have such a bright future but what I see about myself is the complete opposite. I know no matter how suicidal I am there's always a tiny piece of me that wants to live, I don't know how to explain to my therapist how heavily suicidal I really am. I constantly fear that I'm being replaced by my therapist and I can't take the fear anymore. I also don't want to bother him with my suicidal thoughts and gestures anymore.
