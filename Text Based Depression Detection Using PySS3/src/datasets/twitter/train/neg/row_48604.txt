Why canâ€™t I just dieI wish I was dead. I was having such a great month and then the depression came back. The thoughts are not going away...help me!!! They wonâ€™t leave me alone. Every time Iâ€™m driving I just want to turn into the other traffic to stop the numbness. To feel something. People die every day, why canâ€™t I?
