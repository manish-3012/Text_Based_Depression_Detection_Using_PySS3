I'm not depressed anymore.I'm now seven months sober, my life is stable and I got away from my hometown. I have a girlfriend who is very loyal and would do anything for me. I have stable, sober friends and a loving family. My life has improved in every way, to the extent that I don't really feel depressed anymore. Here's the catch, I still want to die. Even when I'm happy I think about it. I just don't see a point. My life as well as everyone else's, is ultimately pointless. Death would end any pain and anger and prevent me from future suffering, but it would also end and prevent anything "good". I'm stuck in purgatory in the fact that I don't see a point in living but I can't justify dying. I get excited whenever I see something on the news about nuclear tension or a new deadly outbreak of a disease, but nothing ever comes of it. Humans are the worst, most fuckered up invasive species in known existence. We are very good at killing and causing pain. Self awareness is the worst curse anything could have put on them. I wish I had been born a cat or a tree or something.
