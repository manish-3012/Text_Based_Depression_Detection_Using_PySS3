I just can't do it anymore.My entire life, I felt that it was okay that I suffered, because at least I was a relatively good person. I am not good at doing things or producing. I am not even really a good friend, but at least at least I wasn't evil or bad.

I am not a good person. I am disgusting, and I hate myself. I can't believe what has happened, and I can't live with it.

I really want to die, and be free of this suffering, but I don't deserve it. I deserve to live in anguish.

So instead of killing myself (which I might give up and do later), I have been thinking of some things I want to do/have happen to start a slow and painful death for myself. I am picking things that will cause suffering and pain with no pleasure, because I don't deserve that (so no drugs/alcohol, no overeating, no kinky BDSM sex)

I will not list them here, as explicit shit isn't welcome here (I completely get it). If you want to read it, it is posted [here](https://old.reddit.com/user/gross-a-throw-away/comments/8zfj51/ways_i_should_be_punished_graphic_depictions_of/?st=jjoua38x&amp;sh=e88e8946). Please be warned, it is really violent. I might add to it if I think of more.

Last night, my back had a major painful cramp. I woke up from the pain and almost vomited. That's a good start, but I have to find other ways to suffer, and I can't rely on my body to just do it for me. The more I suffer for my wrongdoings, the sooner I will feel comfortable letting myself die (and god, how amazing that would be).

Oh god, I wish I was dead so much. I really can't do this. I just can't. Is life suffering enough for me? ~~I don't think anything is enough punishment.~~
