Should I go to the hospital right now and tell them i want to kill myself?I'm at breaking point right now im so scared i dont know what to do, its 3am and everyone is asleep, I dont have my phone so I cant call anyone but I dont know what happens if I go to the hospital, will they section me? I'm over 18 but will they tell my parents? Will they make me have therapy or medication?
