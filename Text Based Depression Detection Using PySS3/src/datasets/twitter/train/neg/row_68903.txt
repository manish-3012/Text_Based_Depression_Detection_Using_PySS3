Last monthIn October I got laid off from the only job I was genuinely happy at, they outsourced my entire department and told us it was because we werenâ€™t working hard enough. 

A month later I found another job that actually paid better and I felt like I was going to turn this around. Instead I was slammed into a hell hole of over work insane expectations and gaslighting. Every day I would consider killing myself. One day I tried (posted here after!) and badly bruised my neck in the process, I went in to work the next day and no one noticed, I had a meeting with HR and told them I tried to kill myself, and they told me to hang on it would get better soon (It didnâ€™t) two weeks later I called in sick and didnâ€™t go to work ever again, I didnâ€™t need workers comp nothing was worth being at that awful awful place. They mailed me my final check and I did my best to hit the job market again. And then nothing.

Itâ€™s December and no ones hiring, Iâ€™m running out of money. (I should note I am a decently skilled office professional and I do my job very well but it is a niche) 

It January now and I just paid my last months rent. I am out of money. I apply for 10+ jobs a day, I only get callbacks from spam and people trying to get me into door to door sales. I have no support system and I am suicidally depressed on a good day, Iâ€™m off my meds and I canâ€™t start from rock bottom again.

Itâ€™s not worth it, Iâ€™ve lived plenty the worlds burning and thereâ€™s nothing left I want to do with my life.

I just want to log off of the server and go to sleep 

Iâ€™m so tired, I sleep for 12-16 hours and am awake mostly to keep a schedule at this point.

I miss being happy, I was making real progress and it feels like an eternity ago.

Stay Vigilant
 I love you
