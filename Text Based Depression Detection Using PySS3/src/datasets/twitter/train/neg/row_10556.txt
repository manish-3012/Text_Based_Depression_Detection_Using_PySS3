How can you live in a culture that doesnâ€™t want you to...?I donâ€™t have the energy to type out a full rant right now, but just...people say that killing yourself is bad, that you arenâ€™t allowed, but then they donâ€™t teach you the skills that you need to survive - â€˜itâ€™s not what you know but who you knowâ€™, etc etc. But what if I donâ€™t know anyone? Never learned how to? Does that just mean Iâ€™m not worthy enough to not get treated like shit while Iâ€™m working for a living?

I know I should be seeing a therapist, but thanks to glorious US healthcare I canâ€™t afford one while Iâ€™m out of work. And even if I did have insurance, Iâ€™m not likable enough to get anything more than a minimum wage shit-tier service job. God forbid I try to make money off of drawing or writing or something I like to do. 

How can I contribute if Iâ€™m just not allowed to? All Iâ€™m doing is just wasting resources right now; all of my friends just basically told me â€˜weâ€™re here if you want help but you have to want it firstâ€™, and...I donâ€™t know if I do anymore. Itâ€™s not going to fix any of my problems.

Iâ€™m just...not compatible with this society. Maybe if I blow my frigginâ€™ brains out the next person that comes aroundâ€™ll get a better stat roll than I did...
