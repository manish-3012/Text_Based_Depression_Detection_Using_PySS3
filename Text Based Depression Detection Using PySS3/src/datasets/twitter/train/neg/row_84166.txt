Iâ€™m crying myself to sleep tonightIâ€™ve officially lost all hope at this point

Iâ€™m 16m going on 17 have super bad anxiety think everyone hates me and lost motivation

My anxiety is always through the roof. I used to get breaks from it but its constantly present and degrading my mental state; I donâ€™t know a way I can remedy this

Iâ€™m convinced that my girlfriend actually dislikes talking to me at this point because half of the time I manage to find some way to tick her off. I donâ€™t even know Iâ€™m doing this sometimes because I just donâ€™t interpret what Iâ€™m saying is rude

Most of the people I used to talk to in my past Iâ€™ve negatively affected, and Iâ€™m beginning to think its happening to the people around me. I think this might be my anxiety speaking for me, but overall I think Iâ€™m just a depressing and uninteresting person to be around

The activities that I used to love doing have faded from my interest, usually Iâ€™m sitting at home doing pretty much nothing these days. I can hardly motivate myself to finish my school work which is bad; other times I donâ€™t eat much for days because Iâ€™m too fucked up to want to eat(probably why Iâ€™m 16, 6â€™, and weigh just over 120lbs) 

By the way I donâ€™t know if this matters but Iâ€™ve only told my gf and and a close friend about any of this; this is truly the first time that I have opened up about all of this. This is all probably just my anxiety fucking with my head but I canâ€™t control it anymore it gets worse by the day.

Is there anything I can do to change my mindset/how I operate that can change that makes my life more interesting; gives me the motivation to work; helps my anxiety; anything helps :)

If anyone just wants to be friends and talk Iâ€™ll be glad to do so Iâ€™ll slide my ## for ya
