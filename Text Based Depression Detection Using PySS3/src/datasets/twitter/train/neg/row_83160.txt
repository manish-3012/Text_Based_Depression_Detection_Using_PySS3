Wasted my teenage yearsI'll be 18 in less than 3 months and I feel like all my teenage years got so wasted by me hating myself, not having friends and just generally being in a dark place.


I still hate myself but now, I have awesome friends and try to push myself to like go out and shit but I really feel like from the age of 10 and up I didn't have a life. 


I feel so horribly unprepared to become an adult (which I guess does everyone) but I just think I missed out on so much experience during this time wasted it by staying in bed all day and wishing I was dead.
