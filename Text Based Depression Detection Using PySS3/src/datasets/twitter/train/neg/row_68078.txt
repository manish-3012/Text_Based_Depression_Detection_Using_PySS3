Im tiredIm so tired. I sleep all day. When im not sleeping im drinking or smoking. I used to care a lot about hygiene and laundry and skincare. I cant remember the last time i washed my face or did my laundry. My house is a wreck. Im in my last semester at college and flunking for the first time in my life. I was previously an A and occasionally a B student. I just cant get out of bed. Cleaning my apartment or even myself seems like too much. Im just so done. I feel numb. I dont even care im flunking, or that my place is a wreck. It feels like it wont matter anyways.
