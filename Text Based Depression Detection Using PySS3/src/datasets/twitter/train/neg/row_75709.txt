Iâ€™m so numbI canâ€™t take it any more, Iâ€™m not frustrated or angry or spiralling out of control. Iâ€™ve had those before. Iâ€™ve caught with severe mental illness all my life but now it just feels numb

I just want to leave, I want to go. Thereâ€™s no point.

I spent thousands of dollars to attend university for my passion, it was the only thing I ever wanted to do, I want to be a director or writer of live theatre. I got into a top school in the nation and now the whole industry is slammed shut.

My goal, the thing that kept me moving is gone

I just want it all to stop.
