I used to escape in my dreams.I used to be able to sleep off my suicidal thoughts, now I have nightmares until in my dreams I kill myself. After I kill myself I sleep like a baby. I really feel like it is a sign. My nightmares aren't bloody or scary, they are just fragments of my life, being pushed just a little farther to the edge. The best sleep I get is after dreams of hanging myself. 


 I'm hitting a pretty low spot in my life. I always thought things would get better after high school, then college came and things got worse, now I'm in real life mode and its all hitting the fan. I've failed professionally, romantically, socially, athletically and academically. I just can't take the pain any more, I feel like my dreams really do have the right idea.

I work in a seasonal area, virtually all of my friends are moving out of the area in a few weeks, I'm going to be more alone than ever.
