I'm not sure how I feel, but this was my journal entry from todayI'm tired of feeling less than. 

I'm tired of second guessing myself.

I feel like my emotional needs are not being met. I'm missing that in my life. I would just like some acknowledgment whenever I'm hurt or offended. Or rather, if I've tried to be emotionally supportive, some reciprocation would be appreciated. I'm tired of being perceived as awkward instead of a person. Maybe I'm more like my father than I think.

I'm tired of being strong and I feel like I don't belong.

I've thought of suicide every single day of 2020 and I honestly feel like my future is never going to amount to anything. I'm bleak and frustrated. The sad part is I really don't have anyone to talk to. I feel rushed and scared and I really don't know how to fix it.

Thank you God for listening to me. Thank you in advance for your guidance and grace.
