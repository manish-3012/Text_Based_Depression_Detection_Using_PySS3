HelloI hate to be a burden but I found this subreddit and really needed to post. I have friends who are on reddit so I worry about them finding this. This thread will be a confession thread as well.

* I've been or thought about suicide since a very young age. At least age 8 or younger. 

*Every day I think of ways to kill myself either the most painful (like torture) or quick and painless. Some of the worst one's involve stabbing myself over and over again throughout my whole body then saving the crucial area's for last. The painless would have to be either overdosing or starvation. 

* Everyday I "see" myself die. I guess it's either my imagination or some sort of mental issue I have. I literally see pictures or "video's" of my own death. Whether it's being ran over by a bus or car, a plane crashing into where I live, falling down the steps and breaking my neck or worse, Burned alive, buildings collapsing, bus's turning over and glass going through my neck. all of these happen.

* I have at least 2 known mental disabilities or disorders as well as one major physical one that makes me unable to work.

* I cannot find love

* I hate that I cant work

* I hate that I am short, big nosed, small D****, horrible hair, ugly feet, not- straight back, everything I hate about myself.

* I had a horrendous childhood. I don't want to post it on this thread because my friends would know it was me. Most of them know my story and my history.

I really don't know what I expect to get from posting here but I guess it might help me to get it out a little.
