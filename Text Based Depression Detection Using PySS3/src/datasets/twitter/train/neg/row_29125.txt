I Made A WhoopsieSo I cut myself. I've been doing it for years. I choose random parts on my body and dont go to deep. I do a lot of work with animals. Because of all this, it's gone fairly unnoticed. People will comment, but i usually brush it off with oh it was such and such. Or i just say I don't know. Well yesterday I was feeling crummy and wanted to cut myself. The issue was, on my left arm there are previous cuts that are still healing. It would look a little sketchy if another one appeared. So i cut my right arm. Holy Shit I went deep. Like surgical glue /stitches deep. Why am I posting this may you ask? Because i just wanted to tell someone that would understand that feeling. I have no one. Im all alone. I've pushed everyone away
