I don't know what the point is I can't do this anymoreEvery morning I wake up, REALLY wishing I didn't wake up. Everyday honestly feels SO difficult to get through to the point where I have almost no energy any longer. I cannot find pleasure in anything and the idea of having to do this any longer really makes me lose it. I am so scared to end my own life because I'm worried it won't work and I'll turn out even worse than I already am. I can't handle the loneliness, the isolation, the constant DEMAND to work day in and day out and make money just to pay bills just to feel this fucking awful all day long. No one truly cares about me and they only want to keep me here for their own selfish reasons. Why can't assisted suicide for mental health be legal? I have called crisis line multiple times daily recently and I'm just ready to overdose on fentanyl.

I don't know, I just needed to vent. I am scared to do it but I just want everything to be done and over. I just want to sleep peacefully, forever. Please ... I'm begging just make it all stop and put me out of my misery. I can't take it any longer.
