Sooner or later, iâ€™ll kill myself.I think Iâ€™m developing a serious hearing problem. My grandma is deaf, my mother is beginning to lose a bit of her hearing. I have a buzzing noise constantly playing in my head and itâ€™s been like this for almost a year now.

Iâ€™m a musician. This is all iâ€™ve got left.

I donâ€™t have friends anymore.

No girlfriend.

Iâ€™m just trying to be something other than this and I canâ€™t.

I want to be better, I want to go to college like a normal guy. I want to manage my drug use better. It seems all my hard work counts for very little.
