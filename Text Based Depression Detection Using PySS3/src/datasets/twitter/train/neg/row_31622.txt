Attempted suicide last night in a moment of passion. Going through with it again this Sunday in a more thoughtful manner.My attempt last night was a huge mistake. I'm still coughing up blood from the asphyxiation. Ordered an oxygen mask and will be picking up a helium tank sometime this week. 

It's going to be weird because I'm going to my therapist on Wednesday and I'm gonna lie to his face again. I'm also going to be volunteering at an elementary school and I'm so excited to help out with all the kids. It feels like a huge disconnect between the two parts of me. 

I can't wait to finally be dead. I don't know why I've lost all feelings of guilt. My mom will kill herself when she finds out, so I'm practically murdering her as well. I love her so much and it worries me that I just don't care anymore. I will not be a part of this world and I won't have to deal with the consequences of my actions anymore. 

I'm going to sleep so feel free not to comment as I probably won't reply. Also, I'm set in this decision and just organizing my thoughts, you will not be able to talk me out of this. I'm too much of a piece of shit to change my mind xd
