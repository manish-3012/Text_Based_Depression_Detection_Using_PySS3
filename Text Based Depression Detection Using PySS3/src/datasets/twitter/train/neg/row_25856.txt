I am 15 and I don't want to live anymore. Just tell me it gets better. Hi. I'm 15 years old, female. Since the age of 12, I have not been happy for longer than a few weeks at a time. I get so tired from the smallest things. I worry about everything. I am so depressed. I know people say that it's just teen angst, but I know it's something more. I never sleep. I stay up hours every night crying or just lying there, staring at the ceiling. Nothing helps.  

I am not happy like my peers. I try to act happy but it's all fake. Even if I feel happy on the surface, deep down it hurts.

I have incredibly loving friends and a boyfriend who is just awesome. He is so supportive and loving and I don't know what I would do without his sfriendship. That sounds unhealthy, but we've been friends since middle school and even if we weren't dating we'd still be best friends.  These are the only reasons I'm still here, because suicide would be too selfish. It would hurt them.


But I am starting to think that I will always be this way, since so many people have a lifetime of depression. I need to know there's a cure, a way to get rid of it. If this is how I'll always be, I don't want to exist. It's just not worth the effort.
