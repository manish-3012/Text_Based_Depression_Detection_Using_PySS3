Dramatic rantA lot of people on here have severe issues and mine can't even be compared to that. I have a loving family but some days i just want to cease to exist. My self hatred is slowly eating me up and i can't help but hate myself at all times. The constant feelings of worthlessness and hatred for myself are overbearing. On top of that, i'm socially retarded and have a shitty personality. I hate going to college and seeing everyone just so happy and normal when i barely have any friends, it gets so lonely and cold and monotonous. I feel like i'm stuck in purgatory, I know it's only 2 more years but I just don't see the point anymore. I feel like a waste of a space and disgusting in my own skin. My agoraphobia is getting worse and i just don't want people to see my face. 
I don't see the ultimate point of life, if we're all gonna die then why can't i just cease to exist rn?
