I have tomorrow offI bought pills and razor blades for some stupid reason two weeks ago when I was feeling really horrid. I came home in a good mood but for some reason everything came crashing down in a second.

I'm a HSP - I'm dealing heavily with dissociation; specifically derealisation. I don't know how to handle it. Everything is setting me on edge. I tried talking to my friends but they don't care. I dump so much energy into make sure my friends and family are feeling like they're loved and cared for and I've never felt that back
 Only by one person but they're my best friend - if I keep telling them this they'll just fucking leave like everyone else.

I don't understand why it is I'm such an unloveable person. I don't know why no one cares. I just want to die - I don't want to keep waking up and feeling nothing until I only feel anger and fear. I can't keep going on like this. I can't keep doing it. I know people would be upset but I feel they'd only be upset because it's such a violent change in life - not because people like me and they miss me. 

My parents only go around me because I'm their daughter. I don't bring anything to deserve love.

I just need this to stop. I genuinely cannot handle it anymore.
