I am watching a friend slowly descend into an inescapable place.....Hi all,
I myself do not have any suicidal or self harming thoughts but it literally breaks my heart to watch my friend tell me about how they how no will to live and that the only reason why they live is not for themselves, but rather because their friends and family want them to..... I need help reddit.... what do I do.... help me understand.... they blame themselves for the suicide of a loved one
