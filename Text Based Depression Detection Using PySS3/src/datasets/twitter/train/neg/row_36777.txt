Loneliness KillsI've been alone and unloved for 2 years now and over the last 2 years I think about offing myself, just so I won't feel this way anymore. I feel like this is the year, the day after Christmas or sometime in that following week and if it wasn't for the fact I have a job and obligations I would've done it already. I'm tired of people telling me don't give up, you'll find someone who loves you so don't bother telling me that. I just don't want to feel this way anymore, I'm tired of being alone every year around this time. 

My obligations are the only thing that keep me hanging on, and if I lose my job I'm doing it, the people I have to work with are some of the only people I talk to outside my very small group of friends who don't care about how I feel anymore. They don't care that I feel lonely every day and don't want to live anymore because of it
