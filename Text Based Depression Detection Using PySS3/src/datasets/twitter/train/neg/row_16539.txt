Would my parents really care?I'd like to think they would. But I don't know. I keep replaying them telling me that I'm a "disappointment" "mediocre" "gave them nothing to brag about". And a part of me wants to change that so badly. I wanna show them that I can give them more than enough to bring about. That I can pay them back for their sacrifice. 

But if I kill myself, would they care? It'd be a good thing for them. It'd be one less burden. One less mouth to feed. They wouldn't have to save up for my college. They could get that new house. It'd be one less person to worry about, to look out for. My brothers doing well, they could talk about him, and all he's doing. He's the first born anyway. 

My father and I were talking about me living a long time. I'm 19. And I told him "For all we know I might not make it past 30." He thought I was just saying that, but he didn't realize how heavy that sentence was. Honestly, I might kill myself before I'm 20. I just wonder, would they care? Or would I be the son who was too "weak". Too "fragile". Too "immature."
