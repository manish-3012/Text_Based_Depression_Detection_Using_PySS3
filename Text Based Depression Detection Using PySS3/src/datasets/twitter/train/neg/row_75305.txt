I hate so much when people (mainly my parents but I guess in general) try to tell me Iâ€™m â€œdoing fineâ€No, Iâ€™m a huge fuck up. I should be making way more than I currently am, but itâ€™s not just that. Itâ€™s just that I am more or less defective. And trying to tell me otherwise wonâ€™t make me buy it, sorry
