Can't deal with school, work, and depression at the same timeSo I recently moved to an apartment. I didn't know how I was going to afford it but I had no choice. My housing situation changed 2 weeks before school started and at that point there wasn't any housing left on campus or off campus. I work retail so I can afford water, electricity, insurance, etc. However, school loans pay for my rent for the most part. I had to sign for 13 months because that was the cheapest option and what I could afford. However, because of depression and work I haven't been able to do homework for the whole week and I've only gone to a class once. For that class, I have a test on Wednesday and haven't been able to to read any of the chapters either. I have 2 projects due this week (note, I'm on the quarter system so 3 classes=15 credits for me). I haven't been able to work on those either until yesterday (they're due today and tomorrow). The problem is I keep being scheduled at work during the time I'm free. Like today in the afternoon, my only time to work on the second project, I have work. And then Wednesday I have the test. I can't afford not going to school because I need the loan to pay for my rent. I can't afford cancelling my contracts because I don't have the money to pay for it, I can't afford not going to work because I need to pay the bills, and I can't afford not getting good grades because I need my scholarships. To make matters worse, I got an online therapist because I don't have time to see one in person and they just basically told me to kill myself because people who are manipulative don't kill themselves and people who are not, actually kill themselves. I don't know how to juggle everything. Work is so stressful I just go there and cry. I can't deal with life anymore.
