I'm scaredI don't want to die. I don't want to leave my family. I don't want to hurt anyone.

And even if I still live I still hurt people. I don't want that. Who wants to have a barely functional, selfish daughter? I'm hurting my family by existing. I'm dragging them down.

I'm scared that one day I might just snapp and kill myself. I don't want that, no I don't want that. I have attempted 2 times (where I actually did something instead of just standing there).

Both time I panicked and backed out. The last time was about 2 days ago, I tried hanging myself (again). I fell into daydreaming and I almost fell asleep? That's what it felt like at least.

But luckly my body reacted and threw me out of my daydreaming. My hands also reacted and oxygen rushed in. BAM I was suddenly so awake and realized what I just did.

I broke down and cried, a lot. I don't want to continue this life, but I don't want to lose my family.

I'm scared. I'm really scared.
