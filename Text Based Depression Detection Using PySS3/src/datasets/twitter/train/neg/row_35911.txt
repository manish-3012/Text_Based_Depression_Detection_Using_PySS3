Iâ€™m a failureIâ€™m a 28 year old male and I wasnâ€™t like this before. My mom gave me the talk: how Iâ€™m still getting taken to work. Where I should be driving and everything. I still donâ€™t have a driving license! Iâ€™ve been to college but itâ€™s been on and off through semesters. Finally, I have 5 classes left to graduate. HOW IM SO IRRESPONSIBLE!!!!  How so many people in my generation, have good careers and have everything and how Iâ€™m 28 and I still have no girlfriend etc. Iâ€™m fat and I should take care of my body more and watch my health. How Iâ€™m nobody in life and I should get my act togetheir. I feel how would life be if I kill myself. All my life, I kept to myself and Iâ€™ve been quite and shy.
