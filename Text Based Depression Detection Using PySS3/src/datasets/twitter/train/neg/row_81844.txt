Not sure what I'm looking for with thisHi All,

I've posted on here before, a while back.  Several months ago my symptoms came back hard core, in large part because of shit going on in life.  It keeps getting worse, and I'm to the point where I'm beyond just fantasizing about a suicide attempt, I'm starting to plan.  I told my therapist about it.  Probably won't tell my doctor so they actually give me the refills I want.  Not sure what I'm looking for by posting this.

Just wanted to put it out there.
