I'm 100% certain that I'm going to kill myselfI don't like the person who I've become. Just too much loser behavior for too long. Didn't give a fuck about my health at all. Used to smoke way too much. Who does that shit? Giving yourself cancer ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ Mom died too young and my abusive piece of shit dad helped me become the mess I am today. I remember at 17 I was so fucking motivated and wise, ready to make something of my life and filled with intrinsic motivation to be better than him.. And then he killed himself and I got an inheritance. I remember thinking to myself: I don't want this fucking money because I knew it would turn me into a sloth, but of course I just accepted it. Would coast through life without feeling the need to fight anymore. So until I was 27 I would just constantly smoke spliffs and cigarettes, only ate garbage and lived without any focus.

Last summer I woke up, became obsessive, filled with regrets. A tragic mess of a person. Would even whine to my ex about my failed life. She just mocked me and her insults kept repeating for 2 months. Fuck I'm pathetic. No coming back from this. I suck and I'm too weak. Time to end it. 

It sucks because my girlfriend is trying to save me, but I will send her my last money so she will have something better than my garbage personality.
