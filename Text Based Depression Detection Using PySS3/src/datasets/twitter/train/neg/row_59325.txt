I am becoming a manchildI'm 26 years old... At 19 I failed out of university. At 24 I dropped out of my second attempt at school, having spent 2.5 years in the program and borrowing 28k in student loans. 

At 25 I began working full time in a deadend job making ~38k. I still live at home and drive the same shitmobile I drove at 20. In addition to being a general failure at life, I also have the privilege of being a gambling addict and I've lost about ~30k to casinos over the years.

My friends have bought houses and gotten married. They've launched their careers and deal with problems far above my maturity level. 

There's nothing I've done "right" in life. I've given up everything I've ever attempted. My long time friends have begun to slowly drift away from me. 

Lately all I can think of is ways to kill myself. I've never felt this hopeless. I have no self respect, as I've done nothing to earn it. I feel as though my ability to change who I am is becoming all but impossible due to the fact that I'm getting older and my personality is cementing. 

I'm insecure as fuck about everything. I just lost my first girlfriend because my mood swings were so bad. I went from being a hard worker and respected at the workplace to being constantly late, and lazy to boot. I feel as though my life is played out. I no longer have hte mental resources to struggle through all the misery I've built for myself.
