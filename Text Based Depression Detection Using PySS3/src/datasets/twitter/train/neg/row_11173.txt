I hate my birthday. My life is looking darker as the years go byThis literally just came to mind Iâ€™m turning 20 in 2021(February)and I donâ€™t look forward to it. My first memory of me on my birthday was when I was 4 my parents took me to the movies to watch racing stripes, to be honest I was a mischievous child I wonâ€™t sit still and ran all over the cinema. My dad then grabbed my arm and pulled me out of the cinema yelling at me Iâ€™m crying, he then took me to the car and locked me inside and went back to finish the movie. Iâ€™m sitting in the car crying with no windows opened after we went home he â€œdisciplinedâ€ me. To this day I even remembered what he said â€œ I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s your birthday, I will plaster you against that wall (we had concrete walls)â€as Iâ€™m crying because of the belt marks on my back he screams â€œ donâ€™t you dare talk back to me I promise you, if you carry on you will die tonightâ€. My birthday this year all I wanted was to relax and watch T.V I couldnâ€™t even do that I spend the whole day doing my brotherâ€™s (15) project, not helping, DOING. None of my friends even called or texted me happy birthday(on my birthday in 2018 - last year of high school, the last time even heard from my friends no one even wished me and we all where ID cards that display our D.O.B), maybe because I wasn't one of the popular guys, I'm always the one getting left out. I actually found out my friend group had a group chat, I never even knew about it. On my birthday this year the whole day was filled with yelling, swearing and violence. I got so angry that I took it out on myself, and that alone just brought back memories of me self harming, I used to cut and burn myself I even tied fish tank tubing to a stick and whipped myself with it. Iâ€™m turning 20 next year I donâ€™t know where my life is going, I was meant to finish university next year instead I failed and repeating it, I just feel like I'm wasting everyones time and money. I have no determination or drive left, I'm just counting the days till my demons win. I honestly donâ€™t plan to live past 21
