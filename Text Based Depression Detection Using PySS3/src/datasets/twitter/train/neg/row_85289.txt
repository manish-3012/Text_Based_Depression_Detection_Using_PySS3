On the brinkI'm on the brink of snapping. I have no family, and my 2 last friends I've ended up pushing away. My boyfriend left me. I'm about to loss my house. I barely have money to eat. And I'm in debt. Killing myself feels like the only option. I don't know where else to go either. My doctor sends me to one place and they basically say I'm to crazy, get sent to another place to be told I'm not crazy enough. I don't know what to do any more.
