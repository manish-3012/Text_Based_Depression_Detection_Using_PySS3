Tomorrow might be the day i Dont have the motivation to keep going on , no matter how hard i work for making things better but at the end i am always a loser. I am tired of being made fun of and alone . I've never done anything in my life that i can be proud of . I failed every time  in a field of my passion . Everyone gets good grades and goes easily through school but me? All i see is failure at the end . People say that dont be afraid of failures and failures are one step closer to your destination But for me its a sign that i should give up and end this shitty life i have. Everyday i wake up in the morning and i really regret being alive.
I've got everything i need to do it so might just do it tomorrow .
Because this life is not worth living!
