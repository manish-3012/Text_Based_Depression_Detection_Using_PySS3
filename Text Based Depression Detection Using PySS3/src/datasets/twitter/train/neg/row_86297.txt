What do you do when all of the regular distractions stop working.For about two months now I haven't gone a single day where I haven't had some sort of suicidal thoughts. Before that they would only ever really come when I was feeling down or depressed but at some point it progressed to any time that I was alone with myself.

I could keep myself distracted by playing computer games, watching YouTube, watching movies, etc. But as soon as any of that stopped, my mind would drift back to those thoughts of suicide.

It's always the same, I think about my martial arts belt, I imagine how the noose is to be tied, and then everything else that follows. If it's not that, it might be on the same stretch of road that I drive looking at that same pole at the end of a nice long straight stretch. If it's not that it's looking at every single car that passes me going the other way.

Then it progressed to if I'm not actively trying to distract myself my mind would just snap back immediately to those thoughts. Like one of those stupid videos that loop automatically. Over and over.

Now it has progressed to the point where even as I'm trying to distract myself, I still have those thoughts rolling around in my head. It's like the little video is stuck on loop in another browser tab or something and never goes away. I can be in the middle of a conversation with someone and trying to pay attention but I just keep on thinking about it.

There have been so many events that just keep on chipping away at me. I honestly don't want to die but I just feel like I'm losing the battle. I'm not a religious man but I try and be spiritual. I just can't manage to convince myself that any of this matters.
