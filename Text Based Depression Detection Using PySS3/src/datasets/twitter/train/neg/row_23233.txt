I don't really know where to go from here.I'll try not to create a wall of text here... but anyhow here I go.
I've never been seriously "depressed" before. I don't know whether this is a mood swing caused by medication or not, but I don't know where to go besides here. I've been basically okay recently but just about three years ago I moved from where I grew up in a small town in Indiana and have really missed it ever since. Within those past years I have been on-and-off fighting (nothing abusive/physical) with my mother whom I love very much about stupid, little things. However, me being emotional, everything gets to me and drags me down a little more. I can happily say that I have never cut myself or actually attempted suicide, but I have hit/punched myself many times. I don't really know where to turn to. I have a lot of friends but my closest wouldn't take it seriously or I'm the one staying strong for them because they have gone through serious depression. I think I just need some encouragement and a place to start looking for help. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for any suggestions.
