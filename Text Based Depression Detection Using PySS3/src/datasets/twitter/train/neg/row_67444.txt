help.Recently, I broke up with my boyfriend. After a little while I began to talk to this girl (I've always thought I was bisexual but I had never brought it up to my parents). Soon, we were dating and I told my parents that I'm dating a girl. My dad has been pretty accepting of it, my mom has not. They're constantly saying what a bad influence she is on me, and she is not in any way. I love her very much and she cares so much about me. I know it. The reason that I'm typing this out on here is because I can't take this anymore. I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorders and depression and I've self harmed in the past. I've told my girlfriend everything that's been going on and she's really worried about me. My parents are ruining my life. They don't even admit to the fact they're causing my life to be a living hell. I'm not trying to be dramatic, that's how it feels though. I want to take these pills I have for anxiety (lexapro and zoloft) and I've researched them. Mixing them wouldn't kill me, but it would be enough to put me in the hospital. I want my parents to realize what they're doing to their own daughter. This seems like the only way, to overdose. I've attempted to tell them how I feel about them and they don't take ownership of how they make their own daughter feel. They make me want to kill myself, or hurt myself. I do not want to kill myself, trust me. But I don't know how else to show them they're hurting me this badly. I need some advice on my situation. I need to know if I did overdose, I would be admitted to inpatient, correct? I've never actually attempted suicide to put myself in the hospital. I'm not saying that I'm about to kill myself as I type this, but I've been constantly thinking about what would happen. Please help. Thank you.
