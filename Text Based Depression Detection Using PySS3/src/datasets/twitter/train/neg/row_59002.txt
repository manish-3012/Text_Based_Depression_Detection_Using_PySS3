overwhelmed with debt and depressionI havenâ€™t been this low in a long time. Iâ€™ve managed to avoid the suicidal thoughts for five years, but now theyâ€™re back and overwhelming me. 

I canâ€™t work because Iâ€™m disabled. Iâ€™m in the process of applying for disability but it takes a long time, and Iâ€™m drowning in debt. I had to drop out of school when I became disabled. I have loans to pay off but not even enough money to buy relatively healthy food. I lost my healthcare two months ago, too. Health bills are now starting to pile up too. And just today the apartment I just moved out of is trying to charge us 3k for cleaning because we left a couple pieces of furniture there. Couch, microwave, 2 small desks and a table. We were anticipating a 600$ general cleaning fee but not this... We couldnâ€™t afford a uhaul and had to take what we could in cars. $100 for changing a vent filter. Just insane charges like that for every tiny tiny thing. $150 for a cheap plastic folding table.

Iâ€™m rambling now and thatâ€™s what tends to happen when I get into this state of mind. My mind just keeps running through all of the awful things and it canâ€™t stop. Just one after the other until I canâ€™t think anymore.

My husband got a new job which pays better, but with the way all these unexpected charges keep getting thrown on I feel like weâ€™ll never escape this hole. I canâ€™t even help and thatâ€™s the worst part. I wish I could so badly, Iâ€™m just so useless and all I do is take up space and make life harder for everyone else. Iâ€™m just a walking medical bill dispenser. 

Iâ€™m so upset and Iâ€™m panicking and I want to live but what kind of life is this... I want to be happy and make others happy but all I do is cause stress and financial strain wherever I go. I canâ€™t keep on like this, it just isnâ€™t worth it. Iâ€™m not worth it. My bottle of panic attack meds are just right there and that would be so much easier and better for everyone if I just swallowed the whole thing. I hate myself so much. No matter what I try or what therapy I go to I never get better and I never will, especially now with this chronic debilitating illness I have. 

Iâ€™m just so done. Every time I feel like there might be a light at the end of this tunnel, I just fall back even deeper than I was before. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m just so damn tired of living.
