Feels like when, not ifI feel so hopeless, getting in for 10 years of being like this, cycles of hope and despair.

Spent a minute with a knife to my throat this morning, trying to drum up the courage, but backed out like a coward. Spend my lunch hour next to the river, thinking just how easily I can throw myself in, end my suffering.

I'm not going to ask why I shouldn't, i used to care about the damage if leave behind but over time I've come to see that they've never supported me when I needed them, but I was there for them. I'm tired of being everyone's rock and nobody giving a shit about issues I've mentioned. They just gloss over it, because they can't handle it, but I have to handle theirs, so no, they don't get a say anymore.

I also know that it will get better, but at this point I know it will come back around again, am I suppose to have kids and be like this? Worse than that, I know that kids of depressed parents are way more likely to have depressions than others, am I meant to pass this onto them?

The cycle ends when I die
