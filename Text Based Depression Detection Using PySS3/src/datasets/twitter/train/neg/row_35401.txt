Everything hurts.I just don't want to breathe anymore. I don't want to feel what I am feeling. I want to cut myself. Feel anything but this pain. I feel so weak and pathetic and I fucking loathe myself right now.

I want to go to sleep and never wake up. I never want to think or feel again. I want the lights to just turn off.

I don't know why I am writing this. I guess it's just because I can't tell anyone and I just needed to get it off my chest.

I have been crying all day. I have had three complete meltdowns and almost had an anxiety attack. can't eat, I can't sleep. The only thing keeping me from losing my mind is getting absorbed into work. And even then I feel it. I feel it like a migraine. Egging me and beating me.

I feel like someone is punching me in the chest, over and over.

Even just when I step outside to smoke I completely break down.

I am scared to go home. I am scared to be alone.
