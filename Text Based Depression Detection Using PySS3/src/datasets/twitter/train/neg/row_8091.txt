I am a burdenI feel kind of bad.. I've started isolating myself again..

I don't want to go to school. I feel like I've been getting farther and farther away from my friends. I don't deserve friends. They probably don't like me that much, despite how they act. If I disappeared, I don't think there would be that much of a reaction. I'll never be as funny, charming or witty as them.

I don't want to talk to my family anymore.. I just get reminded of how they could never accept me if I came out. They would be better off without their fat, stupid child. I'm sorry mom, I'm trying to lose weight so you won't be embarrassed of me anymore. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry im sorry im sorry i'll try to go longer without eating

They would be better off without me.
