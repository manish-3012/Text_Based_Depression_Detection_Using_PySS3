Iâ€™m stuckMy dad has depression/anxiety and I think I do too. Iâ€™ve wanted to just go to sleep and never wake up since 6th grade but I could never do it myself because Iâ€™m afraid that I would make my dad worse. My mom actually hated me and my sisters could care less about me. I wish I could just leave but I canâ€™t. Fuck My Life.
