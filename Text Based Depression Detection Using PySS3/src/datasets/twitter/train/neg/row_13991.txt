I don't know why I'm aliveI feel uncomfortable wherever I am. My home doesn't feel like a home. I've become more isolated, I don't hear from friends much anymore I think I'm too draining. I've never had a very good family relationship, my mother had a baby 4 years ago, I loved him to much and helped raise him and they've moved overseas. It's like treading deep water and not being a good swimmer. 

I take medication and see a psychologist, it's been 6 years since I started. I cant remember the last time I was happy for a longer period of time. I'm very aware that I'm pretty. It seems like the only contact I get is from people wanting to sleep with me. People who come to know me realise pretty quickly that I'm not what they had hoped. People who stay have been abusive. I've been sexually and emotionally abused in 3 different relationships. I reached out to a friend yesterday, she said it's too hard to talk to me about this now because I always seem to be in the same cycle.

 I go back to abusive people because they stay and i have no self worth. I feel desperately lonely. I tried talking to my sister, she said I'm not depressed, I'm just bored. 

I don't want to be alive anymore and I just feel like no one really cares. I've started sorting out my things and thinking about how I can do this with the least burden to everyine around me and make the transition easier. Sell my things, quit my job and break my lease. I've always wanted to be a good person I just don't think I can be.
