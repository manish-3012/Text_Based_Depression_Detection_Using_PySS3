so lameive felt so empty for like 4 days straight now i feel like feeling emotions would be better at this point . it just feels heavy like if u looked into my brain itd be really muffled tv static over thoughts of me dying lol

im sort of exhausted about that. plus the tiniest dumbest things make me tear up but i cant actually cry
