(Non emergency) Spam blockI am trying to make frequent posts but keep getting stopped by I assume Reddit. It says 'your posting too much please wait x minutes and then post again." Usually it is about 5-10 minutes. I feel this should be removed for this sub because minutes matter on some of these posts. 

Also tell me if this post is inappropriate for this sub and I will remove it.
