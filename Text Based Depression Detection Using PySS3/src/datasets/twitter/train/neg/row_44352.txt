It's not worth living at all.I have mental issues, never got diagnosed properly because where I live people just assume teenagers get really sad because they use too much technology. I did try to go to a local mental institute but all I got was a 5-minute pep talk and medicines that got me so sick I had to be bedded. I think I might have major depression, bipolar,PTSD, BPD, probably ADHD in childhood when I look back, just a month ago I was still struggling with sleep disorder, waking up from nightmares and hallucinating. My life is in ruin and it keeps getting worse. Somewhere along the line I developed a solid belief that I will never ever be happy, just mania episodes that force me to be high untill fatigue comes back. I should just end myself, but I'm so so scared, I really really want to die already.
