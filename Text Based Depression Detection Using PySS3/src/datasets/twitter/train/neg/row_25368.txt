I feel quite worthless and bad right nowI don't have anyone to contact and I'm planning on going to a ridge to jump off.

I have maybe one person I could contact but I feel like a burden.

I feel depressed all of the time, but today I feel it more than normal.
I think things would be better for everyone if I just did it - I would stop being a burden at least. 

I feel guilty for posting this, wasting other people's time, I don't deserve others effort. Others here have more valid reasons and deserve help.
