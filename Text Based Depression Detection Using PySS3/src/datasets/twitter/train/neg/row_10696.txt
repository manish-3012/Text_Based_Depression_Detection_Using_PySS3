anyone else get caught up on a note?Iâ€™ve been mentally unwell for about 15 yearsâ€”Iâ€™m medicated now but still frequently suicidal. Iâ€™ve made three serious, life-threatening attempts and a handful of half-hearted attempts over the years.

I feel like I frequently get caught up on the note. Iâ€™ve written a dozen of them and it never feels adequate, and then it never feels worth it at all â€” does this happen to anyone else? I feel like if I could just get through an adequate but not excessive, felt but not melodramatic explanation for the people whoâ€™d be upset, I could go through with it.
