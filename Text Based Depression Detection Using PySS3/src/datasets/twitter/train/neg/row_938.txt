I hate men so much they make me want to kill myselfI'm standard Barbie kinda hot. I have two Masters degrees and an amazing career that no one seems to give a fuck about. The way men approach me is ALWAYS fucking ALWAYS seductive. I am a prey. I live in danger of being looked at and touched without my consent. 
Months ago these behaviours started to really oppress me and I didn't feel safe in many places. I stopped putting on make up, stopped wearing skirts and dresses. 
But last week end was too much. Someone slipped something in my drink at the club and I miraculously escaped and fainted in a taxi that took me to the hospital. 
The next morning, I cut all my hair - 25cm.

I don't want to do all this. I don't want to live in fear. I want to look at myself in the mirror and think I'm beautiful. It's so unfair that I have to look neglected in order to be left alone.

Men I've been in relationships with cheated on me, lied to me, used me.

I think I don't want to live in this world. It's a never-ending battle against men and I will always lose.
