Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide lately but not in the way you thinkMy whole life Iâ€™ve struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts. It started young, and lately, no I havenâ€™t been wanting to die. Iâ€™ve been thinking about my past suicidal thoughts and behavior. The way I felt, and what I wanted to do because I was feeling whatever type of way. And it makes me very sad. And I think what Iâ€™m most afraid of now is repeating the same cycles, feeling that type of pain again, and not coming back from it; doing it. 
Iâ€™ve been realizing that my mental health causes me to ignore, try to forget, certain things. It can be a song, a tv show, a book. If I know itâ€™ll make me â€œfeelâ€ anything I tend to try to ignore it. Probably why I canâ€™t finish a movie or a book or a show, sometimes a song or album. And I just.. go on social media and aimlessly scroll. Which doesnâ€™t really trigger much emotion in me, I just do it to do it. 
I always tend to imagine myself in other peopleâ€™s situations and feel the way they feel. I think thatâ€™s what an Empath is. I tend to hurt my own feelings with unreal scenarios in my head. And I tend to be a little too deep into philosophy and deep thought that really makes me question everything.
Itâ€™s easy for me to find something to be sad about, but I donâ€™t think I can help it. 
And no one gets it...really. 
Thatâ€™s it for now
