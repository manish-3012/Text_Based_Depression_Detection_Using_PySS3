What is there left to do when you realize the only â€œfriendsâ€ youâ€™ve got are out of pityI figured out some people keep in touch with me just because either my family or SO tell them to. I canâ€™t deal with that. I feel awful. Am I supposed to start all over? Iâ€™m pretty sure theyâ€™ll ignore any requests of staying away and just manipulate my social life anyway.

Iâ€™m sick of being lied to.
