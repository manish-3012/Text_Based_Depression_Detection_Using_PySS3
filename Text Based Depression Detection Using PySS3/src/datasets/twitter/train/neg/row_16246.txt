I feel like I can't figure things out anymore.I went on anxiety medication and I've been on it for two months, and what I think is getting better is my ability to go through the motions of life that I didn't want to do before. Physically I feel better, I've been running and eating healthier and taking an interest again in my appearance and my health, but I still don't feel right. I'm still really angry all the time and I'm still suicidal, but since I started the medication I'm absolutely terrified of dying. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing - right now it keeps me from attempting suicide but I can't really be sure in the long run. 

I've also developed stomach problems that so far haven't been diagnosed. I've seen a gastroenterologist and about 3 other doctors for a while now and nothing. My stomach hurts all the time regardless of what I eat. I've tried everything in the book and multiple medications. It just seems crazy that this problem could be going on for so long. 

I just don't know what to do. I really don't have anyone I can talk to about this. My parents have already told me that they don't approve of me being on anxiety medication and they've already told me how they think anxiety disorders are bullshit. My husband has only been angry with me recently because I've been isolating myself from everyone. I only have one friend who I haven't spoken to in nearly a month. I don't really know who to turn to I guess. 

Thanks for listening to me rant. If anyone can talk with me that would be great.
