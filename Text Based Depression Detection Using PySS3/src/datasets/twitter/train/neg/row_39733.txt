Dealing with aftermath of best friend's suicideOh god jesus fuck me.

I found the corpse of my best friend in late April. There were 10 or so friends in the house with me at the time. We were watching tv in the lounge - he hung himself in his bedroom right next door and we never heard a thing.

When I saw what he had done, it was like a meltdown in my head, I felt as if my neuro tissue, synapses, everything just snapped and I was screaming, like a tidal wave had ripped through my body and tore every fibre of me apart.

7 months on and I am depressed as hell and feeling alone. Due to the wide impact, in that all my friends were present on that night and suffered trauma as well, there isn't anyone I can rely on for support. I've just been suppressing it, managing the best I can - I'm in a very high-pressure postgrad programme this year and I simply haven't had the option to fall over and cry.

I don't sleep, I'm angry, weepy, cold, I can't talk, I talk too much... The weirdest thing is that the trauma seems to have morphed into a self-loathing and depression. I'm paranoid, anxious, easily distraught. I feel completely alone.

I keep thinking of following him and killing myself too. But what if that sparks a suicide cluster? Everything is so fucked.

I feel like I'll never be the same again - like this has disturbed me for years and years to come.
