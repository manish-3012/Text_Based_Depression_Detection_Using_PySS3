Girlfriend is the only reason I cant do itI am an 18 year old male. I am currently home from my state university because of my poor grades and squandered potential. I am in legal trouble for two alcohol related charges and cannot afford good lawyers with my current job. Last night, while in an argument with my mother my step-dad pinned me against a wall and punched me in the face several times. This was the final straw, and I am now living with one of my friends until I find another place to stay. I have always suffered from mild depression, but now more than ever I consider suicide a way out. 
The only thing about life that truly makes me happy is thinking about my girlfriend. She is the only thing in my life that I truly enjoy. A few years ago while in high school, her father hung himself due to financial issues. I know that if I were to take my life it would destroy her and cause her to relive the death of her father. In a few weeks she will be returning to school as I continue working about an hour away from her. Hopefully I can go back to school come January, but I fear that I will not last that long away from her and away from my friends. My problems are fixable but I have such little desire to take action on them and find myself sad almost all the time.
