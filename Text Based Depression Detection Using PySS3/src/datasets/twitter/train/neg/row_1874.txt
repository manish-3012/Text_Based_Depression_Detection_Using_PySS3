It hurts physically but no one still takes me seriously : (It hurts in my chest, it hurts physically. Iâ€™m so sick of living like this, Iâ€™m such a wreck, I just wish the pain could end once and for all, Iâ€™m so sick of living like this every single day. I would do anything for the pain to end, I beg for help but no one sees it, my dad destroyed eyes they just look away. I havenâ€™t found enjoyment in life in years, I just want to enjoy it, even for just a day.
