Todayâ€™s the day.I canâ€™t do this anymore. I canâ€™t be in pain anymore. It has been never ending. It will never go away. My life has been one tragedy and trauma after another. I am tired. My soul is tired. I give up. Today is the day. I just need to prepare everything and then itâ€™s over. I feel at peace knowing i wont be in pain anymore.
