I almost just killed myself.I have been going through so much lately. I have been feeling like shit all day. I would feel sluggish and the anxious, and then depressed and then angry all with in a matter of minutes. It feels like I'm getting off drugs or something. I was sitting here in my bed and I was like "I should just kill myself" I grabbed a blade and I just put it to my wrist. I didn't move it. But my thoughts shifted so much to how it would affect people. I didn't do it. I didn't even cut. I just feel like shit now. I'm scared.
