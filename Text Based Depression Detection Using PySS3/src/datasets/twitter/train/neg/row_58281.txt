Honest, not sure what I want anymore...So I found work, so I accomplished my goal of working in the big city, so I am earning money...so what?  Still living in this shithole, near narcesstic people, paying all the bills with not much left, no proper lifestyle, feeling very much alone in my battle. I see loved ones die left and right. What does it all mean anyways. I don't see a future for myself anymore.  Sometimes it's just a little too late given my surrounding conditions. I'm okay with dying because I'm already dead inside. I wish I was dead instead of seeing people avoid me, laugh and hate on me because of my genetic illness and social awkwardness. I wish I could find happiness again. I'm not the brightest because of the way I was raised at home, but I feel i had tried my best at overcoming numerous struggles thrown at me because of it. No regrets. I'm proud of myself that I found work now and I know I'll do my best in this position but i have a gut feeling it's just a matter of time before I will meet my death. Till then, I'm currently at peace with myself and feel like I accomplished and persevered a lot more than what some other person in my shoes would have given all these struggles due to circumstances. This I am happy about. Some days i wonder why I'm still even alive, given someone else they would have gone crazy or killed themselves perhaps. Another night depressed thinking about life and my future, what to do the next day...or the next year if i can make it until then.
