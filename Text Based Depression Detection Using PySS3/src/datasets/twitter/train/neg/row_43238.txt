GoodbyeAfter many years of putting it off I finally feel able to kill myself I feel a peace over me that Iâ€™ve never felt before Iâ€™ve deleted all social media and blocked all numbers I want my corpse to rot in silence until someone comes across what I was Iâ€™ve know this day would come Iâ€™ve fucked up every friendship Iâ€™ve had Iâ€™m a bitch I have no backbone or confidence so I think taking me off the field would be best at this point I just wanted some type of immortalizing post that someone can look back on and say wow that guy sucked
