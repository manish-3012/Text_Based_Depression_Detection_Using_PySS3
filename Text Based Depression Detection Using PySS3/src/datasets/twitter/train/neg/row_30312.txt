Iâ€™m 25 and have two suicide attempts under my belt. Iâ€™ve been this way for as long as I can remember and donâ€™t understand why.I have a good life. An education, a job, a loving family, a good hearted partner, and a lot of â€œpotentialâ€. But for as long as I remember Iâ€™ve always played with thoughts of suicide. For context, one time while talking to my mom, I told her that suicide has always been â€œon the shelfâ€ in my brain. And more frequently than I care to admit, I stare at it. Contemplating taking it doing again. She asked me how we can go about removing it from the â€œshelfâ€, in other words, making it not an option. I was quiet for a bit and told her it will always be on the shelf. The best I feel I can hope for is that it becomes dusty and forgotten. 

My first attempt was at 14, unknown to anyone. My second was at 16 and I was in the hospital for a week. I describe the feeling as ... nothingness or a hole or pit that you fall into sometimes, more than youâ€™d like,  and itâ€™s suffocating and you canâ€™t get out. And for as long as I can remember itâ€™s always been there. And I donâ€™t know why. I have all the mechanisms and factors in my life that â€œshouldâ€ result in happiness and healthiness. And I still dream about the day Iâ€™ll have the gumption to go through with it all. I still dream and I donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t appreciate what I have. I donâ€™t know why I donâ€™t want to be here.
