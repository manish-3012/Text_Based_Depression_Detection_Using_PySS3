I need to go to the hospital but I don't want to tell my parentsI feel like slitting my wrists right now. My best friend and I kissed, but now they are distancing themselves from me and I feel like our friendship is ruined because of it. They were the only thing keeping me from killing myself and now they don't want to deal with me. I know I should go to the hospital, but I don't want to have that conversation with my parents.
