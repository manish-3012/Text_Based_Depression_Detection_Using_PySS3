This isn't livingi havent killed myself because i dont want to hurt my friends or family but i hate feeling like this and i hate being in constant pain. this doesnt feel right. i cant breath. i cant eat. all i do is sleep. i only ever dream about killing myself. i feel trapped and stagnant and i am so close to suffocating myself. every time i wake up im disappointed. i hate this and i hate myself and i cant truly put it into words, but i know its close to the end for me if i stay on this track. i dont know what to do anymore
