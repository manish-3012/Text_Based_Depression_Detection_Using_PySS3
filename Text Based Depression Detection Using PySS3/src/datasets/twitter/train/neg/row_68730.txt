I'm completely incapable of having a future, so I have no reason to existI will be 20 years old this April, and I have been socially isolated for over four years, no school, no jobs, just being in my home, where I'm pretty much miserable at this point. 
I live with my dad, older sister and her boyfriend, and that's all the people I meet, with exceptions of my mom and other sister occasionally. Besides that, I know no one, I have no friends, and no other family.
I have extreme anxiety when it comes to doing anything outside of my bubble (Like right now I have to go to the dentist, because I broke a tooth, and I pretty much want to overdose on morphine to calm my nerves), which is part because of my Aspergers, but has only gotten worse because of the isolation. (and I think I have a plethora of other issues because of being isolated for so long.)

I also have terrible chronic pain in my entire body, that keeps getting worse and worse, and no doctor has been able to figure out what it is. It's pretty much unbearable at this point, and no pain medication, or other types of pain relief works.
So I am basically imprisoned in my own body.

I think about suicide a lot, about how I will never have to go through any more pain or anxiety. 

It's a nice thought.
