Permanent brain damage from overdose?So about a week ago I was having a really bad time with life. I decided to try to kill myself. I have (had) a prescription for ativan. I took ~12mg and also drank 3 mikes hard lemonades. I remember finishing the last mike, and next thing I remember was being in the hospital. From what I gathered from my family and boyfriend is that I ODed around 2pm and was found around 4:30pm. Apparently I was somewhat unresponsive when I was found in the woods and I had almost aspirated on my own vomit. Apparently I had my stomach pumped as well.

Anyways, after I woke up in the hospital, I had really bad brain fog, was hallucinating, and had just about zero sense of balance and coordination. It has now been 8 days since my overdose, and I am still having issues with my memory, hallucinations, and coordination and balance. Does anyone know if taking that much ativan mixed with alcohol can cause brain/CNS damage? Are these effects temporary or permanent? I was not told much at the hospital. My mom was the only one allowed to visit me and she isn't a very reliable source (she's a little unstable)
