im not going to commit suicide but hear me outI'm a man in my early 20s. I haven't gone to college yet. I did very poorly in high school. I jerked off and played video games instead of studying. I probably would have trouble even writing a 5 page essay. I've never had a girlfriend in my entire life. I have aspergers and I get massive social anxiety pretty often. Even my total loser friends are more cool than I am. I work with white trash assholes that treat me like crap. I don't get enough sleep anymore. I'm too logical and analytical to make a bunch of friends. First world problems.
