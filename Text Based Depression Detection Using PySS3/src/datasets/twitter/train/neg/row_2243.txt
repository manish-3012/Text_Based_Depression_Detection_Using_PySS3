From a "not quite, but almost"A few weeks ago, I was planning to kill myself. The plan was very, very firmly implanted in my mind, and had been for the better part of a year. About a week ago, those thoughts began to subside for the first time I can remember. Today, I decided that I was mentally okay enough to get a little high and get in touch with myself. One of the biggest takeaways that I can share, from my own perspective (in the vein of, "none of us matter and everything we know and everything we are is essentially going to be cosmic dust in the wind") is if nothing matters, then we're only as meaningless as everything else is. Maybe it's amazing to be living in some fraction of a second in the lifespan of the universe, when we could just as well not be here. But for this infinitesimally small frame of space and time, our existence does matter. It does hold value. I hope that maybe the journey of discovering yourself is enough to keep you here for a little while.
