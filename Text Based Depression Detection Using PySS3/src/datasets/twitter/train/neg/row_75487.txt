Pretty much the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my parentsHey guys,

I recently came to a rather disturbing realization - the only thing stopping me from killing myself is my parents. They are amazing people who poured everything into raising the person I am today - good for them. 

I have been thinking about killing myself for a couple months now. The more I think about it, the more I realize that my parents don't deserve this. The pain of knowing they their only child committed suicide far outweighs my desire to actually follow through with it. 

I'm currently 24, I'm a fucking failure as a human being, and that is no exaggeration. I have no motivation, I have no passion, just nothing. I'm in law school but every day I feel like I'm too fucking stupid to do this shit. I can't even bring myself to go to class even though my parents pay absurdly high amounts of money for this shit. My personality is garbage - I'm a complete narcissist and almost all my behavior stems from wanting to "prove" something about myself. As if anything I say or do is like another puzzle piece to add onto this image I want to construct of myself. I'm so unbelievably insecure, incompetent, and unmotivated. 

Pretty much just posting on here just to vent - obviously I can't say this shit to my real life friends. I think about killing myself pretty much everyday - it's almost like a feeling of relief to me when I fantasize about putting a bullet through my brain.

My parents are currently 60. My mom's going through a lot, realistically, she's gong to be out within 10 years. My dad's a healthy dude overall, physically and emotionally, but he smokes - I don't see him going past 75. It's a shitty, shitty situation to think about. I love them more than anything in the world, so I'll ride this shit out for another 10-20 years if necessary.

Anyways, it is what it is. Don't know where else to post this. Just needed to vent. 

I hope everyone's having a great Saturday so far. :)
