Goodbye.I have no one else to send or say this to since the only people I care about no longer care about me and probably wouldn't read this anyway.

I'm so sorry. To everyone. I'm sorry for being sick. I'm sorry that because of my illnesses I've been unkind. I'm sorry if I made you feel neglected. I'm sorry that I've been a burden on you for as long as I have been. I am so sorry. To my dog, I love you so much. You were the only one that was keeping me going. Please don't cry for me, or wait for me at the door. I love you and I know we'll see each other again. I hope you all can forgive me.

I have purchased my ticket, and I will be leaving in the morning. You will never have to hear from me, or see me again. I am sorry that I couldn't be anything.

Gone to heaven, safe forever.
