I don't care anymore what my death would mean to others.Today I went to the funeral of my uncle. I saw how my whole family was sad about his death. He was a beloved men and many tears where shed. However during the whole funeral I had just one though in my mind. What if it was my funeral? Could I really kill my self if my family would be in so much pain because of it? I realized that it doesn't matter anymore to me. It has always been the one reason why I've been waiting so long to do it. This realisation sparks some sort of happiness in me. I no longer fear the consequences.
