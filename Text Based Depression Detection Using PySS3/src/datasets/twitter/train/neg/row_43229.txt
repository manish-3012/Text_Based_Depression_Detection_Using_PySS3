Why should I assume that it's going to get better when it hasn't for the past like 4 years?I have absolutely nothing to live for, and each day is actually a negative drain on me. I continue feeling unhappy with absolutely zero good moments. When the few okayish moments do happen, they're immediately met with further useless shit.

I'm currently in the middle of applying to college and the whole process has made me super suicidal. It's well known that Computer Science is relatively well paying regardless of the prestige of the college, and that prestige rarely makes a difference in terms of your salary, but my parents refuse to believe this.

I actually want to end my fucking life. I just plan on sleeping as much as I can to escape this shitty world, because it's horrible and I sure as hell don't believe it's going to get better in the future. I know it won't.
