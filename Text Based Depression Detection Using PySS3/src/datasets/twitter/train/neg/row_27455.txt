I need help.I've had depression for years now. It's gotten progressively worse, and I'm afraid I've finally reached my breaking point. My fiance left me, and I can't blame her. But now I have nobody, and no plans. 

I call the hotlines, and they ask me what I want to accomplish, and what I want from life. And my answer is the same. Nothing. Nothing sounds appealing. If I won a billion dollars, I'd still feel stale, empty.

I don't have insurance, so I can't get medicine or help. I feel like I've run out of excuses to put the gun down. I can't wake up to another day. I just can't. I reach out to people, but nobody notices, or tries to help. Everyone is moving at a pace I can't keep up with. 

I'm stuck in a cold dead town in Indiana. The only jobs are in menial dead end factories. I have no neighbors, and there are few activities besides drinking. My home, if you can call it that, is falling apart around me. I'm just so alone and useless.

What do I do? Where do I start? Or is it finally time to go to sleep one last time?
