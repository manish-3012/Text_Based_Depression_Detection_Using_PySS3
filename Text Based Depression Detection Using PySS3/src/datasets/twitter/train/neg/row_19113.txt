I am confused.I don't have depression. I am not sad most of the time. The underlying issue arises when I start to think about our existence. I don't believe in God and I believe that I see through a lot of the BS that goes on. A lot of things, especially in America go unchecked. Nobody comes to make regular visits to job sites to check for OSHA violations, and corporate greed is getting harder and harder to ignore for myself personally. I worked two twelve hour shifts in our 36 hours of being open at our outlet mall, and got picked up in an overflow lot a half mile away from my store front. I waited with my friend from a different store for the shuttle and when the bus never came we walked the rest of the way in the pouring rain to the lot. My fiance and best friend day that I have a lot of good ideas and philosophies to make the world a better place. But I also think that people are just going to do what they want to do, and that's that. Nothing that I can say or do will convince people to change or to be better. I feel like I'm screaming into the void. 
My brain isn't attacking itself because of events in my life, it's attacking itself because I'm slowly giving up on making the world a better place for our kids to grow up in. I just want to end it all now so that I don't have to go through the pain and stress of how modern society works if I'm just going to die doing nothing of meaning except being a doormat for people with more money than I have. I'm sick of money, I'm tired of greed. 

I want change.
