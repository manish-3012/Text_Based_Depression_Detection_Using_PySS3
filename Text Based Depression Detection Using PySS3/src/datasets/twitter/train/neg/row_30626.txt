You can't be a happy adult when you had a traumatic childhoodMy childhood was robbed in everywhere. By family, friends, bullies, everyone in my community didn't care

I am also a monster

I should kill myself because all I do is fail people and fuck up

The world is better off without me and I never do anything right anyways

People with BPD like me shouldn't exist

Peace
