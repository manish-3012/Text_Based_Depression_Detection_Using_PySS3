Suicidal episodesI really don't know why, but sometimes I get these "Do it right now" attacks. I get that weird body tremor similar to when you do stunts. Life begins to flash before my eyes and it literally feels like something is forcing me to kill myself. It's like there's something behind me that is squeezing my shoulders and "eating" my mind.
