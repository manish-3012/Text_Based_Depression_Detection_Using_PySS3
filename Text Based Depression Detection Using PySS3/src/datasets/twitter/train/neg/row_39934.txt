Friend may be suicidal, need helpA friend of mine is threatening suicide saying things like "I wish I had the courage to kill myself" and similar statements. She is a 16 year old female. She has had extreme depression (or at least acted depressed, I think she may be faking it/making herself depressed for attention, but I don't want to take any chances) for about 8 months. It may have been brought on by a breakup she had or hormones and teenage angst or both. Another possible cause is the false way she thinks others see her. She has a stable, loving family life. She says the impetus for committing suicide would be because "no one cares about her", a statement that is completely false, she has many friends. Every time I or another friend tries to talk her out of it and say we care about her she just loops it back around to the whole "no one cares" thing. I don't want her to commit suicide, so any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. If anyone wants more details I will provide them.
