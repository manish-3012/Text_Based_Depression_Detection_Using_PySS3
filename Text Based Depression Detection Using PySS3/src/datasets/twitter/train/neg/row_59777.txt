I'm a complete failure as a manThis may be my last post for either a while or ever. I don't know which yet but if you do see me post again it won't be for some time. I pray I never have to post here again but who knows. Over the last few days I have been taking inventory of my life and I am a complete and utter failure.  I can't hold down a job. I can't get a girlfriend. I am 31 and still a virgin and yes I have thought about hiring an escort but I don't have money and when I think I am desperate enough I get weirded out by it. I have nothing to offer anyone anymore. I am just an awful waste of space. This weekend I will finalize my plans to end my so called life and move on to whatever lies beyond. I have always liked the idea of reincarnation but if I have to go through this again I will keep ending my life until whatever God is understands that he will owe me more than he or she can afford if there is a god. You know being an alcoholic isn't always so bad at least, I would feel when I wanted to. But even then I was cursed with remembering everything I did completely shitfaced.  I am just so fucking done with this bullshit lie that is life
