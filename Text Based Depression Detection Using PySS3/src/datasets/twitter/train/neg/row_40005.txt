I think I'm just gonna say fuck it and kill myself.I'm about to lose my damn mind. 
I can't fucking take it. I'm doing everything I can not to just lose my shit and break down. Nothing is real. I don't feel alive. Depersonalization is a mother fucking nightmare. When I was younger I thought it was cool. I felt like a character in a movie and I could do anything but now it occurs so often. Nearly every day and it lasts for so long. It used to last 30 minutes max but now once it hits it will last a minimum of 2 hours and will go for several hours sometimes even throughout the entire day. 

I just want to blow my brains over the wall or go outside cut the tire swing down tie a noose and hang myself. I seriously can't take this anymore. Life was getting better. Then it all just went straight to shit again. I'm seriously ready to give up. Life is full of ups and downs but the very few times I see an up just isn't worth all the downs. 

I'm 16 male. I feel bad for killing myself two days before school ends for summer but I can't do this. The second my family is sound asleep in bed I'm cutting the tire off the rope tying a noose climbing 15 feet up the tree and jumping off the limb and deccapitating myself. The drop will be enough to rip my head off so I can't fail.
