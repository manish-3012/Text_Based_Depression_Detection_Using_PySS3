2019 will be the year I die.I keep saying I'm not suicidal but I'm fucking lying. I'm suicidal to the point I've lost all empathy to keep living, and I fantasize about how badly I can hurt my family and friends I have left before I go. I'm virtually a self-destructing sociopath at this point, so what's the point of trying to save myself when I'm so far gone?

I finally have a therapist that validates me that I've been able to trust with both bullying as well as sexual abuse I suffered as a kid, as well as my own urges to physically and sexually assault everyone around me, which is why I isolate myself as much as possible.

I'm a delirious madman and a shallow husk of the person I wanted to be rather than the monster I am now.

Lots of you are probably depressed and think you're a shitty person, but chances are you don't think of hundreds of ways to murder and rape people like I do. I do it daily. I'm so fucking alienated it's all I can think about for people. I hate people. I don't even feel like I'm a person anymore. Just a depraved ghoul, becoming more like that by the day.

This isn't a situation where life is capable of getting better at all. It's a terminal downwards spiral into it getting worse and worse, and further into insanity.

Why do I still have any faint sense of hope. I want to just snuff out those last embers of light already. The light is a goddamn illusion and the embracing of oblivion is the only thing that's real. To exist is a game of self-delusion until you can't tolerate life anymore. The fact that life even exists to begin with is a tragic mistake.

The last remnant of the good person I was before I let myself become a complete piece of shit wants me to kill myself before I hurt anyone outside my remaining friends and family.
