does anybody even care?i've probably fucked up my relationship with the one person i can reach out to, even if i haven't, i don't know how to tell him i'm not okay without sounding pathetic. my parents, rest of my friends don't give 2 shits about me. i feel so alone. i doubt i'll make it another year like this.
