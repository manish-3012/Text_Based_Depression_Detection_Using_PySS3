Iâ€™m actually so sick of being aliveI donâ€™t want to physically kill myself but I wish someone or something else would do it for me just so there could be a different stigma while I still reach the same end goal. Iâ€™ve been so stressed so much in the last year in particular and itâ€™s gotten to a point where I donâ€™t think I even understand myself at all anymore. I reach literal points where just thinking about having to be alive for the next couple of hours and days and weeks stresses me out even more and I feel trapped in this inescapable time of having to be alive and go through the pain of life. Iâ€™ve never talked to anyone in my life about the feelings of depression and suicide Iâ€™ve been feeling to different extents for over five years now and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be able to talk to someone in person about it which makes me feel like itâ€™s just a matter of time until I purposefully get myself into a situation that gets me killed. I almost want that to happen. 

I know I canâ€™t actually kill myself by my own hand because I promised I wouldnâ€™t do that for the sake of my mom, dad, and sister. And while thatâ€™s probably the actual ONLY reason Iâ€™m still alive itâ€™s almost painful how it locks me into this life when sometimes I just hate being in it. I feel so stuck. I feel like the only way I can ever vent these pains and feelings is hurting myself or making myself bleed. 

Thatâ€™s all my brain can think of ranting about for now. Thanks for listening
