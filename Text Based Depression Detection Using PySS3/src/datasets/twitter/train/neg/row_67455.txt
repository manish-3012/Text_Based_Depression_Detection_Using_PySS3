I feel lost, I want to leave.My grandma, who was my best friend and second mother passed away in September. I didn't even get to say goodbye. My grandpa is sad and alone now while I'm hours away at university. 

I was raped last week. By someone who I thought was my friend. 

I think my relationship with my boyfriend of 4 and a half years is going to shit. 

This guy I thought I connected with just ghosted me even though I confided in him and thought he was supportive. 

I lost so many friends these few weeks especially after the rape because they think it's my fault. 

I've been depressed for years. I had an attempt to years ago and after that I was supposed to do better. This year was supposed to be better. And nothing is going right. 

I'm at the point that I don't even care about how my family will feel. I don't feel guilt like I used to. They'll get over it. I'm just sick of being here. 

I'm taking antidepressants, an antianxiety/psychotic. I go to my classes, I see people, I go to my wrestling practices... I do everything I'm supposed to but nothing feels right.
