I'm going to flunk out of collegeFailed all my classes last semester and am going to do so again this semester by the looks of it. I can't get motivation to study or try hard on home works, or go to class. I have no friends and no hobbies. My GPA is in the tank, I have no fucking work experience outside of fast food.

I'm literally the definition of a failure as a human being. Everything is shit, I've dug myself into thousands of dollars of debt and wasted so much time and money and everything is just complete shit.
