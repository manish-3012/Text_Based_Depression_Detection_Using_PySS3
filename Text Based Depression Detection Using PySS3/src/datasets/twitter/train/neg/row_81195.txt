I didn't kill myself today. Vol.2I made a post on this subreddit a while with the exact same title. I just wanted to let people know that...today was a hard day. I almost did it, I almost took my life. I didn't though. I realized what a blessing my meds are and how much I need them to continue. Maybe that's not that good, but it's what's keeping me going. And, again, I'm kinda proud that I lasted through this and just wanted to share. If somebody is afraid to reach out, please, reach out! That's my problem, that I don't reach out when I'm going through dark times, when I'm having dark thoughts. I close myself in with my thoughts, and it's just a spiral that doesn't stop until I tell somebody. So, please, talk to somebody. You can talk to a parent, you can talk to a friend, you can talk to a stranger on the internet even! Just know, there are people out there that do care about you and wouldn't want to lose you. You may not know these people, but they're there! And they do care. All my internet hugs out to you guys!

I'm sorry if this came out kind of incoherent, but I'm just laying out my thoughts on here. Thank you to those who took their time to read this!
