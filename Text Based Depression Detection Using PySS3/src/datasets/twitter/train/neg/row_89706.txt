I dont know why ...I have been really depressed for one and a half years. My family is loving, I have a few really nice friends, and they know my troubles, I go to therapy and take my meds. I am a privileged 19yo piece of shit that has everything one might need in life. Even though we aren't exactly wealthy I get things like a car or an Oculus. Without any qualifications or even having to write a CV I get a job in a realestate management thingy.

Thing is, I hate every single day. I dont think the good things in life are worth this agony, day in day out. It's now gotten to a point where I am even less able to influence my actions throughout the day and usually just end up laying in bed for hours. Even if I distract myself with games or friends or idk, I wish I was dead and I keep dragging my friends down with it. I know what they and my family would have to go through if I did it, and its what kept me from doing it for the last year or so, but now its so much worse.

The one thing that I could imagine making life worth it is a person I really love, but she does not exist. I'd rather not go into detail with that though.

I keep crying and having mental breakdowns all over the course of a day, in my car, at work, in my room, while playing games with friends ... 

I really think this isn't worth it. Not a single day more.
