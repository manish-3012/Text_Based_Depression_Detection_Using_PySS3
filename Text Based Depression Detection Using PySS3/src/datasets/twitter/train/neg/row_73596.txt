What does it mean to be happy ?I feel that I can't enjoy anything in life.

 I have friends and a boyfriend but socializing is agony for me and I sometimes think that I would prefer to be alone. I can't enjoy human interactions but I also feel really lonely sometimes. It's crazy , I know. 

I keep thinking "tomorrow will be good day , I'll  live in the moment and have some fun. I'll  enjoy myself for once. I'll stop analyzing everything and constantly having negative thoughts". This good days never comes because I'm unable to enjoy anything and I'm always pessimistic and negative. I truly don't know what it means to be happy and I have probably never experienced happiness .
