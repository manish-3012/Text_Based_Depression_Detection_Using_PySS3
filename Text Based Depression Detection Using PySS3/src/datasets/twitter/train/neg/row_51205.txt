im struggling i want to fucking kill myself i know i canâ€™ti feel so alone and like such a burden. i wish i could just disappear and it would not hurt anyone. i dont want to feel like this. i never get fully better these thoughts always come back.. i feel so lost. i canâ€™t talk to anyone, nobody understands. i feel like im annoying and a waste of space, i think sometimes everyone would be better off without me
