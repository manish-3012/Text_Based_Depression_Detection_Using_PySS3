My reason whySo I think the only reason I havent killed myself at this point is literally because of my job. I donâ€™t want to fail, and have to be put in a hospital for my own protection, leaving my coworker to do it by themselves, and probably get fired. Like I canâ€™t do it to them, theyâ€™ve helped me so much. Last Friday I was having a really bad day and having suicidal thoughts, and they didnâ€™t know how bad it was, but they messaged me for a few hours, trying to help me without ever asking what was wrong. Iâ€™ve never had someone like this in my life, and I think the only reason I havenâ€™t done anything this year is because I donâ€™t want to disappoint them. Iâ€™m super thankful for having them, and idk if they realize how much theyâ€™ve done for me.
