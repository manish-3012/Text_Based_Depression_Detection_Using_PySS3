I need help, my parents can't afford it, and I can't tell them anyway. Where can I find free psychiatric help? Or will somebody please just send me an email? I don't know what's going to happen. I'm terrified, too. I tried googling "48059 free psychiatric help" and all I got was AA/NA. Sooner would be better than later. Thank you, you're all beautiful.
