Life is good at 22I don't know how much longer it will take for me to finally figure out how i will off myself.
I don't want to be in distress any longer. I've tried everything from exercise to meds and right now i feel like it has all been a waste of time.
I'm worse than what i was two years ago, when i tried hanging myself but failed. Whatever makes me human is gone now as i have drenched myself in lust and drugs over these years to try and ease my fucking existance. Every now and then i remember when i was a happy kid and loved my family (i cried today because i can't connect to anyone anymore). However i've changed. I still empathize with how everyone feels around me but my mind cannot distinguish what is really happening or what is just happening up here.
I even have a minimum wage job and a place to live and family overseas willing to take me in. But i've killed my whole sense of being in this fucking shithole of a city and now my anxiety is so severe i am willing to destroy myself, since that is all that makes me feel alive. I'm fucked up and i blame myself for not having the balls to man up when i should have. I still picture how 'perfect' all this anxiety could shape me up and end up being like a fucking hero in a tragedy movie, but the pain is just too much for any normal human bean to endure. Fuck the last ten years of my life. Everytime i gain something i manage to throw it all away. Maybe suffering is my drug of choice. Maybe deep down i want to feel normal. And maybe, i won't muster up the courage to end my life for now

Tl;dr Fucker turns himself schizophrenic and is too much of a pussy to take life by the balls. Fucker thinks taking his own life is inevitable
