hi, itâ€™s hopelessthis is kind of long

i work a dead end job and i have no car or license. i canâ€™t get a better job because i canâ€™t drive. i canâ€™t drive because i canâ€™t afford to fix my car. iâ€™m stuck in some bullshit cycle. iâ€™m always the poor friend, always has been and probably always will be. iâ€™ve been bumming rides of my friend to get to college and i barely have enough money to pay for his gas. my family is getting evicted and they shut off our gas. iâ€™ve been showering by boiling water in a pot and using a 32 oz wawa cup. my everything is stained yellow with cigarette tar and smells like it from my parents. i was sexually abused when i was younger and i canâ€™t forget it. iâ€™m so very tired. itâ€™s just so tiresome.  i donâ€™t know how much longer i can live like this. thereâ€™s no point to any of this anymore. iâ€™ve been thinking about killing myself for a very long time. iâ€™ve thought about how i would do it, where, when. what iâ€™d be listening to what i would wear. the only things stopping me is burdening people and my extreme fear of pain. i just want to rest.
