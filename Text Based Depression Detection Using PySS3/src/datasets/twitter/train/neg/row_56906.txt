This meat sack is hard to killI tried to kill myself on Friday night. I took a whole box of benzos, the remainder of a box of codine based pain killers (about half a box), washed down with a few beers and half a bottle of wine. And I just woke up the next day with a monster headache and slept a lot. Honestly? Iâ€™m only a 5â€™7 girl, what the hell will it take? 

I fucking hate my job, I hate my life, I hate this meat sack. Yeah I have family and friends I love, but how long am I supposed to endure utter misery for the sake of not hurting them.

I want out, but I canâ€™t even do that right.

Sorry, just venting.
