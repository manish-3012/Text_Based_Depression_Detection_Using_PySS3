Iâ€™m relapsing again and i dont know what to doIts weird because i feel empty inside but also really anxious and overwhelmed so i want to cry and let it all out but i also feel nothing at all so i cant cry? Does that make sense?? Haha i think my emotions are a bit out of wack
Im trying to pull through and ignore all my suicidal thoughts, i distract myself when i begin to plan, but i dont want to tell anyone since iâ€™ll be put in medical care and i hated that experience
Like being at the hospital gives me flashbacks hahaha so thats never. A good option
I have other responsibilities right now so thats why i want this stupid depressive episode to be over already smh i get it! Iâ€™m depressed! I was once actively suicidal and now that i fucking failed that exam iâ€™m relapsing! There you go I acknowledged that shit now will you please go away 
I tried hinting to my bf and idk its a bit gross of me to say but i always always make myself available to him and be near my phone in case hes sad but im dying these past few days and he isnt here for me
I know he wants to be but idk its my fault too i dont want him to worry but i want him to know bc yknow trust is a good foundation of relationships lol
But he really isnt here when i need him the most 
Fuck i really want to die haha
And scratching/bruising myself wont help
Sorry this is just a major rant 
I posted i think two days ago and thanks to those who contacted me, sorry i didnt reply bc i felt like i would start typing and never stop and then just cry lmao so just. Thank you for caring but its alright. I just wanna vent somewhere and not grt put away
