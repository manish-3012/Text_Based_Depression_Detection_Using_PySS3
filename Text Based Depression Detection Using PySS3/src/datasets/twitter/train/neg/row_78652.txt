feeling so aloneMy girlfriend left me for someone else. This alone makes me feel incredibly low. She was the love of my life, I made her everything to me. She was my motivation. But during all that time I forgot about myself, I forgot how to love myself. I used to be happy, I used to like who I was. But i have no one now. She was my only friend. I cant talk to her because she doesnt care anymore, she just gives emotionless standardized responses, which makes it worse. I have no one to talk to. I feel like I cant connect with people anymore. I have no real friends. I dont see the opportunity that i used to see in talking to someone, it just seems pointless. everyone seems  to only be looking out for themselves. I live in the city and there are so many people, but I am so  alone. I used to feel like I could contribute to the world, I want to help people. But I am so timid and in this world we are forced to be independent. I dont know what to do
