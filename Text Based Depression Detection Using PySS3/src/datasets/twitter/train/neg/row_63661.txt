Today I got in a fight with me best and only friendLong story short he said he didnâ€™t want to be friends with me anymore.
Iâ€™m a 25 year old male with nowhere to go in life, no girlfriend, no college. And now apparently no friends.
Iâ€™ve been on the edge for almost a year and a half ever since my ex left me. She said I didnâ€™t have any goals, and aspirations. And frankly sheâ€™s right, I never even thought I would make it to 21 to be honest.
This first night fully alone is only making me sink deeper into my thoughts. I wish I could drive off an off ramp, or plow into the side of a building to just end it all.
All my passions are gone. My soul seems so distant and unreachable. 
Everybody thinks about killing them selves, sure. But I think depending on the next few days..... I just might. I just might.

If you hear from me again it will be my last post.
