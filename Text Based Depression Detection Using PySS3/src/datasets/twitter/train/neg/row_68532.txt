It's time to act.3 years of sadness. 3 years of hiding it. No one knows how bad it is. I've gotten way to good at lying and hiding. Suicidal thoughts for a year and half. Don't know how I'm still here, don't know what kept me going. It needs to go away. I figure there's only two ways that'll happen: in a locked room with a knife, or in a therapist's office. I really want it to be the latter. I can't let anyone know though. They can't know. I'm a undergrad at college in the state of Illinois. How can I get help without anyone knowing?
