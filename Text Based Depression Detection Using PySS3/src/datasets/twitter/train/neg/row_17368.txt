What happens after you call 911I have seen from other Reddit comments that calling 911 while suicidal is a mistake. They will arrest you, lock you up, and detain you or so I've heard. Is there any truth to this? 

I only ask because my 30th birthday is next week and while 'celebrating' at my parents' house I think I'm going to bring a fifth of vodka to the train tracks and just... watch, and think about life. If I called 911 and said "I think I'm going to jump in front of the train" what happens then? Do they help you? I'm really anticipating Dec 22 (my birthday) to be difficult, I feel like it's a milestone year but all I have to reflect on is failure and loneliness.
