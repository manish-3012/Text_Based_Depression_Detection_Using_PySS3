I don't wanna die, at least not by suicide, but lately, I've been feeling like it.Some back story first. A few months ago, I went out with this girl who turned out to be the best thing in my life, a few weeks later, she told me she wanted to break up, she said her friends kept forcing her to break up with me, but I refused to break up, saying that I won't give up, eventually, I convinced her to stay, saying that we will be together in secret, with no one knowing about it. A few months later, after all I've done with and for her, she talks to me again about leaving, saying she's tired of lying, secrets, hiding and secret meetings, and told me she wants to break up, I was devastated, I asked her who I was to her now, and she replied "someone I took responsibility for, someone who I thought I loved because they loved me", I was more devastated, at last, all I wanted to do was to make her happy, to do what's best for her, so I decided to let her go, I wanted to saved the relationship, but I've failed, now I'm left with thoughts of suicide. I'm saddened and I'm weak, I'm vulnerable, I'm hurt by that girl who made me so happy, but now so sad. I loved her so much, I loved how life tried to make her bitter, yet she remained sweet. I've never met anyone like her. I'm now currently thinking of committing suicide.
