Bulimia and everyone hates meHello, and I have gotta story. A couple of months ago I developed a severe eating disorder which lead to me binging and purging every day about 5 to 8 times a day. My girlfriend left me, my friends stopped talking to me and my parents hate me. I'm 16 years old and I was an amazing athlete running 6 to - 8 miles a day but the disorder got a hold of me. Now I have fallen into this deep depression and I want to die because I'm in pain constantly and everyone's angry with me or hates me. I have nothing to live for it feels like, my girlfriend is gone, my parents hate me, my friends think I'm crazy. I don't really know what else to say other than I thought maybe sharing these thoughts someone out could help but I doubt it. At this point, if it comes down to it I'll find a way to kill myself because I don't see anything bright in my future. There's a lot more to this story but it's simply too much.
