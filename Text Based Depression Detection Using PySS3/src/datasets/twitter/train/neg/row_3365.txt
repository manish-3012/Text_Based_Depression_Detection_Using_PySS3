Why can't I find the motivation to end it?I want to die, it would be very easy to do, there are multiple guns in the house and none of them are locked. I keep fantasizing about blowing my brains out and finally getting to move on from this wretched existence. But I can't do it. I can't even get out of bed. I'm so worthless that I can't even put my money where my mouth is and finally do something to end the sadness.
