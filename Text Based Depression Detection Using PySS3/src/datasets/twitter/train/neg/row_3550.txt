I cannot enjoy anythingI just cannot live with myself anymore. Every waking moment I just feel so depressed and filled with pain. I literally cannot focus in class or do any basic functions in life without thinking about wanting to kill myself so that I don't have to endure this pain anymore. And I don't know why I haven't killed myself after going through this depressed state of mind for literally years. Movies, games, music, anime, nothing brings me happiness anymore. It just distracts me temporarily until my mind starts to wander back to how much I hate existing in this world. I don't love my parents, my family, or my friends. I just filled myself with so much hate and for some reason I still am living in this world when I should have been gone long ago.
