Ending it after fucking up so much with my gf and not wanting to be a cuckoldI'm an emotional abuser. Extremely good at what I do. Very manipulative and charismatic enough to get my way. The girl I've been trying to get with for YEARS and I finally got together, but our relationship needed work before it was official. Then it became official, we had plans to get married, but I wasn't very attentive and hurt her all the time. For 12 days, I hurt her and made her feel like absolute crap. 

She was on the verge of saying goodbye for good when I said I'd do anything to get her to stay. She said she wanted to fuck other guys, either 12 different ones or 3 or 4 multiple for all the days I hurt her, ratings included, because she knows it'll hurt me the same way i hurt her. Out of desperation i said okay. 

I can't handle that. I have enough saved up for a glock, and I've had a plan for literally months. I've made so many mistakes that I can never take back. I can't ever go back and change everything that I messed up, and my future is gloomy and grim because of those mistakes. I'll be missed, but I can't continue living because of that. It's not enough. 

Once she's done doing what she's doing, I'm going to finish it off. Call it her last bang.
