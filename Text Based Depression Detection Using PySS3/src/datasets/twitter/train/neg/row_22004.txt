College was literally so bad today Iâ€™m contemplating killing my self tonightI have an exacto knife I could use to slit my own throat and I really want to do it.
Today was absolutely embarrassing and nothing has been goi g my way recently.
In fact things have only been getting worse and worse. I feel like no one cares about me and Iâ€™m at my wits end. I just wanted to go to college and work on things I cared about but then my miserable life got in the way and now I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll even go back.
I wish I was dead
I wish I had someone to talk to
