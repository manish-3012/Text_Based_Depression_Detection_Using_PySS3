It's not bad but not good eitherI'm a 20 years old woman and depressed. A good friend of mine killed herself in may and let's not talk about my love life. I just want to be nameless and be found dead in a motel room. I just bond to fast and it sucks. You all are great. I try to survive for my dog... I love her but she's already 10 years old. I love you all.
