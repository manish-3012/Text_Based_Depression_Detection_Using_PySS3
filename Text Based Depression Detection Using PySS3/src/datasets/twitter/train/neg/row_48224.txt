Hi...Can you make the pain stop?  Anyone knows how?  I'm running out of ideas...it hurts so bad that i ended up pushing everyone away little by little and sometimes not in a very amicable way     
I don't want to feel pain, but i don't want to feel anything anymore.....i just feel so alone and desolate that is unbearable...it's as if my voice can't reach anyone, so why bother?  I need for this pain in my chest to stop...i need help...i can see only one escape...
