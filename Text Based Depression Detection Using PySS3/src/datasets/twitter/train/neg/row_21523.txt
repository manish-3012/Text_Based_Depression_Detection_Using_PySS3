i donâ€™t feel like i can do itanyway so im more depressed right now than ever before i canâ€™t find a job and my s/o keeps lying to me (about meaningless things) and everything is generally terrible

all that goes through my head is 
so worthless so stupid not good enough stupid worthless useless nothing

i literally canâ€™t stop crying and i canâ€™t sleep and all i can think about is the razor blades in the drawer of my nightstand
