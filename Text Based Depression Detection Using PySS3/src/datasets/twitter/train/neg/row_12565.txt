DAE *want* to respond and help the OPs of the posts here, but can't because you simply don't know how to type out anything optimistic?It's darn-near impossible to type out a reason for someone else to live if you can't think of one for yourself, the idea of optimism is completely alien. I scroll through and read a lot of these posts, surveying everyone's pain, but I simply have no idea how to help.
