Am I suicidal or just a lazy fuck pretending to be for attention ?Basically this. I spend most of my time staring at the void, i have no passion and no skills whatsoever and I'm so useless at work I feel getting fired is only a matter of months. I smoke a ton with the backthought that if I get some form of disease it'll finally speed up things and give me a reason not to do anything anymore. I usually skip two meals out of three because I don't want to feed myself, I don't sleep at night, I am unable to focus for more than three seconds, I do not work out, I do not read. If pressing the return key could make my life end I would gladly oblige but I won't even go out of my way to kill myself after work or on weekends, I just rot away in my flat with the shutters closed and act like a broken robot. Am I the problem ? Am I a dumb motherfucker who hopes to get away with doing nothing ?
