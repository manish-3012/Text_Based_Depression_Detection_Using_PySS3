Parents told me to kill myself.I'm 16 (Turning 17 on August 20th) and recently my mom lost about 160 dollars out of her wallet. My dad is a scum bag and loves to take advantage of my mom. Not only that, he blames everything on me and my mom loves to chime on in. If money goes missing it's my fault, food goes missing it's my fault even though I barley eat due to my depression and my dad weighs 270+ pounds and that's not muscle that's pure fat. Since my birthday is coming soon my friends decided to buy me some Space Dandy stuff from Amazon because they know how much I love that show. I told my mom how excited I was about the gifts coming my way through the mail and she looked at me with a face of disgust. To be honest that was typical but I shrugged it off and wanted to be happy that my birthday was coming up. Yesterday my friend told me that she got an Email, it was from Amazon, saying that the shirt that she had ordered for me arrived and I should go pick it up. I was ecstatic at this point, so i rushed down stairs to the concierge (I live in a small apartment) to pick it up. They told me they didn't get anything from the UPS guy. At this point I was kind of bummed out. I really wanted to both see and wear that shirt but whatever, I went back upstairs and took a nap. It was around 5 PM that my mom came home from work and told me that I had a package. You see, the UPS guy comes around 2PM latest 3PM so the concierge basically lied to me. Back to my mom, she read the bag and then tore it open. I  told her that was for me and she shouldn't open my stuff. She then proceeded to tell me that she told the concierge downstairs not to give me the packages that were for me until she got home to get them herself and open them. I told her that, that was invading my privacy and that she should stop. And of course she told me the whole "I'm older than you and I am your mother so fuck off" kind of thing. After that whole ordeal I took to Instagram to tell people what was going on (NOTE that I didn't tag her nor my dad) and how I felt uncomfortable her opening my packages that my friends bought for me and how she thinks that I took her money to buy myself those things even though I don't have a debit card/credit card etc. About five minutes later my mom comments and said "Sweetie @(myaccount) if you don't like it then its time to save money and move out." and people went ham on her. Saying that this is how kids are lead astray she shouldn't do that and how she's a shitty parent and how i'm turning into an adult soon and blah blah blah you get the point. Today, I go to my GED classes  and I get a text from my dad saying "I'm going to give you 5 minutes for you to take that bullshit down or your going to lose your phone" I proceeded to tell him that, that was my account and I could do what I please with it (NOTE that he follows my account and every time when I block him he complains and acts like the victim) but then I eventually took the post down. He then called me to tell me that he didn't care about me and he hopes that I kill myself but not inside the house because since I love attention so much I should just go do it outside the house and the house would smell like shit because I was there and if I did survive it or didn't do it to get the fuck out of his house. I'm currently home crying my eyes out and holding a full bottle of my antidepressants in my hand. I started cutting once again after five months of not doing it. I think i'm actually going to end it this time..

UPDATE 1: 
--
I got kicked out of the house. I would call the cops but to be honest I would rather live in a tent than going back to that place that damages my both mental and physical health. Thank you all for the support. It might not seem that way but thank you all. Although my suicidal thought lingers in my head I thank you all. None of my friends would let me stay with them because of their parents but i'm still trying to find a place to stay. I'll keep you updated. (Written from the GED computer lab)

UPDATE 2:
--
My parents called me and told me that if I didn't come back home they would both disconnect my phone and kill my pet snake Leo.  So,  sadly i'm going back home to these fucks even though they kicked me out. Suicidal thoughts are coming back. (Written from my phone)

Hey everyone. I'm currently at my friends house typing this. I was recently Baker Acted Friday and got out today (Monday at 5:00 PM) for trying to kill myself. My parents don't care as usual. So i'm running away. I honestly can't keep living in that household anymore. The mental and verbal abuse is awful. I'm either going to live at my friends house or just going to live in a fucking tent. (Written from my friends computer)
