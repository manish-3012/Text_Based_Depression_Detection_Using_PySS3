smokingi feel so weak

i feel remotely sad or down and immediately think â€œi want to dieâ€ and i immediately want to smoke a cigarette 

i am trying to quit smoking and not die overall

life felt so good for a few days, and now i feel so bad again

a future with my partner is a reason i want to stick things out, yet the situation we are currently in makes me think to myself about how i want to fall off a cliff 

iâ€™m scared of heights and water

itâ€™s so strange craving death yet being filled with fear and sleeping with the lights on 

trying to escape by scrolling around on my phone but ended up reading through the insane parents subreddit and good fuck i want to die its too horrible and reminds me of shitty shit and i feel sick 

i wish i had someone to talk to
anxiety does that shit of feeling like a burden people donâ€™t consent to 

does anyone else get headaches from crying?
