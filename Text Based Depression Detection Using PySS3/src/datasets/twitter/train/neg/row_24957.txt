My Life is ShitI donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll imminently kill myself, but Iâ€™ve gone through so much shit in my life and kind of donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve been dealing was Asbergers my entire life, Iâ€™ve been bullied for eight years, I just feel like I canâ€™t do it anymore. I ran into so much shit at school (I typed it all out in a review on Google, itâ€™s called The Conept School) after I was getting punished for the same things other kids were doing and I knew all along that they were but no one believed me. I got backstabbed by a girl, have just missed on girls so many times. I donâ€™t know what to do. I just donâ€™t know.
