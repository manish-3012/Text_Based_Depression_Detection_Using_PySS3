Sorry, story time.*I know there is some things I left out that might be hard to understand what Iâ€™m saying but please tell me what you thinkâ€*


I wish I was better than this. I try..I do, but itâ€™s not enough effort. Iâ€™m exhausted and feel worthless. I canâ€™t even help my mom out. I feel as if iâ€™m a failure for that.. i feel horrible inside. I should be living on my own like now or in the near future but whatever I do, even at my best go at it, itâ€™s still. never. good enough.
