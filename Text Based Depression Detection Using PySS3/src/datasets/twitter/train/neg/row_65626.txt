Probably doesn't belong hereI have nothing to complain about. I've never been abused. I have great parents who are supportive and gave me a great childhood. I was never bullied and never had problems fitting in. I have a good job that is rewarding and allows me to be financially comfortable. I'm not ugly. I don't have any physical ailments. People are generally nice to me. I've never even had my heart broken. I have a beautiful and wonderful wife who I love and who tolerates me. I have had nothing but stability and love for my whole life.

But I want to end it. There's a weakness in me. I'm soft, the slightest adversity sends me spiraling. I'm taking meds. Maybe I need more idk. I believe that life is what you make it. It has no meaning except that which you give it.

I'm lazy. I don't want to do anything in action. I have dozens of ambitions that I know I won't pursue. I'll just scrape by and exist. I'm a lazy complainer with nothing to complain about. I have no real problems.

I'm in the process of making sure my wife can easily access all of our money and assets. I'm almost done writing goodbye letters. There's nothing to live for except to spair my family pain. That's not enough anymore.

I tired of feeling weak. I'm tired of not feeling like a man and simultaneously being too weak willed to do anything about it.

Diet, exercise, medication, meditation. I've failed at them all and I'm over it.

I'm scared of everything and only feel alive when I have just the right amount of alcohol in me.

I'm done.
