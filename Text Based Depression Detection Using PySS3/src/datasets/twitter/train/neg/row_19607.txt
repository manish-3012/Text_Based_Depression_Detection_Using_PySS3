Please give me tips on getting through a few hours!I won't give huge back story but I'm really depressed and alone, and I just want to end it so badly but I know things will be better in the morning. Nights are just really hard and lonely. I know have things to live for but I'm just exhausted. 

I really need any sort of coping tip anyone has to get through times like these, until my head is clear. 

Thanks to everyone who helps out here.
