I canâ€™t take it anymore.Iâ€™m just tired of putting on a fake smile. Iâ€™m heartbroken daily. No one loves me. No one gives me a chance. I hate the world and the world hates me. Iâ€™ve made posts like this one before but, Iâ€™ve never felt so hopeless in my life. My body is broken and weak. All I do is cut myself and cry. I canâ€™t even hold a pencil without dropping it. I shake all the time and Iâ€™m constantly on edge. My heart burns in pain and I canâ€™t taste anything like I used too. Despite the sun and the smiles and laughter of others Iâ€™m left alone and hollow. Why was I born to suffer? Nothing brings me happiness. And yet I get laughed at and berated for being weak and not good enough. It seems that only the strong find love. Iâ€™m sick of it all. I hate the world nothing is fair. And Iâ€™m done.
