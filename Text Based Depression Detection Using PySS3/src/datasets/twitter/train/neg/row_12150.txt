âš ï¸Trigger warning (rape)Ah, hello reader! After debating which subreddit would be the most fitting, I guess this one is the one I felt might be most suitable based off I currently feel.

I feel so fucking (pardon my language) DISGUSTING. I have never felt so appalled by my own physical being. I seriously do NOT want to be here right now.

To be upfront, last night I was raped by a stranger. I do not remember any of the actual event, and maybe itâ€™s for the best (?) but, when you know, you KNOW. I have taken the right steps following what has happened, or well, at least the necessary ones. Iâ€™ve already also talked to my mom, close family and friends I just feel like nobody has been able to say anything I could get any help out of. Understandable. Not that Iâ€™d expect any of them to fully be able to know what to say or do. I would probably react similarly and say some of the same things theyâ€™ve told me. I just canâ€™t shake how literally absolutely 1000000% disgusting I feel. Iâ€™ve been shaken up all day, both mentally and physically. I have so much anxiety. I donâ€™t know what to do right now.

I have debated calling the crisis hotline, however, I really would just like to be in the comfort of my own bed (my literal safe place) and I know the things that I would disclose wouldnâ€™t allow for that to happen. :(

Alas, if you made it this far...thank you for taking the time to read my post. It means more than you think. I just wanted to get that off my shoulders.
