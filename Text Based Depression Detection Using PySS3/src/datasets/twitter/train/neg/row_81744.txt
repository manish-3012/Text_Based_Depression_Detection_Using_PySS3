relapsed after 224 days of being cleaniâ€™m so selfish, but iâ€™m not living for myself.

i want to leave this world, but i canâ€™t leave my mother alone and daughter-less. so i did the next best thing i could think of - chew my razor apart in the tub and slice my sorrows away, then take a few shots of nyquil.

she doesnâ€™t suspect a thing, and thatâ€™s great. she shouldnâ€™t have to worry about me anymore. 

my shoulders, my stomach, and my chest suffered instead of her, and thatâ€™s okay. they deserve the pain. 

iâ€™m not sure what step comes next, but i intend on no one finding out, not even my best mate. maybe iâ€™ll be dead in a day or two, maybe iâ€™ll make it out clean someday.

but as of right now iâ€™m at day zero.

i deserve it.
