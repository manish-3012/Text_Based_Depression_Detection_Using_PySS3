I Can't Escape the Idea That Depression is a Rational State and Healthy Coping Mechanisms Are Largely Delusional.Our species is destroying the planet, our politics.are fracturing on a global scale. To hope for things to get better because we need to believe they will seems to deny our capacity for infinite self destruction. And it would be one thing if I could view myself apart from all that, but my own capacity for self sabotage is equally unlimited.

I'm unemployed. I'm depressed. I can't bring myself to put the effort into maintaining a regular schedule. When I connect with others, the slightest rejection sends me into a spiral of despair and self loathing; if I keep to myself, I feel lonely and helpless. It's all I can do to try and survive in a state of constriction, struggling to keep my existential despair to myself for fear alienating them, as I've done to so many others. Leaning on my escapes to try and relieve the pain long enough that I don't start planning.

Let's say I go to therapy. Again. Let's say I substitute my escapism for productive life goals, again. Let's say I create some CBT to reframe my thinking. Again. So it gets better, for a while, but I end up back here again. I **always** do.

Explain to me why suicide my suicide would be irrational. Seriously, explain it. I'm still human, which makes me self-destructive, except that mental illness makes it even worse. I am sick and fucking tired of living between depressive episodes, where even the good times are tainted by low key terror of when the next episode will come.

If I tell people in my life how bad it's gotten, I end up on involuntary. I have virtually no prospects for maintaining a healthy romantic relationship, I struggle to maintain even a semblance of a familial or social life, my escapes have come to dominate my world. I am at serious risk of ending my life, I **know** I am at serious risk of ending my life, **I even know why** I am at risk. And I still **fucking still* to struggle to come up with to come up with reasons why I shouldn't. Basically all I've got left is that I don't want to hurt the people I care about. That's it.

So what's the point? I call a suicide hotline and they use strategies I've fucking used myself to talk other people down because I'm intimately familiar with them. They get me into a hospital or into a therapist's office. Then what? Things get better, for a little bit? Every time I go through this it gets worse.

Tell me why I'm wrong. Tell me why committing myself to a hospital again is the right thing to do for myself when I could just fucking end it and it would be **done**. I keep thinking about Elliott Smith and the anecdotes of how he would discourage others from committing suicide but reinforce the idea that it was their decision. You know how he died? 

He stabbed himself in the heart. **Twice**. Do you know what happens, physiologically, when your heart suffers a traumatic injury? The amount of self-loathing, despair and anger required to do such a thing is almost unfathomable. I have to assume he'd wanted to do it for a long time. How long did he suffer before it finally became unbearable? Was it really a terrible waste and a tragedy to put an end to that?

I'm tired of this waste of a life I'm living. How fucking entitled is the world that it tries to encourage me to keep going on? I'm fucking **done** with it.
