I have an Exam and a Report due tommorow for University and I am having a panic attack, I just want to end my life.But I know this is just a moment and I will get through it, can someone help me keep safe though please? I am diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, I'll admit I haven't been diagnosed by my psychologist for the next thing but I have a feeling I have PTSD from bullying, she mentioned I get triggered by events from the past.

Anyway I am struggling to breath, I think I did a decent job studing for my test tommorow but my report which I was meant to do the work for other people in my group because they are too lazy to do it, while I haven't procrastinated, they have which is why I am panicking so much. I feel light headed and I just want to end it.

Can someone help me please, at the very least try to comfort me?
