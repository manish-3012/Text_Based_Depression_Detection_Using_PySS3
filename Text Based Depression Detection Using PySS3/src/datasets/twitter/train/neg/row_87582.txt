Why should I even bother at this pointAt this point of my young life, I have already lost so much that meant to me. Most of my loved ones are dead when I am only 20 years old, including my friends and family who have died from either drug abuse or suicide. I have had many people I know and love die from anything from cancer, to suicide, to blatant use of meth and heroine, but the police do absolutely nothing about it. I',m just fucking poor white trash with nothing going for them. I am 1000's of dollars in debt and getting kicked out of college for missing so many days to attend funerals, and I can't get a job due to a criminal record of usage of a misdemeanor due to marijuana, so not even McDonalds or Walmart will hire me, so I have to move back in with my parents for probably the rest of my life at this point. I had so many aspiration of being a musician, but all of that is out of the window at this point since I sold everything I have just to be able to pay rent, even my gaming computer, most of my furniture, my T.V., and my instruments just to pay rent, but apparently that's not fucking enough. I have nothing and I am nothing, and what it the point of living anymore? People tell me bullshit like "look on the bright side" or "everything will be better soon" while they have the futures ahead of them. I am just tired of it all and want a way out, and no therapist can help me because I have no money or health insurance to help me, and everyone has abandoned me, even GOD itself.
