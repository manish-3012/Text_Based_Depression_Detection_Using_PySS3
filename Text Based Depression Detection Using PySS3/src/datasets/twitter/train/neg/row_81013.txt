Why do I hate myself so much?I'm the only thing hindering my recovery. I've been feeling suicidal for months now. Constantly posting and deleting posts. I won't move on and live until I start accepting life but I don't feel I deserve it and I really detest myself. Therapy, medications, more therapy, more medications. Why do I constantly battle with myself over whether or not I should kill myself. I have a loving husband, a young child, loving family and friends, good career prospects if I went back to work. So I know deep down I shouldn't but I just can't shake the feeling of not being deserving of this life I have. I'm so angry that I feel like this.im so angry that I haven't killed myself.  I feel so guilty for feeling all of this. Theres so many layers but I think it boils down to really hating myself and feeling undeserving of life.
