Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™m gonna keep this as short as possible.. Iâ€™m 14 and have  schizophrenia.. itâ€™s very common in my family.. itâ€™s undiagnosed because Iâ€™m too scared to tell my family about it because I know there just going to humiliate me.. I have all the symptoms and my dreams will warp into reality.. Iâ€™m not saying this is a reason to kill myself but itâ€™s progressively getting worse and my memory is fading and Iâ€™m scared of what Iâ€™m going to become. I donâ€™t even know if my friends are real because when i mention them to my family they say that theyâ€™ve never seen them when I previously introduced them... I feel like my life is fading away and I donâ€™t know what is happening. I know this is a terrible reason to but I plan to do it tomorrow.. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be able to remember this post, so if youâ€™re reading this and you know who I am based on my username Iâ€™m sorry this is the reason why I did it... good bye I love you all
