Things dont get betterI have 1 friend who has kept me going but he is so high above me in every aspect of life when he tells me "things will get better" its started to sound so grating and condescending. I have a child and thats the only reason other than "it will get better" that i hear i should live.

My child i see every other weekend and i dont find reproduction as a reason for living. I dont actually care how selfish i sound.

I have never had happy memories of childhood or happy stretches of time in my entire life. I went from trauma and abuse as a child. to being a huge slut in my early 20s so i could have places to go and ways to escape these thoughts. Didnt work. Then i got pregnant at 23 and got married. That didnt work out. Im 29 now divorced. I was homeless for 3 months living in my car for the winter of last year and now im back at my grandmothers and cant get out of my crippling debt because i make a shitty 12$ an hour.

I am going to do this there is not any thing for me ive lived long enough to know i will never be happy or not feel this way. I have no desire to do some sort of "career" everything that takes some amount of effort or money to study turns my stomach and makes me want to do this more. I have no desire to be a mother. I dont even know why im going to post this.
