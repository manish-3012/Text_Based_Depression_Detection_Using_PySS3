May 1st.... byeWell if you haven't noticed by know that this is my throwaway account and i don't care what I post here just to the fact that it is. I only vent within this account. As of my other, I don't have one. Well first off I really am thinking about taking a water bottle and just filling it with some bleach or something. My kidnapping and rape which lasted 3 days and the 4th being me going tested on and going home. That was actually the most traumatizing part of it all. Well on may 1st which is next month pretty soon will mark 1 year. People tell me to be strong cause it'll get better but it's not. I just want all my pain to stop. I'm not even sure I can make it to may 1st.
