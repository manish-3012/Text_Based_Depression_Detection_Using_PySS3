what to look forward toI just feel numb all the time, completely indifferent. I have nothing to look forward to and I feel like everything just gets worse by the day. Another weekend spent drunk and alone in my room, she said she wants to stay friends, my grades are shit, summer coming up, so more time to be in my room alone, my parents know Iâ€™m a fuckup, no future, no real interests. I feel like Iâ€™ve been this way my whole life and I just want to take a handful of oxys and down a handle.
