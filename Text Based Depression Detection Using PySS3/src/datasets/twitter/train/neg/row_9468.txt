I don't want pity, just understanding.Its about 1 am where i am right now. I'm slowly starting to accept the fact that today will my last day on earth.  The reason is that i only hurt and never help. My mom is in debt because my actions. I am going to jail soon because I am also in debt. I had a job but my depression made me sleep in to much and now I have no income. I have looked at every possible situation and have come to the same conclusion everytime. everyone would be benefited from my death. Thank you for uderstanding. Today i will say my goodbys and that will be that.
