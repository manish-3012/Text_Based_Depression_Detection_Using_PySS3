Constantly thinkingI'm always headed down the rails of some painful train of thought.. and when I finally arrive at a conclusion.. it's accompanied by a stabbing pain in my stomach.. the truth hurts.. i guess. All I want is to wake up back in time. Or wake up to the life I would've lived had I not slept it all away. Then id never have had the days I made the mistakes that lead me to be in this place.
