My crush laughed at me with her boyfriendSo, i have this girl i falled in love with. She is a coworker of mine. We have a good relationship, with talk and laugh and above all with work together in a positive way. I know she has a boyfriend and that she loves him, so i didn't get any big idea, and i have never tried to flirt with her. I'm ugly and a weirdo but she respected me, i knew that his boyfriend would have probably laughed at me but i didn't except the same from her. I haven't seen her since 3 month, and today i have met her with her boyfriend. She was embarassed and i noticed that she was laughing at me, because his bf started to mocked me for my physique, she initially said "stop", but then she laughed and looked at me in a way "poor loser", it was so humiliating, she laughed all the time at me with him like she was staring a cominc movie, and laughed at me when she was mocking me
