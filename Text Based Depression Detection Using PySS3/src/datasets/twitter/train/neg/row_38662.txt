I guess I'm back here again.I can't tell, anymore. Am I a bad person? Is this why no matter what I fucking do, someone will hurt me? It's not even just a simple, small "incident" - every single friend I have had or lover has crossed the line with me.

Am I so awful that I deserve these things? I just had a friend cross the line with me, and it's the most stupid fucking thing for her to ever do. It was just a fucking game, a stupid fucking game she decided to take her anger out on me. She screamed at me and insulted me, knowing full well of my past and how I cannot handle things like that. Fuck, I don't think anyone even if they've had a "normal" past would deserve the things she screamed at me.

I can't talk to her right now. For my own mental safety I cannot.

I hurt. Not just from her, but from my lover. I told them what happened, I told them I cannot talk to her for the time being because I hurt. They assumed I was in the wrong for what she did. 

What is the point of being in a relationship when the other doesn't have your back? Why did you want me to justify myself? Why did you automatically assume that SHE was having issues and that is why SHE screamed at me like that? Why didn't you want to hear the full story and understand me?

People who do the things she did, there is no excuse. There is no excuse for that behaviour. She wasn't even going through a "tough time" like you suggested, and that still wouldn't excuse her behaviour. You don't do those things to the people you care about. 

I am just done. I am so fucking done. I am done with life and people and relationships. I can't do this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. I am done crying, I am done cutting, I am done with the abuse from every fucking thing. 

What did I do to ever deserve this treatment?
