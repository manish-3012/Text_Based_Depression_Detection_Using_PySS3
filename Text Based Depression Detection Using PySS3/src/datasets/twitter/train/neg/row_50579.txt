Herpes sucksI hate my life

Today possibly it might have spread all to my house mates. They were VERY kind to me and this is how I repayed.    Well Iâ€™m FUCKED. I AM FUCKED. 
I want to fucking kym. Now every freaking body in the community will know this.  

How can anyone continue to live with this stress of accidentally infecting others 24/7? I am seriously about to go crazy.
