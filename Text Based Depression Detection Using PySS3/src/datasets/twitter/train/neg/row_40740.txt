i want to die but i don't want to kill myselfdo any of you just wish it could all go away but without you having to suffer the pain of death? emotions are painful enough. the only thing that kept me away from an attempt so far is probably the pain, and how i'm not done with personal projects, and some close friends and family. my emotional state could have outweighed this fairly easily but somehow it didn't, so i'm stuck. can't get a psychologist/psychiatrist/therapist easily right now.
