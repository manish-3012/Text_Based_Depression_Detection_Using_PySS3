I think other people out there like me that I would relate to in feeling trapped and tortured by the flaws in society, are also like me in having no interest in the nonsense required to interact in our society.Connecting with each other is supposed to help, but now it's becoming more difficult to find reasons/ways to not feel isolated from humankind. It's draining enough to even express my thoughts into words, and then consider them accurate enough to hopefully maneuver the empty void of internet space to grasp for a stranger's attention in the universe. Connections are the first requirements to any hopes to revitalize society and our world, yet I continue to fall into isolation.
