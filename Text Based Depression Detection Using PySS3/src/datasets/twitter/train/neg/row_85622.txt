I reached a new low last night and I don't know what to do about itThis is my first post to this sub and I don't know why I'm so nervous, I don't do nervous...

Last night I was definitely at my lowest point. I spent all of yesterday sat on my bedroom floor just listening to the sounds around me, almost meditating, and thinking about how much easier things would be if I just ended my life. Long story short I ended up getting drunk on whiskey, stealing my brothers gun and heading out to the woods. I put the gun to my head and pulled before I could change my mind, but my drunk ass didn't check to see if the thing was loaded or not and guess what... it wasn't. I'm still alive and I'm still in shock at what happened, I don't think I can believe that I actually did that. 

If that gun was loaded, I wouldn't be here writing this and asking for help or advice but here I am. I don't know what to do. Nobody knows but me and whomever is reading this.
