This is no way to live. I woke up with a horrible migraine, and 10 hours later, even after taking medication, I still have a horrible migraine. I spent 30 minutes hanging dark t-shirts on my blinds because the light from an overcast sky was too much to handle. It took 30 minutes because I have the mobility of a 90 year old. When I was walking out of the hospital on Tuesday, an old man who was hunched over and using a cane was walking much faster than me. Iâ€™m 21 for fucks sake. Itâ€™s only going to get worse.

I have no friends. I have no family that gives a shit. My family is even starting to get violent in addition to their constant emotional abuse. On Tuesday, my mom threw a bunch of shit at me and threatened to strangle me and said she was going to punch my lights out. Today, I asked my brother if I could use his phone to call my phone and picked it up off his desk. This 23 year old â€œmanâ€ viciously grabbed my arm to take his phone back and told me to fuck off. Hours later, it still hurts, because I have fibromyalgia. Even a light touch will hurt me, and they all know that. 

I sit in my bed all day, every day, watching the most mind numbing shows I can find in an attempt to empty my brain. I have nothing in my life, not one thing worth living for.
