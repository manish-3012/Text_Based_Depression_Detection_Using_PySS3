Final days i hopeSo tomorrow my abusive mom is going to be out of town and will be back on Tuesday (leaving me alone for one night) and im going to try to take that as an opportunity to end this nightmare.We have had a cat (to try and better my mental health,even though my mom didnt want it and was forced to get it from my therapist) for about 3 months now and today the cat scratched me out of fear.We were taking it out for a walk when this idiot went up to it and tried to pet it.Cat got scared and got off its leash and i had to pin him down to get him and not lose him.During this,he scratched me kinda badly.Now my female parent is saying that i am poison and that even the cat hates me.She keeps shoving the fact that she didnt want the cat up in my face,even going as far as saying that thanks to me she is now a "prisoner in her own house".

She keeps saying that i am poison and i ruin everything i come in contact with,saying that she has a miserable life thanks to me,keeps repeating how well she was doing before she got pregnant.
She does many other things,including blaming my father for everything (even her own actions),saying that she is going to kill herself because of how much i stress her out.

I cannot take this anymore.I have saved up some pills and got my hand on some alcohol to down it all.I also have murder tendencies,constantly wanting to harm/kill someone else,but now i have realised that im the problem.
This is my 5th suicide attempt,hope it works.
