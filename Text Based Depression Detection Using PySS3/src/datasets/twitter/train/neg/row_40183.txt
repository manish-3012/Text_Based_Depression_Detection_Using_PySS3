My life is horrible and I just wanna kill myself.I am 16 years old, have ocd, depression, and social anxiety, and I have problems in focusing. I have friends but, I cant express myself beacause of social anxiety, I cant be myself, I am afraid of what people thinks about me, everyday I feel uncomfortable, depressed and I feel dumb because I always fail at school and end up cheating which is humiliating, I wanna kill myself, everything feels hard to do, I have shit skin so no girls like me while my friend he gets all the girls and im just a loser, my medications doenst work so I just stopped it and I cant continue my treatment because my father wont support me and cant understand what I'm going through, I am just a pissed of shit and I feel like I am an inmate in my own mind, I dont know what to do and if I tried fixing my problems there will always someone or something that prevents me from fixing it. I am a people pleaser which is dumb because I am trying to please normal people how pathetic I am. I am just losing my hope I've been dealing with this shit for about 5 years now.
