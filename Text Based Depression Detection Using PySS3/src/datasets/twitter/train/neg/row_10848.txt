Want to post on Facebook, not even sure whyI want to make a post on Facebook that I want to slit my wrists in the bathtub, but no good would come of that. I know this. Like, my mom will call me and everyone will freak out, haha. It would just totally disrupt my life, maybe at worst send me to the hospital, then I for sure won't graduate this year. 

I think that I'll be so much better when I graduate and get a job. It sucks so bad to not have money or a car or be independent right now, and I want to just graduate. 

And yet, I get depressed and I can't do a single thing about my schoolwork, so I might not graduate anyway.
