boringright now im laying in bed staring at the ceiling in the dark. i still dont have the motivation to put my clothes on. my sister said I was had no humor or personality and I boring and the only reason people like me is being I whine and cry  and they feel bad for me and that they only like me because Iâ€™m friends with her. shes my twin and we are both 14. sometimes she makes suicide threats. right now shes on an errand with my mom and i told my mom what happened. shes knows those are my insecurities and she actively exploited them to make me upset. i have autism. i was crying because i was stressed. thats how it started. she said im just doing it for attention. i dont want to live anymore. i just feel like a burden.
