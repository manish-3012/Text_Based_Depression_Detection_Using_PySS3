What can I do? I feel like I have no other option.Since I've been in college, I partied and slacked off my freshman year only to try to raise my gpa again while taking my hard chemistry courses my sophomore year. My gpa was still shy of the 2.00 mark where I need it to be to receive my scholarships again. I'm already $45000 in debt from private loans. My course of action was to take a summer course to receive an A and raise my gpa again. Yesterday was the due date for the first discussion and I finished typing it 15 minutes late (it was open for 8 hours and I had to work most of the day) my professor said no excuses and gave me a 0. At this point, it is impossible for me to get another A and I can't take out anymore loans. I play football and my coaches are constantly disappointed in me and make sure I know it. I have tried talking to the professor to make an exception and he wont. My academic advisor says it is too late to register for another course. Today, I've been contemplating suicide so I won't be in poverty the rest of my life.
