Anyone feel like they are getting close to not being here anymore?I dont think there is much to say on this matter besides I do- all the time infact  like one day I'll just wake up and get the courage to end it 

I've always told myself that I wouldnt because I have stuff and people to live for (the usual crud people tell you to think about) and if i did I'd wait until I'm old enough to buy a gun and be quick about it but i just dont know anymore
