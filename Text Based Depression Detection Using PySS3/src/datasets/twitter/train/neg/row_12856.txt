I'm going to die.I've spent the past 10 years of my life giving everything I have to one person. Our relationship officially ended just a year ago. Our relationship was strained, but it meant everything to me. I havnt gotten over it. Everything has only gotten worse. The only reason I'm still here is because I lied to myself and convinced myself that it would work out, and thst I had time to fix things. She just got engaged and it feels like my entire life has been for nothing. I feel empty. I can't shake this feeling of overwhelming coldness. I pile on more layers of clothing, and more blankets, to the point that I sweat, and I still feel like I'm shivering cold. Her name just keeps repeating itself over and over again in my head. I think I'm beginning to hallucinate. Over the past 2 days, the only thing I've consumed is a few glasses of water, because everything else makes me nauseous. Suddenly, all of the things I used to love have become completely uninteresting to me. I feel nothing, and I feel everything at the same time. My mind feels like it's racing at a million miles per hour, yet I feel like there is nothing there. 

I feel like my only escape from this feeling is death.
