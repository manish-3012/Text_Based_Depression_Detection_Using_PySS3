Iâ€™m just so tired. I want it to end.Today I saw my schedule for work. Another 15 hour work week. The holidays are coming which means the hours will go up but I started crying because I canâ€™t live off of that right now. I tried to get a 2nd part time job and was denied an availability change. Iâ€™m stressed 24/7. Iâ€™m in debt. My phone isnâ€™t on and hasnâ€™t been paid for months. Iâ€™m a hoarder and Iâ€™ve been for the most part keeping shit under control lately but now my roommate is complaining about flies and my secret might be exposed because every time I am under severe stress I start keeping trash again. 

I was talking to my friend about whatâ€™s going on with me. All she said was her hours were cut too but she isnâ€™t letting it get the best of her. She lives with her family, I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t have any family or a support system. I literally just moved out of a shelter and I was there for 5 years and I was trying to get an apartment but they didnâ€™t even help me because HIV positive people are the priority. I told my friend I might as well start selling myself for money because I canâ€™t find another job since everything requires experience or college and I have neither. I want to go back to school but I just want someone to give me a chance in the mean time so I donâ€™t have to worry about my bills. My friend then said to me how she doesnâ€™t deal with negativity weâ€™ll and to talk to her when I start to make sense. The truth is I will never make sense because Iâ€™m dealing with this on my own and this is my reality. I can be homeless. I barely eat or have any clothes because all of my money goes to rent and the people that donâ€™t even work hard or want to change their lives always get the handouts (I live in New York City). The system  here sucks. Iâ€™ve been trying to get help and because I have no dependents I just get swept under the rug

Iâ€™m so tired. I canâ€™t take it anymore. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do. I donâ€™t even have money to do small things for myself to at least have a little bit of happiness. I think of suicide all the time. But I donâ€™t have a plan or a means. People pretend they care but in all actuality they dont. My friend clearly doesnâ€™t care and just thinks Iâ€™m a burden and so does everyone else...
