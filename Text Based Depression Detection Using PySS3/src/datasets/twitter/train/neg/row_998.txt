whats better family knowing or suspecting?long story short.

shit live, not happy, making everyone else unhappy, no one checks in etc etc feeling sorry for myself and really kinda done with it all.

also i kinda see it as jumping in front of a car to save my families life...they WILL be better off without me for sure....i was told today that i scare them even though i have never touched them...

anyway to the point sorry...

is it better for them (2 kids and wife) if they know it was suicide or is it better just to smash my car into a wall at 120km/ph...

im leaning towards the car...as it will make payout by the insurers more likely and they may guess but not know for sure which i think would be more beneficial for the kids to get over. the wife could even say it was an accident and they don't need to know.

the only reason an overdose seem better would be the comfort but then 120 into a wall wouldn't last long...

thoughts?
