I have no reason to live so why live?I attempted suicide on the 4th of October 2020. It was my second suicide attempt, the first being in 2018. I'm already planning the third one and this time I'm going to make sure I succeed. I just lost my mother, the only person that really mattered to me so fuck life tbh.
