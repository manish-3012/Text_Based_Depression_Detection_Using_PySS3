I feel like I'm about to lose my mind.I've had suicidal thoughts since I was very young.  Attempted several times before turning 12.  I'm in my 30's now and those thoughts are back.  It's been a rough year, a rough life.  I've made many mistakes and right now so much is weighing on me.  My grandfather who raised me almost died 3 times in 2 months.  The doctors were telling us to say goodbye.  I used to see my grandparents twice a week, but since he go sick it's been months.  My six year relationship ended, which isn't a bad thing because he was controlling and it was mutually emotionally abusive. But it still hurts. I've struggled with ptsd for sometime now.  My dog is sick.  And the world is going to shit and nobody cares.  All my friends disappeared while I was with my ex.  And today I called the suicide hotline only to feel like they had no interest in talking to me.  They asked if I could try watching a movie and to call back if I really needed to.  My mother died when I was 14...and if it were not for that pain and knowing how it would hurt my own son, who is 4...I'm not sure I'd be sitting here typing this.  I feel so frustrated and alone...and angry.  And outside of my child I don't see the point in getting up tomorrow.  My aunt just had surgery yesterday for a brain aneurysm yesterday.  I just feel crushed by this world and it's getting harder everyday.  Knowing others have it so much worse than me makes my life seem even more wasted and pointless.  Sorry for the ramble....I just literally feel I have nowhere else to go at this point.
