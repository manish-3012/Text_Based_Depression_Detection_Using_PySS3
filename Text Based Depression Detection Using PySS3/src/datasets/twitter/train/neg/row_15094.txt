I want god to love meI was ready to die today, the weight of everything fell onto my shoulders. I was absolutely sick to my stomach, and I know itâ€™s the only option. I want gods forgiveness, I want to know that he loves me no matter what but itâ€™s hard, Iâ€™ve never felt gods love before and yet I crave it. God gave me gifts but they fell into the wrong hands, Iâ€™m cursed you know. Iâ€™m supposed to be gods miracle, the one to end the cycle, the one whoâ€™s supposed to be better. And yet Iâ€™m named after the person I despise the most and I feel as if Itâ€™s starting to grow on me. Im taking after him, the curse has begun its effects and I want god to stop it I want a burning bush at my doorstep and I want him to tell me he loves me and forgives me for everything that Iâ€™ve done because I know I wonâ€™t get it from anywhere else. I want god to be there in the end. Iâ€™d do it, Iâ€™m not afraid of death. I can do it. But Iâ€™m afraid of what comes after death, people have experienced gods grace but I donâ€™t know what to expect. I want to know that everything will be alright if I leave, that peopleâ€™s lives will only just get better. I have to die a believer, not like a coward. Death is my only chance in redemption, where I can truly shine in holy light, where I can be the best me possible. I want gods love I want it so badly. I want to be with him forever. I want everything to be right.
