i need help, this is my last outletiâ€™m tired of trying to force myself to get better. iâ€™ve been heavily depressed for the better half of this year. i donâ€™t ~want~ to kill myself but it just seems like my only option left. 

background: my name is mackenzie, iâ€™m 17 and live near chicago in kind of a nothing town. i live with my shitty stepfather, two stepsiblings, a halfsister, and my emotionally draining mom. my dad lives in the city, heâ€™s a good dad but weâ€™ve drifted apart just due to distance and our busy lives. i work with kids, and i really like my job, but i work all day every day and itâ€™s demanding and exhausting. i have a few good friends, and a boyfriend of a year, iâ€™m smart and do well in school, but i donâ€™t really have hobbies anymore (unless we count spending too much money on clothes or shoes). 

(re: my life is normal enough, and there isnâ€™t really a reason for me to feel this way)

iâ€™ve exhausted every reason in my life to stay, most recently my biggest reason to stay was my boyfriend but i realized thatâ€™s not a good enough reason anymore. he knows some of how i feel, but he doesnâ€™t know quite how bad it is. it really gets to him that iâ€™m not happy, but when both of us feel rough we just end up fighting. i love him, but not enough to keep suffering. 

i had big goals for my future and college but nothing excites me anymore. i have things in my life, but none of it is enough anymore. i just didnâ€™t care about anything.

i think i should end it. i just wanted my reason to be somewhere where it couldnâ€™t hurt people. 

no matter what i do, i always circle back to how empty i feel. i canâ€™t be happy anymore. i donâ€™t care about anything anymore. thereâ€™s not a single thing that scares me to leave behind, so whatâ€™s the point?

if you took the time to read this, thank you, and i hope you have a great evening/day/morning. i hope the reason you find yourself on this page resolves and you find what youâ€™re looking for
