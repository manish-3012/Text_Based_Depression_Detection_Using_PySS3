Bullying SituationI'm glad I can get things off my chest here and get some help. 

well, moving to a new school soon, since I was barely in my last one. Lot of people I know there, heh good right? friends? No. One of them despises me. My friends who hate me from there have told me he keeps threatening me, probably shouldn't worry right?

I should, the guy's a mental person, I know exactly what he can do, and with everything else inside of my mind it might just push me over the edge.
