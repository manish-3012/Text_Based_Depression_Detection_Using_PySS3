Stupid vent (I'm sorry)I fucking hate myself, everything about me. I hate my face, my bad skin, my eyes, my addiction to a mirror because it just makes me hate myself more, and I hate constantly caring about how I look, I hate my weight, how I'm never happy with my body. I hate my hair, my bad attitude, how I push everyone who tries to get close to me away because I'm so scared of getting hurt. I hate how bitchy I can be, how easily I get angry at people and how I struggle so hard to open up to people. I hate how I can't take complements, how I just annoy everyone I talk to and how I am so fucking blind to everything all the time. I hate how selfish I am and how I struggle to talk to people because I'm so scared about them judging me. I hate how I cope with my emotions and turn to self harm, I hate how I skip meals and end up Exercising until I'm on the edge of passing out because it's never fucking enough. I hate how I only ever talk about how I feel online anonymously because I don't want to just be told to deal with it or go see a therapist because Ive tried it but I'm too insecure to talk about anything. I hate my reputation, how I'm nothing but the girl with depression who wants to end her own life, who spends more time in psychiatric wards than at home and whose parents hate her.

Sorry for venting, I don't really know where to post this I'm just confused and need to get it off my chest I guess. Xx
