I'm the comedian because I've got nothing else to giveI'm the guy that's never serious when talking to friends. My social media accounts are nothing but jokes and quips. I do it even when everyone else is draining and everything is snarky. I find comedy easy when you have to fake it.

I don't want my peers to actually see the real me, the one that was probably sexually abused as a kid and then really was abuaed a few months ago. The real me is insanely pissed at himself that he doesn't even know what he wants to do with his life while others are actually accomplishing something. The real me can't see himself being of use for anything. The real me wants to die so that his anxieties and depression can finally shut up.

I'll edit this if something else comes up, but I've got nothing else to offer. Sorry.
