Tired.This ain't living, it's just surviving... and for what? Just to lose more and more each time? Just to see what I've worked towards my whole life slip out of my grip?

I don't want to anymore. Dying this year alone and a failure is just the same as dying in 50 years alone and a failure... I don't see why I should wait, nor do I think I can anymore. I don't even know why I'm posting this, just a plea for help that gets nowhere, like all the other times I ask for help.
