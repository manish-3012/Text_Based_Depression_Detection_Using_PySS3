"Seek professional help" which doesn't fucking exist in Calgary/Alberta whatsoeverSo fuck it. Fuck Rick and Morty, fuck the upcoming next year and decade, fuck humanity, and fuck anyone who still is stupid enough to love me.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing to live for. Nothing to justify this worthless suffering of an existence.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to fucking end it all. I'm either going to slice my neck open with a carving knife or I'm going to hang myself in the bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking hate humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking hate my family and friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking hate the mental gymnastics required just to function every day.

&amp;#x200B;

When most people say seek help, they mean shut the fuck up and stay locked up in the psych ward.

&amp;#x200B;

You all deserve pain and suffering, just like I do.
