I've just been informed my friend is seriously contemplating suicide. I don't know what to do.She was supposed to join my wife and I this evening for a show we watch together. After I heard about her intentions (from another friend of ours) I tried calling. She hung up on me and then left the following message on Facebook.

&amp;gt;I'm not coming over, STOP CALLING ME, LEAVE ME ALONE.  It's better if you don't care.

[edit] - Update: my wife was able to get a hold of her. She sounded really upset and didn't want to talk, but she respects my wife enough to not hang up on her. She wouldn't promise *not* to do anything, nor would she promise to come over and just have tea with my wife. We're both really concerned.

[edit 2] - Long night worrying. She facebooked my wife around 3:00am stating that she had been having several really bad days and with today being Valentine's it was really rough. She promised to come over for tea today and talk. So that's a start.
