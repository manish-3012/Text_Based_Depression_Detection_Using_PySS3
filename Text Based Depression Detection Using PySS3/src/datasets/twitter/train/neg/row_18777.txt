can someone help me make a decision?I have a violin lesson today. I study with a prestigious russian teacher who have taught several Julliard students. I suck at violin. I haven't been improving and my teacher, who is very caring but strict, is expressing distress. She was about to give up on me when another idea came into her mind. She decided instead of a regular weekly lesson, I can have more time to practice for, say, a month. Well this plan was only implemented last week and I haven't practiced since, because of my depression (not sure if that's an adequate reason, but honestly I felt like shit since last week). I go to college (I graduated high school a few years early) and I've been getting bad grades after bad grades. An 89% might not sound bad, but I expected a perfect score. That class was fucking easy so a B+ is just a horrible disappointment. I slept every second I had free, and even seconds I didn't have free. I took a day off work, that's fucking bad since I just *restarted* work at a place I left last year because of my sleeping problem. I didn't spend any time on my violin, I just slept. It's horrible, I'm ashamed, and I have a lesson in an hour. Should I cancel it? I feel so fucking inadequate, like a failure. I can't bring myself to disappoint her again, but at the same time I cant quit violin. I love it more than it seems to love me, and I'd be miserable without it. What should I do?
