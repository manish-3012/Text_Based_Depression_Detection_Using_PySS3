Feeling so much painI want so badly to just give up but every time I try, I think of my children.   My boyfriend and I are trying so hard to make it work but it seems like every step forward we take, we take another 5 steps backward.  I donâ€™t know if weâ€™ve kept trying for us or the kids at this point.  I donâ€™t see a future without him, but heâ€™s also the reason I hurt so badly!
All Iâ€™ve been thinking about is just ending it.  Itâ€™s taking more and more in me not to follow through with it :-(
I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore
