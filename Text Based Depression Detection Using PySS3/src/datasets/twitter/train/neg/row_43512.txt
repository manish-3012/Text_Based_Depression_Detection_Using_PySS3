I'm tired. I want it over now.31 years on this planet. Filled with every kind of abuse you can think of. Abandonment. Loss. 

And now the icing on the cake is a PTSD diagnosis thanks to 5 years of hell at the hands of my ex. Who I will never escape because of our son. This perfect little boy is a permanent link to the horror.

Ex will never stop. I've tried everything. This is my life now.

I'm tired. I want it over. I just want some peace. I've tried talking to people; what family I have don't understand, I see the toll this takes on my partner. I see the stress and worry in his eyes. I don't sleep, and when I do I have constant nightmares.

All I am is a burden. A useless, broken shell. I cannot add anything positive to anyone's life.

They would all be happier without me, and I would finally get to rest. That's all I want. I want to rest.
