I donâ€™t deserve my friendsTheyâ€™re literally only being nice to me but they donâ€™t want to really. They probably donâ€™t, itâ€™s just how my brain feels like that. I wish I had a friend who I just knew was nice and actually wants to be friends with me. Because who would want to be friends with such a big fat loser like me
