Me dying would make everyone feel so much betterIâ€™m pathetic for everyone. Iâ€™m a burden. Iâ€™m fucking useless. Iâ€™m fucking dumb. My antics are just plain fucking retarded and Iâ€™m a fucking moron. Iâ€™m literally an idiot who canâ€™t even fucking pass a social skills class. Why canâ€™t I just be like everyone else. Iâ€™ve tried forcing myself to be like everyone. Iâ€™ve tried social media but I can even fucking fail at something as simple as that. I donâ€™t even have any friends that like talking to me. My grandma said herself that sheâ€™s beginning to dislike me and that Iâ€™m a nasty person which is my fault. Life is so fucking stupid and I wasnâ€™t meant to be here and life would probably be more complete and better if I was gone. So many people would be relieved and happy. No more crazy projects like pager communications, quantum physics, orbeez bathtub parties at 6 am, stock market talks, and much more bullshit that annoys people. Iâ€™m literally pathetic and an embarrassment.
