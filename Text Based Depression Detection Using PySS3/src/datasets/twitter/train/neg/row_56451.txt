I tried to kill myself but failed because I was too scaredI was up all night contemplating on doing it. I was so close to just fall asleep but my mind just became determined to do it. I got a hose and got in the car. I must have sat in there for 10 minutes wondering if I should do this. Eventually I turned on the engine and I could smell the fumes coming in. It must've been about 30 seconds but those were the longest 30 seconds of my life. I was shaking the whole time thinking that this is finally it. My heart felt so heavy and breathing was very constricted. I turned off the engine cause I was too scared. Then I laid down in the backseat for about an hour. My lungs kinda hurt but I was just too tired to do anything. When I went back inside to my room I just wanted to sleep. I didn't think too much about what happened. I didn't cry. I laid down on my bed and I felt strangely calm. Then I fell asleep.
