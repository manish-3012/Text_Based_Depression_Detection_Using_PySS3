I don't know if my mindset towards death is good or badBasically I feel a sense of relief whenever I think about suicide and death. I no longer have to worry about anything in life in particular because hey, if things really go south I always have the option to kill myself right? If I die then I don't have anything else to worry about. Having a mindset like this actually puts my mind at ease.
