I donâ€™t want to wake up anymore.Ups and downs. Constant. Wanting to fit in, find a friend, find someone. Wanting to have a family. Wanting to have a place. Wanting to feel full. Constant emptiness, throughout my whole life. 

Trying to commit suicide since I was 11 years old. 
When does it end? How many more years of torment must I go through before I get the option to take my life when itâ€™s my life? 

Borderline Personality Disorder coupled with depression and anxiety makes life an utter bitch. People bully me for my personality disorder. It makes them walk on eggshells, when all Iâ€™ve ever wanted was to be loved and cherished. Or at least felt like I was. 

Nothing is ever interesting, or fun. I never do anything except watch youtube, browse Reddit, play video games. And repeat, and repeat and repeat. I havenâ€™t slept well in weeks. I think being in quarantine is adding to it, though I live quarantined even without government orders. 

What the fuck is wrong with me? Why doesnâ€™t anyone want to be with me, or be my friend? I think Iâ€™m a nice enough girl. I love art, music, video games, I make jokes all the time. But maybe the jokes are just a mask. Why donâ€™t you like me? Why canâ€™t I fit in? Why does this shit always happen? I havenâ€™t been TRULY happy since before age 10. Iâ€™ve just basically come to terms with the fact that Iâ€™m going to shoot myself. Everyone in my life is none the wiser. Maybe I want someone to notice. Maybe I just want them to stay away and let me. Iâ€™ve known since I was a little girl Iâ€™d die young. First I told myself Iâ€™d kill myself on my 13th birthday, then 15th, then 16th... and so on. But it never works. It always fails. Something happens and I donâ€™t end up dead. 

Iâ€™m touch starved, too. I want a hug. A genuine, warm, melt-in-your-arms hug. But I know damn well itâ€™d make me cry my eyes out, and I know nobody wants their shirt wet. I just have so much bullshit and baggage within me that I canâ€™t free myself of. I push everyone away, but at the same time, people leave me too. I havenâ€™t had anyone truly stay except my one friend, Ben, God bless his soul. I want nothing but the best for him. And I know it would hurt him when I kill myself, but I just want him to know and accept that iâ€™m pretty much a young adult, and itâ€™s my life and i can make those decisions for myself. Iâ€™m trying to figure out how to put on my medical file that if I happen to be dying for some reason, I donâ€™t want to be resuscitated.

Iâ€™m just so tired. Just so god damn, everloving fucking tired. Exhausted. 

Peace out I guess.
