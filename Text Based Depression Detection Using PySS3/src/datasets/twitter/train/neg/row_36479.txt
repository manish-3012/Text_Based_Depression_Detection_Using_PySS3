I know imma not doing it like never but Iâ€™m thinking about how to do it, the pain it will occur all the timeIâ€™ve got a really good situation and I feel like Iâ€™m doing everything I can to fuck up all my life half conscientiously like I know I am doing it but for somebody else and I feel like itâ€™s the right thing to do for one people saying all the time I did hurt her but I know I wasnâ€™t in wrong but I still do everything for this person even if she doesnâ€™t respect me, she talking all the time about leaving Iâ€™ m in an unhealthy af relationship with a person I love and that used to loved me but I think she donâ€™t anymore and Iâ€™m like lost 

(PS : Iâ€™m actually a dependant person on drug and havenâ€™t smoked since a week so I know itâ€™s linked, I have some family issue, Iâ€™m actually in a foreign country for a long time far away from all that I know with a friend in collocation that keep judging me on all the calls I make) 

Iâ€™m like lost and Tf I am wanting from here like is it going to help to talk to peoples I donâ€™t even know trying to help a people they donâ€™t know either 

I could write for hours pointlessly I donâ€™t even call for help I donâ€™t even know what my expectancies on writing here but here you go
