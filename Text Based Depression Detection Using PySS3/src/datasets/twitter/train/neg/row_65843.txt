I never want to bother people with my problemsBut today I've been having repeated urges to just end it all. I never tell anyone about my inner issues because everyone else has their own problems and I don't want to bother them with mine. I called the hotline but I feel I shouldn't be wasting their time because I'm such a coward I'd probably never actually do it as much as I really want to. I feel like a faker just for coming here, everyone can just ignore me and go onto the people that are actually going to act on their feelings.
