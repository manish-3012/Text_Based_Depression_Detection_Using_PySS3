She said it again...This year's an important one.

Where I'm from, the final examination for primary school will determine our future.

Today, I woke up crying. I had barely sleep because I kept hearing my teachers' voices scolding me. I kept on crying and crying even when I was taking a shower. 

I couldn't control it.. When I was supposed to get going for school, I couldn't move and just cried uncontrollably. 

My mother snapped.

She kept telling to stop but I couldn't. 

She tried a couple more times before she said

âI suffered much more than you are nowâž

I know, that's why I'm trying to fucking stop. 

It was stupid of me to cry, to ask for help but I am really tired.
