Can't decideI'm at the point where I'm failing out of school. My mom is on her death bed and I've always had chronic depression. My girlfriend got her degree and wants to be happy yet I just can't help the depression. She left me and was the last thing I was holding on too. I keep staring at my gun. Then I keep seeing my dog and deciding not too. I'm literally on edge and have been for days. My old friends stopped talking to me after they graduated frats are worthless. Drug addictions and alcoholism . I'm posting this convincing myself not to do it. I just don't know how much longer I can last .
