i'm so tired of being nervoushi. 16 y/o here, struggling with general/social anxiety, autism, and depression.

i'm so, so tired. for weeks now my head just feels like it's going downhill. the first thing i feel when i open my eyes in the morning is anxiety, sometimes with anxious dreams, the last thing i feel before i fall asleep is anxiety. everything i enjoy has become negative because i worry about it.

 school? difficult, my grades aren't perfect, i flunked a year, probably won't ever be able to get into a decent college and will just be broke my whole life like i am now. i don't have any money for college, my parents never saved up. friends? i'm homeschooled, rarely leave the house, don't have any irl friends, don't know where to start because i don't know how to socialize. not sure if full-time public school is an option because adapting and adjusting to new environments and routines takes a very long time and will probably reflect on my work. pets? they're going to die eventually. parents? they're going to die too, who knows when, but when they do i will be all alone and i will never see them again. my interests, shows i like, hobbies? i can't participate in them because i always feel like i should be doing schoolwork, or doing something productive, instead of the same damn thing i do every single day. 

everyday is the same, everything i do is pointless and i barely feel like a human being anymore. i'm so tired and so close to giving up because i can't do this anymore. i feel so lonely and disconnected, everything i love is going to die someday and i will be all alone. i can't keep procrastinating and doing the same thing everyday. i have no money, can't drive, don't have a phone, don't have friends, and just keep slipping into bad habits. i don't know what to do. everything seems so pointless and hopeless and i've wasted so much time doing this. i can't do it anymore.
