I want to end it, no matter what efforts I make, I just want to end itNo matter what efforts I put in like keeping myself busy, exercising, getting a job (which I was fired from) and trying to get help (my country's mental health services are a joke). On a quiet day or when trying to sleep, the dark thoughts become more intense.  


My family doesn't understand and can't help. My parents are the worst. On the night I tried to kill myself, a nurse gave me a phone to call them, the first thing my Dad asked was if I got a student loan?  


I realised that I didn't have any real friends, they went quite. I was at the hospital again and I was crying because they didn't speak to me. They were more upset that after a few months of no contact I decided to purge them from my social media. I tried to repair some friendships but it wasn't the same, they moved on with their new friends within my old circle and becoming social media narcissists.   


No matter how hard I try, I realise I'm truly alone and I want it to stop.  


I'm done with crap life
