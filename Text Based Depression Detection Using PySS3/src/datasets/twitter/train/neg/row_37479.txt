Had a horrible mental episode/breakdown yesterday. I'm so over this shit. I don't deserve to live.I get stressed out so easily. Especially during and after social situations. I let my emotions take control and go crazy. I hate myself and this world so much. I took a pickaxe from a construction site and started smashing and breaking things, screaming and crying. I got arrested, almost got tazed for carrying a deadly weapon. I don't know what's wrong with me, why I do stuff like this. I don't know how else to cope sometimes. I feel like such shit. Nobody can deal with me, nobody will ever understand. I can't wait for all this to end, I just need to man the fuck up, stop being a coward, and tie that rope around my neck and this suffering once and for all. I need serious help but it doesn't seem to be available no matter how hard I try. I'm just a crazy, alcoholic piece of shit. That's how it's going to be till the end. Death is the only thing that will ever comfort me. I'm really not cut out for this world.
