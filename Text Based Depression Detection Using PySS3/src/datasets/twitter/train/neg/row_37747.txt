21 years old, My life was almost a success. Now i feel like a failure.Sorry for spelling mistakes. Hello i am too scared to write this on my main account, but i idk what to do so pls help me. 

I am a 21 year old girl from the netherlands and in my last year in a university and want to go higher. Always had high grades and have great friend irl and online. I have been working on my body and i finally like the way i look.

My problem is that i was emotionally abused as a child and it really stopped when i was 18 years old, bc my sister wanted to commit suicide and my parent saw how much damage they were doing. I love my parents now and i don't hate them but i have still depression and big anxiety from it and always had it. 

I am doing internship for the first time and i am always scared as fuck. Every hour i am living in fear and it hurts crazy. I took a break for 2 weeks and went to therapy. I got some advice and will do emdr therapy and hypo hypnose. Tomorrow i will start again with the internship just because i fear that i will not succeed it if my break is longer, but my anxienty when doing my internship still excists greatly. 

I feel like a failure. How tf am i suppose to work like this? No clue if i should just do therapy and next year an internship or both. The reason why i wrote this here is bc i have been kinda suicidal the last 3 weeks. Not attempting but thinking about it a lot.

I thought i was doing better. I was really suicidal as a kid and early teens. That became less when i was really succesfull at school. I thought i found my dream job with a good salary. Now i feel like i can't finish my last year so all the hard years of learning and working on my mental health on my own, is for nothing...
