I told my therapistI opened up to my therapist today about childhood sexual trauma that I experienced. I can't even type the words to specify any more details than that. It was extremely difficult and she witnessed some pretty bad tics that I don't regularly have. It was a relief to get it off my chest but it was also like kicking a beehive inside of my head. I'm just getting stung over and over again by intrusive thoughts.

 It's been weighing on me all day. I feel sick just thinking about this.

 My roommates just went to bed. I really wish I could talk to one of them. I have 3 roommates. I've known them almost 3yrs now and I've only talked about it once with one of them almost a year ago, shortly before my last hospitalization. We never talked about it again. I want to open up to my other roommate but I can barely think about it without feeling extreme discomfort. 

I hate feeling like this. I hate feeling so alone. The only way to get away from this horrible noise in my head is to just end my life.
