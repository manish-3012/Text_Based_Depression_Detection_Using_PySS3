Feeling lostI remember that I used to feel excited about things. I've always been easily distracted, but it used to be usefully distracted. I remember sitting in libraries and getting an all-over-warm-and-cozy feeling from the orange-yellow overhead lights, the smell of old paper, and the stacks of books that cordoned off readers like great walls. I used to get very relaxed and lean hard into that feeling until eventually I got inspired to do whatever it was that needed to be done. Sitting in libraries now, I only feel anxious, unworthy, or bored, no matter how long I sit there or how hard I search for inspiration. I remember watching movies and being pulled into the world they created, imagining myself as a superhero, master thief, ancient knight, world explorer, or space traveler long after the credits rolled. Now I just watch movies to kill time until I can get back into bed. I remember the rush I used to get before I went out with friends to a bar to celebrate making it to the weekend. Now I only get a rush when I take that first drink and realize that falling asleep tonight should actually be pretty easy. 

The worst part is that the last few years of my life should have been some of the best. I have a wonderful girlfriend who loves me, I've gotten to study at Oxford and travel Europe...but it's all felt like a chore. Like the part of me that enjoyed life shrunk five sizes and has to drag the rest of my bloated carcass around everywhere it goes. I'm not sure what to do to feel excited again, but I'm beginning to think that this is just what adulthood feels like.
