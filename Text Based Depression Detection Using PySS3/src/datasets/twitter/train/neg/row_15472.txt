How do I tell my mom Iâ€™m about ready to commit suicide without making her feel guiltymy mom took away electronics because Iâ€™ve been spending too much time on them (Iâ€˜M not on for more than an hour a day since school started because Iâ€™m busy). I was actually happy today. I felt confident in myself and was ready to study hard and enjoy life. Unfortunately my mom said out of the blue that i couldnâ€™t be on electronics for anything other than school. this knocked me down where I was before and I have a literal plan to kms right now as a result. My mom kinda sabotaged my only healthy coping mechanism rn and I just want to die. I love my mom but I need to tell her before I stick my head under a car
