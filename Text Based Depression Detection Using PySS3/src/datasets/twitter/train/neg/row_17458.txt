Iâ€™m going to end it all tonightIâ€™m 18 and Iâ€™m going to graduate in a few weeks. Iâ€™ve had no friends and hell Iâ€™ve never even had my first kiss. High school has destroyed me and i canâ€™t suffer anymore. I donâ€™t want to go to some job where as long as Iâ€™m doing a task they could give a rats ass about me and I would have to work for over 40 years. My parents donâ€™t seem to get me and say stuff gets better and that everything will change after highschool but I have a very strong feeling thatâ€™s complete bullshit. I donâ€™t see myself making friends or getting into a relationship in the future and every second a live it slowly kills me. I know that nobodyâ€™s lives are perfect but seeing people have friend groups and dating makes so fucking jealous and I would kill to have something like that. The only thing that has kept me going is drinking and even that is starting to become ineffective. I want to just take a bath and sit there for an hour and just do it and shoot myself. I love my family but thereâ€™s only so much pain I can take.
