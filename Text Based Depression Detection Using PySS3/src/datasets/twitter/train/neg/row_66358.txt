im killing myself tomorrow morning and i feel more at peace then i ever hadmy depression has been so severe for the past month and after struggling for years iâ€™ve come to the realization that this is it, its never going to get better than this and i should just stop while iâ€™m ahead. ive had a shitty life but also wonderful, great moments and i feel at peace dying tomorrow accomplishing everything I have and doing the things iâ€™ve done. iâ€™ve been holding on for my friends and family and partner but at this point the pain is too much, im failing most of my classes and I dont see anything getting any better. I wasnâ€™t made for life and every breath I take is a reminder of how broken I am, how god put pieces that donâ€™t fit together and how much Iâ€™ve been struggling to make them work. And i am so, so tired. So this is it. I have the pills and iâ€™m working on my note now. I have enough in my savings so hopefully my family is financially burdened by the costs of my death. I feel so, so bad and selfish for hurting the people close to me but I canâ€™t do this anymore. I just canâ€™t.
