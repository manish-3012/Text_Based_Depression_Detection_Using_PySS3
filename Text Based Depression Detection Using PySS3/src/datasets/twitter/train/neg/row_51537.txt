Idk why I even bother again..M/24I'm tempted to just attempt it again.. for once in my life.. I'm just crying like crazy.. I've been suffering from depression lately.. can barely eat or sleep... the most i could do.. is sleep for 30 mins... end up just waking up crying... because everything i know of my life.. has ended... i have no one to really talk to in real life to comfort me..  the person who i'm in love with... told me she likes someone else.. it just hit me so hard.. idk what to do.. i thought to myself that i'll be okay... but in reality.. it just hurts so much.. that i wanted to kill myself just to end the pain... idk if anyone would even miss me.. To anyone who cares... thanks.. i guess  but i'm tired of just suffering,  nobody wants to be with me in real life.. i'm just a messed up person after all.. even i know how much no one wants to be with me... but all i can think of right now.. of how much i want to die because of how much i'm suffering, i'm crying while writing this..

Thanks for whoever reading this..
