Can't keep going for much longerProbably gonna end it soon. I doubt posting here will help, but figured I'd give it a shot.
The person I would normally talk to about this stuff stopped talking to me and doesn't seem to care anymore. I guess it's getting pretty obvious to people that I'm not doing well because my teachers are pulling me aside to talk and ask if I'm okay. I just say I'm fine. I will be turning 15 in a month if I live that long. I'm failing all of my classes, but I pretty much gave up on then a while ago. Again, I don't see how someone could help me at this point, but lots of people post here and then say how it helped them. Thanks for taking the time to read.
