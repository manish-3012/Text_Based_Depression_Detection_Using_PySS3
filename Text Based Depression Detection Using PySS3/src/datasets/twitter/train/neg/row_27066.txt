I wish I could get the coronavirus and die without infecting anyone elseI'm immunocompromised. If I get it, I fully expect to die without ever going to a doctor or hospital. I don't want to spread it, so I hope I don't get it, but goddamn. I'm fucking tired and heartsick and I don't have any kindness left.
