Internet friend says he wants to kill himselfI have a internet friend who lives in Russia, and he has it pretty shitty. He's Bisexual in an extremely homophobic country, is adopted and has dead birth parents, and his adopted parents hate him. His older brother treats him like shit, he has pretty bad health problems and seems to genuinely have no real life friends. Almost all of this I have been able to verify via Skype calls and whatnot and I'm really concerned about him
