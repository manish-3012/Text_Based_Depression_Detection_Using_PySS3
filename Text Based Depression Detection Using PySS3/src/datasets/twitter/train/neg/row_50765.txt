I want to die, not for any particular reason.I have pretty bad anxiety and depression and Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts before but never to the point of making plans, up until the last couple months ago, that is. Now anytime Iâ€™m alone or sometimes when I first wake up I just get this overwhelming sense of dread and I want to die. I start thinking of ways to do it, and how badly I just donâ€™t want to live. My life isnâ€™t too bad, thereâ€™s a lot of stress but it could be worse. I just donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore. Even as Iâ€™m writing this I feel the urge. I hate it but Iâ€™m too scared to tell anyone because my parents canâ€™t afford to pay for treatment and I sure as hell canâ€™t.
