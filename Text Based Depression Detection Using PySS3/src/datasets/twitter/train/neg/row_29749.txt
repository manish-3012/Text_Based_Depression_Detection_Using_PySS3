I'm in an awful cycle that's making everything so much worse.I haven't had a bout of depression this bad in years. I tried to do the right thing and get on medication, since I can't afford therapy, but the meds hit me like a freight train and I was falling asleep at my desk at work.

I stopped taking them, and that sucks too. Now I can't sleep until early morning, and then I oversleep for work.

I know it's just a job, but it's that one extra piece of stress that's exacerbating the whole cycle of depression and stress and anxiety. I'm starting to ask myself why I should bother, if this is always where I end up. I can't even be a functional person. It just definitely doesn't help the feelings of worthlessness. I'm getting so tired of trying, and I wonder if it's worth it. I'm starting to think it's not.
