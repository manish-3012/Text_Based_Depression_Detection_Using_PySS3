Cheating on my wife and ruining our familyI had recently had an affair and my wife found out and left me. By all rights that was the right thing she did.I had thrown everything we had built out the door and hurt everyone I had ever known. My own mother and father don't respect me anymore. 
 The guilt I feel for the pain I had caused is overwhelming. The woman I had the affair with is also cheating on me. Karma I guess. Alot of people would agree. I have always bounced and ran away from any guilty feelings or messes I created, but this time. It haunts me like a bad car wreck. Everytime I close my eyes I see nothing but pain and hurt in both my wife and myself. I can not deal with the shame, guilt, and pain I feel anymore. About 3 months ago I had a rope around my neck ready to go. I do t know what snapped me out of it that time. But now I believe the pain is too much and I wish tomorrow would never come. This just might be my last night if not tomorrow will be my last
