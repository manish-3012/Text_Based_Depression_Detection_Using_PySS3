I'm a worthless waste of space and I plan to end my life.I'm 25, unemployed with a Finance degree, squandered all of my opportunities, a virgin, a general waste of space and now my friend is giving me the boot so I have to move back in with my mom. Diet and exercise did nothing. I'm in good shape and it's changed nothing about my life.

I've attempted suicide a few times and it's been a little over 2 years since my last real attempt. I'm angry at my friend and probably won't speak with him after this. He's hurt but I feel like hurting him and ending my life will end my suffering.

I can't live like this anymore. I will never go back on psych meds again. Why can't I keep a job? I'm drowning in student loan debt and I'm so lonely. All I have had to keep me alive are video games, and those are no longer doing the trick for me. I stopped applying for jobs long ago. After 1,000 apps, 3 interviews and no offers, I'm done. I refuse to work at fast food.

All I can do is cry, I even gave my mom the heads up that I need 2-3 days to cry....little does she know that I plan to end my life in the next 2 months. I guess now it's time to get my affairs in order and start writing the notes. Nobody really cares about me anyways. I just hope my grandmother (fuck you dad) doesn't take my passing too harshly.

I wouldn't wish my suffering on anyone. I started feeling depressed when I was 4 and started thinking about suicide at 11. Nobody deserves to deal with what I have dealt with. Unfortunately, the only option I'm seeing is death. I hear him in my sleep and it's getting stronger and stronger. No longer afraid of nothingness or being eternally damned to a Hell. It cannot be worse than now.
