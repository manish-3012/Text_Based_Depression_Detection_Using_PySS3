Contemplating life...Hello Iâ€™m a 16 year old male. While this may seem like just teenage angst posting on here itâ€™s not. Iâ€™ve been depressed for about 3 years now been on meds for about 1 year and they havenâ€™t really helped me at all. My parents are constantly fighting and Iâ€™m pretty sure theyâ€™re both cheating on each other. My grades have been bad all of my high school career as a junior and Iâ€™m constantly scared for the future and what my pathetic life would hold. I would try to talk with the counselors at my school but Iâ€™m too embarrassed to. Iâ€™m also really jealous of people Iâ€™m in a class of at least 600 graduating and hundreds are on the 4.0 list I always get jealous and beat myself up. I keep telling myself I am a failure I donâ€™t know what kind of colleges would even accept me at this point. Sometimes I feel relief just thinking about putting a rifle to my head, and ending it all. Pretty sure no one would actually care anyways
