I'm scared for myselfI have been having a really tough time coming out to my parents as transgender. I was born male and have been living knowing this since I was 10. I'm 22 now and I told my parents who pretend to be ok with what I want but really aren't. They push me, they hurt me and my sister upon hearing this is really hurtful to me.

I am so scared for myself because after a huge fight with my dad, seeing him cry for the first time in my life, seeing him yell at me more mad than anytime in my life, all in one hour, I went online and searched for suicide drugs. Methods. I have always been happy and never thought this moment would come.

I have calmed down now but I have had this detailed plan for weeks to go get my eyebrows done, my whole body waxed, get professional makeup, get hair extensions, nails done, etc. to completely look like a girl (I have a feminine face / body and cross dress all the time getting by in public).

Then wear a red dress, get in my bed with lots of roses and rose petals. cut my wrist to bleed all over my bed and dress.

I'm Scared I keep getting closer and closer to this. But I don't want to call the cops, tell a friend or anyone. I want to save myself from this. I want to live a beautiful life as a transgender. And I know I can. This scares me because I'm so close to being pushed off the ledge. How can I help myself?
