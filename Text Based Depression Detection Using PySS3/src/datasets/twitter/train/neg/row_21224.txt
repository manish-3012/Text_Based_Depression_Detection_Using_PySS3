I think I need to be institutionalizedI've been thinking about suicide a lot lately, and I've even tried it a few times. I also self-harm. And despite every inch of my being screaming at me that writing this is selfish, I need to ask before I do something horrible: Is there a way to get institutionalized voluntarily if I think I am a threat to myself (and others)?




Like, if I tell my psychiatrist or therapeutist, will they be like: "Lol no, get lost."? Can I do something in this situation or do I have to wait for another session to tell them about this? And if I tell them, will they even take me seriously?




Please help, I know that this is really really selfish, but please, do you have any suggestions or advice? I am truly sorry for such a stupid question, feel free to disregard it.
