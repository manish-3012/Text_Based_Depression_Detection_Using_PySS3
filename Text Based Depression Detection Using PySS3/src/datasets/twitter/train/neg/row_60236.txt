I'm tempted to kill my self.I keep telling everyone i think i might be depressed but they all keep telling me it's just in my head. If it's normal to feel this shitty every day then i can't bare it. Every time i'm depressed, i recover for a week and it comes back. I can't fucking take it anymore. How does everyone else live like this?
