I wanna run away or some shitI've been wanting to do this for a while. I want to run from my life leave everything behind. Start a new life in some obscure part of the world and never look back.

If I can't run away then im probably gonna take up drinking and smoking weed again (mind that I'm only 14). I've been trying to convince my friend to get me some more weed and it's taking forever.

And if I can't run away or just get away from my family and their ability to make my depression and anxiety worse then I don't know what I'll do. Im probably not gonna kill myself till I'm at least 18. I've got dreams but with the road I'm on they're never gonna happen so if things get better in the next four years I'll probably survive.

I don't know what im even saying anymore it sounded so much better in my head but thanks to anyone who read through my ranting nonsense. I appreciate everyone on this subreddit. You're all great people. Never give up because for you it can get better I promise.
