I'm DoneMost days I wake up and question why I was given another day. I dread the fact of getting up and putting on a fake smile so that everyone around me will be comfortable and happy. All the while I am slowly dying on the inside piece by piece. If you ask anyone for help they won't help you. Friends and family are worthless and all everyone cares about are themselves. I was raised to care, show respect, help those in need and treat people how you want to be treated. 
Well in those 26 years all I've had happen is I've died on 2 occasions and almost never made it through my birth. I had a drug problem for a few years and I'm never going to get out of debt. Plus all I ever see is happiness all around me. Friends with their girlfriends or S/O always having fun but. When I try to get a girlfriend(or even just sex) all that ever happens is NOTHING. After a couple months of talking and a couple times standing me up what's the point when I am the problem.
So here I am, alone, deciding what would be the best way to make everything stop. I am worthless to everyone I know and clearly selfish for this thought but I can never do anything right so there is no fucking point in bothering to continue. Bye
