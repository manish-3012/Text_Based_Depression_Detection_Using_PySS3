How to deal with potential suicidal friend?My best friend says she wants to "leave". It sucks that she feels like this. She's the only real friend I ever had and I can't lose her

She says she's tired of everything and nothing makes her happy . She says that the only reason she hasn't gone through with this is because of me. She says she can't leave me knowing how much my life sucks

So now she's making me feel guilty that she can't leave? How tf do I respond to that
