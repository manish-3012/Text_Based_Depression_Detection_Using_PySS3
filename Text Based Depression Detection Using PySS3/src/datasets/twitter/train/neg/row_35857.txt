StrugglingSo I had planned on finally killing myself. I had everything ready and a day and placed planned, but made the mistake of talking to a good friend. He lived several States away and I made sure not to tell him exactly where I was, so thought he was safe to talk to. I didn't want him to stop me, nor to help me...I just wanted to say goodbye to someone who actually cared and who understood (he has been going through similar difficulties). Unfortunately, before I could go through with my plan, he was able to reach out and contact my Command. I ended up spending 12 days involuntarily admitted to a lock-down psych unit, and have another 2 weeks of therapy to complete as a step down from being locked up like an animal. I know that my friend cared, but at the same time, I wish he hadn't interfered. I have been going through Hell for the last 22 years, and am exhausted from fighting this. I feel like my heart is being ripped out. I am trying to get help, but the themes I am receiving is either 1.) they want to medicate me (I have been on 5 different meds, none of which really helped, and all of which caused bad side effects) or 2.) My pain and misery is all my own fault and I am miserable because I chose to be miserable. I am currently in the process of losing everything that brings meaning to my life, and already hate myself. I could sure use some sort of encouragement or some reason to keep fighting, because right now I just don't want to fight this any more.
