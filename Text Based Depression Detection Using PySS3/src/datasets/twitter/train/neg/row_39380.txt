Are there any actual reasons to live?Logical there seems to very few reasons to live. Unless you worship one of the many "gods" or follow "Happiness" inducing things such as drugs, sex, power. 

There are plenty of stock humans to resupply even if half of us died. So we no longer live as communities, just hermits in our homes most of humans can't even grow their own food and rely on super markets. 

It use to be that each person played a vital role in their village and family. Friendships and family ties were close. Now it's... Only reason to live seem to be based on false teachings or selfishness. Ofc there is dedicating yourself to something positive, but other than that, I can't think of much. Opinions?
