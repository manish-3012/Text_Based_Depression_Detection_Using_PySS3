i wanna dieeveryone i ever loved didnâ€™t want me or left, my life is in shatters and iâ€™m sick and tired of fighting 

itâ€™s not gonna get better 

i have nothing left to live for anymore except my beloved cats and i donâ€™t even take care of them as well as they deserve and someone else could offer them so much more than my tiny messy flat 

all my life has been so incredibly painful i just canâ€™t do this anymore iâ€™ve been past my breaking point for a long time 

i just wish someone would love me
