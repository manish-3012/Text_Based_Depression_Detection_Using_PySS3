Ive always sort of lurked this sub, never wanting to sub to it because i didnt want to be seen hereBut honestly i dont care anymore. It gives me hope when i see people who are feeling like shit, grow and get better through people in this sub. Dont get me wrong, im stable and havent had a thought of ending myself, i just wanted to leave this heartfelt message
