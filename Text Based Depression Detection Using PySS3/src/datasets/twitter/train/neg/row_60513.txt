No sign things will get better......everything has been stacked against me for a long time.I just got terminated by my second trauma therapist because my trauma and suicidality are too severe. I had 5 surgeries in 18 months for stage 4 endometriosis and botched surgeries and am stuck in DC because I needed the financial support of my birth-family (who are the ones responsible for my severe trauma, which led to my suicide attempts). I was supposed to move from NYC to PDX but got stuck in DC bc recovery has been hard from the last two back-to-back surgeries.

I want to move back to Portland but there are no available (none accepting clients) EMDR or IFS-trained trauma therapists there. I have romantic feelings for a former therapist (that terminated me and treated me like crap) and it's been 18 months and it's not going away despite no contact. My friends care more about work than me, even when I actually lived near them in NYC, and I'm always cripplingly lonely. I've been in severe chronic pain for 18 mos and gained 60 lbs from high doses of pain meds and I hate how I look, and am struggling not to drink again (I'm 4 years sober). I get monthly ketamine micro-dosing but it doesn't help. I have lost almost all of my friends because even before all this, the first surgery, was too much for them. They just ghosted, all of my friend and my two best friends. And I don't think I can trust people anymore, I find it hard to believe that anyone is good.

I don't know why to keep living. I don't see myself ever getting the help I need, and I haven't felt passion or even interest in anything in a really long time. It feels like life keeps shitting on me, and like I'll never get a break. I feel completely hopeless and like whatever I do, it'll end badly, like the world is stacked against me.
