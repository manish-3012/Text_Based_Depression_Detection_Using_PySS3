Just need reassuranceHi guys -

You helped me [a month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/uvwqe/he_cheated_on_me/)  when I was stuck in another city by myself and had found out my boyfriend had cheated on me.

Well here I am a month later, we tried to make it work, but then I found out that he continued to see her. 

I know I'm a great person, but right now I'm feeling pretty low. Last night I was feeling really dark and couldn't muster the courage to do any harm to myself, so I decided to go for a walk in an area where I thought for sure I'd be attacked, but somehow the fates want me to live.

I don't know if I'm especially suicidal right now, but I just need reassurance. I feel like i'm going crazy. I feel like it went from me being the sane one to they psycho one quickly, and I think he's manipulating me. 

I don't know if this is the right reddit for this, please help.
