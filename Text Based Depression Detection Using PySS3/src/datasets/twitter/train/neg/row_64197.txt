I got hit by a train and now I don't know if I could physically stand up to go commit suicideMy arm is broken, I'm missing one of my front teeth, I have stitches in my face, my leg is broken from the knee down, it could take over a year to learn how to walk again, my parents found out I smoked weed and sold explicit pictures and videos of myself. My face got fucked up in the accident. I have no way to reach out to friends or trusted adults. I've had problems with suicide and self harm in the past before I turned 18, but now it just seems much more hopeless, there is nowhere for me to go, I feel isolated and stuck here. I feel like the entire accident is my fault, my friend got hit too, with a much worse outcome than me. I honestly would not mind this being the last thing I type, I with I had died on my first suicide attempt so things wouldn't have gotten so out of control. I think I was supposed to die young, because it seems like things have only gone downhill. I have multiple therapists I could talk to but my parents won't leave me alone with them on an online meeting, this is the only way i think I can reach out without them being involved, I've been racking my brain for ways to end my life but every way I can think of requires me to stand up and walk, I think I could do it, but using my walker is loud, uncoordinated and attracts too much attention from my parents that are also in the house. I don't know what to do anymore, this is one of the only ways I can think of to reach out.
