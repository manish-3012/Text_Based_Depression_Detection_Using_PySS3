What should I do?Either death, or trying something that might work, it won't make my thoughts go away though. Or is it just another way to prolong this meaningless and painful existence, due to fear of dying? I didn't think of myself as being a pussy, but It seems that I am a coward on top of that.

Nowhere to go, nothing to do, only some sort of service would make it worthwhile, but do I fit e.g. Police forces? It's not that I'm unstable, it's more what is inside of my head.

I have been acting, pretending whole my life, noone noticed, so It's fine, I doubt anyone will.

I have more empathy than is required, a paramedic bachelors degree, I always thought of a work where I'd help people, since I know how it is to be abandoned etc. Fight crime, do stuff. I keep saying, that I want to save others, while unable to save myself.

I don't mind the blood, or smell, dead people, I did CPR, but it didn't work out. I'm quite cold, empty inside.

Unfortunately my life is like 0000000000000000000000000000000... and my future work would be just +1 among all the things that I hate.

Not much else to say, really. 

Papers are filled, I might go next week, but I'm not sure. Process is long, not that I care about it, or even want to do it, I'd rather die If I could somehow, fast and painless, but I see no way to do it.

My paramedic internship in an ambulance and in the hospital was quite nice, most importantly that was one of the things I wanted to do, but it's not rewarding financially, and the reality is not what I expected. A vast minority of people need real help, or any help at all. I don't think Police is any different, to me it's a force that exists to persecute people, and just look for an opportunity to fine them. 

It's all fucked up either way. 

I saved a draft, but I might post it. I know that many people have a calling of some kind.
