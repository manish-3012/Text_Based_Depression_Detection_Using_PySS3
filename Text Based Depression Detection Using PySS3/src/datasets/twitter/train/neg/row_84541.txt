waitingSince the age of about 15/16 (22 now) I have been suffering with depression and anxiety, at first it was no an issue, I always go over it but as time has gone on it has only gotten worse.

During this time I have almost completely isolated myself from everyone in my family, except for my dad who I live with (I'd be on the street or dead already if it weren't for him letting me stay), what few friends I had going through school I have completely lost touch with. Now my anxiety is so bad that I can't face people I don't already know for more than a few minutes at a time.

I can admit that I have always been *really* lazy, taking forever to get things done and sometimes neglecting them altogether but now I can't even push myself to do anything. Even playing games on my PC, they quickly become old and unenjoyable, some people might say I'm growing out of them but these games are my only escape from life. The few activities I have I've lost interest in completely, sometimes I tell myself I'm going to do it and then fail to do so, I don't know why.

Now, I stay at home, unemployed and in my room, alone, watching random TV-series to pass the time until I finally get the courage and the means to end my life. I feel like I have no one close to me, my dad has given me so much and looked out for me for so long I'm surprised he hasn't kicked me out yet, but I still can't tell him how I feel and I know killing myself wouldn't do him any good. It makes me wish I could just evaporate and make it as if I never existed. 

I'm not posting this as a plea for help, nothing anyone here will say can make a difference too me, I just wanted to right this down.
