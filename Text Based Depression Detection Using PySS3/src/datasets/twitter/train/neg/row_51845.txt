What's The Point of Living The Rest of My Life With DepersonalizationI hate this. Not being able to feel anything. Looking at other humans like they're aliens. I'm hurting so much and I can't even express it. No one understands. I just want out. The one thing that would suck if there's no afterlife, is that I would never get to experience what it was like to be normal again. It amazes me, though. That I can't understand how humans work, yet I still bother to study Japanese and can understand it at an intermediate level. I mean, why even bother to continue learning it? My love for Japan is gone. It was once the only thing keeping me alive. The only thing that made me feel human. But my mental burnout made me lose that passion. I just wish I could me again. Perhaps in another life...
