I know a guy.I know a guy who had a lot of opportunities in the past but he fucked it all up. He always try to thinks one step ahead but he never make it, failing before he even get there. He had a chance to have a family with a girl who compatible with him on everything and their kid but he ruined everything and he ends up alone. He is a coward, if he wasn't such a coward he wouldn't lost all that. He had the option to stand up and keep walking forward, not like anyone gonna hold him down but he is the one that keep weighing himself down with all the guilt. Every times he try to push on his guilt come back and kill off any motivation he may have had. I hate that guy with all my gut, but i fear that one day, his guilt gonna consume him entirely and I don't know how to stop it, or should i even try to stop it at all.
And that guy is me.
