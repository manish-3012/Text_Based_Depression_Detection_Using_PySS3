Turning 31 on Thursday. I (still) don't know what to do with my life, and I don't know where to turn...I work at a job that I absolutely loathe, but I have to work there just to pay the bills.  I don't have many friends, not seeing anyone.  No pets, nothing.  My bank account exists just for paying bills, and I literally feel like I'm in prison.  Like life itself is just a prison sentence that I'm out here serving.  It's just like shackles.

Even while I type this it feels like my arms are in chains.  I just want it all to end.  I'm so tired.  Most nights I just want to sleep, and sleep for good.  When I sleep I have like the best dreams of living another life.  Almost like the parallel polar opposite of this shitty underachieved life.  It's so much better than constantly waking up to this bland dull existence where I'm mired in debt with no real hope for getting out... and I'm turning 31.

Does anyone know of any pills out there?  I don't want to go out violently, I just want to sleep.  I don't want to be me anymore. I want this body to be put to rest so we can call it a day.

I never even lived, so to the greater world it will be as though nothing gained and nothing lost.

I feel like I failed so, so miserably at life.

I just want to close my eyes.
