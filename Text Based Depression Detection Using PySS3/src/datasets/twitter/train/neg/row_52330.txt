It's too muchI'm giving up.  I've been suicidal off and on since I was a teenager (I'm 24).  I've been suicidal nearly daily since my last attempt in November and basically I'm done.  I'm so tired of the pain that I'm in everyday.  Medication doesn't seem to help despite numerous changes.  I've been in therapy since October, and while it worked at keeping me alive until now, I've come to the realization that I'm just a lost cause.   I've set a deadline (March 17th) and now it's just doing it.  The thoughts of how are more and more intrusive and everywhere I'm at it's just like you could kill yourself by doing this or that.  I just can't live this way anymore.  I don't even know why I'm posting this other than to get it out in the open.
