The peace you get when you seriously consider suicideI'm listening to songs from when I first wanted to commit suicide and I'm tearing up. That poor soul, he decided to keep living and what did he get? 14 years of misery, of false hope, of loneliness. I wish I could have comforted that person crying in his dorm, having not eaten in 3 days. It doesn't get any better, you are fucked and in for years of torture, better to end it now, death isn't as bad as existing in pain with no end in sight. If we had done things differently from the start, maybe we had a chance, but how could we know all the answers. We lost heart at a young age, we felt different, not like the others, defective. We would spend most of our life trying to hide this part of us. We abandoned the idea of God. I'm in lots of trouble now, in too much debt, mentally ill, no friends, there's no room for me to grow. There's peace in the idea of ending it, no more hiding, no more problems. I think I'll be gone soon, I need to find a good method. I wish I could have done better, for my younger self, for my parents, but it just wasn't in the cards.
