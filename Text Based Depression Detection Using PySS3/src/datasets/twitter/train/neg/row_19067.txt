I don't know I feel like I just don't care anymoreI don't care if I die, my boyfriend of 2 and a half years just left me and doesn't feel the same which is horrible as he's the only person to actually have seen me of value and on top of that I hate my new job and in my solitude I forgot how much I hate myself. I'm only not because I care so much about my family and I don't want my ex to blame himself as I know why he did it and I wouldn't want to be with me either but I don't want to keep living.
