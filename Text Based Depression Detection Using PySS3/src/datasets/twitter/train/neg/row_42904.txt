Close to the endAnd I know this, because I am sitting here on Reddit saying so and pretty much doubt it will matter.


I have no family.  My abusive mother died a few months ago, I've had not contact with anyone else.  For all they know or care I'm dead in a ditch somewhere.


People keep fucking blathering about getting help - well, I tried.  i've been in and out of short bursts of useless counselling for a couple of years.  I made on cry just from hearing my story.  Another said that she considered me an imminent suicide risk, but that she was obliged to discharge me anyway.  I'm now told that while I need therapy, I am not eligible, because I have no support system.

No one near enough who cares enough to support me though it.  That's the punchline for more than 40 years of life.  I have no one.  I'm ill but I can't get help to get better because I'm too ill to go through it.


I've been trapped indoors for weeks now.  I can't get out of the house.  But I have no where to go and no reason to go there anyway.  I'm broke, unemployable, and there is no way I can pass the government test for financial help when it comes round later this year - not because I'm better but because they move the goalposts 


I have no one, nothing, no prospect of this ever getting better.  I have nothing to live for.  No reason to keep going.  Why am I still here.  There's nothing in this world for me, there never has been.  I wish I'd killed myself as a teenager.  It didn't get any better, it's been years of miserable fucking suffering for nothing.


If I had a gun I'd do it now, but not in this country.  I wish I could just go.  I wish I could walk to the end of the road and step in front of a bus.  At then it would be done with
