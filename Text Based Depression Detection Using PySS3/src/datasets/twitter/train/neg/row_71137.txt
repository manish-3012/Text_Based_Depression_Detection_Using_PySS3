i lost faith in god so now i want to diehi. i am a 19 yr old girl currently in my second year of college. i love cats and pasta. i have been living in turmoil since my sophomore year of high school. i've been self harming on and off during those years as well. last year i believed in god with everything in me and that consumed my life and i was happy. this year i went a different route and decided to explore what else there was. now i don't know what to believe. i use to feel like i was apart of something bigger than me and that i was helping humanity in some way. now i feel like a self absorbed, useless, and weak individual. i am convinced my life is basically meaningless at this point and am ready to end it any day now. anyone have any experience with losing faith and depression?
