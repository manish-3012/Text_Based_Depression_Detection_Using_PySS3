Here it goesWell I've posted a lot lately on two sub reddits including this one, however after recent circumstances it's evident what must be done. I'm finished with all of this, it's not worth it. The following is everything I've always wanted to say.

I hate my life. You would know that if you listened to me for once. I'm scared of living. It's such a shit world to be in. What's the point anymore? We're all dying, so what if i go early? I never asked to be a part of this, but it was forced onto me.

I loved you. I fucking loved you. Why the fuck would you kill yourself in front of me? I have never fucking understood that. You said it was my fault, was that your bullshit way of punishing me? If so, it worked. I wake up in cold sweat when i see it under my eyelids at night. 

You were a good friend. I don't know why you ended your life but i hope death has treated you well. Maybe I'll stop for a visit sometime, catch up on all the reasons you did it without saying anything. I could've held you, told you i loved you, i could have helped. If only i knew something was wrong.

You're a piece of shit. Why did you make me hate myself so much? I hope you fucking realize what you did to me and i hope you live with that guilt forever. You deserve nothing.

Stop spreading fucking rumours about me, it's getting old. People don't need to know all of my life, inside out without my permission. So stop. 

Why did you even date me? You always stare at other guys. Always smoke and drink when i beg you not to. Harm yourself when I say no to you. I don't understand. I just wanted to make you happy, i guess i wasn't enough. 

Good game motherfucker. I almost had you. 

Everything else, that can die with me. Thanks for bothering to read this i guess. Good luck out there but farewell.
