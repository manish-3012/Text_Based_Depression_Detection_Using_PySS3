I'm stuck in my mind and tried calling for helpI want to preface this by saying that I have a good life going for me. I'm a good looking dude,smart,fun to be around, the people that I meet generally enjoy my company. Situational wise I live with my family as I attend uni. Good school that I have a fullride to. I know there are less fortunate people out there and it makes me sad that I am in the place that I am no, I don't enjoy anything. I wake up with no drive, I stumble through the day with no energy or no care, I sometimes think that if I died right at this second it would be the same as if I was alive. I know my family and my friends would miss me but it wouldn't matter I'd be dead. 
I've tried to not feel the depression. Go to the gym, get some new hobbies but nothing is working. I've reached out for help from my family. I talked to them about my problems, but theyre a bit traditional. My dad's dad died when he was 7 and he had to carry his family out of poverty by himself so he doesn't understand what I am going through. My mom tells me that I have to have the willpower to get better, but that's the problem is that I don't have the willpower to do anything other than sleep and do nothing. I've come to their help on many occasions and they keep suggesting the same things of waking up early and going to the gym and willing myself to get out of depression. This third time however, dad told me that I need to man up and leave the house. He said I should go do whatever I wanted to do and said "you have a car, back when I was your age I left to go work without a car. If you want to go kill yourself, go be a man and do it." 
I don't know what to do other than search up easy ways to commit suicide.
