My purpose...It's a cruel joke perhaps for I am not a functional member of society, I could never be, I can work but only a few weeks after that my body hurts, depression takes whole and I'm left to compare myself to those who seem to do anything but work, they would hold more than 2 jobs and never give a second thought to their very reason of being.  


What a joke it must be to have all these thought, all these questions have an eye for the beauty of the world, have the compassion for all living things, all the love on people and places and having no money or loved ones to shared them with.  


I'm do not excel in field, I don't even exercise my profession, I'm not a good writer or a good photographer, I'm not good at putting my thoughts into words, describing people or places. I wish I'd be religious (Not really) so I could say "I am cursed" it would be such an easy thing.  


So I serve no purpose for me, for the world, for loved ones, I thought before that taking my own life would be a tragedy or a selfish act because there's always family and/or friends who would miss you, after all we don't experience our own deaths, but now not so much, I mean sure some people my remember me my family would mourn for a while but that would be all, they don't see me, they only think of me so not much would change.  


I know as I've been on the other side reading this, I know that there are people who really care and don't want me to do anything foolish, rest assure I won't for I promise myself I won't and I wish to travel, however I'm afraid I would die before I accomplish this if I do so I hope I can still write to you and share pictures.  


So I am insignificant, what I see, what I feel, wherever I go, nothing and no one will remember me or care, everything would be in vain... forgotten, isolated, segregated, marginalized.
