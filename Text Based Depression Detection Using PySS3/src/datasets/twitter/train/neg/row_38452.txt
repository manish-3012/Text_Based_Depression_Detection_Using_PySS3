A note that I'm gonna send to my buddyDude I know you feel like dying. I do too. The one thing that keeps me going is my family. I was once told, "suicide doesn't alleviate pain, it only transfers it to someone else." This statement has kept me alive for nearly two decades. I know that my family would feel a combined pain greater than what I could ever feel. At times it makes me feel stuck but mostly I feel motivated by it. 

I can't tell you reasons to stay alive because I struggle to find the meaning myself but you should keep going. I believe that when we die, it will be the same as before we were alive... so nothing. This keeps me going because it doesn't matter what happens now: go crazy, live the best you can, swim with sharks, test death, because it doesn't matter. Now you have the chance to do things and when you're dead, you can't do things. Find something to look forward to, even small things. Just fuck it, let life do its thing and ride the ride. 

I've found a lot of help talking with the suicide help line 1 800 273 8255. It helps just to rant to someone. They don't try to push anything on you and it really is a good stranger to just dump emotions on. 

All I want to say with this is that you're not alone with your feelings. I cannot understand how people feel the feeling of loving life but like i said, I can't stop existing because my family will lose their minds. But I've felt the want to stop existing for most of my life so just know that you're not alone and you're doing better than me because you can express your feelings to friends where I am too solitary to rely on friends. Take care, find something to look forward to, and keep struggling on for existence; because shit in the light is better than nothingness in the darkness.
