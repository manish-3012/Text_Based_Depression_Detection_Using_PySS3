Dont even know what to title this. I'm fucking hopeless.How are normal people not completely hopeless right now? All I see is bad news. There is no possible way for anything to get better at this point. I don't care if this sounds selfish, but I don't want to live in a world filled with pain and evil. I just want to fucking die.
