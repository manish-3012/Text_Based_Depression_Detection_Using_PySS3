Seven tries, more of me diesIâ€™m 19 and have lived too long. Iâ€™m your classic quiet nice guy at the party that sits by himself because it hurts too much to talk to anyone. Iâ€™ve lived with epilepsy, frequent seizures, insomnia, depression and chronic stomach reflux problems for the last 10 years. It hurts too much to carry on. I have great support but want no part in helping myself. Iâ€™ve done nothing but fuck things up and make peopleâ€™s lives harder since I started working, and too all of them, Iâ€™m sorry for wasting your time. I know Iâ€™m not alone, but after seven failed suicide attempts and an impending drug addiction, I canâ€™t look beyond that. I have no history with reddit, but thought Iâ€™d at least say goodbye to strangers since thatâ€™s all anyone is to me anymore. Thank you to all of my supporters over the years, I know things could be worse, but Iâ€™m making this decision, itâ€™s time to go. I have the ratchet strap and ladder in the garage ready for tonight, maybe eight times a charm. For anyone who cared to read this, bless you, I hope you find more in your life than I did.
