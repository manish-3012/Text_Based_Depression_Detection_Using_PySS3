Is wanting to commit suicide attention seeking?I get depressed quite a bit. To the point I feel like ending my life a lot. I was talking to someone today and they suggested that it is seeking attention. 

I don't think I can agree with this statement. Why would one want to seek attention with suicide it is beyond me :(. Anyone?
