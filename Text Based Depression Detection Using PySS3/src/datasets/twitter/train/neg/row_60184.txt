i dont think i will make it very far?i dont know whats happening to me anymore, 

the panic attacks are becoming more silent and are longer,

im starting to feel the dysphoria in my spine,

im starting to realize how much my life isnt planned out,

im growing tired of the long empty nights in my head,

i miss the hugs and kisses from his lips,

im tired of constantly fighting against people i wont win against,

being trans and gay will always be a crime in someones eyes,

i just want my bear back,

i just want to be someones chipmunk again,

i just want cuddles,

i want my future lover now,

before its too late and my last breath already taken, 

i just need love,

i just need a hug before its too late,

before i give up because right now im okay but i know i might not be in the future,

im sorry.
