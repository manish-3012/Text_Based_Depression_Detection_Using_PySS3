My parents are noticing that something clearly isnâ€™t okay about me, but how do I tell them I am feeling suicidal?My parents are starting to worry about me. They noticed how distant I am from everyone now and how I just want to be alone in my room and laying in bed all day (whenever Iâ€™m not at work). 

Yes, I am not okay. These thoughts are getting heavy and I have been frequently trying to figure out how to end my life. Anyways, thatâ€™s not the point of this question. 

My parents have a history of being angry whenever I talk about my depression. They refuse to believe anything to wrong with me. They just think Iâ€™m being a brat whenever Iâ€™m sad, but itâ€™s so much more than that. Iâ€™m just afraid to tell them because the thing thatâ€™s making me suicidal is completely out of their control and my control. 

How should I have this conversation to them that I legit want to kill myself?
