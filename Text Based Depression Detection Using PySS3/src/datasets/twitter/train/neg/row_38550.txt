Pretty sure tonight is the night.And i dont feel calm like I thought I would. I feel no peace. I feel broken hearted and panicked, because I wanted so very desperately to make life work. But I cant. Nobody deserves to be homeless. Nobody deserves not to be in 1 stable place long enough to keep a job to have a little money. Or not to be able to even afford a bus pass everyday to get to work. Its been 6 months and it wont get better. Im tired of stress. Im tired of hurt. Im tired of wonder. Im tired of instability. I cant hold on any longer.
