Well, I'll admit it, I'm a zoophile.Yes, you read that right. I experience sexual attraction towards animals, and I'm fully ready to kill myself over it. Not at risk right now, but I will be actively trying if this keeps up.

To make it clear, I have never had sexual relations with any non-human being (or human being either, for that matter). Although I do fantasize about it and sample all sorts of pornography involving such a thing. I'll admit, I wish I weren't into this. I know how wrong it is, and I try desperately to keep my consumption of it ethical.

But I crave death because of it. To know that I'm such a fucked up person, and knowing that most of the world is in agreement that I deserve death, I can't even take it. And what's worse, I can't say the people who favor my execution are truly wrong. I can't really think of a reason that someone who so frequently has abuse on their mind should be left alive.

So, in conclusion, I'm not deserving of the gift of life, no matter what way you slice it. Go ahead, change my mind.
