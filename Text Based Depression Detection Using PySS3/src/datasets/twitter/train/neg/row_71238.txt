just need to let it out...i recently just moved to the beach which has always been my dream... nothing is turning out the way i want it to. i am a senior at a new school and it is really hard cause i do not know anyone and all my friends are gone...even close friends do not even talk to me anymore. all my relationships with guys fail.. i cant even hold a stable relationship for a month which makes me ask myself... whats wrong with me? i have also been working hard to get into college but it seems as if my hard work is not paying off. if i do not get into college, i think i really will kill myself. recently, i have been failing classes and i know college will be way harder, i dont know if i will survive college. the only thing holding me back from ending it all is my family. i cant bear the thought of bringing them such devastation. i know my problems arnt as bad as those who post here... i jsut wanted to let it out. thanks for listening reddit....
