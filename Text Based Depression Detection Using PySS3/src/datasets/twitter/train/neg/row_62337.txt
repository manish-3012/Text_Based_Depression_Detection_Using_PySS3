I cheated on herThe one person I swore to protect, I would never hurt. I fucked up. I tried to leave but she threatened to harm herself. I stayed because I'm afraid of being alone and couldn't stomach the thought of putting her out. This is the only option I feel like I have anymore. I broke up with her again tonight and I've written my notes. I really don't know what to do.
