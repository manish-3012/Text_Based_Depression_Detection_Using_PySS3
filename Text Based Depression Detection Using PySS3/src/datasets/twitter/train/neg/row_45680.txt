I want to die but everyone keeps lying to me about how much i have to life forMy depression started up in mid March of this year. Ever since then it's been on and off but progressively worse. Now its just the final straw. Im tired of not being good enough for my parents. Im tired of being alone 80% of the time. Im tired of feeling like im taking a backseat on life while all of my friends hang out, hook up, and just enjoy life like i never get to do. Im tired of being such an awkward fucking useless excuse of a human. All of my hobbies are creative driven (like poetry) and im shit at all of them and have no talent whatsoever. Im tired of being alive. Everyone just looks at my grades and says "wow i cant believe youre sad you have so much going for you". Fuck you I would kill to be anyone else. I want to get off o this ride i never signed up for. One less person for everyone to deal with
