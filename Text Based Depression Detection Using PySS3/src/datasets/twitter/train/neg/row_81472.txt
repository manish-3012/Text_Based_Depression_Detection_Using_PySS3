I feel trapped.I feel depressed and I hate every single day I spend living. It feels like a never-ending cycle of either being disappointed or being bored as hell. I've went to my local doctor and he literally asked me a bunch of questions about my life and then gave me a number and told me I seem to have a good life. He told me that there were people worse off in life than me. I know that and I couldn't care any less, I'm still hurting everyday. 


I barely have any faith in improving any time soon. I'm not gonna be getting any medication and I don't have that much faith in therapy. When I have depressive episodes I don't have them for a reason, I just feel down for no reason. Not only that but it's probably gonna take months til I actually start getting therapy and even then apparently the sessions are only 20 minutes long.


I can't kill myself either because I would completely destroy my mother's life and I really can't do that to her. I don't know what to do, I'm so sick of living like this.
