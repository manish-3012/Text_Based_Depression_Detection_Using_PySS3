It Doesn't Feel Like Living AnymoreMy partner and the love of my life left me. We had a terrible breakup and they called me an abuser, a terrible person, and a monster. I was being abused when we met and they saved me. I wanted to spend the rest of my  life with them. Now that they're gone, I just don't want to live anymore. I never planned on a life without them. We used to be so in love and it hurts so much. When I'm awake I'm thinking of them and when I'm asleep I'm dreaming of them. I still love them and they never want to see me again. I can't do this anymore. I want to die but I keep failing. My roommates have me on suicide watch but if I want to I know I'll find a way. I don't want to live anymore. I hate this. I just want to die.
