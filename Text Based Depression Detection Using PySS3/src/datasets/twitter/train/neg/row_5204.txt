My life is so fucking boringSchool, school and more fucking school. That's all I've done the past 16 years on this fucking rock. I'm bored. Yes I can try something new or do this or that but that's still boring. I wish I could just fucking go in my car and start a new life somewhere and actually be done with all this drama and bullshit.
