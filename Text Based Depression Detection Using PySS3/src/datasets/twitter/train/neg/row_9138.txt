i feel so guilty posting heresome of your guys posts are about how youâ€™re already in the process or are planning to kill yourselves. 

iâ€™m contemplating breaking up with my fiancÃ©, deleting all my friends on facebook deleting all my numbers and throwing my phone away and running into traffic. 

i just left my mothers home, iâ€™m 18. everyday that iâ€™m at my moms iâ€™m yelled at, i donâ€™t have a bed a room i canâ€™t use my tv. iâ€™m told iâ€™m not a good person and that iâ€™m lazy and i wonâ€™t get a job. 

i was abused by my father for a really long time and i just donâ€™t see any end to this. i just want to end it myself. i find it hard to talk. i want to admit myself to an impatient place but i know it wonâ€™t help. iâ€™m so scared. idk where iâ€™m gonna be sleeping tonight. 

i just want to end it all.
