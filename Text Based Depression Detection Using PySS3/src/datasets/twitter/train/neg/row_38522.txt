I really dont know what to doI am at wits end.....i am broke and unemployed and have very little to no food left....im hungry because i was trying to ration my food as best as I can.
I can barely sleep and im feeling very tired all the time.
Im 21 and life has been sucking lately alot.
I am feeling very suicidal.
