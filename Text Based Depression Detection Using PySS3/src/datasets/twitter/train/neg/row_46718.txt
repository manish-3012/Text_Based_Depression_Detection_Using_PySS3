im a lazy depressed piece of shit who will never be happy and its all my faultim the most priviledged white boy cracker ass fucker on planet earth with no fucking challenges at all in life but i cant fucking for the life of me try to improve myself or be happier

i fucking hate my body, i want to be a girl but im not fucking willing to put any effort into it and i just fucking rot away in my shitty fucking body everyday hating myself

i treat my wonderful girlfriend like shit because i really just cant fucking feel anything anymore, i love her deeply and that shines through but the instant gratification i can get always fucking comes first. im so addicted to any instant gratification and anything that makes me feel fucking good because theres nothing in my say to day life that makes me actually happy.

and im fucking considering suicide (which i probably wont do in the next years, but 100% will eventually) just because i hate school, it makes.me so fucking depressed just going through the same hopeless fucking slog everday for shit that will never matter in my life just to be tired because i literally cannot fucking sleep

tl;dr have no motivation for life because of hopelessness and require tons of instant gratification
