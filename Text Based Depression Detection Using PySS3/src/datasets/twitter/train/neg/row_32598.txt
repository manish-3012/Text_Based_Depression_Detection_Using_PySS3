needa talk to someone20f with ptsd


I've been struggling a lot with ptsd symptoms + feeling suicidal and I think I might j need to talk to someone, preferably someone. But I can't talk to my boyfriend/friends/family bc everyone would panic and I absolutely do not want them to stress out about this. Honestly talking to anyone would be so incredibly helpful but if anyone has experience w ptsd, anxiety, depression, abuse, trust issues, loving someone w an addiction or anything of that sort, that'd be killer.
