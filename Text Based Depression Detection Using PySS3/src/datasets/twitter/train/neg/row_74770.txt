A question about therapy and suicidal thoughtsI have suicidal thoughts regularly (the extent is irrelevant) but I'm very wary of getting therapy and being honest about what I think/feel.

&amp;#x200B;

If the therapist were to intervene by having me committed, I'm afraid that that would just make problems worse once I eventually got out. Payment, missed school/work, being outed as suicidal to my family/friends etc. I guarantee I would still feel the same afterwards, probably even worse.

&amp;#x200B;

It it possible to get help and be fully honest about the full extent of my feelings without fearing repercussions?

&amp;#x200B;

If I can't feel safe enough to fully confide, why the hell should I bother?
