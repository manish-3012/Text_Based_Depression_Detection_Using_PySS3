There isn't a single live chat available to over 25s in the UK after midnightI've looked and basically unless you're under 25 or part of the LGBTQ community, the only live chat for people with suicidal thoughts in the UK closes at midnight. I've found that response times aren't very good on 7 Cups of Tea plus they don't want you talking about being suicidal there.

It's really frustrating and upsetting that there isn't anywhere to have a 1 on 1 online talk. Or even a chat room would be better than nothing. Some people aren't comfortable talking to someone like Samaritans over the phone.
