The temptation is realBeen really stressed, both mentally and physically. Pushing my self hard everyday even tho most of the days I can't think of anything positive I still push.
Tomorrow I have around 1000 miles to drive. The temptation to just hit a tree at full speed is real... Fighting it the best I can, but God damn that's tempting...
I've had a rough life and I know shit gets better, but I'm just so tired...
I really want to do it.... 

P. S.
