I'm mediocre at everything, even stuff I used to be passionate aboutI can't even enjoy doing stuff I loved anymore because all I can think about is how shit I am at everything. I'm not invested in anything now, I just do things because I need to. What's the point of going on when I'm just passing by life. I have no value as a person. I can't even be a good friend, my insecurities hurt others and drive them away. I just want to go away.
