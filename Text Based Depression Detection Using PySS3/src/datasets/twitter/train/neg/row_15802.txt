Feeling depressed and anxiousOver the past week I've been berated online and in person by many people. I feel like a worthless piece of crap. Go through my comment history and you'll get what I'm ranting about. As for real life, a certain individual has berated me for the past 2 years Everytime I see her at my church. Constantly berating my guitar playing, personality, jokes, hobbies, and everything that she thinks is dumb. I can't go on like this.  I feel if this goes on much longer I might impulsively try something. Don't know what to do.
