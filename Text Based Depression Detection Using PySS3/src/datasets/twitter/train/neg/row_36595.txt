One mistake, and its all over.Well, I cant say Im at the point of trying to die quite yet, but Im on a quick road there. Ive been living at my folks house to try and save money so I can try and achieve my dream. Well this morning, I was getting into my car to head to work, and forgot to put up the garage door. I ran into it and dented 2 of the panels. Once again, instead of progressing forward, all my money I try and save is going to go to fixing the door. My dad already thinks Im a moron, this just proves it. Ill never realize my dream, money is the only thing that matters in this society. Im done, I hope I get the will to end it. I jsut had to vent. I had to tell someone.
