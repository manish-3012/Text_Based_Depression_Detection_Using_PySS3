how does therapy help anyonelong story short iâ€™m really suffering and have been for so many years. iâ€™ve finally decided to see a gp for meds over summer, but i refuse to try therapy. 

i donâ€™t see how it could help at all? what can someone say to me, expert or not, that i havenâ€™t already heard, seen, or thought of myself? i donâ€™t get it?

and this isnâ€™t belittling therapy. it really helped my boyfriend and my best friend but to me, it seems like they just wanted someone to talk to? and i donâ€™t want or need that? so i just donâ€™t see why people wonâ€™t stop recommending it to me?
