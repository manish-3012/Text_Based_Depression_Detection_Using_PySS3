Day... Idk... 42 I guess?I have no idea how long I've been suicidal. It feels like an eternity. Everyday it's the same thing. And yesterday I screamed in the car when going to work cause off all of the built up stress in me. I walked the rest of the way cause my father threw me out of the car for that. And during work I almost, multiple times, screamed at a customer. I still think that things will get better no matter what. But the thought of just going to the street and walked in front of a car kept coming in my mind or taking a knife from the restaurant and slit my wrist in the toilet.
