Been 2 months sinceThe last attempt. After medication I still wanna be set free but all of the suicidal feelings gets too tiring and scary. I remember my heart beating the whole night and me waking up like 13 hours later then being dizzy the rest of the night. I wasnt even interrupted and still survived. My body just wouldn't quit . Sigh... If it would had worked I be sound asleep or in hell . Either way I could had been free from all my troubles.
