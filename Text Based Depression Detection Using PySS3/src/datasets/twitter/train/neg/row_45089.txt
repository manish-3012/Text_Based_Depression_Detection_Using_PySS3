I keep a knife in my backpack so I can commit public suicideReasons why:

There's too many people suffering and I can't bear it. I can't help them in any way.

Loneliness and shyness - have barely received any messages in the past 2 years

Having autism

Schizophrenia

Guilt from making hundreds of people believe (something) was my passion, when really it was just something I liked, for years.

Parent problems and me wanting to move out.

Feeling like I have no future without schizophrenia and I have to suffer.

Wanting for love and sex.

Not wanting to say reasons for suicide.
