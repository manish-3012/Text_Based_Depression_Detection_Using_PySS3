I'm JohnHi. I'm John. I recently saw a post on here that was from a high school student, which made me think that I could post here too. Im in highschool. I'm very introverted, very geeky, and girls don't like me. I only have 2 good friends, whom I drifted away from due to not seeing them in forever. Any new friends I try to make just... Drift away. I recently made a new friend. For the same of anonymousity ill call her X. X and I became good friends, and I really liked her. Recently, however, during a bad stretch in my depression, she said we couldn't talk anymore because she was trying to fix things with her boyfriend, who cheated on her. Now I feel so.... Alone again. I'm constantly picked on, for a number of reasons, and I honestly feel like, had I been given an option, I would hav commited suicide long ago. If I can find a way to kill myself tonight, or tomorrow, I just might take it. I'm sick of everything, and I just ant to end it. I Doubt anyone would really miss me, anyway. I hate the world, and I hate life.
