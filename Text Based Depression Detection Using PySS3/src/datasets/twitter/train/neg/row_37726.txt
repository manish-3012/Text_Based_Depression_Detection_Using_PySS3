I just can't live like this anymore.I just can't do it anymore. I've talked to counselors, I've talked to friends, family, coworkers...I just don't have a legitimate reason anymore. My life is shit. I'm broke. I'm disabled. I live in a shit house in a shit town. The only people who care about me are the ones that I reach out to...and I'm forgotten again as soon as I close out the chat window. 

I've hurt people and used people. I've been hurt and used. I've been abused and raped and assaulted. It's just too much weight to bear anymore and I just can't live with it. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
