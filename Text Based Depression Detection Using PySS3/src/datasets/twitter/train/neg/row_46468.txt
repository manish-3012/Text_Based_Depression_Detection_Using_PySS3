Life with depression is a roller coaster...and I want off. I'm getting really tired of the ups and downs. I'm just not sure I can really handle going through this cycle of being happy and excited and positive, then crashing down into feeling suicidal and tired and bitter out of nowhere.

For the last little while, I've been feeling fine. Let's say three weeks. Before that, depressed for three weeks. And before that, good for two months. Bad for a month, good for two weeks, bad for three months, and on and on. Whatever, you get the idea. I don't even know if all the good stuff that happens is even worth it when I keep fucking it up after a short while.

Three weeks ago was when I started medication and I felt amazing. I thought it would be the magic pill and I'd be fine. Today, I came home and out of nowhere, the thoughts of suicide come up. I'm telling myself, "Just jump, you're a bad person, stupid, worthless, who do you think you are, fag, you can do it, don't be a pussy. Train, rope, bridge, pills, exhaust, take your pick. Who would miss you, you friendless fuck? Why even bother?" I'm purposely just looking at myself and finding things I hate with my body. I'm tired. I don't want to get out of bed. I know it's the beginning of another dip.

But I'm trying to stay positive. I really need someone *who has depression* to tell me that shit turns golden. Or at least that it's worth it. It's easy for people to tell me that things will get better, but if they don't know what it's like to fail repeatedly when you try really hard to be happy and functional, they can fuck off.
