Tired of looking like a monsterIâ€™m 28 and have dealt with mild to moderate acne since I was 17. I eat clean as fuck. Drink gallon of water a day. Whole Foods. No dairy. Skin will get decent for a few days then goes back to hell. Itâ€™s destroying me. I hate going out now. I prefer to be in my room. At least no one will have to see my face. Going to work is a nightmare. Since I work in a restaurant surrounded by people everyday. I just want it gone. I want the stress of it gone. Iâ€™ve never been suicidal but itâ€™s starting to sound good now. Wonâ€™t be in misery anymore. Donâ€™t know whatâ€™s after death but has to be better than this shit. ðŸ˜ž
