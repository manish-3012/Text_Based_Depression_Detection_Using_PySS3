I can't cope, too much stuff is pushing me to the edge, i don't know what to do. i can only see one way out. 20 shitty years, it's never going to get better.There's so much shit going on in my life, I had severe bullying all through school (being attacked, other people trying to get me in serious trouble [other students using my account to google for child porn, drugs and weapons] other students trying to burn me alive, knives held to me etc..) this was just the start of my miserable life, if had severe depression and anxiety ever since, I had a really fucked up relationship including some memories of it I had flashback recently that make me think he was planning to either badly hurt me or rape me, my parents make my life an absolute living hell, they use anything they can as ammunition to make me miserable, i can't afford to move out and i dont know how much longer i can live here, i have 1 friend, no money and spend almost all day just shut away staring at the walls.

I'm also transgender which causes me so much depression and my parents would never be ok with it i've had to hide it my entire life, i'm 20 now and it feels like if i leave it much longer it's going to be too late. 

I hate my life completely, i can't find any hope for my future, i think i might just end it tonight.
