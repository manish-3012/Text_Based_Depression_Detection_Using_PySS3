man i'm just so fucking tiredi really just want to die. my first ex up and left. i don't know how to explain it because nobody would understand. my second most recent one lost feelings for me after almost 3 years. i can't get into relationships anymore because they always end in heartbreak.

that and i'm just a complete and total failure. i failed my first two semesters of college. my mother constantly yells at me. i find it near impossible to open up to my therapist. i have no friends outside of the internet. i'm a controlling bastard. i'm a fat fuck who eats and eats and eats. i have a plethora of mental illnesses. i'm at risk for alcohol addiction because genetics and i'm already feeling the temptations. i don't get it! why am i cursed like this? what have i done to deserve this?

i'm even too much of a pussy to off myself. to end all this pain. that means i'm even a failure at going out and ending it. it'd be so easy. i live right by a highway. i'm on pills that could kill me if i take too much. so why, why won't i just end it? there's no end in sight to all this. i'm tired. i'm exhausted. i can't do this anymore. i just want to die. i wish somebody would come and do it for me.
