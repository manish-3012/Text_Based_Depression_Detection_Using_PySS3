LostIâ€™m a current student study in the college for first semester. But the fact is, i did not study, I pretend I am a good student but now Iâ€™m a lot bit tired of doing that. I havenâ€™t been to the class for like a week. I donâ€™t know what am I doing in the class and I donâ€™t have a good grade in any classes. I loosed my motivation to do anything. 
I did not care that much about the friends in the new college, they are all rich and they are all like a freaking successors unlike me, I looked like I am a good student but no, Iâ€™m not, I seriously canâ€™t force myself to come to the school. 
During the days off of the school I slept for 10h in each days, Iâ€™m not tired but my body told me to sleep.
I donâ€™t know if this is the right time to quit the school, I do not, I want to end my life but Iâ€™m trying for a week to cut my wrist. 
I did not success. 
I should go to school for the in class essay unless I really decide to out of track. 
Thatâ€™s all of my mumbling words, I might write more words in some days.
