I'm SorryI'm sorry to my teachers that they had the displeasure of teaching me. I should have killed myself before they had to deal with the referred embarrassment and annoyance. I'm sorry I didn't get the message that I can't do the things I wanted. 


I'm sorry to my parents for not being the kid they wanted. And to the rest of my family for not being what they wanted either.


I'm sorry to the few people other than my family who'll miss me for any real amount of time for causing them to miss me. 


In short, I'm sorry to most of the world that I existed. And to the rest that I don't have the strength to go on existing. 


Years ago, I tried to strangle myself in the break room at work. I knew nobody would come by for hours. But it didn't work, and so I just went back to doing my job. I still wish it had worked. I've only been steadily losing my ability to feel anything good since then. I've melted into my mask and lost myself.  

All the people who are grossed out by me will be happy that one more tranny is gone. That's the one thing i resent. That resentment seems to be the only feeling I have left. 


I have no immediate plan. But it feels inevitable.
