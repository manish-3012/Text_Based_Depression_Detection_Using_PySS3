I canâ€™t handle realityI have to spend all day trying to distract myself because once I remember whatâ€™s happening and what my life is I want to die. I donâ€™t know how to keep reality at bay. 

Iâ€™m so lonely. I have no friends and no one wants to be my friend. Iâ€™m tired of getting rejected. I now have to watch the girl I was falling for date someone else. She rejected me. 

I have no one to turn to with anything, good or bad. Iâ€™m so alone. Iâ€™ve had anxiety and depression for years and SSRIs donâ€™t help and venlafaxine makes me black out and do stupid shit after like 3 drinks and Iâ€™m tired of alienating people. 

Iâ€™m in medical school and Iâ€™ve wanted to be a doctor all my life but I canâ€™t keep going when itâ€™s so hard and the idea of having to do anything for the rest of my life is horrifying to me. 

Waking up is so disappointing and every day I wish for a freak accident to take me. Im tired of trying to push reality aside so the pain stops. Iâ€™m tired of the pain and crying when I acknowledge reality. 

All I want to do is jump.
