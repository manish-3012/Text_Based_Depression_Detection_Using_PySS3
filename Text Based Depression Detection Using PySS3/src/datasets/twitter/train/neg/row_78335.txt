So this was my day today..1. Find out I probably can't afford law school, despite working so damn hard to get in
2. Spend all day at my menial job being hit on and talked down to
3. Receive routine verbal abuse upon arriving home \(you're garbage, nobody cares about you etc.\)
4. Remember that it's my ex's birthday today and that I haven't actually felt happiness since he left
5. Drink myself into oblivion
6. Realize that I will probably be broke and alone for the rest of my life
7. Lay in bed \(read: tiny broken air mattress\) and contemplate suicide
8. Look for solace on Reddit because I'm afraid to fuck up my 3rd suicide attempt

I really just can't fucking do this anymore
