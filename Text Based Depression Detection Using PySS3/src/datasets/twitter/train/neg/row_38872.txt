I don't want to die, i just don't want to be me.I think that there is a lot to do and discover in this world, but only when you actually enjoy living and when you're having fun. I don't hate the world, i hate myself. I'm addicted to some shit, i'm ugly as fuck, and i'm a fucking asshole. I just don't want to be my anymore because i hate myself
