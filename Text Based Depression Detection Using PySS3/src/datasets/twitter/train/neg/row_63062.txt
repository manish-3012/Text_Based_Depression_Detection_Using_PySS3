I hit my little brother...now I wanna die..I told my little brother and sister to go to bed, because they're annoying and always are. I feel like they don't listen to me. So I hit my brother with a towel because he makes very irritated. I don't  know why but I felt like doing so. Part of the the towel hit one of his eye's. When he cried out loud I knew that I fucked up. And of course I got in trouble for it. I admitted what I've done but I didn't told them why. I didn't know what to tell them. I went to my room after I did that. And wanted instant death. I don't deserve to be in this world if I'm this fucked up.
