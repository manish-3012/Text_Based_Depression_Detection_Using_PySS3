Suicide is not a joke....Well I ponder around thinking about life and how to fix it. I go from feeling like I have a purpose to where I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Itâ€™s been going on for the last couple of weeks. It all started on the first day of my 6th grade year. At the end of the day we do silent sustained reading, I had my book down on my desk reading and my pencil beside me(it was a led pencil). So what happened was I set my book up and grabbed my pencil and started stabbing myself in the hand, I put so much pressure that the pencil made a little bitty whole in my hand, I ended up doing that twice, not screaming bc of the pain. I have been thinking of a way to do it but Iâ€™m too scared to do it, half of me wants to live and the other half of me doesnâ€™t. Iâ€™m the biggest fan of Markiplier and have always wanted to meet him in person. I love him, he means the world to me and if anything happens to him Iâ€™ll jump off a bridge, and I mean anything. Nobody cares about me or what I do and nobody wants to talk to meðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
