Tried to kill myself on Tuesday.tried to hang myself with a belt but as i was passing out and my body began to spasm, the belt slipped loose and i survived. its something I've been wanting to do for years. i did it because i can no longer bear the guilt of my existence. the fact that it is human nature to indirectly cause suffering to everything and everyone, is what drove me to attempt suicide. the only course of action seems to be kill myself and use the nutrients in my body as fertilizer for a tree or something. (yes i know that my death would cause suffering but nothing compared to my life)
