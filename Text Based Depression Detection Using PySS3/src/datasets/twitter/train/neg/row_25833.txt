Starting Friday, I've got one year.Something has to convince me not to do it within that year. Anything positive. My last summer, and my last set of holidays. My last year of schooling, then death or the world.

The realization is hitting me, and I only want to end myself sooner. But I'm giving myself one year, where I started counting down two years ago.


I just want my pain to stop.
