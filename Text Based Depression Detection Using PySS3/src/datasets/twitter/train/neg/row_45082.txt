my thoughtsI constantly think about taking a bullet for someone so that it wouldn't sound as bad as suicide. I won't do it yet i can't help but think about it weekly....sometimes I just wanna scream let it out but I don't because I dunno why. As the Smashing Pumpkins said: Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
