Contemplating it 24/7Everything has been going downhill in 2020 and it's getting worse by the day. I'm doing my best to think positive and to take action to fix my stuff but everything I try fails... It takes a lot to calm myself down and work on my problems but when my actions fail I get even more discouraged. It's been like that for all of 2020, constantly everything is failing no matter how hard I try and I'm on the tipping point rn. I can't take this much suffering, even if I have all these people around me, I can't keep suffering for so long just cuz people care it doesn't matter to me anymore it doesn't change anything I just want this to end.
