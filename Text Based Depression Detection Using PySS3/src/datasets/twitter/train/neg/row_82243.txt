Aaaaand I'm backIt was a good one week run of not being suicidal, with the help of St. John's wort, supplements and quitting coffee.

My anxiety dropped quite a bit, suicidal thoughts were gone for a week, but now I'm back to utterly miserable. 

Because I'm not constantly in fight or flight anymore, deeper issues start to emerge. Long lost feelings come to the surface that I've pushed down for decades. I don't want feel this way. It's too much. I just want it to stop.

If that wasn't enough, I looked at old classmates' profiles, they all advanced in life, many found love, while I'm stuck in my traumatic dream land, having achieved nothing at age 24. I'm defective and useless. I just want to die. Please, for the love of God, put me out of my misery.
