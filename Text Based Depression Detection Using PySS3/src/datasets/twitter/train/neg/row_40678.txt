I have no other options... I can not believe it. He actually won.**sorry for it being so long, but pls If you have the time read it all. I need all the help I can get**

This Saturday 12am I have decided that Iâ€™m going to kill myself. 

Iâ€™m 19 years old and have been working non stop for the last year to get into one of the top 15 colleges in the world for engineering. 
I also got in, I had received my acceptance letter sometime in December. 
I guess you guys are not wondering why I would want to kill myself right? 

Because this Friday is the deadline to make the fee payment. THE only reason why I even though of going to this college was that my parents promised me that they have more than enough funds to cover my costs. We also sat down one day and calculated everything. 
And Iâ€™m not some spoiled brat or anything, Iâ€™m more than ready to work during my vacations instead of flying back home to help reduce the cost of my studies. 
But my father has been delaying the payment ever since I got my financial letter. He feels itâ€™s better to send my sister (who could not even get into college for bachelors, my parents even had to bribe a local college to accept her) abroad to a better college than me. 
He has always loved her and taken more care of her. 
**Fun fact** : when I was born my father wanted to kill me (killing of new born babies is quite common in my country), the only reason I am even alive is because my mother literally has to physically fight him off. 

**Fun fact 2** : Since that day he has also hated my mother and has beaten her with belts, shoes and his bare hands on multiple occasions.  (My country also does not have a very good department against domestic abuse). 

**Fun fact 3** : I usually have to wear the same set of clothes for upward of 2 years since whenever we go out for clothes shopping and I would like to buy something he would emotionally manipulate me by saying things like â€œyou already have that at homeâ€ â€œIâ€™ll take you to another place with better prices (but never does)â€ â€œyou are spending too much moneyâ€ â€œthatâ€™s too expensive, we will comeback some other timeâ€ â€œyou are buying too much nowerdaysâ€ 
And when my sister wants to buy anything there is NEVER any FUSS. She has a fucking jacket worth 250USD. I have never bought any clothing above 65USD. 
Shoes? Iâ€™ve been wearing my same woodland shoes since 4 years now. I only own 2 pairs of shoes and 1 pair of sandals at the moment.
My sister? 17 pairs of various shoes. 
My mother is in a similar situation as me. 

So now that I realised that he has no intention to sending me and just wanted to create false hope I thought that Iâ€™ll instead look for some local collages that will accept me. Unfortunately in my country there is a type of standardised test (like the SAT) that everyone has to give to even apply at any local colleges. Guess what? A month ago My father told me not to take it and waste money since he Will anyways be sending me abroad and now I can not even apply for that test anymore. 

What about free community college? No such thing in my country. 

Wait another year and apply at my local colleges? I just canâ€™t. I can not live here anymore. The emotional and mental manipulation is just too much, I canâ€™t take another WHOLE YEAR of THIS UTTER MADNESS. 

**Fun fact 4** : He also makes a fuss when I buy any books to study. He tells me to use my sisters old books, thing is that her books are 7 years old! The syllabus has been changes MULTIPLE times since then. But does he care? Nope. 

What about moving out and finding a job? Not possible in my country. Unlike the US in my country it is not common for anyone under 21 to work. Even if I would like to I would not get any job since the unemployment rate in my country is so high and employers literally 20-30 people ( minimum ) to choose from who ATLEAST have bachelors degrees. 


If you guys have ANY other suggestions pls. Tell me. I had such high hopes of leaving this horrid household and actually start a better life for my mother and i. But I canâ€™t see any way that can happen. 

I donâ€™t want to die. I donâ€™t want to leave my mother alone with this PATHETIC EXCUSE OF A FATHER/HUSBAND/HUMAN BEING.
