Just looking to ventI feel like I have screwed up my life. I've been doing badly at university and recently failed some subjects, and it just feels like I'm wasting my life. Throughout high school I was getting great marks, and people were always telling me how I could be a doctor or a lawyer, but that seems impossible right now.

I know getting bad marks is really insignificant compared to some of the things people go through, but my intelligence has been the only thing I could ever be proud of. I don't have anything else in my life. I'm ashamed to tell my parents about how I've failed my subjects, even though they both failed some when they were at university. I just feel like shit.
