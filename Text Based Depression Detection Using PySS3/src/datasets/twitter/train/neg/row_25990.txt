ChaosI am an emotional wreck. No one sees. Not even my significant other. I wish i never have taken this job. I feel like i cant take my life anymore. What am i to live for. I dont feel like fighting for myself. Having a 9-5 job. Working coming home sleeping day in and day out. I want to scream! I am to the point of exploding. No one sees.
