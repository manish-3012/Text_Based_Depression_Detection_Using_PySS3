what should i do when i hang up from the suicide hotline but i am still unable to keep myself safei am in the UK. i canâ€™t call back up because there is only one person working in my area tonight and she already finished her conversation with me. please help. nobody is helping. talking to people does not help when no changes are made. just trying to get through the night does not help when i have been doing that every night for months now. i canâ€™t keep myself safe. i canâ€™t even ask my mother to tonight
