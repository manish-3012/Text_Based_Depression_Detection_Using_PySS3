I feel that odd euphoric peace that usually comes around when Iâ€™m about to go.It happens whenever I come closer to attempting. The last time I felt it was I believe in 2017, when I was resting in the bath just before I took the candy. It felt peaceful, thinking I was gonna die in the tub. Except I didnâ€™t.

I feel that now. Not some pushed attempt or an angered one. A genuine one. One where I know for a fact it will succeed. One where I will never have to suffer again.

The euphoric feeling always puts me at ease, so it makes it so much easier to plan to go through with it. 

I wonder if anyone else feels it too.
