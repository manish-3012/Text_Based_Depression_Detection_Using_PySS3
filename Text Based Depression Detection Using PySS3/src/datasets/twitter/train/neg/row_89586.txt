Everything is coming back againI tried to kill myself in october and was stopped by my parents, and after seeing a counselor and taking SSRI's the thoughts went away. This semester I made friends again and my life was finally getting better.

Now its all going down hill again. I'm back to never feeling happy, I don't feel anything. All I think about is how easily I could end my life. Nobody would miss me. I doubt they would even know I'm gone.
