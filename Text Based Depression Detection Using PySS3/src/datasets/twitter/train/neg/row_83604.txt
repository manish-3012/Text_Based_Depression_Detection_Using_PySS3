I think about suicide a lotI'm contemplating suicide more and more as I continue to live my life dealing with my perpetual loneliness and crippling depression. I've considered just ending it, then losing interest and continuing on with life. Now I find myself thinking about suicide every other day almost. I think about it in a nice way, I feel like it would be calm and peaceful, life is too fucking stressful. Does anyone else think about this stuff, i can't be alone? I always think it would be nice for me, but then peeps I know wouldn't understand and be like upset and I don't want that for them. I only really have my family which care about me, so I guess I should stay alive for their sake; I mean it would be kind of a waste of money feeding me all these years if I just killed myself. It's bizzar really coz I'm like a vegan, non-alcoholic, don't smoke, exercise semi-regularly - really healthy guy yet I only think about death :/ I'd talk to a friend or family member about this but they'd just either report me to some social service people, a psych ward, or just burst into tears - it's not like that, I aint sad, I just can't be arsed living anymore, it's like I need some fucking motivation to keep living or some shit. Any words from fellow human beings would be nice - I can answer questions also.
