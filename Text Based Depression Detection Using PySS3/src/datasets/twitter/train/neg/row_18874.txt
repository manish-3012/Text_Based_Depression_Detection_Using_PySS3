I came very close todayReally, really close to ending it -- which would make it my fourth attempt. Thought about it all morning today. Where I was going to do it. How, etc. 

Worst year I've ever had. Best friend took his life, almost got in trouble with the law for something I didn't do, have to live with my pill-addicted mother, no hot water in the house, no air conditioning and it's like 90 degrees outside and in. Cockroaches everywhere. Flea bites all over me. I go to bed sweaty and dirty.  Have nothing at all to my name -- no car, no clothes, no money, nothing at all! 

Then I discovered that my anxiety meds I just got filled are short by about half. Don't know if my mother stole my meds, which is a possibility, or if the pharmacy shorted me, which has happened before. 

Talked to a sorta friend who works there and they're going to look into it tomorrow. 

I never abuse my pills and in fact had a few left over from last month. If I can't get this situation fixed, I am so screwed. I will run out in a week, or two if I am extremely cautious (and allow my anxiety to run over a bit, which will be torture). 

I don't know what snapped me out of it. But this isn't good at all. I think I am going to face this again soon, and I might not snap out of it so easily.
