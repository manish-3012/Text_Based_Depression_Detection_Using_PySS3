I'm 34 and i'm tired of living.I'm 34 and i think my life is useless and i am better dead than alive.

Since i was a kid i suffered from Social Anxiety Disorder, wich prevents me from socializing with other people. During my middle school years i always had no more than three "friends" and i couldn't socialize with almost anyone. During my high school years it was even worse. I had no friends for three years. I was having frequent panic attacks, and my mom wanted to get me a medication, wich i refused because i didn't wanted to drug myself. College was the same bullshit. Everybody was partying and sleeping around, while i was stuck at home. My parents told me to drink alcohol (my dad used to have a mild social anxiety too) to control my anxiety, but i've never touched a single drop of alcohol in my entire life. I've got a job at 25 and i don't talk to my coworkers.

The years flew by, and i realised that i'm a 34 year old kissless virgin, who never spoke to a single woman (my looks are below average). Besides i have no friends and no one to talk to. I live alone wich makes it even worse.

I am a completely useless person who doesn't deserve to live anymore. I have no self esteem and no confidence. I'm just wasting resources that deserving humans could use. Years of loneliness and depression made me a bitter and cynical person about everyone in this world. Even the money i saved from years of loneliness isn't enough to make me a little bit happy. I think the last time i felt some happiness was many years ago.

This is the end for me. I'm 35 next week and i don't want to be 35 and alone. All i wanted for my life was to find someone i would love, marry and have a family. But this dream is shattered. I already have everything ready for my death. I have my .357 ready in my desk and i'm doing it tomorrow. I hope i don't end up failing and fucking my life up.
