Please Help MeThis is a throwaway account. Just in case. I need to understand why in my whole life I have just been slighted, made fun of, pushed down, abused and constantly fail? Do you think I did something in my life to deserve the suffering as some sort of punishment? I hate myself and I barely even live my life anymore. Iâ€™m 18 years old and I just started college and already Iâ€™m struggling and my long term girlfriend who goes to the same school is being very very distant with me which makes me constantly anxious off the charts. And Iâ€™m poor. And I had an unexpected medical emergency my first week which sent me seized up in my dorm to the hospital and now Iâ€™m behind in all my classes and have to go to countless blood draws and scans because itâ€™s a mystery event. But I think itâ€™s because I just am stressed so hard and am so done with living the life Iâ€™ve been living forever that my body just decided it had had enough and got all fucky. I feel guilty saying anything to anyone and I never tell people. I hope someone here gets what I mean and maybe has some insight. I just feel like I see everyone around me doing things with ease that I struggle massively with all of the time. The only things Iâ€™m good at are things that donâ€™t have any application to a career or real life. I just donâ€™t think I should be alive and taking up so many resources to just waste them on myself.
