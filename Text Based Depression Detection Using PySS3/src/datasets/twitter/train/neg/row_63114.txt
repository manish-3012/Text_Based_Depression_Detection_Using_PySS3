The first girl thatâ€™s been interested in me since my traumatic breakup with my ex 5 years ago no longer wants to associate with me. (A couple phone texts below)
Iâ€™m 26 and sheâ€™s 21.

She stayed over last night for only the second time and left a few hours ago. We had some short-lived sex because she began to cry during it (donâ€™t laugh). Not like hysterically cry, just shed a single tear. So I stopped immediately out of concern and just began to hold her and tell her things would be fine. I had a feeling it was because of her ex of a recent relationship. We woke up spooning and I asked her how her night of sleep was. She said â€œgoodâ€. Then after a few minutes I jokingly asked â€œso are you gonna come back to watch more Stranger Things with me?â€, she stared up at the ceiling and after a long pause she said â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€. I didnâ€™t expect her at all to NOT say yes. Thatâ€™s when I knew it was downhill from there.

I asked her a couple of times if I did something wrong and she kept assuring me that I didnâ€™t.

Fast forward to her leaving and Iâ€™m walking her down the stairs and I said â€œIâ€™m probably still going to text youâ€ and she says â€œIâ€™ll let you know whatâ€™s upâ€. Then I cringe.

She opens her car door, turns around and gives me a hug (not a kiss like after the first time she came over) and says â€œthanks for having meâ€

About an hour after she leaves I send her a text saying â€œIâ€™m here to listen if you want someone to talk toâ€

Another hour after that she texts me back saying:
â€œI really jumped into stuff with you and whatever this stuff is, Iâ€™m not ready for it. Everything is still so raw after my relationship and i need time to just mend from that and i need that time to be alone. Today was the last time Iâ€™ll see you for at least a while and i would prefer if we didnâ€™t talk everyday. Iâ€™m sorry for dragging you in when i wasnâ€™t ready and Iâ€™m sorry it took me this long to realize that.â€

I liked her text (weâ€™re on iMessage) and I replied with the best text I could come up with:
â€œI understand. We probably have 2 different ideas of what â€˜at least a whileâ€™ means but I promise Iâ€™ll respect your preferences and give you space. I do hope Iâ€™ll eventually get to see you again. After all, itâ€™s pretty tough finding girls like you. So when you figure it out, you know how to reach me :]â€

Iâ€™m not planning on bothering her at all until maybe September/after the summer. I just feel awful. Iâ€™ve been in a VERY deep and debilitating depression for like 5 or 6 years now and then I met her. She made me feel good for the first time in what feels like an eternity. I was even thinking this girl might be lifting me up out of this depression. Plus sheâ€™s a great, cute, nerdy girl and probably way too good for me. Then I get hit with this. 

Now I go from feeling the best Iâ€™ve felt in a long time to feeling the absolute worst Iâ€™ve felt in a long time. A total reversal of my recovery. I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. If I dropped dead right now Iâ€™d be at peace.

I wish I had a gun so I could off myself.


Please donâ€™t just tell me that â€œIâ€™ll find anotherâ€ or â€œjust keep tryingâ€ or â€œyou gotta put yourself out thereâ€. Itâ€™s been almost 6 years. SIX. At this frequency, I wonâ€™t have another chance until Iâ€™m in my 30s. But thatâ€™s only if the rest of my 20s are worth living.
