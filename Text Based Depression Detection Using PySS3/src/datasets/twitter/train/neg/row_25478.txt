A week ago, I was hit by a car. Today, my vet told me my cat will be dead in a few days. I am so lost.I wish I got killed by the car hit. 

I don't want to live without her. I've had her for fourteen years. She's been my only and best friend, she helped me in my childhood and teenager years in which I have been abused so much. She was always there for me. It was like she sensed me feeling bad, and when she sensed it, she never left my side. Hours, days, sometimes even weeks. She was always there for me.

Now she's dying. Soon I will wake up next to the corpse to her.

I will join her when her time is over. I cannot live life without her.
