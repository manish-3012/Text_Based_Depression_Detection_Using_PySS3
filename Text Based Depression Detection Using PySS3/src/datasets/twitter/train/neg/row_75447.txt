I LoVE it when people cut you from their life for being depressedAnd then all their other friends back them up and call you toxic.

Why the fuck did you even bother with me in the first place knowing full well how I am? Why come back and fuck me up then leave and tell me it's my fault. I trusted you.. I'm so fuckkking DUMBBBBB

I can see it from both points of view. It's not nice having to deal with someone else's problems and it's a drag.

If it was some random person you just met then okay sure, it's awkward and maybe you don't want to invest your time in that.

But you were my best friend ever since I can remember.. I cut off everyone for you because I'm fucking stupid. I literally threw away everything for you. You knew I had nobody else and you didnt care about the shitty things going on in my life. Im not even worth a "hi how are you" every once in a while anymore. Probably wouldn't even care if I was dead. Maybe you will when I actually am.

You broke me

Fuck you for telling me you love me, for wasting my time, for saying we'd always be friends and you'd never go anywhere. Fuck that stupid demonic bitch that controls you.

I loved you so much. I know you loved me too. I wish we could be friends, but I really think it's over for good now. We've never gone this long without talking. I don't want to live without you but I don't want to tell you that or you'd think I'm insane

I miss you.. I wish I could just hate you
