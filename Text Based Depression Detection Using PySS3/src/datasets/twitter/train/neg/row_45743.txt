Whats the point of living if you are constantly scared of dyingI have severe hypochondria/health anxiety/somatic symptom disorder. If you donâ€™t know what that is its basically constantly panicking every day about a new illness that youâ€™re scared is gonna kill you. It all started when i was told i would have to do surgery. It was a very safe surgery, a 30 minute procedure where the doctor would have to cut in to my testicle and untwist my veins. Its a condition called varicocele. Its not a fatal condition nor is it even serious its just my testicular veins will feel swollen. Ever since that ive been focusing on every sensation. I woke up with a numb arm. My first thought was: stroke. I rushed myself to the emergency room after my arm started painfully aching. The doctor said im ok and gave me pain killers for the aches. I never ended up using the pain killers since my anxiety was gone and the arm aching went away. This was the time i learned about health anxiety and that you can imagine symptoms. But that day my pet cat spit on my mouth. I was horrified that i had rabies. I went to a doctor and was told i am perfectly safe. But then my cat scratched me and I panicked all over again and went to a different doctor. He also said im 100% fine. I cant take all this pain the stress caused. Im thinking about suicide. I love life i just think i have to force myself to die because if i dont, then i will die of rabies. But im too scared to die. I dont want to die painfully. I want an easy, non-painful way of death.
