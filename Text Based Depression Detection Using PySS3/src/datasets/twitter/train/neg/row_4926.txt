3rd time is not the charm, I guessI really honestly donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting on here, but the third time wasnâ€™t a charm. I previously had attempted suicide 2 times in 2016 the year my grandpa passed away and havenâ€™t thought about it for a long time, until I got really drunk and took over 60 pills in December of 2019, which came to be my 3rd time of attempting. I ended up getting sent to rehab because the doctors blamed it all on the alcohol, not the fact that I am severely depressed and so anxious I barely talk to my own family members to avoid confrontation of anything. I recently got a puppy in hopes it would help with my situation but it only made the situation worse so the puppy is currently living at my parents while I still contemplate suicide everyday, not to mention I am currently in college studying criminal justice. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Everyone around me always asks how Iâ€™m doing but no one really fucking cares. Not even my own girlfriend who I can barely get a response from in the first place. What if the 4th time is actually the charm this time instead of the 3rd, a different way, not with pills because that havenâ€™t gotten the job done in the past.
