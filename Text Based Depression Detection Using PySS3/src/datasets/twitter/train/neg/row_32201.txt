I want to do it so badly, but I can'tI can't do it anymore, and I never thought I would feel this way. I was certain that suicide was how I'll go, but that changed. All I feel now is fear of killing myself due to religious roots, which I don't even face anymore, so, how dumb is that? Everyone's being selfless and having legitimate reasons to not kill themselves, like family and close ones, but I'm just sitting here being a selfish little bitch, scared for myself...

I hate myself for that, I really do. I'm getting help but my family now thinks there was nothing wrong with me in the first place. And the help isn't helping, so that's wonderful. And I'm just tired now. Tired of living and feeling torn about dying. I think I'll just continue to drift through life, but it's just so draining, I want to kill myself. But I can't. I was going to do it earlier this year, and then I postponed it to the end of May (planned it out completely this time), and now I'm just too scared, so I know I won't do it. I don't want to remain drained. On one hand it's all I know and I want to drift through life and continue to be miserable, but on the other hand, I can't commit to killing myself. I don't know how to feel.
