Feeling a bit depressedI've been in a big low all weekend. I don't know why death has actually crossed my mind a few times. I don't care to admit it to any of my friend because I feel disconnected from everyone. I feel so lonely, yet I feel so overwhelmed that I can't really talk to anyone. I've been pretty isolated for the past few days, mostly doing work. 

I just want someone to talk to, it doesn't have to be about depression. I'm a male college student, about to graduate.
