More valued as a viewer than a friend. The tiny handful of friends that still humour me with messages from time to time are all streamers. The only time I get messages from them are to visit their streams. When I do, they say hi once and never say another word to me again unless it's to invite me to another stream... 
 
  One friend is doing a charity stream today with donations going to "smash depression", but won't even lift a finger when I say I need someone to talk to. I don't think they realize how hypocritical they're being and how hard I've been struggling with not ending it all these last few months... but they still invited me to the stream. 
 
 I think I'll jump off a bridge instead.
