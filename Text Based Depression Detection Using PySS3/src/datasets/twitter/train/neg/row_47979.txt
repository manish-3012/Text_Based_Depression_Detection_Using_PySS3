I cant fucking handle this anymoreim a 18 year old female and im already tired of my life. i cant handle all these emotions at once. i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, social anxiety, and ADHD. i have tried so many medications but nothing works. i have tried therapy, DBT, hospitals but nothing fucking works. i have been depressed since i was 12 years old and i dont know how much longer i can handle being in pain. i have so much fucking anxiety that i cant even go out and function normally. i miss work because i cant even get out of bed. ive tried to kill myself over 3 times in the past month but im too much of a fucking coward. my parents kicked me out because im just too much for anybody to handle. my own fucking parents dont even want me around. i broke up with my boyfriend while i was having a breakdown and i regret it so much. we have been together for almost 3 years and he is my best friend. he will never forgive me. i never meant to hurt him or anybody. i feel like my entire life is falling apart and im stuck in a cycle. im so self destructive. i ruined my own life. this is all my fault. im thinking about just taking my entire bottle of trazodone with some brandy and then hanging myself. i just want to make sure i do it right this time. i just want all this pain to go away. im so tired...
