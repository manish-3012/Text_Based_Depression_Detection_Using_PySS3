hello againbeen coming here on and off through the years with different accounts and varying levels of success and failure. here again because I'm tired of therapy but still need some sort of outlet.

I'm 22, jobless, not pursuing college/University(too expensive and it's never been my forte or something of interest anyways), been in and out of the hospital since I was very young for major depression, anxiety, and ADHD. Oh, and I'm a trans man (female to male), but thankfully that's not really a major issue anymore like it used to be, though I'm worried it might again if I lose access to my healthcare once I turn 26 in a few years.

and that kind of segways into why I'm here: I'm planning on killing myself once my health insurance goes away at 26. if I somehow manage to get a job, I honestly cannot work more than part time due to my mental disabilities (I've tried working full time multiple times and I crack under all the pressure and get sent to the hospital), and as far as I know, most jobs I'm qualified for don't really have health insurance for part time work.

soooo... I'm fucked? i get psychotic when I don't take medication, and if I lose access to both my hormones and anti depressants/anti anxiety meds, I'd rather not continue living. I'm already a burden enough living with my parents and wasting their resources, and it will cost thousands upon thousands to keep me alive without healthcare.

I have a lot of other issues too, but I'm getting tired of writing at the moment. Just wanted to see if anyone else can relate to anything I said, if this even gets read at all.
