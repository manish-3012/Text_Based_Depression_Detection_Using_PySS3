ventingmy sleeping schedule is messed up bc I sleep during the day so I wonâ€™t have to be awake when everyone in my household is.
Lots of things in my life are causing me stress and my depression and suicidal thoughts have worsened this semester.
I have no therapist bc my last therapist suggested I see a new one (and didnâ€™t send me references to new therapists? just left me hanging?) so Iâ€™ve been without a therapist for over a month.
Havenâ€™t been taking my meds, which make things worse, but tbh itâ€™s kind of like another form of self sabotage bc i think that if I let myself keep getting worse, maybe Iâ€™ll get to the point where I finally kill myself successfully.
I have a social media addiction.
Iâ€™m trying to move out as soon as possible but Iâ€™m still saving up.
Iâ€™ve been feeling so suicidal so often this semester. I donâ€™t have any plans to do that at all. But the desire to not be alive is very strong.
Idk what I want to get from posting this. I just wanted to vent.
