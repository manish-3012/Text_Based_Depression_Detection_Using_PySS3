I'm not a good personI'm only 17 and i've learned that im not a person that anyone would like to be around. I don't know how anyone can stand being around me. I'm alone, I'm afraid. I'm afraid of being this way forever. I can't control the way I act. I'm so hurt on the inside that I take it out on everyone else. I hurt because i'm so fucking hurt. I am so broken and I am so tired of living. I don't think I can do this anymore. I'm so tired of fighting and i'm so tired of searching for things in my life to keep me going. I have no friends. I have nothing and no one. The only thing in my life that brings me happiness is my kitty. I let myself down, and I let everyone else down. My parents are so wrapped up in trying to prevent my sister from crashing and burning they forgot that i'm here crashing and burning. I feel so dead inside, I can't love anything, and nothing/no one can love me. What am I left to do? I have no future. I have no friends. I don't see myself going anywhere in life. I can't even leave my bedroom anymore. I have no reason to, I Have no reason to get out of bed and get dressed, I'm not sure if this is a suicide note or not, but I think it might be. I can't find peace anymore and I just want everything to be done with. My life is so terribly difficult.... all of my problems are self inflicted and I know suicide is selfish and everything thats driving me to suicide is my fault, but its so fucking hard. I let everyone down. I'm so broken. 

edit: I said goodbye, but I didnt mean it. Im not leaving just yet.
