testimony of broken promisesmy life is a testimony of broken promises.i really need to vent out my frustration ,anger and sorrow.  i spent most part of my life weeping . i have always felt lonely . i attempted suicide a couple of times but unfortunately failed. to be frank i have got friends, but they have never tried to understand me . there is this bloody group of people who gave me dreams , expectations : only to take it away from me. everyone toyed around with my mind, twisted it  and now finally i have lost hope in all humanity. 

the only thing that i call my own are the scars on my wrist, reminding me of the cruelty in this world. none gives a shit about whether i die or not . i have always been alone . i have wished for someone  to understand me , to save me from the emotional torture that my mind was setting up for me. but everyone turned their faces away from me. all i wanted was someone to tell me that my life matters, but no. and here i am now, putting on a fake face for everyone , smiling on the outside but crumbling inside. i know my life is extremely short and i am contemplating suicide. i have tried being happy but it didn't work. now i have lost it . i am becoming  a psychopath with each passing day. has anyone loved me sincerely? i don't think so. i hate my body , i hate my life, i hate everything about me. do u know what i fear the most ?my mind. it is unstable .all i wanted  was someone to love me sincerely. but i didn't get it. its fine. i do not know why i live. my mind is dead and is ready to kill me any time . so here i am - a dead girl with no desire to live and a dead mind.
