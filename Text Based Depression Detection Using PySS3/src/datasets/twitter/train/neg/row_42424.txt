there's just a lingering emptinessi am constantly going through the motions of life but it's hard sometimes to be okay. i hate myself sometimes because i can't get things under control. i feel like i no longer have a grip on my life. i feel like i have ruined everything. i turn eighteen in less than a month and i'm so terrified. and the highs and lows are killing me.

highs of productivity but excruciating emotional energy then terrible numbness and sometimes peaceful neutrality, and then crazy deep depression. i have no answers as to why i am this way or what i can do to stop it.

i just want to stop this pain. i just want things to be okay again. i just want it to be okay. and it's not like i want to die but i just want to take a really long nap or just stop being human and be a statue or a flower or something else for once.

i have been conditioned to understand that while the lows will get better, the highs will get worse. and there's no comfort in any of it. the highs make me feel too fast for my own skull, the lows make me suicidal. in the middle i feel like i am the most myself because things are normal. my therapist says it's anxiety and i guess it is but the treatment isn't helping it stop. but anxiety is anxiety and believe me i've dealt with it (ocd, panic disorder, generalized anxiety) but the energy highs are literally me feeling everything in the book.

i feel so lonely and low and i feel so awful and i feel scared and i feel conlicted. i just want answers.
