Should I tell someone I want to kill myself?I have attempted suicide before, and afterwards people tell me they want to tell them if I feel like doing that again. Here's the thing, right now, I am in university, and I'm about to go into finals. If I get institutionalized, then I won't be able to pass my classes. 

Also I don't think people would understand that I feel like I am about to do it again. I think they'll blow me off and not care, which contradicts what I just said. I want to get help, maybe even institutionalized, but I also can't do that because I would have so many problems as a result. I'm at a loss, and I feel like I might try hanging myself, making an exit bag, or jump off a bridge.
