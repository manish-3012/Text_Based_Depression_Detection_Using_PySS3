Sunday seems like a great day to kill myselfIn the past 2 days I've had the worst panic attacks of my life which involved me scratching off pieces of skin on my shoulders and forehead, and my best friend won't talk to me ever again. She was a serious trigger for my anxiety, and I said some hurtful things to her. She hasn't talked to me since. After my vacation, I'm going to set up a plan I know can't fail. If I play things out right, I will cause just enough confusion to die before anyone can find or untie me. I just want to clear up that I'm not killing myself over my friend. In fact, I'm happy about her leaving. That adds another level of distance and confusion, making it much easier to slip away before being noticed. I've always been taught to turn the negatives into positives, and that is exactly what I plan to do. Anyway, I just wanted to say goodbye to you all. I've received some lovely pms from a few of you, and I must say receiving your messages made many of these last few days bearable. Good luck out there, it's a big and cold world we live in.
