I just cant do this anymore ( sorry if this is long) I just don't know how much more I can take of this,  Im 15 now
I've had really bad family problems. one of my parents was a drunk, whenever they where drunk they'd become abusive.  mostly verbal but often physical.  
In school I get good grades. A's and B's,so academically I'm fine. just during school I get bullied. I've been dealing with bullying all my life. grade school I didn't have friends I had bullies. when recess came I was on the swings alone, everyday. during middle school I made friends buy since 7&amp;8th grade I've lost every friend I've ever made.  
socially I'm a mess, im am.outcast with no friends. I don't have anyone I can call up.and talk to if need someone. I don't enroll in sprorts. I did join drama club but I've had no luck with it.  
I know I probably sound like an ungrateful teenager,or just an another teen over reacting, and I probably am. 
I just want to this all to end, or things to change....
