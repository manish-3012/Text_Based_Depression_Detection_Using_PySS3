I donâ€™t think we should be hereI donâ€™t think this subreddit should exist.

There, I said it.

This sub is named â€œSuicideWatchâ€. This name is a blatant miscommunication. Suicide watch is an organisation dedicated to making sure that people **wonâ€™t** kill themselves. This subreddit, however, almost seems to encourage it.

The problem with this sub is that it consists mainly of suicidal people with hopeless thoughts. When someone posts about being suicidal, the responses are usually about other people who are also suicidal. And this leads to the suicidal feelings of both the poster and the replier to be reinforced.

And however fucking awful life may be, we have to at least **try** to keep on living.

I get it, life sucks. Iâ€™m suicidal myself, and it sucks for me too. But the point is that we have to keep believing that it can get better. No matter how bad it is right now. Even if those beliefs are lies.

If you have terrible family members or you have no friends, you can always outgrow your family, and you never know when or how you can get thrust into social situations.

If youâ€™re tired of your job or your life and everything is monotonous, try something new, or find a way forward. And go to a psychiatrist because these things usually have something to do with underlying mental illnesses. 

If you have some kind of hopeless medical condition that canâ€™t be cured, medical science is advancing all the time, who knows what the future will bring?

And maybe things wonâ€™t get better, and maybe you can never be happy and if so, then so be it.

But you have to at least **try** to believe that you can be.

Because what if next year will be the best year of your life? What if everything fixes itself and everything works out for the best eventually? Then youâ€™ll be missing out on **so much** of a life you never had.

And I donâ€™t think this sub encourages this thinking.

I think this subreddit will eventually be discovered and uncovered for what it really is. The mainstream media will call it an atrocity, and Reddit will be pressured into shutting it all down. 

And I think thatâ€™s a good thing.

If you want an alternative to just get your feelings on the internet that is much better than this one, Iâ€™d recommend the forum suicideforum.com. It has some genuinely wonderful people and some of them seem to know what theyâ€™re doing.

Above all, keep hoping. Maybe it can get better. You never know.
