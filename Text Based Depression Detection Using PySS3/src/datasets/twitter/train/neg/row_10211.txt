I want to be a sea, I want to drown people.My friend is suicidal. And it is exhausting.

Yes, he needs help and support. But why is it always me from whom he expects to get it.

Why won't he talk to his parents, get a therapist, call a fucking hotline. Why dump it all on me every fucking time. He doesn't really have other friends who'd listen. And I'm starting to understand why.

I care but I can't deal with this practically once a week. It's burning me out.

What am I even supposed to tell him. Everything he complains about is true. Yes, no one likes you and no one cares whether you live or die, with the exception of a few people maybe. Yes, you're fat and ugly. Yes, you've been unable to keep even a stupid min wage job. Yes, you're failing school. Yes, life is pointless and meaningless. There's nothing I can do about that.

He sends me pics of his gun and tells me how his brain is going to be all over the wall. Makes me feel like a hostage. Helpless and afraid to leave. 

He wants me to talk to him and listen to his broken record of a story all night. Till 4:30 am. And then he's drunk enough to pass out, and he will sleep 16+ hours, because he can afford it. He's unemployed and doesn't give a fuck about school. I, on the other hand, have to wake up at 6:00. And I don't function very well on 1.5. hours of sleep. Not at all. 

I think I'm reaching the point where soon I will be burnt out, tired and sleep-deprived enough to just tell him to go through with it. He has almost convinced me that it would be the best option for him. He won't do anything to improve his situation, to change anything that makes him depressed. I can't care anymore. It's chipping away at the remains of my own sanity.
