I'm not strong enough for thisI have had a rough family life. Lived with an aunt who verbally, mentally and physically abused me while her husband stood aside and watched. Taken by my biological mother at 15, hoping that things will get better. It did, for a few months. From then on it was neglect and being ignored for weeks and weeks with little proper communication. I only had friends to talk to.


Years have passed and I still get the same treatment. Just this morning, I saw the smile leave my biological mother's face when she saw me entering the kitchen. I just found out few minutes ago that my biological mother actually contacted my boyfriend and told him not to see me or she would never give her blessing for our relationship. Important to note that my boyfriend is one of the few things keeping me tethered and mentally stable. It turns out she has been keeping him from coming to see me the past few weeks.


It's my birthday today and he promised he would come but he can't cuz my biological mother won't allow him to see me.

I have been harbouring my suicidal tendencies the past few months but I have tried my best to keep it at bay because I know I still have my boyfriend, I'm clinging onto the last hope of building a future with him. After finding out my biological mother is actively stopping him from seeing me, it all came back


Please help me. I already planned to go jogging in the morning and killing myself during that time cuz I simply can't bear all this pain anymore. I never felt more lonely in this world than I am after finding out the truth just now
