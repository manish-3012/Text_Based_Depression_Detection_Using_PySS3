I can't do it anymore. Killing myself instead of going into work today.My mom's dying of cancer. I tried suicide hotline and reaching out. But the reality is, nobody can say or do anything to make this any better. I'm sorry mom and family. But I can't do it. Call me selfish or whatever. Yeah, I am. I just want this nightmare to end. No more. I've got the pills. I'm so glad this is almost over.
