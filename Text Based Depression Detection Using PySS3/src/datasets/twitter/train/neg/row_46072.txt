Losing hope...Giving up...It has been eight years since I started having suicidal thoughts. In that time I have been to six therapists, two psychiatrists, and been on over half a dozen SSRI's and other mood altering drugs. I am currently paying for college myself so dipping into my savings to pay for appointments and medication that haven't been helpful is causing extra financial stress in my life.How can I keep asking for help if I seriously believe it will work. I feel as though I am incapable of imagining a reality where I don't hate myself. I'm very lost and I'm not sure how much longer I want to wander around running into things. I just want these thoughts to end, I just want it all to stop.
