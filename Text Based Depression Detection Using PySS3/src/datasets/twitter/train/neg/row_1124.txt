ridiculousit's kind of funny how my boyfriend is texting me almost every hour when i kinda decided to give what he wanted. i told him he doesnt have time for me. that one time i was upset my mom was talking to her boyfriend, i told him about it but he didn't reply. btw he repeated tells me to tell him if something is bothering me but when i do tell him, he acts this way. and now ive finally made my resolution and planned every step to end everything does he suddenly acts like he cares.

i was not asking for anything. i just wanted to feel he was there. i wanted to talk to someone to keep my mind off things. in fact, i esp want someone when im lonely and suicidal. but my friends take hours to reply and no one understands how my mental health is affecting me. i can't trust anyone, not even my family who doesnt care about me.

im planning on breaking up with him and do what i have to do. i postponed this plan of mine to end myself bcos i dont want to hurt him, eventho things are very hard to deal with. but now, i finally decided to do it regardless of how he'll deal with it. i dont care about them. i reached out to them but they just dont care. they probably won't be affected of my passing.

uh im ranting idek if what i said made sense. im too sad to even care.
