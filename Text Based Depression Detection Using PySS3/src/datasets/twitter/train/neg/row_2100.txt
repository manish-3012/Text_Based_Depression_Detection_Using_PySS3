Ruined the only thing in life I have any skill atThroughout my life, the only one skill I have had is my academic skill. Well today I fucked up a major test that would have placed me on track within my college classes, so now its looking like I'll have to take a whole extra year to graduate from college, which I do not have the ability to pay for. Everything else in my life is a complete failure. No relationships to speak of, no hobbies or talents. Just sitting in my room all day working on my work, which now is something that I am not good at. Life just seems very pointless and I will probably just off myself, better to be dead and doing nothing than living a life of no talents and no enjoyment.
