On the Brink?I am really in the worst place. I cannot tell anyone in my real life- I am sure those of you on here totally understand that. Once I say something Things will get worse- Iâ€™ve got an important job working with lots of teens that look up to me and depend on me, I honestly donâ€™t want to let them down. Iâ€™ve got a wonderful family and kids that love me and we are incredibly close. I honestly have a great life and wonderful home, although my husband can be a narcissistic , lying ass, overall he is really great, too.  BUT- my mind is fucked... Iâ€™m a fucking wreck all the time. I survived terrible cancer a few years ago and I get scans and tests every 3 months. So far so good but lately I feel those feelings in my stomach and I think itâ€™s back. Is it in my head? Who knows.. my next tests are next Friday. I had a severe crash upon diagnosis, mental breakdown and basically became catatonic. I just cried and couldnâ€™t speak... they had me on all sorts of meds for depression and anxiety during chemo and it was the worst fucking thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me. And since then Iâ€™ve not been right- I worked so damn hard to get off all the meds after chemo- I started a whole new career and totally kicked ass- blew everyoneâ€™s mind. But inside Iâ€™m still a total basket case. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll never be okay again, Iâ€™m pretty much ruined now and I am so sad about it. No one understands this, I became friends with people that had cancer like me when I was DXed and they all died. My last friend died a few weeks ago- my family just blew it off because they are online friends. My friend called to tell me he was dying, he left a message asking me to call, I did and we got to talk before her passed. Now I just play his voice message sometimes because I feel so alone in this bullshit now. He knew how jacked up I am and never judged me, just talked to me and checked on me even during his own cancer battle.  I wake thinking of suicide, I go to sleep thinking of suicide- I fought hard to survive cancer but cancer won anyway- it ate away at my spirit and hope for my future and now all I do is worry it will return. I cannot go through that again. I wonâ€™t do it.
