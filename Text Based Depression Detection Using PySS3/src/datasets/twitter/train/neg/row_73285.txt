Things arenâ€™t that bad, so why do I still feel like this? Iâ€™m so doneIâ€™ve never had it easy. Been bipolar for a long time. Not medicated. The wrong medication. In and out of psych wards. Abusive family. Abusive partners. Multiple rapes. 

But on paper things are looking up. Iâ€™m doing well with the family that I care about. I have a new boyfriend whoâ€™s great. My therapist is awesome. 

But Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m just so so done. Itâ€™s been about a month where Iâ€™ve felt nothing. No feelings. Canâ€™t remember a lot. Life was very hazy? And now... the suicidal tendencies have hit like a freight train. 

To the outside world I look normal. But Iâ€™ve stockpiled the pills, I know how to tie a noose, Iâ€™ve written the will and all the notes. Iâ€™m just so done. I donâ€™t know what I can do.
