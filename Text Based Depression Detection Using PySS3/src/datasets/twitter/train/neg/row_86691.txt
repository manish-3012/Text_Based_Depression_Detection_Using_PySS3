So I'm back unfortunatelyI thought I could find a way out, I moved across my country to try and become a better self,  but that failed miserably I'm just Soo fed up with this miserable  life I just want to end it all
There is a rather tall building near hear it's around 12-14 stories tall should be rather easy to gain roof access I may have a look at what it's like to fly for a while

Any way how are all of you beautiful  people doing today, I hope it going better than mine and if you are having a bad day remember  that your pet would be very sad and confused why you didn't come home.. 

Anyway thanks for reading  - red
