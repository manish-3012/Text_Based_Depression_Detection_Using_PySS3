Maybe I should just goAnyone I've ever felt intimate with is gone from my life, and I was always a bad person in their life. What's the fucking point, I keep leading myself on thinking that someone I love will love me too but it doesn't fucking happen, anyone who makes this world feel real is gone from my life, I don't want to feel like this anymore. All I ever wanted was a hug from them and I couldn't even get that. I'm crying so much, I just want it to be over, please please someone help me, I want my best friend back, I don't want to do this alone, fuck fuck fuck I hate myself, someone hold me please.
