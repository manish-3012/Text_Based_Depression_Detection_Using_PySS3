Itâ€™s time to goI feel extremely suicidal today. Itâ€™s not that I feel empty inside, because I donâ€™t. The problem is that I canâ€™t stop feeling this pain in my chest, letting me know that Iâ€™m wanting to give up. And the voices in my head who usually call me worthless or a failure are just stronger than ever. Today theyâ€™re telling me to die and sending me all these nasty thoughts of myself. I just want to drive to the lake and walk into it. I canâ€™t swim-thatâ€™s the point.  I feel myself disassociating as I keep thinking of everything that triggers me. All the memories, all the trauma, the mistakes Iâ€™ve made, my failures. All my fault. I have no idea why Iâ€™m posting on here. I guess I just wanted someone to know how I felt before I end it.
