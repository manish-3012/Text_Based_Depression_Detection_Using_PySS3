I cut myself againItâ€™s been a week, I havenâ€™t hurt myself like this since middle school. Iâ€™m 20 now. I think about committing suicide every day, I wish my father never touched me. I wish my family kicked him out. I wish that the 9 years of sexual assault was enough for my family to kick him out. I wish they remembered what he did to me every time they ask me to buy him things for Fatherâ€™s Day or Christmas or his birthday. I wish they realized that seeing him everyday isnâ€™t good for me. I wish they never made fun of my depression. I wish my mom never said I was an embarrassment when I came out at bisexual. I wish my school didnâ€™t tell everyone about my attempted suicide. I wish my track coach didnâ€™t tell me that I had nothing to be sad about because Iâ€™m only a kid. I wish everyone fucking knew that I was sexual assaulted by my father when I was 8 and it didnâ€™t stop until I was 17 only because I told my sister one night. I wish everyone knew that he still lives with us and it kills me everyday, I wish everyone knew that my family constantly tears me down. I wish everyone knew all the things my family said to me. All the death threats I received, all the bullying. I wish everyone knew I dealt with anorexia from middle school until m senior year of highschool. I really fucking wish someone would look out for me. I wish someone cared. Iâ€™m so alone and my life is a shitshow Iâ€™m so exhausted. Iâ€™m so tired of trying to protect everyone from the truth or from sadness, because I always end up hurt. I wish I put myself first for once. I want to die, I wish I was dead.
