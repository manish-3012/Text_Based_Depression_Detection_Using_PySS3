Never been so unhealthy mentally and physically.(18m) About 5 months ago I was the happiest and healthiest I had ever been in my life enjoying new hobbies in a very good relationship with the love of my life eating really well while also going to the gym regularly. But 5 months ago my whole life crumbled I found out that my girlfriend had cheated on me with my best friend and had all of her friends lie to me for months just to cover there relationship up but everything just went downhill from there. I got diagnosed with manic depression and schizophrenia after i reached out for help at my nearest hospital they have put me on an ssri and a medication called risperidone but it hasnt done much for me at all. I attempted to commit suicide with those pills but woke up the next super ill and it really just made everything worse. I have panic attacks almost daily and have started smoking cigs to cope with it. My parents arent supportive and ive done almost everything on my own since i was 16. My biggest concern right now is i go days without eating and just drink water and i lost 10 pounds which doesnt sound like much but when your 145 pounds and 6ft tall then drop to 135 you can really see the difference (ribs) I have never done good in school and im not getting any credits this semester because i very rarely left my room for the past 4 months so im in a very bad spot with school.
