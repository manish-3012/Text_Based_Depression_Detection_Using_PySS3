Should I tell my mother about my suicidal thoughts?So I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts and depression related to what I think is body dysmorphic disorder (I haven't been diagnosed) for a long time, and recently it's got much worse. From the time that I wake up to the time that I go to bed, pretty much my entire daily routine revolves around trying to escape from my anxieties, and I keep getting these images flashing through my head of killing myself and there just being no more pain or obsession or sadness. Nobody knows about this except me. My mother knows I have been struggling with depression, but she doesn't know how bad it's got. I want to tell her, just to have someone who understands and who can maybe guide me towards getting help, but I don't know if now is the right time. My father just passed away last month, and my mother is having to deal with an immense amount of paperwork on top of the grief associated with the death of a loved one. I'm really struggling right now and I want to tell her, but it feels like I might be doing a really bad thing by adding yet another thing she has to stress out about to her life. I've written out a note for her describing all of what's going on with me, but I haven't given it to her. What do you think I should do?
