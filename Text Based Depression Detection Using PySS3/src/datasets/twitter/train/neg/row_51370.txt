I am gonna end my life tonightI'm a 16F and am already diagnosed with chronic sleep problems (i barely sleep), chronic depression and chronic suicidal tendencies and thoughts. I've been admitted to a mental hospital multiple times, for a total of 24 months. I've tried over ten different sorts of therapy. I never, a single moment of my life, been happy my previous attempts failed. I'm so done. There is no hope left for me
