What's the point of living if you're not in love/having sex?I'm 20 years old and I've never been in a relationship.  Never kissed a girl.  it's likely that I never will.  I just have horrible anxiety and self-esteem issues.  dalkjghriut 
I find it kind of funny/pathetic because I read about other suicidal people here and they have so many fucking problems.  besides my anxiety and depression, my life has been super easy.  My family is really wealthy, my parents are good people, I've never had someone close to me die.  but I just can't get over my self-loathing.
