GoodbyeI can't take it anymore. I can't take any of this. I'm an autistic socially awkward guy and I can't pass high school because of the shitty grades I get. I cannot focus on anything I cannot speak to people without sounding cringy I can't do anything right. Everybody thinks that I'm just lazy and they misunderstand me. I've been considering this for a long time already and today is the day. The day where I solve all my problems for good. Goodbye world.
