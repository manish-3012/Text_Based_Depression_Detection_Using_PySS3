About to give upI have 2 weeks to do almost a years worth of coursework because I fell behind due to mental health problems. I can't get an extension but my mental health is getting worse. I've tried everything to get my mental health back on track and I'm doing everything right, but nothings working. My GP won't listen to me, camhs (mental health service for under 18) dropped my case after offering me help and I'm too young for adult services, I just keep getting passed from person to person but no one will help me. I have to go to court after my exams as well to testify against my abuser and I'd actually rather die. I've spoken to people about it but no one really cares, they all say "oh it will be alright it's only a few hours". I've been sufferering for so many years now and I've attempted suicide a few times already, and I'm so close to actually doing it. I have enough pills, and I live next to a train station, so I have my options. I just don't know what to do anymore
