My life fucking sucksIâ€™m 23. Live with parents. Shitty job. Over $30,000 in debt. Credit score is fucked. Iâ€™ve got a 3 year old son that I canâ€™t even fucking provide for. My sons mom and I broke up cause Iâ€™m a fuck. Collections calling me every fucking day. End up with zero fucking dollars by the end of my bills. I knew life would be hard but I never thought Iâ€™d be to the point where killing myself seemed like a nice relief
