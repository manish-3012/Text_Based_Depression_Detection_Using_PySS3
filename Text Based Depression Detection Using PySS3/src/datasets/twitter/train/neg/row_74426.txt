I have absolutely no will to live anymore, I'm tired and beaten and I just can't take it anymoreI'm 32 and the thought of having to trudge on like this for another 50-60 years just makes this feeling even worse.

I'm going nowhere in life, no friends, shitty job, shitty family, shitty neighbors, shitty house, shitty everything. I just want to end it all because I'm just so tired of living like this every day.

I have no skills, no talents, nothing, I'm such a fucking worthless loser with nothing to contribute to this world
