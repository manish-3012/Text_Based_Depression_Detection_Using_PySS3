I should not have backed down from suicide.Last year, I attempted a short drop hanging, but removed the noose before falling unconscious due to the intense pressure it put on my eardrums.

Last night, I realized that not killing myself was an immense mistake. I was at a party and had drunk 3/4 of a bottle of wine. It was then that I realized two facts about myself. First, my life has not improved since last year. I still have no reason to live. Second, I have a gargantuan hatred. I used to point this hatred inward, taking it out on myself to the point where I became incredibly depressed. Last night was different. For the first time since childhood, I let my anger manifest itself outwardly. I ranted incessantly about how happiness was impossible, but that the closest I could get was attaining power via fear. I talked about how the people I thought were closest to happiness were dictators and people with power over life and death. Multiple former friends are disgusted at my words, and I fear I have lost their friendship over it.

My existence pains others as much as it pains myself. I fear that if I don't kill myself soon, I will become even more despicable.

I have no reason to live, but a convincing reason to kill myself. What do I do?
