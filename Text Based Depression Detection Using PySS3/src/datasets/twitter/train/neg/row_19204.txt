I might try to commit suicide. I dont have anyone who actually gives a shit about meI don't have anyone who actually gives a shit about me. I'm not talking about just regular stuff like trying to help someone who just got through a break up I'm talking about actually wanting me to do good in school and I can't bring myself to tell this to anyone but you guys. My whole family thinks I'm a waste of space and a waste of money and they started to think I have  a mental health problem cause I'm not thinking like them. My girlfriend doesn't even know what to say to me. I thought maybe you guys can say some meaningful things to cheer me up. I got an exam on Tuesday and I feel like I want to quit life altogether. There's so much stress everywhere I am and it's getting to me. I currently have this heart issue where my heart beats abnormally fast without no physical activity and it hurts with every single beat. I forgot what you call that but I feel so Shit and I feel like nobody even sees how peaceful I am and how I try my hardest to cope with stress. They think I somehow get over it but nobody realizes that I'm bottling all of this shit inside. Hell this is the first time I even sad anything like this to anybody. Please help me guys. I'm too scared to talk to suicide help line I feel like it's too real. Right now I'm at a loss of words so I apologize for thr way I'm typing right now.
