What do you say when someone says this to you?Talking to my boyfriend about how i'm sick of life and I just can't deal with it anymore and he says this

"you said that you would kill yourself even though you say you care about me and that you love me. you are not allowed to do that to me"

How are you meant to respond to that? It makes me seem like I'M the bad person for not even wanting to live. If you talk to someone close to you about something like this, wouldn't you expect them to care just a little?
