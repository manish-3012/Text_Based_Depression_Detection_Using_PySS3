Help. I can't move. My next move is either suicide or revelation. I don't want to keep goingI can't get these suicidal thoughts out of my head, I have been sleeping all day just to cancel it out, I don't want to hurt my family. If my family weren't in the way I would have ended myself years ago. I have college and stuff on my chest too but it's so hard to focus. Am I not fit for society? I am in physical pain from being so fucking depressed
