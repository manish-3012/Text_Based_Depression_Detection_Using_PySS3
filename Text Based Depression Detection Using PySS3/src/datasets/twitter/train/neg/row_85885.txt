Can't get over my ex and it's killing me.Our relationship was very much a rollercoaster with high highs and really low lows. She was very abusive, controlling and it made me become jealous and controlling. She cheated on me atleast twice, abused me physically and mentally, she bit me on several occassions leaving huge marks, she pulled my beard a couple of twice so hard a lot of hair came out. She caused scenes at my parents last new years eve, she caused scenes screaming and yelling at me in malls, on trains, at work etc etc. 

I have realised, looking back at our conversations on facebook, i was pretty stupid aswell, accussing her of being unfaithful (which she actually was) but there was no trust and i wasn't very nice alot of times. But that was my outlet i guess. I regret alot of things, i regret even starting to see her because i know from the start it was bad news and i didn't listen, the thought of being with someone, anyone was all that mattered and i really did fall in love with her, i really did love her more than life itself, but i wish i never did. 

It's soon been a year since she left me and i'm not so sure i can make it another year without her. She's constantly on my mind, i miss her every second, i miss the times we shared i miss it all... 

If i only could stop thinking about her but i can't, everyday for almost a year i have thought about her. I can't keep this up, i'm going insane.

I wish i could contact her and talk to her but after she dumped me she cut all contact with me and even threatened me with calling the cops because i tried to talk to her... 

She said she loved me, she promised me forever, she promised we would fight for eachother no matter what... How can someone who says stuff like that turn in a blink of an eye and cut all contact?

I'm not made for this world... I can't go on. One year without her was one year too much.
