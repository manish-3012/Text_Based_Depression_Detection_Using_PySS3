[Trigger warning] Excuse for self inflicted burns*I do know the crisis line and used it after when I was having a panic attack.
*I know it's not a healthy thing to do.

But, I did. I did something stupid out of impulse. I burned myself.  I REALLY need help with an excuse as the father of my daughter knows my history (we were together 12 years.) He's seen my at my worst - but! I had always only cut on my ankles and wrists, I'm thinking the excuse for this would be easier than one for cuts.


 I did work on my car last night and I hadn't self harmed in a LONG time. I just did it without thinking, as usual; impulse and lost in the moment.


Should I say I touched something under the hood while the car was still hot? I have 3 almost in a curved like pattern the first on forearm then down a little then on the side of my wrist. They are about an inch long, kind of wide and a little deep. 

I think the car excuse  is a good one but I would need to say what I was working on to explain the 3 burns. Maybe that there was a wire smooshed behind the engine and when I went to fix it I touched the engine? 

I do not want to self harm again, I just need to be able to explain this.
