Things i cant tell anyoneEverything is so bad right now. Its such a complex and horrific situation that I cannot type it out. I feel so alone despite reading posts on this sub. 
I'm lucky enough to have a very close friend to talk to but honestly, I still feel completely alone. I don't know what's missing in my life, but I feel this void within me. I feel like I've lost something important. I feel like I have no one. 
I have nothing to lean on. I have nothingâ€‹to do with my time and nothing that I can get interested in. 
The only thing keeping me from killing myself right now is the fact I'm starting a new job. I don't know why I have the job anyway but I guess it was better than staying at home all day.
