My biggest fear about going through with it.My biggest fear about killing myself is failure. Leaving myself mentally incompetent. Or living through it and being in pain. It terrifies me. I shot my rifle at a 1/4 inch steel plate from about 15 yards out the other day at my dads farm. It went clean through and it was strangely comforting. If i do it at point blank range i think theres almost zero chance i could live through it. Im still too much of a coward to pull the trigger, but if i ever do at least i know its over then and there.
