I just wrote my suicide note.I write sometimes so I donâ€™t go fucking insane. I did that tonight and it ended up devolving into a suicide note. I do not plan on killing myself in the very near future. But if I do end up dead as a result of my own hands, this will be near. All asterisks are redacted personal info.

To whom it may concern,
I want nothing more in this world than to die. I seek nothing more than the beautiful image of my brains, bones fragments, and blood run down my lifeless body. Why the fuck are we here? Worthless apes whose only purpose is to disappoint everyone or die. Or both for that matter. Why the fuck do I not have the courage to kill myself? Itâ€™s going to happen anyways. There is nothing in this life for me, except my demise. I seek control. No, I need control over my own life. There is only one way for me to do so, I have to kill myself, it is the only fate this world holds for me. I wish that I had the courage to knock that motherfucker out. If fairness existed, and anybody deserved anything, that man would deserve a long, painful, macabre death. He deserves my fucking fist so deep into his head that his skull cracks and fragments. I would take that .22 and blow his fucking brains out if I had the courage. Him and I both. Two fucking pieces of shit lying dead, waiting for the cat to eat our fucking faces. Thank God, soon I wonâ€™t have to see him for three months. I will only call him once in that time to make sure he isnâ€™t dead. We arenâ€™t father and son. His only relationship with me, is one of genetics and money. He pays for my final days unaware that soon I may be dead. As if. I donâ€™t have the courage do so. And if I did, he would be dead first by hands before I would. I am nothing but a burden on his miserable, pathetic, superficial life. Normally, after writing this much (but so little), my mind would change and realize the sheer gravity of my words. But not this time. Despite my young age, I can see through this fucking facade we pathetic apes have created for ourselves to hide ourselves from the crippling realization that nothing matters, that we donâ€™t have any value in a universe that came from nothing. That will be nothing. Nothing will be nothing. I quite like the sound of that. We humans need to rip our heads from our asses, and see the world for what it is. Nothing. Nothing at all. Dust in the fucking wind. Pretty small dust, and a pretty strong gust. Nobody would even see us. Nobody in the middle of nothing, all to return to nothing.
I have made my decision. If I kill myself, and I probably will, it will be in his car. The only thing that fucking pathetic ape loves in this world. I will die doing what I love. Isnâ€™t that our pathetic dream? At least then, heâ€™ll be sad about his car and people will think he was sad about me. That way, itâ€™ll look like these past few years, he actually did like or love me, and actually cared. If anybody reads this, I have died as a result of this, or similarly designed plan. DO NOT CONFUSE THAT PIECE OF SHITâ€™S LOVE OF HIS CAR AS LOVE FOR ME. He is, in the words of Maynard, â€œa liar and deceiver. Nothing but a snakeâ€. Please do not confuse. I do not blame my need to die on him. That is completely moronic. He has no bearing or control of my life, I do. I do not blame it on the death of my mother. I have what some may call it, â€œgone fucking insane like a chicken stuffed in a cageâ€. I like to call it â€œrealizing my worthlessness like a chicken stuffed in a cageâ€. The only difference between the chicken and I is that Iâ€™m not freaking out. Internally, I am perfectly calm. I put on my facade with other stupid apes because I do not seek to be hospitalized.

I guess since this writing will only be read in the event of my death, it places itself in the category of suicide letters. Therefore, it must end with closure to those who actually care. I not only write this for this purpose, I write it in hopes to turn my mind around, and see that life does have meaning. Itâ€™s comical how I can recognize the problem and solution, and not take action of either. My mind is one that deserves to be split between two pathetic apes. It does not belong here, nor do I. Anyways, I lost myself in a tangent. I only love those who truly know I do. My dearest friends, ************ *****************************. You seven are not friends, you are truly loved ones. You have been there with me through my trials and tribulations. You have showed me love beyond unimaginable means. Next, there are those who I only hope the best for, and I wish I had become closer with. ******************************** **************************. In mentioning these people, I will almost entirely exclude family unless there is a reason. Now, I have messages for certain people and groups. To my family, I love you. This doesnâ€™t mean I was close with you, or even liked you. Family has a bond that few experience. To my closest ones, your immense effort to show me love and care was not wasted. You eased my suffering in my final months and years. I truly, from the bottom of my heart, love you. To choir, while we may not have been as close as we could have been, you had nothing but good intentions for me, and I love you. To the Boy Scouts, and more specifically Troop ***, you gave me a home both physically and emotionally when I needed it most. Your values do nothing but good. With that, I give you a hardy left handshake goodbye. To mom, I would say that I will see you soon, but obviously thatâ€™s impossible. You will not even be able to read this. But if Iâ€™m completely wrong, I love you.
