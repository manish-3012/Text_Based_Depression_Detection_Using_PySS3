I'm a 23 year old virginKissless. Never been in a relationship. Never even held a womans hand in romantic context. Am I ugly? Is it because I'm short? Did I somehow miss out on some crucial information about how this game is played? I don't understand why and I'm not sure it matters at this point.  
And no I don't want to go to a prostitute. That wouldn't solve anything. This isn't just about sex, it's just as much about feeling wanted, feeling loved and maybe more than anything I want to be able to relate.  
It's just so frustrating, stuff about sex/romance/relationships is so ubiquitous, you can barely watch a movie without it coming up at some point. Recently I was at a city festival where there was a cover band playing old school rock songs. The majority of those songs were love related. I can't even go out anymore to have a good time without my virginity chasing me.  
Last week I spent completely resigned, as a couple of harsh reminders came up around the same time, like my mother trying to be subtle about asking me whether I'm gay. Other than for a friend's birthday, I didn't go outside for anything I didn't have to. Didn't open the windows and barely ate anything, drinking only coke and going down to the same fast food joint below the flat I live in, to get my only meal of the day. Only reason I realized I needed to stop was because I started to feel dizzy by the end of the week.  
I wish it was easier to get a gun where I live. I wager I would be able to kill myself on the spot when these thoughts start to come up. Instead I always have enough time to think of some stupid rationalization not to do it. Continuing to pretend to give off a sense of normalcy, only to have the same thoughts come back up every couple of months. I don't want to live on false hope anymore, I just want to be done with this misery.
