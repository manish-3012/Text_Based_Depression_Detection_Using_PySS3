I sometimes close my door to my room and think about how, if I kill myself, Ill never have to see beyond those walls again. I have this weird dichotomy taking place within me. I don't believe in suicide I don't think it's the answer. I think living is important and worthwhile. However, my life is ruined in many ways. Drugs, money relationships. The way I've always been treated like riffraff. The dichotomy is that when I want to die I sometimes think metaphysically if I never open my door to my room again, I somehow deny the existence of the world outside of it. When I feel that way I become peaceful in my heart. I feel relief. The other side being that I now see that the danger of suicide is the numbness that comes before. I think that numbness is a warped view of reality but the way it takes me over sometimes is intoxicating. I'm not crying right now I actually feel quite stable. I've been thinking about this so long it's become familiar, friendly, some proverbial mother cooing me to sleep as she pets my head....
