Fat, stupid, autistic, socially awkward, gay, and hated by myself and others. What's the point?I have no confidence, I can't do anything, I self harm, I spend my whole life wishing for death, and my mother openly says she dislikes gay people despite me being an out lesbian. I can't even list all the things that make me fucking worthless.
 
I've been happier lately since realizing I'm gonna kill myself, but now anytime shit get's hard I just ignore knowing when I'm dead I won't have to deal with it.

I'm not sure what the fuck I'm trying to do with this post, maybe just looking for attention, maybe looking for someone to relate, maybe crying for help. I don't know.
