My SO and I have been together for 4 years and I still just don't know how to be honest with him about my crappy mental health. Today I just want to be done.I don't know what to say. Nothing bad happened today. Actually good things happened today. But when I came home and he wasn't home, I wanted to just take a handful of sleeping pills and never come back. 

I lost my job a while back and now I don't know that I can afford to care for my dogs, which makes me feel like scum. I love them so much, and I have always been a great dog parent (my back yard is full of agility equipment, my dogs have great manners, and one is in the process of becoming a therapy dog - they are really my life), but now I wouldn't be able to afford the vet bill if one of them got injured, and I feel outrageously irresponsible.

I wish I could talk to my SO about my mental health - I have OCD, and he has very little understanding of how that affects me. But he has a hard time talking about feelings - he just totally shuts down. It's something he's actively working on (and has gotten much better in the last 4 years), but sometimes I feel like I need someone in my life who is more available.
