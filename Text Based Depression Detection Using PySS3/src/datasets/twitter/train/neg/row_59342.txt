I need helpIt's weird, I never thought I'd be in the position where this seemed like the best and only option.  My life's spiraled out of control, I have no idea what I'm doing, no one to care about me when I'm gone and no reason to continue this hell that I call life. I've hit what I thought was rock bottom, and waited for things to get better... they didn't they only continued to get worse. I went from being depressed, losing my job, and having no one that cared about me to being depressed, having a meaningless job, no one to care about me, and relapsing into pain meds and cough syrup. I've tried to pull myself together, but after many failed attempts and no one ever caring about you, or giving you a second chance you get so run down that you just can't do it anymore.  It's funny though, so many people come to me for help with their problems, thinking I'm some beacon of reason and truth and I'll be able to give them a reason to do something. The truth is, I give them what I longed to be told and have long given up being told. That SOMEONE SOMEWHERE CARES about you, it may not seem obvious but someone does.  It's easy advice to give to others, but I realized it's not true for myself.  I've systematically phased everyone out of my life at one point or another, no one not a single person has ever come back to me and said they missed me.  I've lived my life, and fulfilled my purposes, it's on to the next part, where things may actually look up, or maybe I'll just be forgotten in the dregs of time, either way it's better.
