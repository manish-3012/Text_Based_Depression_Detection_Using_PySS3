Tired of FightingWell I have only posted a few times on Reddit, I feel this will be my most important post I'll ever make.
I have been struggling with major depressive disorder and a slight bi-polar disorder for the past 10 years of my life. My mom was a severe alcoholic and often beat me. My father hardly showed me affection, and often just screamed at my mother. On top of this, I was severely bullied in grade school, resulting in my arm being broken. While I understand that other people have been through worse, and I sympathize with them, I feel like my life has no purpose. I am currently in college, about to finish a degree that I have no interest in. My girlfriend emotionally abuses me, and I'm starting to hate the relationship and I have little to no friends. Suicide has always been on mind, but I have tried to hold on and push through for years. Medicine, therapy, weight-lifting, non of it helped. I've reached the point where I don't think i'll ever make a bounce back. I just don't feel like my life has a purpose and I feel better knowing I can put a hollow point in my brain and be rid of it all..
