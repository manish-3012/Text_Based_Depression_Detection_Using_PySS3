(13/m) I won't ever be happy, so why continue?Everyone is going to die eventually. Some lives are just longer than others. Why bother with anything knowing that it will someday be pointless if you're not enjoying anything?

I'm 13. I was born in California. My parents took me to Brazil when I was 5, and I spent 8 years in hell. They both took drugs and didn't let me eat or leave the house. I just curled up and waited to die. 

My cousin saved me from that life last July. I live with him in Minnesota now and life is better. But instead of being happy, I find so many more things to be depressed about.

All I want is friends and love. My first friend when I came over here was very patient with my bad English. We spent so much time together. He was my best friend for months. He is the guy of my dreams, and he is gay. I told him I was gay too. We were going to be a couple. I love him. But he decided to date another guy instead and joined his group of friends, who told him not to talk to me. He doesn't date that boy anymore but still does not want to talk to me. People online say that is not love and that I just "love" everyone I crush on, or that it will go away in a few days. It has been 71 days since he betrayed me and I am still deeply hurt. I still love him, and he is the only one I want.

I wish I had just died before coming back to USA. I burden my cousin too much. He wants to fix things for me that can't be fixed.

I don't know why I'm even posting here. Everyone will just say, "It gets better," when it won't; or "I know how you feel," when they don't. Nobody takes teens seriously on the internet. Nobody takes anyone seriously in the Suicide Watch it seems.
