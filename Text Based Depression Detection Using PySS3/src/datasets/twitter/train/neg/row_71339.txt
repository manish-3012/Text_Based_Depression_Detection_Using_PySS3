I'm sick of myselfI cannot stand my own thoughts or being in this body. I just need out. I need out of something and i don't know what. I know I am very unstable right now. I don't know what i want or need i haven't been able to breathe properly. It's like screaming into a vacuum and no one can hear it. i don't have anyone no one knows i exist anymore i am a burden. 

i want it all to end. i need an end. it hurts. hurts a lot. i hurt myself for kicks now because i dont have anything to lose.
