Any stories of attempts that failed against all logicAnyone ever lived through attempts that you feel like definitely should have killed you? Like I've had two serious attempts that somehow didn't work. Like taking whole bottles of pain killers, some expired and somehow just ended up in a weirdly high and half awake state, wondering the streets then shitting and puking blue the next day. I used to be into asphyxiation and decided hanging would be a good way to go, rope broke after a few seconds, it was supposed to have very strong weight limits too, well above my body weight. Anyone else ever make a serious go at it only to have lived against the odds?
