I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.Iâ€™ve been feeling this way for so long. I canâ€™t keep going through life like this. Everyone says it gets better but it hasnâ€™t. What if I still feel like this a year from now? Five years from now? I canâ€™t keep feeling this way. Iâ€™ve tried getting help. Nothing helps. Iâ€™m young and in college and this is supposed to be the best time of my life but Iâ€™m just miserable. I spend so much time wishing I could just be someone else whoâ€™s happy and actually has people that care about them. I feel so alone all the time and everything just seems so pointless. I donâ€™t have a reason to be alive so why am I? Itâ€™s just the same thing every day. My therapist told me I was going to be miserable the rest of my life and heâ€™s probably right.
