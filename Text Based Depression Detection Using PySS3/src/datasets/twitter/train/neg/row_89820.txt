i feel uselessim in highschool. i'm that kind of friend who does whatever to please the people around me. it makes me happy to see that my friends are successful and thriving.i love my friends, they the people who are really beside me and keep me happy. i just put on a happy face and smile, but really on the inside i feel empty. there isn't anything about me that is special.

 i feel worthless. my mom compares me to cousins and friends and say how much better in school they are. how they are getting into amazing colleges like princeton and yale. she constantly tells me how ugly and stupid i look. 

my dad doesn't say anything, he tells me how much of a good job im doing and that he loves me. however the other day i overheard my parents talking about me and he was saying how useless i was. how i wasn't successful at anything and that i don't deserve anything. it hurt me so bad when i heard that. i try to hide my feelings and emotions.

 i try. i really do. but sometimes i just want to end it all so my parents wouldn't suffer with me anymore. it feels as if im putting a huge burden on their shoulders.
