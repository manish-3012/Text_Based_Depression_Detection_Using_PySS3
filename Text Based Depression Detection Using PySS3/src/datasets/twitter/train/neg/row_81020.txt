I want to end my life. Please, somebody help me.I tried to live so hard, but every minute I feel like I'm drowning.- just plain painful and helpless.

I feel like I'm the most useless thing in the world, and just not worthy enough to live. I'm just tired of everything, and I can't bear living anymore. I'm not exactly someone who deserves to live.

My life's a mess, and I feel like everything is falling apart, no matter how hard I try to put it together.

Today, I put a knife in front of my heart, but I couldn't bring myself to push it further in because I couldn't bring my few loved ones to face my death. I cried so hard after that.

Why am I just dragging this miserable life on when I can just end it within minutes? I wouldn't have to suffer, and world would have one less horrible thing to sustain.

I don't know what to do with my life anymore.

Please, somebody help me.
