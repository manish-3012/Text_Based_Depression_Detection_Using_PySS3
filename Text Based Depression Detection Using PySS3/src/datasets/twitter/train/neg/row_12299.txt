Tired, just want to go away now.I'm tired of living in here, I just want to run away. If only I could do it faster or sooner, but there is no way. I made plans to go live to the other side of the world. Away of all those people that make me want to shut the lights out. It's so hard to get this out right now. 

I don't even know where or how to start, It's like all my life I have been alone and now I want to end it or change it. But I really don't know how to do it faster.
