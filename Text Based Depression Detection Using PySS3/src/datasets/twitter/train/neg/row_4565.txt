Hey guys.Iâ€™ve been thinking about it a lot lately. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s triggered these thoughts and feelings, but it feels as though each time it becomes more heartbreaking. I have trouble keeping friends, I disappoint my family a lot. All Iâ€™ve got is my boyfriend and my potential art career, but I feel like Iâ€™ll lose those too. Iâ€™m a mess. I attempted suicide back in Feb, and my boyfriend left me because of it... Iâ€™ve been dating this really nice guy since April and heâ€™s treated me so well, but I feel like I canâ€™t kill myself because I would break him. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m so selfish guys, I just want to escape
