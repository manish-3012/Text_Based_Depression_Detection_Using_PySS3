So tiredI'm so sad it physically hurts. I woke up randomly and it's honestly the worst. 

How bad does it need to get before I actually find help? I already feel like a burden to everyone around me. 

I have cuts on both arms and I'm physically and emotionally drained. I don't want to be alive but I'm afraid of being admitted to the hospital too. 

I'm tired of living but I know it's the only option. I feel trapped and desperate and sad. So intensely sad.
