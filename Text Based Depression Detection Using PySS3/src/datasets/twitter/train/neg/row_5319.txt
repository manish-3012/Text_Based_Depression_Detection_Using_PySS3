9AM exam, can't stop thinking about dying insteadFuck this shit. This semester killed me. My first final is tomorrow. I'm not ready. 

I have so much other shit going on too... I can't keep doing this. I'm done. I'm discouraged. I'm tired. 

I'm going to try and sleep, but I've got 4 more exams and a week before I can go home. Just need a few friends, kind words, support....
