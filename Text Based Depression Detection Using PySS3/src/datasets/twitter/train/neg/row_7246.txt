sometimes it's just too hardI'm 25. I've had problems with anxiety and depression since I was a young child. Things don't seem to be getting better.  Sometimes I just think my brain is fucked.  I can't stop doing impulsive things to soothe myself and use escapism at every opportunity.  I'm getting older and more reclusive. My head is filled with anxiety all the time. I can feel the stress hormones chipping away at my sanity.  

The end.

Please someone, end me now.
