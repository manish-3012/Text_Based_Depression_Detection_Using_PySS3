Iâ€™ve given up on school... I donâ€™t see the point in going when I have a foot out the exitI donâ€™t see the point anymore.. I donâ€™t see myself living long at all.. will never have my own car, house, first pay check, have kids, pursue oneâ€™s passion. I donâ€™t care anymore.. I donâ€™t want to live in this world, In my body, alone, feeling misunderstood or never understood. My empathy is running out fast. Im too weak emotionally to handle anything anymore. Im tired. Im tired of everyone being shit. Everyday is a battle and I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s worth to live for except love but even that is scarce. Itâ€™s so hard. I donâ€™t know how to stop everything. I canâ€™t breathe in this place.
