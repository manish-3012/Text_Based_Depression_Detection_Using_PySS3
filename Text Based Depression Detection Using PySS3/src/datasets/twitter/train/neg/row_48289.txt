Canâ€™t see a psychiatrist for 4 monthsI live in a very small town. There is literally only one psychiatric facility, and they canâ€™t schedule me in till April. I live with my parents and they wonâ€™t let me go to one thatâ€™s out of town. I already see a therapist, and they said that I definitely need medication. 
If I canâ€™t even get it until 4 months, thereâ€™s no point. I tried to get help and it failed. I might as well just die, since I canâ€™t go on living like this.
