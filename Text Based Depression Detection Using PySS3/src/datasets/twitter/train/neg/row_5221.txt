Nothing good, nothing badEvery month or so I get the urge to do it, and every month or so I don't, today's that time of the month again and I decided to give this a shot to see if I can get out of it.

Short story is, I don't have any place in society. I have no hobbies, no particular objectives, no redeeming qualitys, no nothing. I just kind of sit around existing being a drag to my mom and not looking forward to anything.

17 y/o with 18 coming up faster than I'd like, finishing high school hating the fact that life is coming up to me soon-ish and I still might as well be 12 years old mentally. Last "real" friend I had was when I was maybe 13, and even then it was pushing it since looking back he was just searching desperately for excuses to cut me off, then last friends were at around 15 after we moved from our country but it turned out some girl in the group just had a thing for me and semi-forced me in her group to get close, obviously once she got to know me and my shit personality she backed off and the group of friends was freed for me. Honestly I don't know where I'm going with this I don't know what kind of information I'm supposed to give to you guys, so I guess I'll try to answer any questions that come up, I have no idea what you can say to me but I guess I wanted a place to get this off my chest.
