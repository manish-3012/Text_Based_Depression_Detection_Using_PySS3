What do I do?I don't know if this is the right place for this, but I've been following one of my friends spam instagram accounts for a long time, now. They haven't made a post in months, but just recently, made a post about having only 63 days to live, and started a day counter in their bio. They moved away, and I don't know where they live anymore, but I feel like I have to do something. Only 6 other people follow the account, and I don't think any of them are active but me.
