I just want it all to stopI spend every night thinking of how I should kill myself and why I should do it. I wake up wanting to die. The days I don't feel suicidal, I don't ever feel happy. I love my two best friends to death, but I don't think they even like talking to me. They would be happier without me in their lives, just like my old "friends." I was too stupid to even realize that they hated me and wanted nothing to do with me, but I see now.

Sometimes I think I'm just not meant for this world. Everyone would be happier if I was gone.. I wouldn't be a financial or emotional burden on anyone else ever again. Sounds a lot better than what my current situation is. I hate myself so much, and it's been like this ever since I can remember.
