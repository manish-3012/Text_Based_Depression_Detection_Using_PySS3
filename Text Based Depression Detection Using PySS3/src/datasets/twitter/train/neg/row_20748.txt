Just need to get this outIâ€™m 22 nonbinary. It feels like my depression, bpd, ocd whatever have you canâ€™t let me rest or relax or feel happy. I would post on r/depression but because I talk about suicidal ideation Iâ€™ll post it here. Iâ€™m not going to do anything, that is a promise. Iâ€™m just extremely depressed and wish I wasnâ€™t so afraid to do things to myself. Iâ€™m starting a day program Monday. But for the last decade my life has been hell. I had to grow up too fast and took care of another human being, up until she died three years ago from cancer. Then my mom has Alzheimerâ€™s. So I get to see it happen all over again. Thereâ€™s a lot of trauma that I opened to professionals about this year from the trauma with all that to having years of being put down and yelled at a lot. I had a best friend who I saw as my sister but because of undiagnosed bpd over the years I just put too much on her and now sheâ€™s gone. I had an extreme fear of abandonment, I feel alone, I have friends but friends have family. I also canâ€™t stand being an adult. I miss my childhood almost every day. Iâ€™m trying to get what I can back but some I canâ€™t get back at it hurts like hell. It really does. For so long I felt like if I couldnâ€™t get things back then instead RIP. I feel like I donâ€™t deserve happiness. I miss my best friend. I donâ€™t feel romantic love, Iâ€™m aromantic, asexual. I donâ€™t wanna get married, I donâ€™t like relationships, but I wanna be apart of a family, and my childhood back and I thought I had that but I donâ€™t. I may delete this later. Just needed to get this out. Iâ€™m depressed as shit. Adulthood is filled with trauma, depression, death, abandonment. Thereâ€™s no magic left. I just needed to get this out. I just wanna feel cared for. My brain just makes me regress because of trauma and overstimulation. OCD wonâ€™t let me feel happy bc of past mistakes that I think of anyone knew what they were.. theyâ€™d probably hate me? Also like my dream is to be a film director or work in the industry but I just dunno if Iâ€™m good enough. I donâ€™t think I deserve it. I miss my best friend. I miss my grandma. I miss my mom. And I feel like shit because I have friends and I should be grateful, but I want family, because they all have family and I donâ€™t. They all have someone to go home to. Anyways Iâ€™m gonna try and do something relaxing and chill with a friend and stay safe. I just wanted to get this out. Thanks.
