mid-late teens, suicidally depressed for over a decade, had psychosis 2 years back and it came back in December, it's scratched at the door of my mind the whole time though, shoulda killed myself in feburay on my birthday, but I fuckin failed, NOBODY KNOWS!Read my earlier posts if you give a shit, I hallucinate sometimes, I see a dark double of myself, I hear whispering, I used to have delusions, I had some around christmas even, but I fought through them, had delusions really bad two years ago, I can't get help and I really really want to be dead, and these are only half of my problems, the rest I can't talk about. Can anyone explain any of this shit or give me a reason to keep going? My ONLY reason for living right now is to play doom 4, which is a pathetic reason to live to be honest, but frankly I don't really have anything to look forward to right now. Ask me questions about my psychotic or depressive symptoms if you want.
