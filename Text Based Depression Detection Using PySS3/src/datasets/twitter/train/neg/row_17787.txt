Hi reddit, I think it's time.I've been studying engineering for 2 years now, have a good gpa, but it's not what I want to study. This semester I tried to make my parents notice by getting bad grades on only my major related classes, but instead it went another way and I just can't take it. It hurts to make my parents waste money, it hurts not being able to change. This isn't about school anymore, I don't eat, I don't care about myself, I just live everyday in auto mode. I have barely any reason to keep on with this, but I don't think I can keep at it. My motivation is dead. And I'm scared that my time to make the right choices has passed.
