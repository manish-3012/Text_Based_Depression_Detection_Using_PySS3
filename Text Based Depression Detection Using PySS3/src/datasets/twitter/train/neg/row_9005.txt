Iâ€™m just scaredAnother night with no sleep. I donâ€™t want pity or attention, I just want to feel okay. Iâ€™m done putting on an act all the time, pretending to be normal and happy. How are people just happy all the time? Itâ€™s so funny, it all hurts so much all the time that I think Iâ€™ve lost the ability to cry. Iâ€™m such a fucking freak. I donâ€™t want to live without love anymore. Iâ€™m just scared and alone and weak. Iâ€™m too scared that itâ€™ll hurt or that Iâ€™ll mess up and just let everyone down again.
