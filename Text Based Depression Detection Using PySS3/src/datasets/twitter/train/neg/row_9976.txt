Anyone around?Not in danger of committing suicide, but feel like maybe I could use someone to talk to. Everyone who knows me - all my friends and family - are pretty much lost to me at this point. Tired of reaching out to people and either have them feed me platitudes about how "life will get better" or simply having them write me off.
