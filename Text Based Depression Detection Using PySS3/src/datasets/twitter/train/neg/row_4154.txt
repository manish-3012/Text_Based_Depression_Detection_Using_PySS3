I use video games as escapismAll my life I've loved video games. I still play even though some days it feels like I shouldn't be, or I know I shouldn't be.
As far as my memories go I know there'll be some of a game I played at the time. 
But I think the first time I ever realised something was off with me, was in 6th grade, when I finally got off of a 3 month grounding for a poor grade. Only to hop back on the computer and feel different. Like the grounding sucked the life from video games. I still played though, just different games. They never seemed the same though. Now I still play them regularly, just with different priorities. 
Now I've opened up to my girlfriend recently about some dysfunctional family issues that I hadn't realized were problems until now. 
One being a memory of how my dad would say "Now hes becoming smart" after I learned to keep quiet when asked about things I did, good or bad.
Or how I'd have to cry nonstop at my door while grounded in elementary school for my dad to allow me outside the house with friends. 
My mom always told me its how he was raised in his family and that its to show he cares, so I went with it and let it go. 
But now I'm beginning to understand why I would stay in my room all day, on the computer hiding.
I played through my worst and best times. after or before suicide attempts, and achievements. 
I don't feel emotionally involved or connected to anything anymore. My chest doesn't even hurt anymore when i cry to my girlfriend over text, instead I just feel hollow. Even dread is losing the bite it once had.
