I have been thinking about suicide again.I seem to always come back to thinking about this, but always for different reasons. I know I have some amount of depression. Iâ€™m not going to call it clinical because I can still get out of bed and function normally, and itâ€™s undiagnosed. But thereâ€™s always something that makes me think about suicide.

This time, itâ€™s that I miss my time in high school. A lot. And I know that is such a trivial thing to miss and consider suicide for, but my life since high school has been all around not great to terrible. And I didnâ€™t even have necessarily a good time in high school. But I loved my school, and most of my classes. I actually had friends. I had no real responsibilities yet. I was interested in school drama. I lost all of that in college. I always think, if I could, Iâ€™d happily live in an endless loop of my time in Highschool, easily. And while Iâ€™m not a religious person or spiritual necessarily, for all I know that could happen if I die, just start from the beginning again, or become looped in your best time, etc. or nothing at all.

I know not everyone had a good time in high school and it can be a time of great trauma for some. Iâ€™m sorry to those people and hope they are doing better than I am right now.
