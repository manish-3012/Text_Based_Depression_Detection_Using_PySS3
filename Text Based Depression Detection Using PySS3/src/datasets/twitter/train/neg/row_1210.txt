Friday I end it all.I'm 15 and transgender, and I guess I'm just tired. I feel exhausted all the time, I just really wish things weren't so difficult. My school year just started a few weeks ago, and I'm already a week behind and failing two classes. Things just feel like a never ending shitshow, and I know that's my fault. I'm the main thing wrong with my life, I know that everything bad that happens in it is because of me. I'm the one always putting myself in these positions to get screwed even more. I'm the one always fucking up every good thing I've ever had. And then I have to wake up and deal with the piece of shit body. Every morning I'm forced to look at it and I hate it. I can't stand it. But I know I can't change it, even if I were to transition, I would never pass. I'm already 6'3 and have massive fucking limbs and broad shoulders. My facial features are way too masculine and amount of hormones is going to change the fact that I was born a guy. That I'll never be a real woman. That even if I were to transition, I'd have to live a life of fear just because I'm black and trans. I feel like I lose either way, that either way I go, I still end up miserable. I'll never be someones wife or mother, I'll forever be this gigantic freak who wishes they were a woman. I wish that I could be a normal teenage girl for just one day, but I can't and no amount of wishing to an unforgiving god is going to make that happen. I'll forever be mocked and ridiculed, called slurs, and quite possibly assaulted or even murdered. It doesn't help that my grandparents hate trans people, and my parents used to make fun of them. I fucking hate this rural fucking state, I hate everything about it. It won't matter for to much longer though, I'm going to kill myself on Friday. I plan to take a bunch pills in the middle of the night and go to sleep. I'm so done with everything, I just want my life to be over.
