Wanted to OD on a bottle of acetaminophen, had to call NSHNew Years was just fucking awful. I was alone on it and had no one. Everyone I knew had glamorous plans and had so much fun, meanwhile I was just watching my clock in the darkness, waiting for any of them to respond to my texts. I feel so selfish that I felt like that, which just made the suicidal feelings worse. I keep a full bottle of acetaminophen in my room, since one full bottle is easily enough to induce liver failure and kill a grown adult.

Thankfully, my feelings weren't so extreme that I didn't call the National Suicide Hotline. I did, and they talked me out of doing anything extreme, but now that it's over I'm still feeling suicidal. The thoughts are brief but really strong, and I'm basically just hanging from a thread at this point.

I'm in a bad, bad spot, and I think my depression and thoughts of suicide have driven everyone close to me away. They won't ask me if I'm okay anymore, and I'm too afraid of ruining their fun nights to try reaching out.
