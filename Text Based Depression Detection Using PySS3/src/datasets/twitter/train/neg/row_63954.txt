I want to kill myself, not beacause of depression, I just feel material life is just not worth it.I want to kill myself, not beacause of depression, I just feel material life is just not worth it. 

I feel life is not good, not because i am unhappy with evertything i have but i believe spirituality is the actual path of the being, i am pantheist so "god" is not a thing for me. Right now i feel that suicide is the only way to move on off this body to a better life or world, i dont know for sure but id rather kill myself and hope for the best than live in this sick capitalist and horrible world were you live to work for the elite, and a fake economy were you have to consume and slowly kill your body with chemicals and shit they put in the food and water, spend this physical life mostly working and sleeping, this system is rotten and i hate it, i think im done and this week i will do something about it. :/
