I think Iâ€™m going to go through with it soonI wanted to wait until after my momâ€™s birthday to make it easier. I wanted to live through this Halloween and maybe the holidays so I wont ruin them for anyone I love. Also, I can see if things may change. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it for somewhere around 6 months now &amp; it hasnâ€™t left my mind. Ive been calling the suicide hotline nearly every week and Iâ€™m just wasting peoples time that they can be spending on someone whose mind still has room to change rather than me, because nothing helps. I feel bad. i try every day not to drown in myself &amp; Iâ€™ve reached out to all of my doctors about how Iâ€™m feeling, and I shared some things with people I love so there will be no doubt that I tried everything. I am sure I want to do this. 

Iâ€™m going to start giving away a lot of my stuff to make it easier on my family members. If not, Iâ€™m gonna write names on them so someone will know what to take. But Iâ€™m hoping to do it all myself. I started a box where I collect all of the things going through my head on a daily basis, mostly dying soon; so there will be less questions for the ones I leave behind. I know confusion can hurt the most sometimes. I might leave letters so people will know it wasnâ€™t anyoneâ€™s fault &amp; that I *did* think through this well. Iâ€™ve already written my own note. I donâ€™t have an exact date, just an idea, &amp; plans. Iâ€™ve begun doing things Iâ€™ve always wanted to do so I could leave less regret, here on earth. I am no longer committing to things and have started finishing anything I need to do for others. Iâ€™m building a playlist of the songs I will be listening to as the meds kick in. Iâ€™ll probably post again here regarding my situation in case I need to vent. Iâ€™ve tried to refrain from spending time with people so there will be less connection. 

Iâ€™m tired of things always leading to this. Iâ€™m tired of battling my own mind. I think life just isnâ€™t meant for everyone. I do believe there is something up there. Someone near me has passed away a few days ago and my dad was whaling while crying, so I got to watch their funeral on zoom, Iâ€™ve seen news stories pop up on my feed about people my age in similar situations committing suicide. And It seems like somethingâ€™s trying to tell me what Iâ€™d be doing to others if I did it but itâ€™s never been about anyone. Call me selfish or whatever but it hurts too bad, &amp; has been hurting for so long. Everyone will get over my passing, eventually. My depression isnâ€™t something I can get over &amp; staying alive is something with too much work for what its worth for not only me &amp; itâ€™s for the better of everyone. I want to make sure everyone is in an okay head space before I go. Iâ€™m waiting until thereâ€™s less going on in the world. Iâ€™ve written wishes for my funeral to make planning easier on everyone. Nobody really knows Iâ€™m planning this and if I did tell them, they would think itâ€™s their fault. So I will stay quiet.
