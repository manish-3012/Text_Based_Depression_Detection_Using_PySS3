Aboulomania has ruined my lifeThis is basically the term for pathological indecisiveness. And it defines me perfectly. I can't stress enough how debilitating it has been for me to make big decisions over the years. I'll be stuck in analysis paralysis for days and never make any progress. I started a business years ago because I couldn't decide on a career and still question every day if this is what I should be doing. I'm grateful it has made me a living but i've put such little effort in to it, it has made me feel unemployed at times. It's like I have no inner voice or spirit guiding me telling what's the right thing to do. And even when I do finally make a decision I will ALWAYS beat the crap out of myself because I'll tell myself it was the wrong one. And I'll question everything I'm doing all the time. I never have any sense of security or closure on any decision. I'll then spend a ridiculous amount of time dwelling on past decisions and imagining what my life could be like if I had made better choices. Can anyone relate? Could this be a sign of another underlying disorder? I believe if I could get this under control I would not be depressed and might actually want to live
