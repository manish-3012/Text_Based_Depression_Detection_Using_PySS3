What do I do?Iâ€™m still recovering from a terrible break up. Iâ€™m using drugs to cope and began distancing myself from my friends. I donâ€™t want to become addicted to molly, but at this point. What the hell? Iâ€™ve had two attempts that landed me in the hospital in may and july, and all my mother had to say to me was â€œatleast tell me if youâ€™re going to do it so I can take an insurance policy outâ€. Iâ€™ve flunked out alot of my classes this semester for my freshmen year of college. My motivation for my passion has dissipated. Iâ€™m lost. I do any drug I can get my hands on. I donâ€™t care if I OD. I just want to be relieved of this fucking weight that holds me down
