No choiceWhat should someone do if there's nothing left in the world 

The girl you loved dumped you yet your gonna still be living in the same place together shes got a new man.  A person who you use to talk about getting married and having kids.


Family life completely destroyed 
Father said you were no longer a problem and did terrible things you wish you could stop 
Mother whose suffered so much and continues to. Being powerless to help her.
No one in life that you can trust to talk to only one who ended up betraying you 


Feeling completely pointless in doing anything in life as it fails anyways 

Knowing there's no one ever there for you 


Flat out with no one left in the dark unable to do anything 

Pain that hasn't left in the last 2 years 


There's only one option left and that's to not be here just make all the pain stop. 


The pain has come to the point I cant fight it anymore I cant sleep i just wanna drink. 


I'm scared to end it as I cant seem to find a painless way to die all ways have many risks and can hurt alot during. Wish there was a way to legally end it. 

It just wont stop hurting I'm trapped
