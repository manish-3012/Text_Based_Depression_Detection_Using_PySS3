Why the fuck do I feel like this god damn itThere's little actually wrong with my life. I don't have low self-esteem or much to stress about. I don't meet the typical profiles for depression because I don't find it physically painful to get out of bed and I'm not starving myself or whatever. I just feel so FUCKING BORED ALL THE TIME. I had to quit my job because the boredom was too painful to endure. I rarely go to class because I can't focus on the lesson. I can't focus on lesson because the boredom causes pure agony. It's 6AM and I have a test in 4 hours that I couldn't study for because I couldn't focus on it. I really tried this time. Every time I try to exercise, I have to stop because of the boredom. I can't even cry right now despite never feeling more hopeless and desperate in my life. I've seriously lost the will to live. All the music I used to love sound dull and I keep looking through my playlists for a song to relax me but nothing seems to bring me any pleasure anymore. I can't read a book or watch a movie. I just fucking can't fucking do it. FUCK THIS SHIT. I spend every waking moment of in a constant struggle to be happy, but nothing provides. Suicide seems to be the only thought that sparks any interest. Help me please.

PS: don't suggest I speak with a professional because I've been doing that for 2 months and its done jack shit
