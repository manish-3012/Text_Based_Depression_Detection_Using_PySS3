He walked outI missed a few days of my antidepressant and also had some horrible shit happen over the weekend. I was crying so much for 2 days, and again today. Like every few minutes today and strong suicidal thoughts. 
I'm trying my best to push them away until my meds are back to normal, but it feels so hard to control and push them back. I've been in sort of a panic attack for the last 2-3 hrs. 

I really just needed to talk with someone about it to help me see clearly. Like help me feel calmer and talk me down. I haven't seen my boyfriend who was out of town for 3 days until today. He is literally the only person who I've ever been open or honest with about these feelings, and the only one who has ever been successful in making me feel calm and safe when it's gotten to this level. Whether by holding eachother, talking, or just being near him. 

He knows it's been building all day. I really just wanted to sleep with him tonight and hope it passed by morning. 
He had to get home bc his sons were making dinner. 

But the total look of annoyance on his face as he was trying to say a brief "k, bye love you" with no kiss, hug, etc. just about killed me. I was crying debating going to the hospital because I don't feel safe alone tonight. 
I feel like there was no going back from that. Fuck. Like a punch in the face.

Shouldn't you be with someone you say you love when they need you most?

That only made things worse and now I am worse than before.
