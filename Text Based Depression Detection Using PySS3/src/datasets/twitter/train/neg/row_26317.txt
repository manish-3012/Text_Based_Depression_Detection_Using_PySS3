I'm the worstI hurt everyone. I don't belong in anyone's life. I want to die so bad. I've already tried overdosing a couple months ago and it didn't work. I'm thinking cutting my wrists might work better idk we'll see. I honestly think I can get better in time but the pain is so much I don't know how much longer I can wait
