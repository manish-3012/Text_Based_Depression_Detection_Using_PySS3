No point in pretending anything in life will get better.I'm done with life. I don't care anymore. I'm failing half of my classes, have one close friend, have no interests besides music and video games, in a state where busking is illegal so I don't have any income, work for hours each week with no pay from a selfish mother who only cares about herself and money. This only really  leads to one question. What's the easiest way to die? Getting my head crushed by a train jumping off of a bridge, a 35 foot drop onto concrete, or any other suggestions.
