I can't pretend anymoreI've been pretending for as long as I can remember. But now it hurts too much. I'm tired of waking up. I'm tired of thinking. I can't act fine anymore.

It's so insulting when they ask what's wrong. When they ask if something happened. I've been crying for help. Are you this oblivious? Do I need to kill myself in front of you so you can understand what's happening? I don't have the energy to keep up the happy act anymore. I wanna fucking rot
