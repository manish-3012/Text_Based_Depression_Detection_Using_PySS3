I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreMy depression has been so severe that for the past week Iâ€™ve barely been able to eat or sleep. Iâ€™m in college and the stress of the semester is making everything so much worse. Iâ€™ve had a headache for days but I canâ€™t take time to recover. Just today I missed two quizzes and an exam because I physically couldnâ€™t take them. I tried to call my schools crisis line but they wouldnâ€™t help me. Iâ€™m just so tired. I donâ€™t think I can do this anymore.
