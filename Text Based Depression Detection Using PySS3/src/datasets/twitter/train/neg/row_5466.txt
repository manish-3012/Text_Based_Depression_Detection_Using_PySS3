Didn't Know I Had It In MeI spent about twelve consecutive hours today thinking about suicide.  Its been on my mind a lot lately.  I'm not posting here for attention or because I'm looking for someone to convince me that life gets/has purpose/whatever.

Even though I feel I have no reason to wake up in the morning, I do.  Every morning.  I'm afraid of death... rather, I'm afraid of the associated pain.  I've done research.  I know my options quite well; hell, I have favorites.  It's not like I haven't been here before.  I don't think I quite ever truly recovered when I got here the first time.  I didn't succeed when I first attempted suicide, but that's because it was a half-assed attempt.

I was afraid, and I didn't really know if it was what I wanted.  I'm... I'm getting more sure of it now.  Still, taking your own life... that's a ballsy thing.  It takes... it takes something.

So, today I cut for the second time.  Self-harm has never really been my thing, but it's progress.  The first time I cut, I pussied out a bit of that too.  This time I was a little more bold, and it didn't hurt as bad as I thought.  I felt... proud.  Maybe someday I could actually do it.

Like I said, this isn't because I'm looking for a "friend" or someone to talk me down.  I've realized that friends don't really exist in this world.  That's fine, because I don't really want to exist in this world either.  I can't really blame the concept of friends for not wanting to be here.  This is because I'm proud of my progress, and I wanted to proclaim it.
