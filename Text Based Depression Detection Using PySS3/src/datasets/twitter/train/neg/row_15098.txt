I think my fiance is leaving me and I am not sure I care to continue on.We have had a long distant relationship for the past 5 years. And all of sudden she won't talk to or text me just as the distance aspect is nearly over so the loss when the end is so near is kind of kicking me in the ass. And it happens to correspond with my first "fit" of depression in nearly 4 years. I, in extremely unhealthy and unhelpful form, have dealt with this by going on a 5 day long bender. And I figure I owe it to those who care about me to try and talk myself out of anything drastic.
