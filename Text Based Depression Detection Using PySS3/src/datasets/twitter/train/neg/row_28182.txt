Read this againYOU DONT NEED YOUR PARENTS IN THIS LIFE. You didnâ€™t ask to be born, you didnâ€™t choose them. SO STOP THINKJNG JUST BECAUSE THEY BROUGHT YOUBINTO THIS WORLD THAT YOU NEED THEIR LOVE!!!!! sometimes parents ainâ€™t shit... sometimes family ainâ€™t shit. Hell more often than not family ainâ€™t shit. So do yourself a favor and stop it. I can say whether or not killing yourself is a good idea, hell I reached out the other day and got an exciting award. First post on reddit so u can guess how fucking bad I wanted to cut after reaching out to ridicule, but the point is we need to get the whole fuck out of this mindset that we are owed love by our parents, truth is, we arenâ€™t owed shit by anyone. So if you have a friend, but your parents are assholes? Guess whoâ€™s your family now? The friend. Fuck your parents ðŸ¤— most of the time (at least for me) my family has been and will not be related to me by blood. When someone isnâ€™t related to you and CHOOSES to be around. Thatâ€™s family. Idk about you but my folks just seem to â€œput upâ€ with me. I donâ€™t call that family.
