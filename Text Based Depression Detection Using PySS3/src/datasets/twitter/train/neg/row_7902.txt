i just don't wanna go onI'm tired of hiding my sadness to everyone around me and acting like everything is fine during the day, it's not. I have so many regrets in life and I keep beating myself up over it day after day,  month after month. I didn't ask anyone to be born into this fucking world, not my mom, not my dad, no one, I just wanna kill myself but I'm scared I'll hurt everyone around me, especially my mom, she already has depression and I don't wanna hurt her even more, especially after my grandma died  last year, school fucking sucks ass too. everyone there either acts like a thot or a fuckboy all the time and this whole forced positivity thing the school administration are shoving down everyone's throats all day every day. in my school you also get made fun of if you show any emotion at all, people just clown on you and act so macho/tough all the time. I've cut my wrists so many times It hurts even when I let them heal.                      I'm currently just in my bed at 1AM so that's why this whole thing is a jarbled mess.
