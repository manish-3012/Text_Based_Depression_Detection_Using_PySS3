My best friend just said she hates meShe doesnt want to be my friend anymore. She was probably the only friend I had that I truly trusted, not to mention the closest friend I've ever had. I always went to her especially when I go through my depressive episodes. I'm going through one again and I can't find a way out. Everything is just weighing down on my chest and I can't breathe. I just don't wanna live anymore. If the one friend I thought i had ended up hating me, how am I supposed to convince myself I'm not alone. I just wanna end it.
