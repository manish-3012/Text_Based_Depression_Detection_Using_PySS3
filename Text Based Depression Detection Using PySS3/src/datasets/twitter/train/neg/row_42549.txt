May I ask you for some help?This isn't a post for me but for my friend who is really worn and beaten down with life. I haven't talked to her in a while but I see what she puts on twitter and it terrifies me that she might do more then cut her self this time. She never really has liked life because her dad abuses her physically and her mom mentally. She stopped talking to me for no reason  or one that I want to find out. I always supported her and tried to her help her out in a friendly way because her boyfriend tried to keep her sane,but he recently broke up with her and she is going nuts emotionally. This is her most recent tweet "I hope tonight will be the night i finally leave this fucking world." I really am scared for her well being. Can any one help me help her?
