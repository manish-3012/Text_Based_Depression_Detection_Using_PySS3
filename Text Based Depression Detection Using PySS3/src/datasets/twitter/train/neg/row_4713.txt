I have taken some tabletsI have written my letter apologising, I have taken naproxen, tramadol, beta blockers, ibuprofen, paracetamol, alverine and whisky- got some sertraline too but I am being slow- I donâ€™t really want to die but I know that there is something really wrong with me, I am cold and empty and self obsessed and impulsive and dangerous and I need to remove myself from the planet so that the people I love will be able to have happy lives, free from my chaotic weakness and evilness. I know Iâ€™ll never be able to work out how to be a proper person, and Iâ€™m terrified of everything anyway. I am the ultimate lazy coward victim and I genuinely do not deserve a shot at life, what a total total waste. To my parents, brothers, friends, boyfriend, coworkers; everybody, I am so sorry I am so rubbish and incapable and such a fake manipulative liar; to the planet; you are so incredible and beautiful, Iâ€™m sorry I never appreciated that before; to all of you reading this, let people know who you really are because lies and fantasy worlds fuck your brain up and make you totally incapable of living any kind of real life; every lie about yourself that you tell moves you further away from reality and real love and the point of life and it is such a fucking empty and pointless way to be alive, anybody who is lying about anything who reads this, go out and confess, save yourself before you lose your soul and mind like I have: I am a coward and I deserve to die, be braver than me, accept yourself and reality and embrace the world and learn how to navigate it, otherwise you end up 24 years old, downing tablets and clutching your childhood toy, utterly terrified of your own emptiness and the pitilessness of reality. I know somewhere that I only think the world is as bleak and empty as it is because I am broken, I know if people have souls they see the point in existing and take note and participate, I do not so I am dying today, I hope itâ€™s like going to sleep, but ultimately, it just wonâ€™t matter. I am so sorry.
