I feel so shitty all the timeNo throwaway because fuck it. My brain has been turned to clay by the meds. I have no friends, no hobbies that bring me any joy. Whenever I try to interact with people it's as if they sense there's something wrong with me. They turn away. Maybe act like they're interested in talking to me for a couple of minutes before they realize I'm just not like other people.

I just want to be with someone, I want to accomplish something, but I'm nothing, nothing at all. There were times where I could still feel joy, but those seem to be finally gone now. Why drag this on for 40 more years?
