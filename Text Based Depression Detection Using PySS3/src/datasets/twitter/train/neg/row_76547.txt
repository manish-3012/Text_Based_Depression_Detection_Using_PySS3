I don't deserve anything anymore[For a little bit of context (if it helps with anything I guess) I am 15]
I honestly don't know why I deserve to live by this point. I have tried to lose weight over the past 3 years to absolutely nothing has changed (despite my efforts), I'm a disappointment to my family, my friends don't like hanging out with me because I'm constantly depressed and they've told me they're sick of it, I can't accomplish anything I put myself to, and on top of all of that my social life is basically fucked. Whenever people look at me either it's that disgusted look or saying "oh look it's Steffen" and then probably proceed to make fun of my appearance. Honestly it would be better if I were dead by this point and no one would care if I were dead anyways. In fact everyone would benefit from not having my stupid fucking face on the Earth anymore.
