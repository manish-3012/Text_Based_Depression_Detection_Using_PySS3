Dont careI could give a fuck less anymore. I dont care for myself my health or fuck all else going on in my life. Fuck it honestly im really quite tired of the fucking living in my lonesome. Im either just gonna relapse on cutting myself again or just up and slit my fucking arteries and I can care less change doesnt matter it doesnt mean shit. New home. New friends. New whatever. It doesnt fucking matter because it still wont fucking make me feel like im not a shit stain. And dont fucking say that stupid "Im here for you" bullshit Ive heard it so fucking much its intoxicating and making every bit of breathing hurt just a thousand times more. Im not planning it nor will I. Id rather it be impulsive and just out of my own fucking will to get out. Just thought some fucking person from around where I am might wanna know what the fuck happened so maybe theyll find this somewhere in the fucking mess of these post. Fuck it all.
