finding the right pathi got a glowing complement at work yesterday, one of the managers where I work sent out an email to our director.  Nothing but praise over a project myself and a coworker did.   I found out, after the director forwarded it to my manager and my manager to me.

It really made my coworker's day.  I didn't really feel anything when I read it.  

I wonder am I some sort of psycopath? sociopath? to be honest, i don't really know what those words mean.

i think back on all the things i've done.  all the things people are thankful of me for.  i don't think i appreciate their thanks.

i wonder if i'm some sort of monster. 

i think about killing myself everyday.  i think about what i would do if I didn't.

I can't think of anything I want to do.

I think of all the people I might hurt when I do it.  I almost don't care.

I think about what if I did go on,  all the bonds and connections I'd make.   then I think about how many more people I'd hurt if i did kill myself.  then i realize, that I won't be making any more bonds,  i'm so far withdrawn and broken.  my life is flashing by me now.  i don't think i care,  but i know future me will be ashamed of how much i've wasted. 

I guess this is just a handful of rationalizations about why this is the right path.
