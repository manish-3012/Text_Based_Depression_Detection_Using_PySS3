I am pathetic and stupidI have a learning disability I got after 2 concussions, one from getting hit with a hammer (the sharp end) to the back of the head and the other from hitting a metal air conditioner while running. After I hit the air conditioner I was knocked so hard down I hit the concrete and split my head open and it had to be stapled back together. I passed out from blood loss I don't even remember much of that day, just the pain and the agony I was in. All I remember was looking down and seeing blood all over my shirt and shoes in shock and wondering what just happened, then feeling the cold sweat kick in and gently everything just faded to black. Ever since then I cannot write clearly **(my writing looks like a 5 year olds)** I cannot focus anymore, I do not learn and study like I use to be able to. My doctor prescribed some crap that didn't work and it's been almost 2 years since those accidents happened and I still have not gotten better. Anyway, I was thinking about getting a Criminal Justice degree as I sort of just wanted to do it "because". Yeah I know right? Anyway, after looking at some universities I found one and was ready to sign up when I saw something called, "General Education" which is about 36 points and required to get your degree. I thought you just go and learn your major and that's it. It listed every subject I sucked at in school, I sucked at Algebra, I sucked at Chemistry, I sucked at Math and now I won't be able to get my degree because they  require me to do all that on a college level. Hell, I couldn't even do it at a high school level. So now I'm deciding whether I should just kill myself now and spare myself the pain. I'm mentally disabled, I have no hope for my future as I'm pathetic and a piece of shit. Maybe I'll die after a third concussion.
