Got cheated on, have a terminal illness, Iâ€™m pretty much feeling dead already, and Iâ€™m too muchIf things donâ€™t look up Iâ€™ll just do it. I donâ€™t care anymore. Itâ€™ll be better than living like this with the hurt and pain of feeling unworthy to someone who you once loved. Been told all sorts of things like everyone would be better off without me and honestly I think that itâ€™ll be better. 

On top of that Iâ€™ve been told that Iâ€™m too much and because of that Iâ€™ll never be loved or given a chance. So yeah, Iâ€™ll be nothing then instead of too much
