Whatâ€™s the pointI have many recurring health issues that cause prolonged senses of pain and can hardly do anything I want to anymore without the fear that they will affect me causing me to miss out on many opportunities and even affecting my family and ruining the trips they try to have me on just because I end up suffering on the trips ruining it for everyone. So I ask what is the point of even being here if all I do is derived my family of their fun all because Iâ€™m doubled over in pain so often
