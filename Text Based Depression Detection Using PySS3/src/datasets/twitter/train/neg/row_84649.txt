Trying move past prior incidents of self-harm and mitigate recurring suicidal thoughts.I suppose my main motivation for writing this is to give myself some accountability in all this. Itâ€™s becoming increasingly apparent that I might need to seek help, but I still canâ€™t find the proper outlet to do so. 

Iâ€™m 27-years-old and living abroad. I have a steady job and am generally a responsible person when it comes to fulfilling work commitments and so on. But I would say that perhaps Iâ€™ve been dealing with some form of long-term â€œfunctionalâ€ depression (that is only a self-diagnosis, not a professional assessment).

A little over a year ago, I tripped on acid and ended up swallowing 100+ tablets of aspirin. I called a friend who stayed with me overnight, but I refused to get medical help. (At the time, I was afraid of potential legal implications for using an illegal substance in my country of residenceâ€”I later found out there wouldâ€™ve been no penalty.) 
Looking back on it now, Iâ€™m not sure I would call it a â€œsuicide attemptâ€; It was the acid that gave me the â€œnerveâ€ to do something like that. Prior to that, while I had experienced suicidal thoughts during bouts of depression, I had never acted on anything. Still, the knowledge hat those feelings, and the intent was probably already there, frightens me even now. 

I thought I was moving past last yearâ€™s incident to some degree, but about two weeks ago, I found myself going through another rather sudden wave of depression, during which time I got incredibly drunk and then proceeded to burn my arm repeatedly on the side of the oven door. (I donâ€™t have a history of self-harm; this was an isolated, albeit frightening incident). I also fantasized about throwing myself over the balcony. I called a friend again, who managed to talk me down. 

Since then, I have been trying to stay away from any kind of substance, as I fear that that is what is giving me the â€œcourageâ€ (if one can call it that) to hurt myself. I do not have any kind of addiction, but when I am feeling a heightened sense of depression, I am more prone to consuming something. Even when I get adequate sleep, stay away from negative influences, and try to make self-care a priority, the suicidal thoughts are still there. As of late, theyâ€™ve been at the forefront of my mind. I am afraid that eventually, I will do something to seriously hurt myself. Most of the time, I am very rational and reasonable, but sometimes, I feel that I cannot handle the â€œemotional vortexâ€ I find myself engulfed in.

I think I am trying to cope with underlying and unresolved issues regarding childhood sexual abuse, a more recent sexual assault, confusion about my own sexuality, as well as my inevitable return to my home country in a few monthsâ€™ time, in which I will be facing joblessness  and will likely be moving back in with my parentsâ€”probably a combination of those factors.

I tried mentioning what Iâ€™m going through to a close friend but did not get the response I was hoping for. There is another person close to me who is familiar with the situation, but they have since moved back home, and I no longer feel I can communicate with them, because of my complicated, unrequited feelings for them.

Mental health professionals do exist in this country, but most of them are non-English-speaking and are apt to describe anti-depressants as a blanket treatment for any kind of mental health ailment. 

Most of the time, I canâ€™t help feeling like such a sappy, bratty, ungrateful first-world Generation Y idealist for being this old and still not having my shit together. I get angry with myself for not being able to just suck it up and deal with lifeâ€™s curveballs like an adult. 

Good god, the MS Word document Iâ€™m typing in has exceeded a page. I donâ€™t expect anyone to read all this. I just wanted to put this out there and maybe sort out some of my own thoughts. I donâ€™t even know where to begin with all this. 

TL;DR: I have a few prior incidents of self-harm which were spurred by suicidal thoughts and being under the influence of alcohol/drugs. Even when I abstain from substances, I experience suicidal tendencies, stemming from underlying issues, and do not know how to begin to deal with them.
