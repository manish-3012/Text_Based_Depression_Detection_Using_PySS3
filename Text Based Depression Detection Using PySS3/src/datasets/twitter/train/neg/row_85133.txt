i can't take my mind off itthe sunset tonight was beautiful. deep blue sky and pink-red clouds. it broke my train of thought for just long enough for me to realize that my default state of mind is very fucking off. haven't been to class in two weeks and everything i see, everything i do, i see ways to die. im spending a lot of time on r/wpd, crying more, drinking, ignoring people... i need some help. not empathy, not emergency hotlines, idk honestly. i know i dont want to die but i can't shake the thought of suicide
