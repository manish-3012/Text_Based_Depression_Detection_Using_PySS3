I can't do thisI'm having so much trouble keeping up in school. I'm falling behind. I feel like a failure. I can't do this anymore. I don't even know why I'm still alive. I can't keep going. I can't breathe. 

I feel like I'm suffocating on air that I breathe everyday. I'm drowning and drowning without an end. The voices tell me to end it. I might listen. 

The voices don't scare me anymore. They are comforting. I want it all to end. This pain, suffering. But what will I be without it? 

I need to end it. My mom took my pills. I want that razor from upstairs. I can't go into the kitchen or I'll think about that razor, the feeling of it over my skin, the blood that will come out, the scar.
