Only my dog keeping me going.Throwaway for obvious reasons. The only thing that has kept me from going through with it is my dog. I love him more than I love myself.   At a certain point Iâ€™m not responsible for anyone but me. Whatâ€™s the point? I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m expecting from this sub. Life keeps churning with me left in the shadows. Dead end job with no aspirations. Seems so easy to pull a trigger.
