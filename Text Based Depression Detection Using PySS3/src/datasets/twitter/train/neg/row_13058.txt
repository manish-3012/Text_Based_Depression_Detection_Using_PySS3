Well...another evening.Tv SUCKS. Getting Heparin shots in your stomach SUCKS (and hurts)...being stuck in a hospital bed sucks. 

Positives: talked a LOT to my "sitter" (remember I am on Suicide Watch) as we sat in the hospital lounge and looked over into the park next door. All those people coming and going...made me sad. I opened up to her a lot. We talked for 30 minutes. Then my tray came and they got on me again about eating again. Sigh. 

I will hear about that from the doctor tomorrow I'm sure.

Otherwise, my mood is best described as apathetic. I am numbing out again...and I don't care. 

Sorry to be posting again but I have little else to do right now.

To all suffering: know that there are lots of people who care and who don't want you to hurt yourself. I am here to listen too...until my phone gets confiscated in the psych ward. Blah.
