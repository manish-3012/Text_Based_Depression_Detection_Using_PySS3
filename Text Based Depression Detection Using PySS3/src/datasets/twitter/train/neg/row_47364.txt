what's the point?my friend's threatening to call cps friday, since i won't do it myself. what's the point in being alive by then? i don't want to live anyway, and another friend told me he'd call cps if i threatened to kill myself, so it's a lose-lose for me. i actually just need help, but i can't get help by friday. what do i do?
