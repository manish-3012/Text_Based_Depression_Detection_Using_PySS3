sending online friend a suicide note or ghosting?in 2-4 weeks im going to be dead, if everything goes to plan and shit. and i dont know if i should tell my online friend. shes the best friend ive ever had (my only one) and i love her so much even if we have never met, since she lives on a whole other continent. shes the first person i came out to, and before, she came out to me even though she is closeted on the internet. we are both trans for context.

and i really dont want to upset her. like sending her a suicide note per email just sounds unbelievably cruel. i dont want her to be sad.

but if i just disappeared i know shed be worried as well. weve written almost every day the past few years, and she knows about my suicidal tendencies. and i can imagine her emailing me and getting back an email from my parents that "*deadname* killed HERself". even fucking worse. 

i mean if i could get away with it id just disappear and have everyone forget about me. causing my family pain is the last thing i want to do, and its the only thing that even kept me alive for this long. but i just cant anymore. but my parents obviously have to know, somebodys gotta arrange my funeral and shit, yknow? 

and with my friend-she doesnt necessarily have to know. i just want to spare her the pain. her roommates cat died in a traffic accident and she was devestated. i cant do this to her, but all options seem terrible. i dont know what to do.
