rantI hate my life so much and I feel like everyone will eventually abandon me like my dad did. My home life is terrible. Iâ€™m disappointing everyone including my mom by making everything so much harder for her. It really hurts. Also whenever I get angry I lose control, Iâ€™ve never ever been like this before and it scares me. This started happening around 3 months ago. I have a super short temper especially when it comes to my brother and I canâ€™t control it anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do about anything and I think everything would be better off without me around. I hate being like this but everything feels so out of control and nothing seems to be getting better in any aspect of my life. 

Just needed to get that off my chest :)
