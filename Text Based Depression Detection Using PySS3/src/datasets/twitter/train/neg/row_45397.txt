GoodbyeAs I sit here trying to think about what to say, I realize it doesnâ€™t matter that much.

Itâ€™s funny, I once wrote one of these letters, and didnâ€™t end up going through with it. Later my husband ridiculed me for writing frivolously in my â€œstupid diaryâ€. I shredded it that night, mortified that this man I married didnâ€™t even care.

I thought about getting help for a whole. Even reached out to a few doctors. I either got put on hold or never got a call back. I think deep down I was relieved because I didnâ€™t want to get better anyway. 

Iâ€™m normally petty modest but I feel like I can say this here. Iâ€™m one of those people who puts everyone elseâ€™s needs first. And while I donâ€™t mind that, sometimes I do like to feel like I matter to people. But more often than not my kindness gets taken advantage of.

My family is so caught up in their own things that they havenâ€™t even noticed the shell Iâ€™ve become. To give them credit, maybe Iâ€™m just better at hiding it than I thought. 
My best friend is fighting her own battles. I think she sees hurt but she lets me brush her off and doesnâ€™t bother to dig deeper. If sheâ€™d just ask or show interest, I would tell her. But lately, I feel like an afterthought, only called upon when convenient. 

My husband used to be the most romantic man I could ask for. But he keeps pulling away, attached to his electronics, and noticing me less and less. Iâ€™m not sure how you can share a bed with someone and not notice them cry themselves to sleep, not notice that their smile doesnâ€™t reach their eyes, that their once full of life attitude has become empty. 

I look forward to the peace of not feeling like this any longer. It is truly exhausting to put up this facade and I think I have had enough.
