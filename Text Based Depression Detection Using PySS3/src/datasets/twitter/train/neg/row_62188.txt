It's been 3 daysSince I've had food or even the slightest hint of a will to live. I have no money or family or anything and I don't think I can do this much longer. I really hope things get better with America so no one else takes their life because too little social security income ruined their life. $700 a month isn't enough to live on when you have rent electric and water. 
I want to die so bad but I can't do it lol. I'm fucking pathetic and I hate myself for it. I honestly just kind of want to become a criminal or something so I could go to jail and have food every day. I don't care if it's not even good food lol. I just want to be able to survive. But no that's completely wrong for me to want. Nothing is stable. It's wrong for me to want to die too? Lol? You know what? I think I can do it lol. We have trains and stuff here. I could just sleep outside for a few days or something as well.
