why the fuck notwhy don't i just fucking do it. sorry for being boohoo me, but I haven't had contact with any of my family members since i was 16, because they were abusive. so i don't even have a fucking family to turn to, i have no one, fucking nobody. i was in a shitty relationship for 3 years that took over my life, so i stopped talking to all my friends because i was with my paranoid and abusive boyfriend who wouldn't let me to talk to anyone. been single for a year now. any chance of making friends or anyone, i just run. i don't get it. i'm scared or some shit. i just finished my shift at work and am thinking of going back out this afternoon to just chill out with them (i work at a bar) but i fucking can't. i feel too sorry for myself. instead i'm sitting home alone writing this on a saturday evening. something about it just scares me. i'm scared of making new friends. if a guy ever looks at me as if he'd like to get to know me, i just turn my head and never look back. i'm miserable and fucking alone. and it's ALL MY FAULT, apart from the family thing. i don't know i just wanna die. it's getting worse. for a few months i genuinely wanted to live and was so happy, even being on my own. but now the past few weeks i've been feeling worse every single day. i can barely do my work shifts, near the end of the shift i just feel like breaking down and stabbing myself in the gut
