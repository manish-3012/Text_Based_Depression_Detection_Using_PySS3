Feeling lonelyHi guys, 

It's my first time posting anything here so I'm not sure how it works. 

I've been home confined for a total of 60-70 days now, and I'm starting to feel depressed. 

I feel lonely, unwanted, and I kept thinking of committing suicide. 

Ever since I decided to go no contact with my ex, my life has started to feel super lonely. I can go for a few days without receiving any messages or alerts in my phone from my friends or anybody else... 

On top of that, I have recently been made redundant by my company, and had to move back with my parents in my age (mid 20's). 

This hurts my self-esteem, as I looked through everyone else around my age move on with their lives through social media. Some are getting pregnant, some are moving to new cities... I can't help but feel stupid, useless, unwanted, not good enough for anything...

On the good side, I am going to go get checked with a therapist in a few days from now. I hope that would help...
