I just don't see the point in staying aroundAll I do is create problems for everyone. I am incapable of existing without making everyone around me miserable
I suck at my job
I have no friends
My boyfriend doesn't think I care about him and  he's said countless times that loving me takes work
Work that I'm sure he regrets now
These feelings are never going to go away
I'm always going to be this miserable garbage person
I have nothing stopping me from taking my own life
So why am I still here? What am I even doing? I'm not contributing any good use to anyone
I don't want to be here anymore
