I really messed upSo I fell in love with someone I met online, and I told him about a scenario with another guy I had no feelings for, and it went completely topsy-turvey and now Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to lose him completely. He was the only person that had been able to make me feel beautiful and wanted in such a long time. And I might have completely ruined it just by talking with another guy about romantic stuff. And I keep making it worse and itâ€™s just so much pain I really donâ€™t need and I just want it to stop.
