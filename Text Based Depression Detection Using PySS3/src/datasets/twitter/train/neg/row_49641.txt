So, why shouldn't I kill myself?I've posted the "Story of my life" [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/pajxj/ive_overcome_depression_but_my_life_still_is/) a couple of days ago but I geuss it was caught by the spam filters or people just diddn't feel like commenting on it. In the last couple of weeks I have been thinking about suicide more and more, from when I wake up til I go to sleep. For years now I have been struggling with keeping myself fed, clothed and a roof above my head and financially this is getting harder and harder. I geuss i'm doing fine now but life just doesn't work out for me, it actually never has. I don't have any family or friends that **I** care about, and I don't understand why they would ever care about me. In general i'm happy but i'm not positive about my future. I've thought about my future a lot and the most common outcomes I can see is that I will be either in Jail, Homeless, a Junkie or dead, regardless of what career or dream (that I currently have) pursue, and death seems to be the most appealing option to me. I have kept people from killing themselve by talking to them and making them realize its not worth it, people that I cared about and they slowly just forgot me as a friend, because i'm probably a really hard person to keep as a friend. Now that i'm at the crossroads the same things I have told them don't work for me and I feel like I really should just do it. For some reason I also feel attracted to the concept of "death" which is pretty hard to explain. I'm really exhausting all of my options so i'm posting here, but in all seriousness I don't see myself being alive by the end of 2012, I have everything in place to do it right now but as long there are no big obstacles in my way I don't see a reason.
