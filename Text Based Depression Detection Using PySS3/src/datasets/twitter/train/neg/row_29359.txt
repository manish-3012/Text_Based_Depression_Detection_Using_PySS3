I will never achieve anythingI'm not hard-working or creative. My brain is fried after years of dealing with depression. I really just want to die at this point. I'm thinking of doing it in a few weeks, maybe near the end of the year. I'm just so tired and I don't enjoy anything. It's hard to survive until the end of the day, so how am I supposed to actually do something with my future. I'm doomed to fail.
