I'm struggling to find anything to live for now that I saw endgameI don't like tom hollands spider-man (Much more of a raimi guy), Guardians of the galaxy 3 is too far away and I don't like mcu thor that much(Not enough like thor from the comics) so nothing is close enough to keep me going anymore. What would you want someone to put in their suicide note to lessen the damage? I guess you can expect me to upload my suicide note in the following days If I get the balls to do it
