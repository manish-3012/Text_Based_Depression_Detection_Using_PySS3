Tired of it all hurtingSo heres my life update:
I'm currently 28 yrs. old. Ive been horribly depressed since i was 13. 
Im getting divorced shortly. My wife has decided to leave me because things haven't been going well. Weve been married two years. Shes only my second girlfriend. Im no good with women. 
Im morbidly obese. I overeat when I'm sad or hurt. 
I spent way too much money on school. Like 70k
I got a degree that was my back up and a very bad back up at that. Biology general. I was gonna kill myself if i didn't get into a program i wanted to since i was 18. Got in and get basically shit on by one of the instructors until i quit. My wife held me together and didn't let me kill myself. 
Im worried I wont find a job. The economy is shit. I need to make enough to pay my school debts and live and i dint think i can find anything that will do that without being exceedingly poor for the rest of my life. 
Pretty much my life has fallen apart in the last few weeks. I just want the pain to stop.
