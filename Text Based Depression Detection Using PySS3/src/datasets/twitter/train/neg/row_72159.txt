Feeling lonely and can't stop cryingI'm hiding in the toilet so my family doesn't have to know. I just suddenly got hit with the loneliness of having zero friends and I can't seem to stop it. I try my hardest to be the nicest person I can possibly be, but I don't know how to make friends. I just feel so isolated and I can't take it anymore. I'd say more but I'm crying to much.
