I'm Fucked, and I'm doneI'm about at the end of my rope. to quote Curt Cobain "I hate myslef and I want to die". I've been out of work for about a year, I'm in pretty serious money problems, most of my family is dead or moved far away, my lover just moved 1500 miles away and its pretty much over and to top it off I'm an alcoholic, as in I have to have a drink or five just to feel some sembalence of normal. I have things I love, things I'm absolutely pasionate about, but they just aint cutting it anymore. I'm 27, used to be in the military, before they kicked me out. I'm a failure, I've failed at everything I've ever done and  I'm just done, done fighting, done trying. I cant do this anymore. i'm a failure, I'm in constant pain both physically and emotionaly and above all else I'm just deeply, deeply tired. I don't want to hurt my family or friends but I just cant do this anymore. Things aren't going to get better, I'm fucked, and fuck this. I just want to sleep, for a very very long time. I don't want to be me.
