I have decided that I am going to kill myself tomorrow, Monday, the 18th.It's 11:55 PM, Sunday, and I have decided I am going to kill myself tomorrow. 
I'm 17, I am a senior, and I may change my mind. 

So far I don't think I will, but maybe tomorrow will be the best day of my life. 
Maybe tomorrow things will change. Maybe I will meet a new person. 
Maybe I will get help. 

Either way, I wanted someone to know this &amp; not call the cops on me. 

If anything, maybe something someone says here will keep me alive one more say.
