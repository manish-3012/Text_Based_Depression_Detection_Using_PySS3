16 years.I've been thinking about suicide since I was only 11 but at the time I quickly recovered due to support from mum.

Only my mum died 2 years later. I not only lost my only source of support but I began bein emotionally and physically abused.

At 20 I sought help, only to be diagnosed with gender identity disorder.

Earlier this year I realised that I am not transgender. I am 27 now.

And it is too late to get my natural body back.

I cannot bear to live in a fake body. I would have solved any emotional stuff but not this. I used to love my body before hormones. Now I don't even take pictures of my face. My hair is gone. Mt skin is ruined. I saw myself last at 20. I will never see myself again so I don't won't to live anymore.

Today I pulled a towel around my neck. Ended up vomiting. Wish there was an easier way out.
