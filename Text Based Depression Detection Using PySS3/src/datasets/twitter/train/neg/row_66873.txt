It hurts to be lonely and uglyThrowaway account.

I almost at my limit. Iâ€™ve been considering yeeting myself into a train, off a building/bridge, etc. Iâ€™ve been thinking this way for a good long time (at least a few months). Iâ€™m not thinking it every night, but whenever I realize what a pathetic lonely motherfucker I am, the thoughts come back. Literally the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my dog. If something happens to her, I wouldnâ€™t really have anything keeping me from killing myself. My parents are great, but theyâ€™re getting old and probably would forget that I died in a week or so. My siblings all donâ€™t really donâ€™t really contact me and I donâ€™t keep up with them. Iâ€™m almost out of college and have a job lined up for me, but even thatâ€™s kinda eh. I try my best to improve myself; I work out and bought new clothes to make me look better, but itâ€™s all in vain. Iâ€™ve had 0 luck with clubs (night clubs and college clubs), bars, online dating apps. I donâ€™t know why. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s cus Iâ€™m fucking ugly, I wear glasses and look like a nerd. Even my friend who I think Iâ€™m a bit more attracting than gets at least 10 matches to my 0. Some of you will say dating isnâ€™t everything. Iâ€™m fucked up even when it comes to school and my social life; also, Iâ€™ve never had a girl genuinely interested in me, and Iâ€™ve always wanted a girlfriend. My school work ethic is awful. I know Iâ€™m smart (I get excellent test grades), but I canâ€™t seem to find the motivation to attend class, go to labs, or do my homework so my gpa is fucking horrendous. I fucking hate so much myself because of this. Iâ€™ve been hard working with part time jobs, but with school Iâ€™m fucking awful. I feel like Fucked my future up. Iâ€™m awful with my friends too. I want to be the nice, funny guy, but Iâ€™m the weird, bullied guy in the group. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I fucking hate myself and would rather be dead than suffer my loneliness and mediocrity.

TL;DR: I feel like Iâ€™m fucking ugly and stupid and awful and canâ€™t get a girlfriend/get good grades/make good friendships and I want to fucking kill myself because of this. Dog is holding me together
