I just want the pain to stop.I'm so tired of trying. I'm so tired of people telling me things will get better when I always end up in the same position at the end of the day: crying to the point of being numb and feeling trapped in a life I can't escape.
I'm sitting in the dark at 6 AM, periodically bursting into tears and feeling like a terrible person for not being happy on New Years while also being jealous of those who are.....
I know I'm only 17 and I have so many years ahead of me to make things better but the prospect of living through another year of turmoil is terrifying. I don't want to participate in my own life and I wish I could just disappear. No one needs me around and everyone would be better off without me in their lives, whining about stupid shit. I don't have talents, I don't have dreams or aspirations, and I don't have the drive to do anything. I'm useless and unproductive and a waste of space. 
I'm so sick of everything. 
I just want it all to stop.
