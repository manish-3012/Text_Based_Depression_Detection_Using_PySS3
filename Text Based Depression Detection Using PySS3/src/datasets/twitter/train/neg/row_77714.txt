im so sick of everythinglife has been so fucking difficult for the last few months and im sick of it. im fucking sick of living like this. my untreated depression is making everything so so difficult. i cant get treatment for it either because of covid19 and the fact that im a minor who cannot consent to health care without both parents and my dad is currently not working in the country and he cant back in due to covid19.

im barely taking care of myself by barely eating, drinking, showering, doing my work, and sleeping because im so demotivated to do anything. i just want my pain to end. im so stressed and depressed.

the one person i trust with venting to gets incredibly stressy when i talk to them about it and stuff because they have their own shit going on. i understand that it isnt healthy for me to use them as a therapist but i have no one. i have no real friends and a rocky relationship with my family (another reason i havent been able to get treatment) and it seems like nothings helping.

all my online friends are too casual to talk about my issues with
if i try to talk about it with my family it will result in a fight 
i can no longer use the person mentioned before as theyre too stressed and its bad

ive been having strong suicidal tendencies recently and i have no idea what the fuck i should do, my mind is very good ar convincing me no one cares or loves me recently and i know thats not true but its crazy what the mine is capable of doing
