Seriously thinking about ending my life...It all started with my depression and anxiety when I was a young teen, and then my life went to shit just as I finished school. I have been facing an internal battle for years and I have problems with even the tiniest of things. Can hardly get my sorry ass up out of bed in the morning, usually just asking myself "what's the point? Why do I even bother?." 
I've tried talking to people but they just laugh and say "you'll be fine, everyone feels like that, stop feeling sorry for yourself, it will go away soon." &lt;&lt;&lt; Yeah right, then why the heck am I posting here? 

I'm loosing the battle with myself...all those fake smiles and laughs that I give people...I can't do it anymore...

Sometimes I don't even know who I am anymore; I get so aggressive and angry, I even tend to burst out in tears at random for no reason. Then I started having an identity-crisis (and I still do), because I can't even describe a single thing about me that I like or that makes me special.

I've gathered up the courage to kill myself once and almost succeeded: tried to hang myself on a blind cord; it seemed like the best idea at the time but... it snapped and I just gave up and cried feeling unsatisfied and empty. Nobody knew what happened- no-one was home at the time- it was planned that way.

I've attempted to try again with a knife and scissors (which have now been confiscated- my parents don't believe me, just say 'don't be silly'), and even go as far as planning precisely how I am going to end my life. Date/time/place etc. 

I've seen a Psychologist; didn't help much, if anything it just made me think that I wasn't worthy enough to be on this planet in the first place. I've taken anti-depressants too- they don't work for shit. 
So I'm thinking about it again...considering how little I've contributed to the world I figure no-one would miss me. A fitting ending for me; no friends, no future...
