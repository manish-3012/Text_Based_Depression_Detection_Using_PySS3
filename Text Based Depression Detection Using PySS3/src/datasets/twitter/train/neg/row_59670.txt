Interesting title hereSince my failed attempt to off myself a week or two ago(idk ive lost any sense of time) the level of self loathing for myself has just skyrocketed. I just cant live with myself. I just hope to whatever if any almighty powerful being that controls everything in our universe that i dont fail next time, whenever that may be(near future)
