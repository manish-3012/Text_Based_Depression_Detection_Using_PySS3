..I have this choice, i could either take it or suffer. I dont understand why people value life so much. I just cant understand. There are beuties in this world but the ugly truth is what lingers longer. I want to die why is that such a crime, why is it so horrible. Its a choice for a better fate, to end an ugly life and suffering, like euthanasia. Everything always hurts so much, its been far too long and ill die soon anyway, why not take control of it and plan it myself? Im fated to die like this. Ive done a many horrible things this lifetime, so many crimes and its about time to pay for them. Yes, theres forgiveness but can you possibly forgive such a large amount damage done? Im not quite sure. Even if so the person does forgive, how can i possibly forgive myself. This burden ive brought upon. Im getting so lost and far too away to seek for any help, or guidance. Im tired and my body is giving up on me, my mind is giving up on me, everyone is giving up on me. Im giving up on everything. Im sick, and ive been suffering for too long. Everyone is awaiting in anticipation.

Im so tired and theres nothing else to fix this broken life ive created except to erase it. Everyones left, and im all alone. All alone so im allowed to finally end it. I could tell from her face, her urgency, her boredom, even her speech. Ive finally doen it. Isolated myself from anyone reaching any concern in my head. Its all gone and i could finally be happy soon.
