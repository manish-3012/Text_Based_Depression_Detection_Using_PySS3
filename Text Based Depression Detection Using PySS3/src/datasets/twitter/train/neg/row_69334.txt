Help meThis probably sounds ridiculous, but over the course of today, my brother ate all the leftovers I had made from the night before, and it sent me into a fury like I haven't had since I was a kid.  It was enough for me to eat for two days, and he ate it all in one day.  I've been depressed most of my life, but it has been exceptionally tough recently.  I believe this is just me approaching my breaking point, I don't think the food is really what is upsetting me.  But it's so hard to know for sure, because I can't even go into the kitchen without feeling like I want to break something or hurt someone/myself.  So now I'm starving, which is partially fuelling my rage, and I can't even go into the kitchen without my blood boiling.  

I have been struggling with depression for years, and I never learned to cope with it.  I began smoking pot which helps with the anger management and my depression.  My friends have to beg and plea for me to come out, the only way I can feel up to it is to self medicate.  I have no ambition and no desire to do anything except continue living my mostly solitary life.  But tonight, after I discovered the food was gone, I totally lost my shit.  The words "a danger to yourself or others"  kept flashing in my mind, and may be partially the reason I haven't done anything that is irreversible, yet.  This was the first time I have legitimately and seriously considered suicide.  I even put a belt around my neck to see if I could endure that.  I couldn't.  But I am obsessing pretty hard about alternatives.  Since I'm having such a hard time coping, I figure there's one surefire way of not having to worry about having to cope anymore.  

Please help me.
