Im so tired of being lonely. Just want to dieNothing has changed for me as a result of the quarantine.  I don't have anyone to see or anywhere to go anyway.  I work a part time job I hate and suck at.  was supposed to graduate college, but that's not happening for a while now, and to be honest I don't really care.  Never had a girlfriend, not a real relationship at least.  Still a virgin at 21.  Don't ask girls out much, but I recently started to.  Both were taken, as it seems everyone is. Everyone's got somebody, but not me. The past week I reconnected with an internet friend of mine who I used to be close with.  We've been talking all day and sexting at night.  Out of nowhere she said she wants to stop the sexual stuff.  That's not the problem, Im just afraid we'll stop talking.  She was the only person I've had to talk to outside of my three guy friends in months... years. I'm trying not to be upset about it cause it's someone I'm never gonna meet and it's someone I went five years without talking to, but seriously... just like that?  Why can't anything ever go right or at least end smoothly in my life?  I don't see a scenario where I don't kill myself one day.  I'm tired of being lonely every fucking minute of my life.  I know someone will offer to talk to me but it's just not the same.  I haven't felt physical and mutual affection in close to five years now.  It hasn't gotten easier and I don't think it ever will.  I had every opportunity to make friends and find a girlfriend in college.  It's over .
