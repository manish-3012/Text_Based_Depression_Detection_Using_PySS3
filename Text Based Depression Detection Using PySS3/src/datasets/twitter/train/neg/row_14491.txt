I knowI'm complaining a lot but I feel so shitty I just need to let it flow somewhere or bad things will happen to me. Haven't taken my anti depressants for the last two days as I heavily suspect they are making me completely numb to my feelings. But at the same time I am so numb that the peace from death seems just delightful compared to how I feel right now. Last night I had planned to buy something to help in my escape from my depression but I felt so terrible today that I got lazy and didn't. I feel like my mental health is just about gone that I wouldn't even think twice about ending my life. And no I don't like the idea of calling a hotline. I can tell they would say similar things to what I would say to someone with my fucked up thinking. Right now I am sitting here smoking a cigarette in the area of the home of the swallows (if you know anything about birds you will know where I am. Please don't reveal it but if you want to guess send a pm, please note though that I am getting ready for bed and not sure how much longer I will be up as I have been having really fucked up sleeping patterns) and just thinking how peaceful it would be to no longer have to worry about anything ever again
