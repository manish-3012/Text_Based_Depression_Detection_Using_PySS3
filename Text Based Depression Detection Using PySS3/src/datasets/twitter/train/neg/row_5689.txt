The problem with UN-SUICIDAL people is that they judge us standing in their perfect HIGH HEELS.They look at  our situation from their perspective, which is a perfectly alrighty world for them and our problems can be easily fixed.... ' like they say by having a good diet and exercise which in turns gives us a good mindest, hence curing depression '. There is no one answer dor all of our problems and if there was it's hard to find it and we 'suicidal' people are striving to just keeep ourselves alive every single fucking day. The exercise and distractions do help to some extent but they're not the answer. 
So un-suicidal people please stop looking at us from your HIGH HEELS.
