A Right To DieLast night I just caved in. I started harming myself and breaking down internally. 

Please don't get me wrong, I used to love living. Despite all the suicide attempts and illnesses etc, living was still something good. But I am afflicted with conditions that are slowly eroding my capability to live. 

My sanity, my mobility, my upkeep etc. I feel as though I am ready to end my life. I'm not sure how yet, because I don't want another failed attempt. I want to make sure this works. I can't risk my  condition getting worse to a point where I can no long attempt to end my life. 

When I realized this is what I wanted to do last night, a wave of happiness washed over me. For the first time in so long, I felt calm and peaceful. Nothing and no-one has been able to provide me those feelings since my first suicide attempt as a child.

Please don't bring up family etc if you try to talk me out of this, which I guess is in part, why I am here. I cannot spend my whole life existing purely for the purpose of other people feeling better. There comes a point where I have to consider myself, and what I can continue to put myself through. 

I feel as though I have a right to die. We're all going to die, I just want to make it happen sooner, rather than later. I tried the treatments, professionals, alternatives, everything I could find. My conditions only continue to get worse. I want to die with my dignity, not decrepit and unable to move. 

In other ways, I want to live. Knowing that such feelings of peace and happiness do still exist makes me wonder how life could have been, had I not been like this. I don't know when I'll do this, but left unchecked, I just know I will. 

Any comments are appreciated, I just feel conflicted and deeply saddened right now.
