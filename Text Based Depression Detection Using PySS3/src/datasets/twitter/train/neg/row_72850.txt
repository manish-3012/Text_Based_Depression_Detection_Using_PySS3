Loaded my gun last nightMy gf left me about 2 months ago. We have been in constant communication and off and on together, her in and out of our house. I was a wreck when she left, and now the hot and cold thing she is doing is really tearing me up. She will love me and fuck me one day ("you're not the only one rediculously in love") than the next it's no contact or she is uninterested. Last night she went to a party without me, and I decided to drink with a friend. Stupid. When she left, I threw all my ammunition in a corner high on a shelf to make it harder for myself to access my .357. last night, I chambered 6 rounds and thought long and hard about really just killing myself. She is the only thing I want in life, and it's so empty.  I honestly feel like if she hadn't been drunk messaging me at 2 am I probably would've just gone ahead and done it. This fucking sucks.
