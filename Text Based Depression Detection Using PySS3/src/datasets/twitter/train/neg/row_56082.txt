Hope is gone, Anger persistsI can think and feel clearly. Hope made me its fool. This only fuels my self-hatred. Yet I am distraught that with my hope of happiness is gone, my weakness keeps me alive. 

It is embarrassing to know it is weakness that keeps me alive. I am alive because of anger, guilt, vengeance, and lack of courage. I still worry a lot about the after and how it would affect my parents or other situations. 

I have realized I don't worry about me making a mistake and thinking things could have gotten better or things I would have liked to do. I am alive out of almost duty or just plain weakness.

I don't know understand my urge to post. I know I feel a deep loneliness. I don't know what I want from this.
