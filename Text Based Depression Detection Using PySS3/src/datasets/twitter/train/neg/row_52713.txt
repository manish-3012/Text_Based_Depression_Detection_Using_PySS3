I hate having to keep everything inEveryday it gets harder to breathe. Like my chest is just getting heavier and heavier. But nobody cares, nobody really cares. Nobody listens, nobody really listens. 

And even when they do, they don't help. They just say the same generic bullshit and it makes me even sadder. 

Last week when this all started it was at least bearable, but now I can't keep going. Everyday it gets worse and I can't do it. I can't live like this. I'm not going to live like this. Goodbye
