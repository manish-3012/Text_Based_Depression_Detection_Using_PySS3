The person whom I had trusted the most has gotten tired of meThere used to be someone here at school who was willing to care about me. She took the time to learn about me, was patient with me, and helped me with some of my suicidal tendencies and self harm, and was a great friend. She was one of the first people that I met at college (we actually met on tumblr through a mutual who found out that we were going to the same place). But now, I've extinguished what we had. We got into a series of fights because of something that I was (unintentionally) doing. She was hurt and angry so I don't blame her for hurting me back. 

I had planned my third and what I thought was going to be my last suicide attempt. I was in a bad place. I walked a mile down the train tracks and lied down, waiting for the last train of the night to end my life. But I was on the wrong side of the tracks and didn't die because I'm too stupid to figure out inbound and outbound.

Later on I told her what had happened. She got very angry at me and made the entire situation about her. She made me feel worse.

I've learned how little she actually cares about our friendship now. I miss her. And even worse, I love her. She won't leave my mind. She's straight and I thought I was as well; she got very offended when I told her. She even unfollowed me on tumblr, which sounds like a stupid thing to worry about but that was how we met and now it's come full circle.

Tl;dr I am a terrible friend and now I have ruined a friendship with someone whom I had trusted and who at one point put up with me. Now we are both left with pieces of each other's lives that we don't want.
