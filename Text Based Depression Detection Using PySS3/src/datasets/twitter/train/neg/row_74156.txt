The old, leather belt in my closet.It's currently fastened around the clothing rack with just enough room left to fit my head into. Occasionally, I'll pop in there and put my head into belt loop and allow gravity to have its way with me. I'll do this probably three times a day, and have been doing it for the past month. 

I doubt that I'll go through with it completely though, maybe it's the fear of hell. Perhaps. Primarily, it's what my death would do to those close to me. I couldn't do that to my family, it would ruin them. Think of all of my potential! Wasted! 

So here I am, bored out of my mind and typing out my thoughts to a bunch of strangers that couldn't exactly care less. On the off chance that one of you comments, I'll probably get the old, "hang in there!". And then I'll make a joke about how they're right, and then I go hang myself. Or something. 

My girlfriend's dad shot himself in the head. Her last boyfriend had to get into therapy for PTSD and for suicidal tendencies. But you don't care about that. Think of how she'd feel if her new boyfriend goes and offs himself. Not again! She'll probably think. Bad joke.

My life isn't so bad, I suppose.
