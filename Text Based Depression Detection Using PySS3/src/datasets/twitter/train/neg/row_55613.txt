Really want to kill myself but donâ€™t want to hurt anyone by doing soHi, I just wanted to vent my frustration and see if anyone can relate to this paradox, especially as I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to about my depression/suicidal thoughts.

Everything is getting so hard, I donâ€™t want to wake up in the morning so badly now. Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t want to kill myself but rather wish I never existed in the first place, because I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone by doing so. I donâ€™t want my parents or friends to think they didnâ€™t do enough or werenâ€™t good/loving enough towards me. Itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m ungrateful in having them, they just donâ€™t deserve to feel guilty in response to my suicide.

But not wanting to kill myself for the sake of those around me leaves me to numbly go through daily life hoping something would just happen to me instead, as in hopefully Iâ€™ll get hit by something trying to cross the road or Iâ€™ll get really ill etc. Itâ€™s a really frustrating and painful existence, Iâ€™m sure others feel this?
