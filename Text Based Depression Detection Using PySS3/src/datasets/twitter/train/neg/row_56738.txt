I hate life to the point where I can't stand being alive anymore.I just fucking hate everything. 

I hate that people get a kick out of being mean to each other and feeling superior. 

I hate that there's always going to be someone who's better than me in every way. 

I hate that someday my dog's going to die and I'm going to be left alone, picking up the pieces of my broken psyche. 

I don't want to be here anymore.
