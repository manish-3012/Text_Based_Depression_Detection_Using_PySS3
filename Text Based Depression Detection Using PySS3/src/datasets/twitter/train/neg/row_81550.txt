I'm going to kill myself tonightEverything that I do isnt worth it anymore. When I woke up this morning I was like yeah. This is gonna be my last day. I've been telling EVERYONE im unhappy, all of my friends, my parents, they just don't believe me. They just kinda brush it off. I just want everything to be over. I think when I get home today I'm going to swallow a bunch of pills instead of going to ballet. I'm currently in geometry. I'm so misrible all the time. I think there is only one friend i'm gonna miss. He'll get over it though. I feel like i'm being overdramatic. Like my depression isn't real. There are so many more people that have it worse than me. But i think about killing myself every second of the day. I want everything to stop. I'm too tired to ecplain all of the reasons that lead me to this, or even write a suicide note. It''s too much energy I don't have. :( idk why im posting this but bye.
