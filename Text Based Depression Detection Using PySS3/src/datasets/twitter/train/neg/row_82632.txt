We as individuals are all alone in this worldIn only very rare cases will you find someone who you can count on for every single thing and who will listen to everything you have to say. Of course someone can physically be in a room with you and you may feel a mental connection. I have experienced this many times. But when it comes down to it all, we as individuals are alone on this earth. Nobody knows exactly how you feel, nobody knows exactly what you think, nobody knows how you perceive things. 

I've come to realize this after reaching out for help to doctors in my city and having them shut me down as well as  numerous times on this subreddit while in the middle of dangerous suicidal meltdowns and getting no replies. 

I try very hard to empathize with other people, but I feel that people don't do the same for me.(Not referring to reddit, but in real life) I try to do what people want, because I like people to be as calm as possible, but everyone else seems uptight all the time. Maybe i'm delusional, but I sort of feel like *most* people don't have my level of awareness. I can usually tell what people want, or how they feel and I do my best to please them, so I have high expectations of what people do for me as well.  

But the point is, nobody listens to me, nobody takes me seriously. Everyone has their own life to worry about and it is all they care about.
