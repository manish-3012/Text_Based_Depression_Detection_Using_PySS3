Don't want to erupt IRLI'm such a fuck up, I don't know where to begin.  I'm in such a bad spot, my father is saying that the first of the month he's going to kick my out of the house if I don't have a job, I can't tell if he is joking or truthful.  Back story I'm out of college for two semester for having a GPA under 2.000, I became too depressed to even go to class at the end, it was a vicious cycle.  The worse my grades got, the worse I felt, etc.  I just got mail yesterday that my grace period on Student loans is ending June or July, there is a payment plan that would take 10 years, but I also owe the school right now for almost $8k + $120 a month, this totals to $133k + interest.  I was fucking stupid to even try to go to college, I knew my first semester I wasn't cut out for it, but I kept trying(my dad constantly asking me "Getting all A's right?" and I'd just lie to him, "yeah yeah, trying my best" I'm a fucking scumbag)  

If he kicks me out I have no clue what I'd do, even if he doesn't this debt. is killing me inside and I don't want to say anything, I'll just be more of a failure and put more pressure on my parents that isn't needed.

It doesn't help that more and more lately I've just had bad dreams of my head in a vice, just as I wake up *splat* or another with a [hand crank drill](http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/77235/77235,1284503379,2/stock-photo-antique-carpenter-wood-hand-crank-brace-with-vintage-bit-drill-crank-isolated-on-white-61077781.jpg) drilling into my temple.

I know my family has a therapist or counselor that I can talk to, but my double thinking self just thinks all counselors just sit for an hour listening and couldn't give less of a fuck since they are payed to sit and listen, maybe prescribe something or push it onto another person.

I just needed to get this off my chest now so I don't blow up in the near future.  I just need to get away from everything, but without burdening anyone else.
