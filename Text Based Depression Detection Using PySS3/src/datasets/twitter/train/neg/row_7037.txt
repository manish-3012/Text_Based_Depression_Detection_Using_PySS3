I peaked in high schoolI don't know how but I managed to fuck up with two different beautiful women who loved me. I look back at my old writing from the time and it's a different person saying these things, someone with potential, with a personality. Nowadays when I think of my personality I can only really define myself by what hurts me; I miss my exes, I get irrationally angry hearing about animals being hurt, my generation annoys the fuck out of me, etc.

Nothing bad by itself, but they shouldn't make up the core tenets of a person's life.

This is worded like shit but I'm about to pass out anyway so maybe by some miracle it'll help someone else out there put their situation into perspective. It's too late for me.
