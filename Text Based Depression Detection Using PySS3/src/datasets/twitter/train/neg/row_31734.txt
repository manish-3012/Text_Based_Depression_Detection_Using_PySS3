Planning my own funeralMy suicide attempts have worsened over the years. I don't even obsessively plan my suicide anymore because I know exactly how I'm going to do it.

The only thing I've never done before is think about the 'after.' Maybe because in some ways I didn't really want to die before.

Now I've spent the weekend planning my own funeral. I'm going to pay for it next week. All that's left is to write some notes to family and friends. I've always put this off because I fear not writing the 'perfect' note.

Coronavirus is going to provide me with the perfect opportunity to slip away as no-one will notice I'm missing until it is too late.

I just wanted to voice what I'm doing out loud. Thanks for reading.
