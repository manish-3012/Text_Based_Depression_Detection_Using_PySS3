Could really use someone to talk toI have been passively suicidal for many years, and every time I think I really want to do it, I think of ways to but they all sound so painful. I thought pills would be the best way but they could easily go wrong and Iâ€™d be in horrible pain. Itâ€™s weird but Iâ€™m more afraid of the pain than of death. I think death is really peaceful and probably feels really good, but itâ€™s the getting there that scares me.

And itâ€™s that fear of the pain leading up to death that is keeping me alive. But I have nothing to live for. Iâ€™m unemployed and canâ€™t work because of a myriad of physical and mental health issues. Iâ€™m autistic so Iâ€™m socially isolated and have sensory issues that make everyday life 10x harder. I had to move back home because i got so sick and couldnâ€™t keep living independently and now i sleep in the hallway of my momâ€™s house because there is literally no space for me here. Actually, i donâ€™t sleep, because i canâ€™t; I donâ€™t even have a room, I stay awake thinking how I have been wanting to die since I was 7. I was abused by my father since childhood and now live withCPTSD because of it, which is the root of my depression and autoimmune illnesses. And Iâ€™m 36, so I really donâ€™t see how things are gonna get better from here since Iâ€™m almost middle aged. I used to be married but my (ex) husband left me and made me get an abortion because he didnâ€™t want to be responsible for a child. Iâ€™ve lost everything that mattered to me in this world. I know friends and family would be devastated and that they care but they canâ€™t do anything to help. I canâ€™t fathom the ida of going on like this. Iâ€™ve been told to hold on because â€œchangeâ€ will come but itâ€™s always change for the worse, not better. 

Iâ€™m in a horrible dark hole and I just wish I could magically wake up in a better life situation but I know that wonâ€™t happen and I just donâ€™t have the every and resources to make that change happen for myself. If anyone want to talk please pm me Iâ€™m in a lot of emotional pain but until I can find a painless way to go i could really use someone to talk to 

Oh and btw yes I have a therapist and Iâ€™m on meds and yeah it doesnâ€™t really make much difference. Iâ€™m still getting progressively worse.
