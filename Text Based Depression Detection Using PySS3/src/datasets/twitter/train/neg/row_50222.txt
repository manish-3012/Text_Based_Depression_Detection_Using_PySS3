Anyone that has told there parents they are suicidalHello Iâ€™m a 20 year old male currently in college. Iâ€™ve been having trouble in school for the past 8 months because I canâ€™t stop constantly thinking about killing myself. My parents are fed up with my lack of performance in school and think Iâ€™m a lazy POS when in reality my mental health has become so unstable itâ€™s now hard for me to focus on simplest of tasks without contemplating suicide. I want to tell my parents the truth but I donâ€™t want them to think I am suicidal because of them/ there parenting. Does anyone have any tips for telling your parents you are suicidal?
