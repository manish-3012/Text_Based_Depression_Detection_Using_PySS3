Good news is statisticly I'll actually be able to do it.Tried 4 times already, meds and counseling, tried school 4 times now and I'm failing again. One more week to get my grades up and it doesn't look like it'll be enough. I have no qualifications and no opportunities left. If I can get hold of my weapons again, I'm gonna try again.
