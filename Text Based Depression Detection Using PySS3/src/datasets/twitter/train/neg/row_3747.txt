I donâ€™t want to do any of this bullshit so why live?I hate wage slaving and I hate talking to people. I hate being a slave to my body and having to maintain it every single day. Life is just a giant fucking chore and Iâ€™m sick of it. I hate how Iâ€™m just expecting to do all of this bullshit and put up with it. Why live if pretty much my entire day is filled doing meaningless bullshit that I hate? Life is so idiotic and it pisses me off. I want to quit life.
