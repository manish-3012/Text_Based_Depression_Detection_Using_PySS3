19 weeks pregnant and want to end it allI'm a selfish fuckup. I said no when my long distance boyfriend wanted to marry me because of the pregnancy. Because I didn't want to end up like.m y parents. I've been dodging his calls for two days.now. Thinking about terminating. It's still legal here. It's a one day procedure. I can do it. But it scares me. I want to terminate me. I don't want to be me. I ruined th wonly good thing I ever had. There's nothing left for me
