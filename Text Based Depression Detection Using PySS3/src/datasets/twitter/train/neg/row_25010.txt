Iâ€™ve realized Iâ€™ve never expected to live past my 20sFor context, Iâ€™m currently sixteen, and currently repressing gender issues, which I will probably be doing for the rest of my life, as long as that is.

I self-harm occasionally, and recently Iâ€™ve been told that doing so is a big risk of suicide later in life, and I found that the only thing I could think was â€˜so?â€™

The world is shit right now. Poverty is rampant, politics is bought and owned, natural disasters are more and more rampant, and the progression of the climate will probably end humanity sometime within this century. I have no desire to survive the fall of the civilization that is the only thing that can make my life bearable, nor the days of strife and dictatorship that will come before it.

I love my friends and my family and the people close to me, but the honest truth is itâ€™s hard to imagine a future that doesnâ€™t have me taking my own life some ten years down the line once all my hope has dried up and things have gotten even worse. I canâ€™t be the person I want, I wonâ€™t live any kind of fulfilling life, and Iâ€™ll always be too atomized to make any kind of political difference. I still feel thereâ€™s good I can accomplish in this life, but itâ€™s a finite quantity, and Iâ€™d rather not belabor my time here before I suffer more.
