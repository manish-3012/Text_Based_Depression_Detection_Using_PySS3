My abusive parents make me want to take my own lifeLife has felt worthless and I have been thinking about commiting suicide for a while now, I can't seem to ever love someone and had a huge fight with my abusive mom. Told her she owed me an apology for all the years she abused me and she told me I had no right to get one. Had a huge fight and I feel like this is the perfect oppurtunity to go and take my own life and basically give her a bad reputation and cutting her ability to make money off of me and someone to abuse. Besides, I felt like going anyway and I know deep down this is wrong but the urge to go now is very strong and i'm actually about to do it and I really need someone to talk me out of it. Im just so fucking done living in fear of her.
