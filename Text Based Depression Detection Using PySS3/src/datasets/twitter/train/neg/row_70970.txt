Voluntary euthanasiaI wish society had a voluntary euthanasia program for anyone seeking to end their lives. Without this option, people have no choice except to suffer indefinitely or resort to unreliable and painful suicide methods.

Society facilitates to end the lives of suffering animals with kindness. Please can we have provision for those people who would like to end their lives with minimal trauma or suffering to themselves and others?
