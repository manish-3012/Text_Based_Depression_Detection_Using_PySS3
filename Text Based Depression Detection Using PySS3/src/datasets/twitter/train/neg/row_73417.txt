Possible attempt - consuming antifreezeHi Reddit,
If someone intentionally drank around 150ml of antifreeze that was cut 50/50 with ethylene glycol and water, do you think an emergency hospital trip is warranted? (Not speaking for psychological eval, which is sorely needed in this case, but rather for other reasons). They are a feeling a bit buzzed/dizzy and drowsy right now, but nothing else. The person weighs around 145 lbs and I guess this occurred 2-3 hours ago.
I personally would like them to seek help, but they're being stubborn and I don't have any other backup for several more hours at least.
