Even on a normal good day I still think about doing it every day.I don't know if I even feel "bad" anymore, I have up days and down days but every day is invariably the same, I'll consider just ending my life. It doesn't feel like an easy way out, I have no idea how I'd do it, everything I consider seems just as bad as bothering to continue.
