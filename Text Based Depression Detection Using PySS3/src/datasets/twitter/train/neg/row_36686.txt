I'm going to catch covid and hide at a park until I dieI'm going to try to intentionally catch covid hide at a park in my city, and hopefully die. I have a preexisting respitory condition, asthma, so  if  I wait it out long enough Ill hopefully be good. I'm a piece of shit and I'm going to flush myself down the bow. Almost everyone in my life figures out I'm a: blackhole sucking the joy from every situation, I'm a complete fucking moron, and I have the moral constitution of an offending pedophile. My 'boyfriend,' if I could even call him that, has caught on. After a short period when we didnt talk, he's realized I'm a social anxious, cowardice, people pleaser who lies to myself and others so much you'd swear I was supporting a drug habit. Things have definitely gotten worse as I've lost my mind, but I've always been this I always will be. Despite my declining mental state I feel like I've reached a point of clarity, I know what I need to do. 

I hope there's a hell
