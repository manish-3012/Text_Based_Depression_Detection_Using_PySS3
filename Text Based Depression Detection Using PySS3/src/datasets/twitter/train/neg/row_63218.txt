Death is a preferable alternative to adulthood.In my short, pathetic life i have faced much more abuse than i can endure, and i believe that it would be logical to end my life before i reach the age of 18. Which means I've got a year left to do what i wish.
I do not think i will thrive as an adult, i am most likely looking at homeless and poverty for most of my life.
I have completely ruined my chances of getting an education by doing nothing, i just couldn't get the energy and willpower to study for most of my last years in highschool.
Besides, even if i did get an education, i dont believe that i could make it this horribly competitive and cold, uncaring society.
The worst part of my life, atleast for me, is that nobody cares about me... at all.
Ive got a bunch of shitty friends who simply leave me at a moment's notice to meet up with more interesting people, im just expendable to everyone.
I can't befriend new people as nobody seems to want to even look at me, i cant blame them.
Most people see me as an autistic weirdo, which, to tell the truth, i am.
I guess the only thing left for me is a cold, lonely death by my own hand, never loved by anyone, easily forgotten.
But i guess thats what i deserve...
