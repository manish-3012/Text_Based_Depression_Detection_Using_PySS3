Not quite there again.I have been down the attempted lane three times, but I have finally realized exactly why, however it is quite hard to explain. I only really came to realize why I have no will to see out life during studies on existentialism during English. I have concluded that there is nothing that life can offer me, and paranoia and social intimidation have left me empty. Knowing that life has no meaning, and the knowledge that what is in store is the continuation of depression, torment and social anxiety that has plagued me since I was twelve, my image of death, which is a dream state where there is nothing at all, a complete absence of consciousness, looks all too appealing. I have failed three times before so I am at least confident that I wont end up doing it, but I cant help but hope that I wont wake up. Thoughts?
