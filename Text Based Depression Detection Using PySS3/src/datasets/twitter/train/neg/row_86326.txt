I have the means to kill myself right nowDon't get me wrong, I'm not suicidal. But the thoughts pop in my head often enough that I'm getting scared. I have a gun and ammo in my room. When i was cooking dinner tonight i looked out the window and thought to myself "i could just drive away from my family and shoot myself right now". It scares me and i dont know what to do.

I just wanted to share.. I needed to tell someone and i dont know who I can turn to.
