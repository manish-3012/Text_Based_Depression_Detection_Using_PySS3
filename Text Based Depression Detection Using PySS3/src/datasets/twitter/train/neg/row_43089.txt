Just self-harmedA few small cuts on my wrist. I'm working myself up to the main event I guess. I'm so tired. I can't deal with life anymore. I'm done. 

Yeah, fuck it. I'm going out tomorrow and I'm killing myself. Can't do it now, not at home. I'll do it somewhere else. I have got no hope for the future. I'm a piece of shit who deserves to die. I don't care what happens next. People can hate me all they want. I'm just sick of feeling like I'm only on this Earth to be hurt. So screw it. I might as well just end it.
