Helpâ€¦I'm afraid of myself. For a few years now occasionally thoughts of killing myself have been creeping into my head, but these past few months they're growing stronger &amp; stronger, I think that soon maybe I will go through with it or at least try to. I'm writing this post because I don't know what else to do, I want to reach out for help now before it's too late and I no longer see any benefit to seeking help. I was searching amazon just moments ago for a decent rope and was this close to ordering it before thinking "I need help". Can anyone offer me any advice on where to start please? Thank you to anybody who may be reading this for your time.
