Now whatI've been suicidal for almost 2 years, but I didn't kill myself because of my family.

Now, I hate my family, so I'm thinking about suicide a lot.

Literally, my brother told me that my life was completely pointless because i don't want kids. Seriously.

I've told him several times that I don't like kids, toddlers are kinda stupid, babies are basically useless, etc etc etc.

My mother is the most hypocrit person I have ever met, is just painful to live in my house

Idk how does mom's love feels, because my mother doesn't care about anything. She doesn't know I've been raped and bullied,   e t c

Now what, i have no reason to live
