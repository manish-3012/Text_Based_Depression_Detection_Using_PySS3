Why even try anymore?What's the point anymore, I have no fucking friends, I fail every relationship and I can't stay calm around people. Why even exist, people will just bullshit and be your friend for a couple days and then never talk with you again. People are a sad disgrace to this world, I can't trust anyone. So who would give a fuck if I killed myself, they'll just put more pills down my throat so I feel nothing at all and eventually get my way out. I'm a sad excuse for a person anyways. I'm not going anywhere in life, no point in trying to stay alive anymore. I'll probably just end up homeless on the street eventually, I'm not going to let myself live like that, I rather die then deal with life or any of that shit. Life is too hard and I wasn't  strong enough for it, it's probably benefit someone else to have my place because of my shitty problems. Why even care anymore.
