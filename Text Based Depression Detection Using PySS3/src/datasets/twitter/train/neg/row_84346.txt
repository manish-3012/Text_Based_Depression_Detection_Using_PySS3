Don't see the point in fighting it anymore.I'm only seventeen and know I have yet to experience most of "life" but I fail to see the reason people fight through the shitty times. 
I'm not religious at all and think analytically so I had to come up with a reason for life, the reason you get up everyday, go to work, come home and continue through a unsatisfying life. I came up with that everybody wants to change the world, be that through yourself of through your children. It's the reason that a parent gets that rush of endorphins, or "pride" when their child does something that proves they will be successful in life and touch others lives. I can explain my thought process here more if required.
Well I was diagnosed with depression at seven years old and put on anti-depressants. A few years later I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on Ritalin. The years between then and now have been an experimentation of what two drug combinations will solve both issues.  Well the massive amounts of experimentation messed me up pretty bad and eliminated any sex drive I had. Not into girls, not into boys, haven't had an erection in about 20 months. 
With my eliminated sex drive and the massive depression spikes I get when my ADHD meds wear off I don't see the point of me continuing to trudge through a life in which I'm not happy. 
I need some advice on how to approach my parent or anyone for that matter because I feel like I really need someone to talk to.
