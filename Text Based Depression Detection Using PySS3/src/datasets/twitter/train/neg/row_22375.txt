So close to end it allHumanity is a piece of shit.
I wasn't always as nice and calm as I am today. In school people changed me I hurt people near me at some point a saw what damage I've done and said never again. From that point on I tried to see the good in people. But every time I think I found someone they just use me because I would never harm them and help them whenever I can until they feel better from whatever bothered them. They never tell me the truth so I have to find that out the hard way.

Humas are ignorant assholes thinking only about themselves.
We have no right to evolve further (change my mind)

Today somebody I got really good along with threw me in the trash just before work. 
So I called in sick today because I can't think of anything else then tanking my life.
