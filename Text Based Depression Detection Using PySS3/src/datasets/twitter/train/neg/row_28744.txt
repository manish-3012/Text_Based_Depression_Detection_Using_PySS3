I need to kill myselfMy life is more than worthless. At this point in my life it is detrimental to continue living. But not just for me, it is detrimental to everyone. I hate my family. Unfortunately I still have the misfortune of living with them. My father is an aggressive narcissistic asshole. He treats everyone like hell and he deserves to be alone for the rest of his life. My mother treats me like shit. Lies, threatens, and talks shit about me and anyone Iâ€™ve ever introduced her to my entire life. She will bring up people from my past and use haunting memories to hurt me. My father does the exact same thing. Not surprisingly they hate each other and threaten divorce every time they fight, which is at least once every few days. My sisters are little bitches just like my mom. Theyâ€™re too young to care about anyone but themselves and likely wonâ€™t ever learn how to because of who theyâ€™re being raised by. Iâ€™m 25 and work a worthless shit part time job. I have a negative gpa. I have a dui, which limits my ability to do pretty much anything that requires a background check. I canâ€™t drive, no license, canâ€™t afford insurance. My body is failing and my joints have terrible arthritis already. I have no friends. I have nothing to look foreword to. The only reason I am taking the next breath is because I canâ€™t distract myself from thinking about how to beat the living shit out of everyone. I have hurt anyone that comes near me, and always will, in many ways.

Killing myself is the only option. But Iâ€™m a fucking weak piece of shit that canâ€™t do it. So Iâ€™m typing here instead.
I wish someone would kill me. Please.
