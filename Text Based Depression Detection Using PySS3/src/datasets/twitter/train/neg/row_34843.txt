What to do/prepare before doing in the deed? Like financial, SO, pets, house etc.Please do not respond with dont do it etc. I need genuine advice as to leave my SO behind the best way possible.

At this point i have the following things and input would be nice.

- clean way to die outside of the house
- process of life insurance and the terms etc. since it will be a suicide and insurance for the funeral. I would like to leave her behind with enough money for a good while and perhaps a specialist.
- prepared a photo and my funeral wishes including costs.


- unsure if i should leave behind a suicide note since she part of the reason i am doing this or leave that part out. ( too much info. Dont ask. wont answer. )
- unsure if i should prepare a seperate set of clothing to be buried in.
- anything else i should arrange for my SO.
- pets

I dont have a single family member alive so that is easy.


Thanks for the honest response.
