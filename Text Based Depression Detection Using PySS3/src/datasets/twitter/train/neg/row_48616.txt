Girlfriend broke up after 1 1/2 yearsI was in a realationship with a girl named Katharina for a little bit more than 1 1/2 years. She is everything for me. I love her more than anything else in the world. I was always nice to her and I thought everything is okay. And 4 days ago she said to me it's over, she doesn't feel any love anymore. She is everything for me. I would die for her. I don't know what to do, I tried to get her back, to change her decision but she didn't. I feel so useless now ans I really don't know what to do. Nothing has a sense for me now. Without her....I don't wanna live without her....I don't wanna live anymore
