I don't feel good...I really don't feel good inside. I actually don't know what I am feeling. It's a mixture of sadness and loneliness with some numbness and anger. I really don't have any friends and my family will probably not understand. I don't know if I want to talk to anyone. I. Just. Dont. Know. I don't even know why I feel this way, I think it's just that I've realized that I have no one. I feel scared and hopeless, yet soft and calm and ready to die. I wrote my note and it did help a little because I realized what I will leave behind if I die. Plus, I'm a coward. 

I'm sorry if this post is all over the place, I just needed to type it out. This is a lonely fucking world.
