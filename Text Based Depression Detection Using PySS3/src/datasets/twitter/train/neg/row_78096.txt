I want to end my life but i can't stand hurting the people in my lifeI feel so alone. I just went through a tough break up and i feel so empty and unloved. I don't really have any friends and the ones i do have know how much pain i'm in and don't care or text me. My past abuser just won't leave me alone. Because of all of this and more I just want to end it. I tried a few years ago and ended up in hospital i thought things would get better but it only got worse. 

I want to wait until my ex and last 2 friends have drifted from my life then i'll act on it because i don't want them to feel its remotely their fault for my fucked up brain. I have lost all hope in my life I constantly get hurt and misunderstood. 

I just want someone in my life who understands me and doesn't want to hurt me. I have been abused and mistreated so much and I am tired of it. I don't want people to tell me how strong i am for carrying on or how brave i am for what i have been through. I just wanted people to like me and care about me and no one does. They all say i am loveable and kind but no one stays in my life for more than a year. 

I feel so alone and the one person i met who understood me and didn't think i was odd or cold or this or that is a different person now. I have truly lost hope and thats why i am on suicide watch now i don't see a future ahead of me that i want at all. I joke that i'll be happy with a house i own and a stable job but what use is money and stability if theres no one there to ask you how your day was, to laugh with or, to celebrate your successes with
