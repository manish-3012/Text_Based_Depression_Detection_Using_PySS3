Four more daysLong time lurker, big fan. 

It's been a wild 26 years but I think this is finally it for me. At the current moment I'm 26 with no completed education past high-school. I'm currently unemployed after a string of grocery store jobs. And I'm 18k in debt. I'm engaged to the greatest girl in the world, and I want to die.

I've suffered with depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder for as long as I can remember. I can't even remember a time when I wasn't depressed anymore. Without going into my entire life story, my mentality started falling apart on a grand scale about 7 years ago. That's when the suicide attempts and the medication started.

Since then I've been alive, but definitely not living. The only thing I currently have going for me is my engagement. Unfortunately it's an international engagement and our K1 Visa is taking incredibly long to process. I spent the last 5 months living with her, trying to find the good in the world. And I did. She's the good in the world.

Unfortunately, four days from now I have to go back. I can't legally stay here any more. When I go back, I'll be going back to all of my problems. I'll be alone.

18k might not be a lot to some people, but for me, it's more money than I'll see in the next few years and it's enjoy to completely destroy my life. In fact, the first suicide attempt was because I was $2,000 in debt.

I've discussed this in depth with my fiancÃ©e and I've decided to keep this from her until it's time. I'm positive she'll be better off in 10 years without me. She knows I'm depressed, and have attempted suicide before, but I don't want her worrying, or blaming herself. No matter what I do, she'll worry and blame herself though. 

So, four days. When I go back, I'll have all the time and space I need to do it. I have a plan, I ordered my tool off of Amazon already, and now I guess I'm just trying to get it off my chest.

I'm not meant for this world.
