I can't go anywhere in life, and I'll die unloved.Every time I try to do anything with my life, I fuck it up. I got kicked out of trade school when they learned I was cutting myself because of harassment. 
I'm trans. My dad is an emotionally abusive, transphobic asshole. I keep failing drivers tests. I'm too fucking stupid to get a job, and even if I could, minimum wage doesn't pay for an apartment, and it sure as hell wouldn't pay for hormones. 
I'm disgusting and fat. I worked my ass off to lose weight (20 pounds doesn't even look noticible at my weight), only for the bariatric surgery place to back out because the behaviorist thought, despite me being an adult, that I can't handle the surgery because I didn't want my parents going into appointments with me.  

Every time I do anything to improve my life, it crashes and burns. My mental health has been destroyed because of my dad. I'm too unattractive to even do sex work or some degrading shit to get out of this situation. There's nothing left for me. My dad won't pay for college or medical bills once I'm out as trans- not that I'd have a chance of being accepted into college on the first place. I've had no success dating, because no girl wants to date a fat, unemployed women who doesn't look like a women. I'm trapped. I've got no reason to live, but I'm too weak to even go through with killing myself.  

I don't want to die, but at this point it would be less miserable than going on living. I'll never get to be the person I want to be.
