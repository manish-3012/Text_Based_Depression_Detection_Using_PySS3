I'll never find love. I give up.I've made it so close with different women in my life. But it never works out. I always fuck it up.  I either get super shy when it's new, or act like a total immature dick after I get to know them. Another girl who I fell in love with keeps drifting in and out of my life. Another girl who liked me a few months ago, who hit on me and was really touchey now ignores me because she lost interest. Another girl who seem to really like me, now gives up on me because I was talking shit about myself while she was around to a friend. 

No woman will ever love me. I give up. I'd just rather die.
