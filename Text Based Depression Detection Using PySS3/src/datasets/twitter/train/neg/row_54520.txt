I want to kill myself tonightMy live in girlfriend left me right before Christmas. My grandmother died on the same day. Iâ€™m transgender, so that just sucks in general. Iâ€™m not good looking enough to find someone else. She genuinely was the love of my life. Everything was fine. Just one day she got super panicky about the future and left out of nowhere. 
Iâ€™ve been drinking good whiskey and practicing some cuts on my upper arm so I can get the pressure right. 
I no longer have any hope for the future or desire to live. I am going to really miss my dog though, who is also going through depression bc my girlfriends dog has been his lifelong best friend. Iâ€™m gonna leave a note for my mom, so that she knows there wasnâ€™t anything she could do. 
Iâ€™m ready to die.
