I need help.I have been diagnosed with clinical depression, about a month and a half ago. This was over a year after a very public (and unfortunately) very failed suicide attempt. Since then, things have gone downhill fast. My parents absolutely refuse to acknowledge anything is wrong, and do whatever they (legally or in some cases, illegally) can to ensure that I don't get help.

I'm currently on anti-depressants, but due to my schedule I can't take them at a regular time, making them worthless. My therapist appointments were all canceled because I have antidepressants - my parents apparently not realizing that antidepressants alone won't do much of anything for me. I had someone I can trust and they were taken away.

On to what happened today - I had my antidepressants taken away ("because they're hurting you"), I was screamed at ("IT'S JUST ANY EXCUSE FOR YOU NOT TO WORK") and when I tried to defend myself all I want to do is cry. Other things said to me today

"You're selfish, rude, and arrogant. You've never been depressed."

"Your damn medicine is tearing this whole family apart"

"You are worthless to me"

"If you die now, it'll be the drugs fault"

"You aren't our problem"

"You're not fit to go to school, you're just not capable." (School is the only place I can hide)

Amongst others.

I tried to respond, I tried to say that screaming at a depressed person is sad and rude but then they just screamed more. 

I need someone.

I don't have anywhere to go. I can't escape. I have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.

And that is why I'm sitting in my room

Preparing to die.
