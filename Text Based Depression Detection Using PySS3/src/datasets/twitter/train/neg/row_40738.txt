Got my gun out today and loaded itI wrote my note and god am I tired of this depression. 
Now have the monumental task of cleaning up before I go so my husband wonâ€™t have to deal with that. How do I begin? I can barely get off the couch.
This is my second attempt. My psychiatrist has failed me repeatedly and Iâ€™m in such a low space that I donâ€™t have the energy to find a new one. 
Iâ€™m so done with no feelings - everyday I wake up hoping this will be the day I feel better, but no. So many failed meds, so many attempts at distracting myself to hopefully feel better.
Iâ€™m a failure and a burden. Iâ€™m an economic debt. If I were single this would be so much easier bc my family is all deceased- so there would be little impact. Just a bit of a messy clean up. 
Yes, Iâ€™ve talked to a hotline - they are useless- I mean no offense, itâ€™s just my last attempt I called right after and itâ€™s not like they can actually do anything- 
I donâ€™t have tears or anything- I just want to be done.
My husband is largely clueless and to be honest has contributed to this, but this is all me -itâ€™s buikt up over several years and now Iâ€™m just stuck.
I have one or two friends, but I canâ€™t imagine telling them. They would be horrified. 
I just want out.
