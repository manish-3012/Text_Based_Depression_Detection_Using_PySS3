I need ways to prevent myself from committing suicideI am genuinely suicidal. I get this way when I am really stressed out and unable to cope. I am autistic and I do have trouble regulating my emotions. I get impulsive urges to hurt myself when I am upset. Because acting out in any way when I'm upset leads to consequences I would rather not have to deal with, I have learned to internalize all of my anger and stress and frustration. It builds up and can't get out. Then I get suicidal. 

I used to self-harm which acted as an outlet. I have been doing other things to try to help but they aren't working. Some things, like listening to music, or watching tv/movies are actually triggering for me because I have been abused, raped, etc. A lot of media contains violence or themes that make these emotions worse.

I usually get stuck in a loop of suicidal thoughts/impulses/urges to hurt myself. They last for days or weeks. Sometimes they go away for months or longer. They have been getting worse recently and more serious. Last time I was hospitalized. Which, by the way, did nothing to help me. It was a nightmare. I cannot call any hotlines. They have never once helped. They are entirely useless. Also they contact the police if they think you are a threat to yourself. No thanks. I have lost all faith in any kind of mental health professionals as well. 

I do think I am at risk for harming myself. This is not a cry for help or a way to vent. I want actual advice on how to help myself before I end up dead.  I have been very close to impulsively ending my life several times in the last few days.
