I'm afraid to ask for help.I'm done. I've been on depression medication since I was 11 and it has ruined my life. I remember the process of getting on them was terrible. I believe that the expectations my depression gave my parents led me to be even more depressed. I'm 16 now and I can't deal with it anymore. I stopped taking my meds about a year ago and everything was find up until about 6 months ago.

My life is going no where. Even if it was, I see no point in continuing. Ending it would be painless. Isn't that better than anything?

I've heard those around me talk about suicide. My friends mock people who strive for attention and I don't want to be ridiculed for needing help. My boyfriend and I are going through a rough patch. But this has nothing to do with him. The only thing holding me back right now is that I don't want people to think I killed myself over a boy.

 I can recognize that I need help, but I have no place to go. The counselors at school are mandated reporters. They have to tell my parents if I talk to them which would cause even more issues. 

I got off the phone with the suicide hotline. I don't feel like I got anywhere with it. I literally have no resources that will bring out a positive result. 

Coming back to it, I don't really want to fix it. I know that if I had a gun next to me, I would shoot it in a heartbeat. I'm afraid of failing and I'm afraid of the judgment that would bring. I just want it to end.
