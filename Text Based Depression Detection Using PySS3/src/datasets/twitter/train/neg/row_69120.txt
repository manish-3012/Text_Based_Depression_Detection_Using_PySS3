If you need help.I don't know what you are going through. I have no idea. But what you could do, is you could tell me. Why? Because everybody has problems and some people's are tougher than others. We also deal with things differently. I want to hear what you have to say.

Honestly, whatever you decide to do, it is your choice, and you will experience the consequences. But maybe if we chat, your decision will be life.

It is not life that has let you down, it is living. You can always change the way you live your life. Stay strong, my friend.
