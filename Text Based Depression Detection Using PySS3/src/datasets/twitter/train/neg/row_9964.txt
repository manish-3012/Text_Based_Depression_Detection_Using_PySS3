I told my friend how badly I felt and now he doesn't want to be friends anymoreI've been feeling absolutely terrible and thinking about killing myself a lot because I haven't been able to see him. I have such strong feelings for him, and he knows this. He's told me that he's unable to provide the support I need.

I'm a guy btw and he's straight. I know nothing will result from my feelings for him. I didn't even intend this to happen. It just did. I wish things would be just as they were before I started liking him so much.
