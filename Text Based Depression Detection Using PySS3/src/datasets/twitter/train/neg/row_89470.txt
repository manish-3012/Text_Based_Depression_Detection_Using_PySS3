I am a deadbeat.I have nothing to live for. Probably going to enlist in the military because I have no real goals in life. I kinda want to be a streamer but i just dont think people will ever follow me or whatever so i never started. im pretty sure this is the only way to keep myself from suicide. I have just never found a passion in life other than games. It is sad but I just dont think im good enough to do anything. I can perform most physical jobs with ease but i dont want to live my life as a rat race competitor. If i dont kill myself i will join the armed forces and help the nation. That way I will have a little purpose in life.
