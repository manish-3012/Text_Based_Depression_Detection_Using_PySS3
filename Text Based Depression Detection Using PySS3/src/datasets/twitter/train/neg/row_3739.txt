I'm never talking shit about my feelings or my personal issues again.Never. I'm sick of the fucking stupid advice I get. And if I don't take that one piece of advice then it's my fault for being in that situation. Like "move to another city" or some shit. It's not that fucking easy. I don't have money. I don't want to move. It won't fix some of my issues. But sure, that's my fault for not being able to drop everything in my life, work to get thousands of dollars and move somewhere else. 

I fucking hate humans. Fucking hell. This is why people kill themselves, because people don't open up. This is the last time. That's it. I'll just never talk about anything ever again because no one understands or cares. Whatever.
