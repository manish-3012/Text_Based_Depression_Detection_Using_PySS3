I feel so worthlessNo one fucking cares. Everyone just takes, everyone is just selfish and chases their own goals. So called friends and even family. When it comes to make a decision, they choose themselves. That's how the world seems to be. And i just sit here and i'm scared to be alone so i do nearly everything for my friends. When they really need someone i drop everything and i help them. But that's dumb. It's exploitable and that's what everyone is about. Find an idiot to exploit in need and never give back. I can't do this anymore. I got my hopes up so often only to crash every single time. No one ever will be there for me unconditionally. All they do is take. 

I'm sorry for the rant. Letting it out through crying didn't do the trick this time.
