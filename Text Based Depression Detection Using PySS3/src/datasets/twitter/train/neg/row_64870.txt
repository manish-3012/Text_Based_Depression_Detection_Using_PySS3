How can I get into a psych ward?I need a really detailed answer. I'm 14, bipolar.. And I cut myself. I want to commit suicide badly and don't want to exist anymore. When I cut I want my inside pain to match the outside. Do I call 911? I want to wait until school is over in a week and a half.. But I also don't. I'm pretty sure the nearest ward is an hour and a half away. How can I get in and get help? Please help.  /:
