I don't know what I'm doing wrongI can't remember how long I've wanted to die. I think the thought has been a casual idea in my head for a year or two now. This February, I had a glass of water and pills lined up for me but I was too much of a coward to do anything with them. After that I've become aware of how much I really want to die.
When I'm in the car, I hope I'll get into a terrible accident. When I'm home alone, I hope that someone will break in and kill me. I always hope but I never do anything. I feel like I have a choice to either do my schoolwork or die. I have an essay due in a day and all I can think about is disappearing or turning into a giant Kafka-esque bug so that people will forget about me and I can die in peace.
The funny part about the whole thing is that, in all honesty, I have no idea why I feel like this. I don't know why I'm so tired all the time. I don't know why I keep forgetting that I exist. I don't know why I've stopped speaking as much. I don't know why I can't sleep or sleep too much or forget what my memories are and aren't. I find it incredibly hard to look at myself in mirrors, hear my voice, and talk about myself to other people. The lights are always too bright and the noises too loud. I'm going all through this and I can't find a damn reason as to why. I'm a teenager and it feels painful to watch my friends laugh and smile. I should be laughing with them, not observing them like a fly on the wall.
If this is what life is going to be like for me, I'd rather die than suffer through it. I don't want to go through some karmic punishment without knowing what it was that I screwed up.
