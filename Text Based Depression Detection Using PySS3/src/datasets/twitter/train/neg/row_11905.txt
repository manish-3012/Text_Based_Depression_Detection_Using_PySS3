I need advice pleaseSo I'm currently a full-time University student and failing my classes. My parents don't know and I can't tell them but they desperately want me to take summer classes as well. Thing is, I'm so depressed and suicidal that I cannot fathom this being a good idea. How the hell do I tell them I'm so suicidal that I can't even remotely imagine taking summer classes?
