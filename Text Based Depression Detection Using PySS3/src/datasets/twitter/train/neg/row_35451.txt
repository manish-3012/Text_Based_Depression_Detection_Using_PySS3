GPA and motivation have tanked. Why bother.So I tried to kill myself a year ago. Things haven't improved at all. 

Two years ago my GPA was 3.6. Then I couldn't get a job that summer and a bunch of shitty things happened. Next summer I got a job but I got caught zoning out and just being sad. Boss says she won't give me a good reference cause she didn't feel I was motivated with the work. My own fault anyways. I'm not mativated with anything anymore.

If I wasn't so lazy and useless maybe I could actually account for something. Couple of bad semesters later my GPA is now 3.22. I used to be competitive for some grad schools and now I don't even meet the minimum requirements. I have a midterm today. Not that it matters. Even if I somehow managed to raise my GPA back up and go to grad school or hell even just get a job with my undergrad degree I doubt I'll be able to keep it. Ill just fail at that like everything else. 

I just wish I had actually managed to go through with taking my life. There's no point. It doesn't get better.
