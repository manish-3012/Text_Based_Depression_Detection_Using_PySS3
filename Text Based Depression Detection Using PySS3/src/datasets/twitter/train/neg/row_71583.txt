All hope is gone.I've been infrequently visiting the topic of killing myself for the past year now, but over the past month or so I've been obsessively thinking about and planning how to do it. Originally I was going to jump in front of the train, but now after hearing the story that came out the last few days of the boy who killed himself in his truck whose girlfriend egged him on, I've been searching for generators to purchase to do this to myself.

I think the only reason I haven't done it yet is that I don't want to leave my family saddled with my debt. I can have everything paid off in the next two months though.

I don't want to be alive anymore and continuously fluctuate between despair and feeling nothing at all whatsoever.

I don't know what to do. I want to live, but not like this. I can't break this cycle.
