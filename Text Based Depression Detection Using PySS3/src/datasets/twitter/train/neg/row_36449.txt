But it hurts like hellHello.
I'd like to start by saying I don't think I'd actually do it. Though I want to and the thought of it consumes every waking minute. My bones ache for it. 
I want to be dead. I wish I had never been alive at all. My childhood was great, my teen years a dream. My early twenties were spent having adventures with the love of my life. We traveled and partied and lived without a care in the world. I had more friends than I could count including a few best friends that were the funniest, coolest, and most caring girls I've ever known.
I'm attractive. I had a silly and easygoing personality. I had a crazy job that I was totally unqualified for but managed to impress everyone anyway.
Then I got pregnant. I never wanted children. I cried for days after finding out. My boyfriend was beside himself with excitement. I sucked it up and put on my mom of the year hat. Godawful pregnancy followed by colicky baby. But oh! She is so sweet and beautiful! She looks just like me. She has my personality, too. Wild and crazy and passionate and full of dreams.
My life is perfect. My husband works hard and provides us with everything we could ever want. I stay home with my three year old. I fucking hate my life. I hate being a mom. I hate being a wife. I hate granite countertops and organic vegetables and swimming lessons and play dates and vaccination debates. I've developed drug resistant hypertension 180/120 medicated and sinus tachycardia 150bpm. I'm so fucking tired all the time. I can't think straight and my memory is failing. I love my little girl and husband so much. Everyone thinks I'm super mom and tells me how jealous they are of my perfect life.
I just want to be dead. I'm not afraid of dying, of the pain, or the nothingness, even hell. How could I do that to my baby? How can I not? 
Just reading what I wrote makes me feel like such a  stupid asshole. I hate myself for feeling this way.
