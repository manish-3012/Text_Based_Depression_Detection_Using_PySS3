Just a sandcastleDoes anyone else ever fee like a sandcastle? Like a beautiful one that people stare at in awe? Some may envy it.

Then you realize that itâ€™s nothing more than crumbled remains of stones and bones, bleached by then sun then left alone with no hope of a being anything more fleeting enjoyment to those who wander by?

I am nothing and will be swept back to sea and everyone will forget that once, for a brief moment in time , I was something beautiful.
