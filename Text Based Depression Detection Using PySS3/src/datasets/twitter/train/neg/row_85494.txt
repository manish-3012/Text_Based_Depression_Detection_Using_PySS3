life is stupid 19fI firmly believe that there is no reason why I should continue to live anymore. Iâ€™m 19 and I have nothing to show for it. No job, no car or license, no place of my own. The only thing Iâ€™m doing with my life, right now, is going to college and even that feels like itâ€™s not enough. Iâ€™ve struggled with thoughts about death and suicide since I was 13 and the only person that knows about it is my boyfriend. Heâ€™s dealt with similar issues. One day I told him I was feeling suicidal and he told me that â€œInstead of talking about it, I actually tried to do it.â€ Itâ€™s a lot for me to try and, likely a waste, to explain the sources of my feelings because itâ€™s numerous. Nobody cares, yet everyone acts like they do. Sometimes i wish I would die-just get into an accident and cease to exist.
