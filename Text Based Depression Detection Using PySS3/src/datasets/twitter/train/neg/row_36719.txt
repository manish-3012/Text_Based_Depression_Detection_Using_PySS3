Iâ€™m going to kill myself if I fail 12th grade.This probably sounds trivial and silly but if I fail 12th grade which Iâ€™m positive I am then thereâ€™s no point in trying to live. All my life Iâ€™ve been taught to pass everything the first time and that failing would be look bad to future universities, employers, etc. This isnâ€™t the only reason why I want to kill myself. Itâ€™s just the fucking last straw, Iâ€™m a pretty stupid person to begin with, I have crippling social anxiety that makes me too afraid of asking teachers for help or even pumping gas at a gas station. I canâ€™t get a job because I wonâ€™t be able to get passed an interview. Iâ€™m just a fucking disappointment and failure to compared to my brothers, thereâ€™s no point in me living if all I do is fail and ruin everything. Thereâ€™s no point in me being alive if I canâ€™t get into the real world.
