My dad is homeless and in pain and I don't know what to do.He has many medical issues and even though he has been going to the doctor constantly on Medi-cal he doesn't have meds that help. He's applied for Social Security Disability (He's only 52, so no regular Social Security) as he seems to be deteriorating as time goes on, but the process takes months and he's been told the first application is always denied. We live in an area with no homeless shelters or large hospitals with MRI machines (He needs an MRI) and though the local clinic has promised to refer him to get an MRI and provide transportation, they have not. There is nowhere for him to go day or night and he's in pain as it is, and it's wearing on him. I live with my grandmother and absolutely none of my family, including her, is willing to give him a place to go, even though they're decidedly upper middle class and could afford it until he got approved for SSD. He can't go on like this. He slept on a couch cushion covered in cat hair outside last night. He's told me he can't handle it anymore and will end it as soon as he gets the courage or opportunity. I can't bear to see him like this and I don't know what I can do. I'm trying to make money but it's not enough. To make it worse, it looks like my grandmother has been sabotaging this whole time, telling horror stories to employers, resulting in him getting fired when he tried to work, and she doesn't believe that he is disabled. She is hostile towards him and doesn't seem to care it hurts me, no matter how much she says she wants to help me. Sorry if this is rambling, I just need help and I don't know where else to go.
