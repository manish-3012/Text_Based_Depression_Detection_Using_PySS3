Cries for help..Letting people know how you feel is a cry for help.. it means you want to be helped.. it means that youre not ready to go through with this.. when we no longer want to explain to others why, this is when its real.. when you no longer want help. I have bothered too many folk with my own feelings of inadequacy.. i can't do it again..  and some things just can't be fixed. And we know this.. but we cry out anyway.. in some vain attempt to find an end to these things.. but there is no end.. anyone who has been through these feelings has normally been through them several times.. and it gets so tiresome.. it becomes futile. I really want people to understand why.. but logically, its only me that needs to make sense of it.. and i need to stop subjecting my own misery on the people around me. Its just not fair on them..

Fact is all of us struggle.. we all have problems.. and its difficult for us all.. how can i, in good conscience, off load all this negativity on to some other poor bastard.. we're all the same.. and its not easy for anyone.
