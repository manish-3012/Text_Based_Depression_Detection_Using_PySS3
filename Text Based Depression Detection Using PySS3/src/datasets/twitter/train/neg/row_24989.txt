I can feel myself slippingThe last few years have been difficult; the last ten even more so. 

This year I lost my grandmother to a particularly harrowing form of cancer that left her a shell of the person she was in less than three months, the girl I thought I would spend the rest of my life with left and my life feels like itâ€™s going nowhere. I graduated university, getting a degree in a course I used to be enamoured by but I now canâ€™t find a single shred of happiness within it. 

Daily living seems tedious; Iâ€™ve changed up my routine and moved countries and careers, yet I just feel like Iâ€™m going through the motions. Every day I struggle with the meaning of life, struggling to comprehend the point of living. Every sun set reminds me of the eventuality of my death, each moonrise illustrates the futility of life, the tedium of waiting for the eventual and inescapable end. I thought I was getting better, and indeed I am, yet while my mood improves and the pain of a broken heart recedes all that is left in it wake is the ashen remains of past hopes and dreams. 

I know I wonâ€™t do it, but equally I know that I very well may put myself in situations where eventually it will come. 

Iâ€™ll allow the way unfold; what ever will come will find me.
