I need relief..I need help.I have this C++ class that is moving too fast for me.......The teacher is not helpful at all....She is going too fast.. I have assignments that I just don't understand.. I don't know who to turn to..my head is spinning. I cannot change or drop the class. I fee like I want to kill myself. This might be trivial to many but I am having a hard time thinking about anything at all much less my assignment.. Last semester was not the case. I did fine.  I don't know what is wrong with me.  Am i doing something wrong? Is this just a lack of discipline?  Is this just me being lazy? Is there a special way to this thing? I don't understand. I wish I had some answers and solutions. I  want to get my degree and move on with my life.....I don't know what to do.
