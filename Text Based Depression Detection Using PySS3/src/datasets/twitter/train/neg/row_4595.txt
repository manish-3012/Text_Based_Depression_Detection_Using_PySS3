What is wanting to live even like?In the almost 18 years I have spent on this planet I have not once experienced what it is like to genuinely enjoy being alive.

Every time I smile something draws me back and makes me feeel completely empty, every time things go "well" for me I can't stop remembering that it does not matter anyway and every time I try to "think positive" I can't help it but rationally conclude that some distant day all information of my presence on earth will disappear just like the information of all those who will temporarily remember me and eventually every single thing any human being has ever done will ultimately be forgotten and permanently lost.
Which leads me to the conclusion that nothing matters and that has been my philosophy ever since I can think. This made me think about death early. To this day I believe that death is pure nothingness, which seems like the ultimate form of existence to me.
I want to become part or this nothingness and I do not want anything else this world has to offer, I only live on because I have been raised or rather programmed to care about those closest to me, even though that doesn't make any sense to me if I think about it.
I am here waiting until I am old enough to isolate myself in order to minimise the harm I will cause for those around me when I will take my life.

People don't understand how others do not want to live? I don't see any reason to live in the first place.

TL;DR I rationally cannot see any reason to live so I have decided to take my life eventually.
