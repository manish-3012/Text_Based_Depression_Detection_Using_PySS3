I can't take it anymore. I am so done with life.Throwaway for obvious reasons. I have written like 4 texts in English in my life, so I apologize for my grammar. 

**Background**

My parents got divorced when I was 1 or 2 yrs old. I was a "happy" mistake, so I grew up with my grandma. As an only child living without his parents, people pitied me and this made the whole experience worse for me. I have been drawing crosses with  captions "I wanna die" when I was 4 years old. Most kids at this age were eating their boogers and driving parents nuts, but at point I missed my own parents so much that I couldn't imagine living like that any longer. My mother hated my father, who had alcohol problems, and she has tried to brainwash me to dislike him. I have been visiting my dad every week for years and after some time I didn't see an alcoholic anymore but a smart guy who made a terrible mistake and has had an extremely difficult childhood. Every time when I think about my father, I can't hold back my tears. Such an awesome and intelligent person having bad luck. Born as bastard, hated by his whole family, getting a deadly disease while blood transfusion, alcoholism, his only child hates him, clinical depression and much more. 

I have always been quiet and introverted type of person. I have never had any friends except one dude, who is still my BFF. I attempted suicide at 14 by cutting my wrists. Many adults told me, that I am exceptionally mature for my age and while having very good grades and high IQ, I relied on my given intelligence to pass through classes. How smart kids with no work ethic end up, everyone knows. Of course I've noticed an interesting phenomenon. If my behavior was based on my inner feel, no one wanted to have any interaction with my. But as soon as I started faking it, more kids started to respect me and some even thought I was 'that' funny guy. At that time I started improving myself. Change my wardrobe, work out, read books, learn new skills etc. 

**Current situation**

The day I became an adult I moved out to another country for better opportunities. After a year I received a position in my dreamed profession. I got friends and people wanted to spend their free time with me. I have even had a cute FWB for like 3 years. I got money to buy almost anything I could dream of. Good grades at school, life is great.

And I my depression has never been so bad. 

I sought out for help by shrinks, used drugs, meditation, more exercise, talked to my mum. Nothing. Even the smallest inconvenience drove me to drug abuse, panic attacks, chest pain, sweating and crying. I can't take the absurdity of life, everything is so empty. I don't get it, theoretically speaking my life is awesome, but I can't take it anymore. I hate talking with people, yet I hate being alone. In my job I have to carry quite a lot of responsibility and as an apprentice I have to work with live system, sometimes under a huge pressure. If I'm taking huge responsibility for my actions which are being performed under a time pressure, my brain shuts of. I can't think at all, I'm in panic and make really stupid mistakes. I don't fit into this modern life, I hate it. It's so pointless. We all are gonna die anyway, and I don't have any FOMO by dying at 22. I can't imagine the pain my parents are going to receive with my sudden death, but I can't take it anymore longer.

I have over 18 cubic feet of compressed UN 1046 Helium in my room, ready to go. In next couple days I will cancel all of my subscriptions, bonds etc, sent letters to family, work, landlord etc., clean my room, pay any due bills for next month and then exit this world.
