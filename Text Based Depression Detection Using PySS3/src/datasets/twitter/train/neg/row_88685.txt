For my brotherI know that no one will see this, but for some reason it makes me feel better posting to the unknown internet than keeping it inside.

I'm here for my brother. He doesn't know it, but he is the single thing that is keeping me alive. He has something that I don't: a future. He's bright and he's funny and he has everything going for him. He doesn't deserve to grow up with the burden of a dead older sister. He deserves everything good in life. He will not grow up without me. He will not grow up with that pain in his heart. As much as I want to end this all, I won't. But if it ever comes to that, I hope he understands.
