Failed relationships is what made me want to kill myself.Guys, i know most of you are guys ,since i see statistically guys have been wanting to kill themselves more and more in this feminist broken family delusional goal-less apathetic society that doesnt care about men specifically. Baby boys now even are literally being left in the dirt to care for themselves longer than baby girls. It used to be that boys were the ones to be cherished and protected like gold ,because they can do something about their fate and they can do something about their family ,but now our society hates men so much, that guys prefer death than to keep on living. I was and still am somewhat in that spot, so i can relate to you all. But i think that since we're posting here, we're obviously still maybe willing to persuaded differently ,theres a chance. Im not saying that everyone here is looking for attention, but maybe for MERCY Or help. Now im not sure im the guy, but i am a guy that is smart enough to have an inteligent poignant conversation with pretty much anyone without me getting offended , i can even take criticism and i want to be honest and good towards people and thats what i want from YOU. If youre a guy that wants to understand himself , PM me and lets get together and see if we can talk instead of type all the time. Even our suicidal thoughts are better of said than typed.
