Do the suicidal thoughts ever stop? Or is this just how itâ€™s going to be?I feel like Iâ€™m at THE happiest point in my life right now and I still want to kill myself. I go to therapy and I have a great support system. I have a good job, nice apartment, good friends, good family, good hobbies, and love. I still want to die. I donâ€™t know what else to do.
