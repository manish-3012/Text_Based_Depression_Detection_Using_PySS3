Search within yourselfI was down recently, shit was real bad, but I survived thanks to my amazing friends, and  now I feel happier everyday. The reason? My friends didn't cheer me up directly, they helped me ask myself- what makes me depressed, is it my own weakness or is it a past experience or is it someone/something else completely, what drives me forward, what have I lost, what can I recover and what can I gain. And they gave me no answers, they just gave me time and space, lots of it, to search the answers myself. 

In my case, it was my own weakness and I work on it, bit by bit, everyday. I accomplish something new, I make my friends laugh, I handle my duties and my passions well, and after an unbelievably long while I sleep waiting for the next day.

I can't say, I'm completely out of this, but my want to end it all has shrunk down a lot. Was it easy/quick? Heck no, it might be longer/shorter for you, but the important thing is, most of the answers lie right within you. So go on, talk about it. Talk to yourself, your friends, your parent, your partner, your pet, talk to me if you want to anyone you're comfortable with for that matter, but find it. Make yourself better and be the queen/king/ruler that you are.
