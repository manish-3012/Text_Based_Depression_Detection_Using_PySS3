Not suicidal, I just don't know where to post thisLast April, I tried hanging myself in my closet. When that didn't work, I took a knife and stared at my electrical socket in my kitchen for what seemed like forever. I researched online various ways of "falling asleep" to die, such as carbon monoxide poisoning through your car, etc. I eventually sought help (by going to a dr appointment for a med change that landed me in the hospital), was hospitalized, had a med change, learned how to deal with the thoughts, etc. 

The other day, my coworkers and I were talking about it, and one of my (I thought) good friends said "it wasn't like you tried to kill your self through. You just went to a dr appointment and was put in the hospital". I then told her that, yes, I DID try to kill myself, and she said "I mean, it can't be that hard. If you really wanted to do it, you could just google it, right? That's what (insert her cousin who killed him self) did before he did it. Otherwise you really aren't trying to kill yourself."

I was pretty shocked by what she said, and I can't get it off my mind. This was Sunday, and today is Thursday. I don't want to go to management or anything like that because I don't think it's worth getting them involved, I guess if anyone has any other insight, that would be great.
