In Pain and PatheticI don't know what I'm doing. I am not sad nor depressed, and I know that I do have days when I'm happy and having less impulse to die, but I feel like, in the end, I'm just too lazy to live and constantly scared of becoming down. I know wanting to commit suicide is just an impulse and on many occasions is just a short-term solution to a short-term problem, but I just want to do it.  If I were to die, I wish people could understand me and remember me in one way or another. I wish the people I had a misunderstanding with would forgive and understand me.

I've thought of so many ways in which I could control the ending of my life with no regrets and pain but there is none. I wanted to cut myself and let myself bleed out, but the knives/glass pieces wouldn't cut deep enough because they were too dull and I always used too little force because I'm always too scared. I've tried suffocation but I'm scared that I would survive with brain trauma and end up paralyzed. I've considered jumping off a building or carbon monoxide poisoning but I'm afraid of the aftermath or regretting it in the midst by thinking too much. I'm too afraid to die but too lazy and scared to live... I am Pathetic.

In the end, I'm only trying to seek attention. I want people to see and remember me, whether emotionally or physically. I want to die as me.
