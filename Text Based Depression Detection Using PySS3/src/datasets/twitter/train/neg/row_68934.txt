I've freaked out today.I did something unreasonable, I went as far as I could with no destination whatsoever. Not knowing much of what happened and after scare the shit of my parents I ended, somehow, at home again. I don't know why I did it or what I was looking or going for. But here I'm again, same subreddit with the already know suicide thoughts, NOW I must have tried everything. I really can't do it anymore. Tried friends, family, doctors, hobbies, optimism and even this same place -- I can't try anything else, will just fade the fast as I can.
