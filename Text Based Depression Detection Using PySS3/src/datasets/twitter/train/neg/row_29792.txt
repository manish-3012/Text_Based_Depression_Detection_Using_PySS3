I'm all aloneEveryone's in bed and I'm falling apart. Coworker who I thought was a friend called me fat, and I'm recovering from anorexia. I barely gained 10 pounds within a few months just because I was able to stomach food again. 

Is that why everyone's hurt me? Was that why I was abused, hit, and raped? Was that why I'm never able to keep the people around me happy? 

I'm all alone, and I don't see the point anymore. 

I'll be seeing you soon grandpa. Before December 27th, I'll try my best.
