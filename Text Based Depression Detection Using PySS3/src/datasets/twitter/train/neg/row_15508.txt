It's time to get serious about ending my lifeWell, I've tried to recover. I've tried numerous medications and doctors. Gone through horrible side effects and of course, mood swings. I realize now that I cannot get over this. I cannot get over the fact that my family does not care about me and turned me into what I am today. I cannot get over the fact that I do not belong anywhere. I cannot stop thinking that I am grotesquely hideous. To the point where I avoid all social gatherings for fear of being seen/ my picture being taken, immortalizing my ugliness forever. It's time to seriously plan my demise. I can't keep this up. I've avoided friends and family for months and have just dug myself deeper into this negative thoughts and delusions. I will never be normal. I will never be good enough.
