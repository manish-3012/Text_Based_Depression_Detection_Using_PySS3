Why live if I'm not going to make it?I'm 21, trying to graduate college, and not doing so well... I keep failing classes because I just don't care and the thought of pushing myself makes me break down because I feel like I'm already at a breaking point with my depression, my loneliness, my whole mind. If I'm this bad at college, and I keep hearing people talking about life after... Even lonelier, slim to no chance of getting a sufficiently paying job let alone doing something meaningful... I can imagine how much I'm inevitably going to fail at being an adult. My relationship with my parents has a lot of pain, so either move in with them and deal with that on top of it all, or keep struggling on my own... I've pulled myself back from ending it all more times than I can count, on the hope that maybe I missed something, maybe there's something worth living for that can promise the future will be better. But what if there isn't? What if life is as good as it's gonna get in childhood (mine wasn't too good) and just goes downhill after that? 

I just spent my entire day lying in bed not doing anything I care about... I don't want to give up. I really don't want to give up. But I don't know what to do because it seems like everything good is falling away from me one by one. And it's not coming back, not being replaced. I'm so alone. And I don't think I can ever get better than this. No, I'm sure of it. All that's left for me is how much pain I can tolerate. That's no way to live. Please, someone tell me otherwise. Tell me I missed something. Please.
