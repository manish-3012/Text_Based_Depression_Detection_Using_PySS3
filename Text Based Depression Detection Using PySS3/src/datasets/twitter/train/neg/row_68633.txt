I tried calling the suicide hotline but it just made me worseI just called the suicide hotline and it was awful. I was on hold for 20 minutes crying, just waiting for someone to pickup. Finally they do and they ask why Iâ€™m calling today. Seriously? Not even what my name is. How Iâ€™m feeling? I explain that I am doing really really badly and Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m afraid I wonâ€™t make it to the next day because Iâ€™ll hurt myself. They then ask if I am having suicidal thoughts, which I just answered. I say yes. Iâ€™m in tears and crying. They then ask me if Iâ€™ve ever had them before. I say yes, but I promised I wouldnâ€™t hurt myself. He then asked again, like he wasnâ€™t paying attention the first time, if Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts. I answer. They stop asking questions and it is just awkward silence and Iâ€™m crying and I canâ€™t take it anymore so I hang up. What on earth is this? Iâ€™m suicidal  and I just put myself through the torture of trying to speak to someone while being super vulnerable. I wait 20 minutes and the person doesnâ€™t even care. I donâ€™t know what to do.  Iâ€™ve now been waiting scared and ignored. All while trying to save myself. I canâ€™t take it.
