Alright so I'm only here because some guy in some other sub told me to go here because I said I'm suicidal, but I never did because i thought i was just being a pussySorry if i insult anyone with my wording, i seem to have a way of doing that when i dont mean to

quick summary of my problem: im sick and tired of my worthless life because im dutch.

the netherlands has fucking nothing of value, especially in the digital age. Its always "i went on vacation to germany", "i visited france", "I saw belgium" and "ive been to amsterdam"

Nobody ever says theyve been to this place and if they do they call it holland. That just about shows you how much this place sucks

but the worst part is that the capital of the digital world is america and its so fucking unfair. If you need proof, although basically only america uses dollars, fahrenheits, pounds and inches, the internet has dollars, fahrenheits, pounds and inches as standard measurements.

Since nothing ever happens in this country almost all our news is always about america

And if you want i could give you a long list of why america is a way better place to live, but ill summarize it. Less taxes, no mandatory health insurances, WAY higher salaries, lower general costs.

TLDR

I fucking hate my life because i live in an inferior place that constantly reminds me of the life i want to live, i want to move to america. But right now im just a stupid 18 year old dutch waste of space.

I feel like i dont have the right to complain because i still live in a good country and shit but i have autism and cant stop comparing nethetlands to america so i just am depressed and have panic attacks all the time

Thanks for reading, now go shower me in hate like this website always does when i cry for help
