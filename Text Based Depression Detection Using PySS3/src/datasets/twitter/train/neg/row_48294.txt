Should I tell my parents Iâ€™m suicidal?Well, *parent.* Just my mom. Iâ€™ve been really depressed and anxious over the past several months, and this month Iâ€™ve been very hopeless and suicidal. I want to tell my mom, because weâ€™ve always been really close, but Iâ€™m not sure she could take it. On top of her having lost several family members already (my dad died of lung cancer a while back), my brother is also very depressed and suicidal, and he takes it out on her, emotionally. Could she stand knowing that 2 out of her 3 children want to kill them selves? Wouldnâ€™t that really fuck someone up to know? Iâ€™m really suffering, and while I did finally set up an appointment with a psychiatrist, itâ€™s a month away, and Iâ€™ve been in a very bad place today. Whatâ€™s the best thing to do here?
