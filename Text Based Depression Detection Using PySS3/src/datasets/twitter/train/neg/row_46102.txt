I doubt anyone is going to read this......let alone respond to it.

I'm sitting alone in my car with the intention of commiting suicide. I won't bore you with the details of why. Just rest assured that life for me is terrible with no foreseeable chances of getting remotely better.

Just wondered if anyone wanted to say anything before I went througlh with it.

Edit: Failed attempt. I'm now in the hospital.
