I can't get myself to do anything and I'm tired of it.I haven't done any homework in four weeks. I've skipped most of my classes. I sleep in to 3pm when I need to wake up at 8am. I graduate in a week but I don't even see myself making it there since I'm probably going to fail a class. Every night I tell myself "tomorrow I will work hard, I will pull my part of the load", then I never do. I'm going to be a failure forever unless my mind decides to magically function again. Even after I graduate, should I get a job, I'll be useless. I know I will hurt everyone if I leave, I will destroy my parents and my girlfriend, but they will eventually heal and won't have me there fucking it all up. I just don't know how to care, it's been so long. I keep trying and it all comes back to me being useless and scared and lonely.
