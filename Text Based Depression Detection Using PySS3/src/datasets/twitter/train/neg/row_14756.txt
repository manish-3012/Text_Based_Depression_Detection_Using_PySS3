Dislike current situationI am to much of a pussy to kill myself but I am just feeling very sad and lonely, I have friends at school but Iâ€™m clearly the weakest link of the chain. When I get home I have no friends besides one person online. I push people away with my ultra extrovert behavior which I canâ€™t control, I want them to talk to me and include but actively keep them from doing it. Gaming has lost all excitement and joy to it which is my main thing for entertainment, canâ€™t find anything good on streaming services. I dislike my personality and wouldnâ€™t be my own friend, the girl I loved barley knows me and quite possibly dislikes me I had to kill my affection for her which was hard and painful as balls. I have barley above passing grades and no attention span get anxious at night because my mind fills up with dark thoughts. looking for some kind words perhaps encouragement or just converstaion because Iâ€™m feeling very lonely and exhausted
