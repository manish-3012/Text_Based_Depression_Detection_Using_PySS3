What can I do?there is this fellow, he is a genuine, good guy. i knew he wasn't happy, and if i had known he would attempt to kill himself, i would have done something. i saw him, the day he was going to do it, i don't remember much, but i think he had a pleasant expression, how was i to know? he's in the hospital right now, its been 6 days. i had read that if someone had attempted to od, they'd stay in the hospital for a week or two, perhaps they could get out earlier, if they deemed to be stable. i was aware of his attempt a day after, and i think only 3 people know, including myself, i swore i wouldn't speak of it to anyone in school, and i have not, i have lost sleep over it, i know he didn't die, he was online social media two days ago. i want to comfort him when he comes- or if he comes back, i have pondered over the letter writing idea, but i don't want to overwhelm him, nor do i want to make him uncomfortable, but I'm afraid that if i do nothing he might attempt once more. i am certain he was feeling very lonesome. i want to be there for him, and i want him to lean on me, though i am also worried he might not want my help, I'm just afraid of making the wrong choices, and regretting it for the long run.
