I just cant do this whole life thing anymoreMy parents fight my dog just went missing even though I cuddle with him throughout the day I went bike riding and I feel like him getting lost is all my fault because nobody in my family cares about my dog. I'm always the one who has to feed him and take him out and the one day I go out with my friends he's left to roam and eventually run away. I'm 15 and I just cant do this stupid shit anymore what's the point of living if you're just going to go to school another 4 years and then go to a job that you will never like only to barely scrape by then getting a relationship which cuts off your connections to the people that matter most until you're 50 or 60 and just cant do the shit you were able to and then die due to some bullshit. I just cant put up with this anymore I would end my stupid fuck8ng life if I didn't think about how sad it would make my parents and other family.
