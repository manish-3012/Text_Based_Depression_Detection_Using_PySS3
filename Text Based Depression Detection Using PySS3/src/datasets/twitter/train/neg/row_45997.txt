I have never been closer to suicide than I am right nowI have typed out this post multiple times but have felt pathetic every time I went to hit post. I have to get it out, though. I am suffocating. I can't sleep, I spend every minute contemplating suicide. My life has never been worse than it is right now. I thought my teen years were hard, and they were, until I got to this point. I get brief glimpses of moments I wish to stay alive for, but they quickly fade upon the realization that they are utterly unattainable. 

I am so alone. I have lost everyone that has ever meant anything to me and it is crushing my soul. I have no concrete plans, no future. As the years go by, I have slipped further into disappearance. I once was a beach, but am now merely a grain of sand. When I walk in this world, I am not seen the way I once was. 

The walls are closing in and my bones are cracking from the weight.
