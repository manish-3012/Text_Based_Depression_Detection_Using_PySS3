Not a day goes by where I don't point a gun at my head.All I have to do is pull it, and all of my problems will be solved. No more trying hard to be happy, no more being miserable, no more depression or anxiety, no more living in a world where everyone despises me and treats me like shit, nothing. But since I am too scared to pull the trigger, I'll live the rest of my life being a miserable, lonely, and pathetic piece of shit.
