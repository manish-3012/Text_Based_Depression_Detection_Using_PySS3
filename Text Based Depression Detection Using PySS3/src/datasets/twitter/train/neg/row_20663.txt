I'm doneSo I keep trying everything that I can to make myself feel better, but none of it works. I'm turning 23 today, still living with my parents, still haven't finished college, and I fucking hate my life. I tried to address issues with my family, and they half ass try to help for about a day, and then revert back to their previous behavior (ex: my mom drinks often and ends up talking shit about people and yelling). I was going to a therapist for a bit, but I gave up when nothing had changed in months. Also, my mom straight up told me that therapy isn't going to help. And that the drugs are useless as well. I try to do activities that are supposed to make me happy, but nothing works. I thought that a lot of my stress was coming from school, but that's done for the semester, and I passed everything. I've tried numerous antidepressants, which made me feel worse. I've heard that you should just let it go for another day, but I've been doing that for the better part of two years now, AND IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK. Nothing works, I'm miserable all the time, and the one friend I trust with this stuff is getting tired of me. I'm just tired of dealing with this shit. I know that my life is actually really fucking good, but my emotional brain gives zero fucks, and I feel even shittier when I think about this.
