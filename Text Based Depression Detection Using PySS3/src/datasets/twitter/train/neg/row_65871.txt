You know when you donâ€™t want to die but also could care lessIâ€™m not suicidal , like Iâ€™m not gonna do anything but every day is exactly the same. Iâ€™m 23, going no where. Iâ€™m just a loser no matter how much I try I just can not succeed. I just want to take a bottle of klonopin and go to sleep for a few days and do it over and over and over again. Iâ€™m getting to the point of just not even trying. Not to be that â€œpersonâ€ but I have no friends, I have a decent family but still . I feel like a loser,  I dont think Iâ€™m ugly or anything, Iâ€™m confident with my appearance. I donâ€™t know yâ€™all but I just donâ€™t know how long I can keep going on â€œtrying but never succeedingâ€ when I was 16 I tried to kill myself and ended up in a 6 month treatment center which yes wise hopeful at the time and sense I havenâ€™t had any issues , never needed therapy no medications. For the last 6 months Iâ€™ve been on Lexapro and therapy(once a week) but still, I canâ€™t not just be happy. I wake up at 3am everyday , I only get like 4 hours of sleep. Itâ€™s just ridiculous. I eat healthy, I go on runs . I do everything that you are supposed to when you are having a rough time but itâ€™s been 6 months of this bs and I just feel worse everyday.
