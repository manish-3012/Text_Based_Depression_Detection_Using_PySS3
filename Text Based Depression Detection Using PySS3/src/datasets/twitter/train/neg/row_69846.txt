I'm at my limit, I don't see anything getting better.Dad called me a bitch and threatened to kick me out of the house for asking for air conditioning to be turned up for my bearded dragon. I just got the baby a couple days ago, and the humidity was up to 70. He got mad because he originally thought he turned it up. He never did, then I went to work. Minimum wage as a full time manager, nobody listened to me and I did a 1500+ rush all alone. Drama keeps going up. Boyfriend hasn't responded to me and pretty much ignored me for 5+ hours so far. LMFAO, things aren't getting any better and I'm done with being a happy go lucky bitch. I'm tired of being someone for everyone else, and nobody caring about me. I'm ready to honestly end it. I can't eat properly anymore, I only had 600 calories worth of food lmfao. It's not worth this suffering. No rainbow has came before,so I know it won't come now. I want to die, and I'm assuring myself that it will happen.
