Veteran cousin in trouble. Suicidal and alcoholic at the end of his 5 day binge. Need adviceI'm at the VA right now trying to get my veteran cousin help. He's suicidal and needs to detox from a 5 day liquor binger.

 They will charge him for service since he has a "less than honorable" discharge for 2 dui's and no follow up care ("if we can even get a Dr. Down today). We are at the city hospital for emergency psych and detox screening waiting to check in now. 

He said he doesn't want to hurt anyone but himself. Any advice, suggestions or resources that will help would be great. He's currently in a halfway house for veterans and has employment but is seasonally unemployed. Marines if that helps with advice...
