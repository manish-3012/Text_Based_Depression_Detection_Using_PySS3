I donâ€™t see a solution and Iâ€™m tiredI feel like I am too dumb to ever become successful in the future, my grades are dropping . Even if I studied for a test really hard, I would still get a shitty grade especially math and chemistry. I donâ€™t really see a solution, Iâ€™ve been trying to get better. I feel like I understand the content but when I take the test. I get nervous and then I panic. I think that Iâ€™m a failure and Iâ€™m worthless. I also get diarrhea before a test when Iâ€™m really stressed, which makes the whole thing even worse, sometimes during the test itself. I think I might have depression and I really want to go see a psychiatrist, but what if Iâ€™m perfectly normal? That Iâ€™m just a loser looking for excuses to make myself feel better. I donâ€™t want to die but I also donâ€™t want to be here. Iâ€™m tired of being me.

To whoever that is reading this, thank you.
