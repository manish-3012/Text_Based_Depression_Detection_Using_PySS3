Im not prepared for societyI honestly dont know what to do, im 18, i live in a complicated country, shits about to hit the fan and im useless, cant do manual work.. im short and weak, social jobs? im socially inept. College? What money? Im stupid too. Im trash, i cant do shit.
Aaaaand im lonely as shit, no friends, acquaintances, no one. What can i do? Im erratic.
I never had the urge to do drugs before, im pretty 'conservative' but now if i have something in my pocket im taking it. Lately ive left my tomb and went out to do some shit and there were thoughts wandering inside my head about jumping in front of a bus, getting hit by a car, going on top of some building and jumping, making a pretty stain on the concrete. Whatever, i dont think i have much time left
