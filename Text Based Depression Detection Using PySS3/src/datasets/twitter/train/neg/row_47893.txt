i need comfort that its okay for me to be alivei want to talk to someone but whenever i tried to words dont come out n i know its all in my head so the idea of burdening someone with my thoughts is too heavy for me to bear. i told my close friend n they always remind me of how privileged i am for not being as mentally ill, handicapped as them n havent attempted suicide as many as they did. if anything i feel like im the one whos most aware of my blessings. i broke my one year clean streak.

im tired of having to wake up n depend on myself on what to do. i dont think i deserve anything in my life bcs i never did anything deserving of it. if only i could give it to someone more worthy of mine i wont have to feel any burden from being alive anymore.

i feel like i need to actually kill myself just for them to see i really am hurting. but at the same time i just wanna go out silently without anyone noticing bcs someone as unqualified as a human like me deserve not a single tear still it would be nice if im in someoneâ€™s memories.
