Living Hell...It seems that every day I'm bombarded with thousands of messages from fellow classmates, teachers, and lawmakers, all saying the same thing. "WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU." All the news that comes out has that message, too. People heralding the most unreasonable and mean opinions are just everywhere and I just can't take it anymore. Please help.
