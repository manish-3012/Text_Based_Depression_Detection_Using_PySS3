Every day life pushes me to the ground, one of these days I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be getting back upIâ€™ve been depressed for many years but 2019 and 2020 have been the very worst. Lost two of my closest friends last year, anyone I get close to seem to just leave me heartbroken. Ended up in the psych ward in October of last year. With covid this year itâ€™s hard on everyone and just when I was getting back into working in the summer my granddad who Iâ€™ve been close with my whole life got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and then just passed last month. Right after that my grandma gets a cancer diagnosis of her own. My family and I fight every single day and Iâ€™ve had no treatment this year because nothing has ever worked for me besides coping with weed. Today another friend left me and Iâ€™m barely making it through my work shift without breaking down. Each year I feel like I wonâ€™t make it to the next but Iâ€™ve never felt that way more than I do now.
