thinking of graduating high school makes my suicidal thoughts worseim in my senior year of high school and im starting to wish my past suicide attempts worked. i didn't plan for college/my future because i grew up telling myself i would die before i graduate. im passionate about art and music, but i know that getting a degree in those subjects would be useless and leave me flat broke. i dont have a dream job or a dream school. living past 17  just wasn't meant for me. my parents can barely afford to help my older sister with her schooling. i keep telling myself i'll take a gap year but the school i go to is very pushy about college and going as soon as you get your high school diploma. all the college talk keeps pushing me closer and closer to the edge. i havent talked to my therapist in weeks and in months and i havent taken my meds since late august but i've felt this way ever since middle school. i dont know what to do anymore. sorry this is just rambling
