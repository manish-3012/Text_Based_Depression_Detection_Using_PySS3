alone againI constantly feel so alienated and isolated from everyone, which is so strange. I live with three roommates, my ex boyfriend still talks to me, but all I want to do is die. I feel like everyone doesn't actually like me or care about me. I feel misunderstood and alone. I feel like even when I talk about what hurts me, people don't understand it. I wish there was some diagnosis between "I know I can't kill myself and I don't plan to" and "I really wish I was dead and nobody is taking me seriously". I don't want antidepressants because all they did was make me want to take action with my thoughts, and being off of them made me feel back to normal. I think a lot of it stems from intense abuse as a child, and I am in therapy, and I am trying to socialize and get a good job...but at the end of the day I always wonder if there is a point.  


Life isn't fair and I'm so tired of hurting. I'm so tired of feeling like nobody understands how this.
