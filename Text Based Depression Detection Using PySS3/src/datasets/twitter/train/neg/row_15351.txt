I want to stop existingI just want to like. Stop existing.
I want to not be around. I feel like I'm such a burden to my friends, I'm constantly asking if they even want to be around me because I'm incapable of trusting them completely no matter how hard I try. My family and their financial situation have gone to shit and I feel like such a burden asking for necessary things like shampoo or body wash. 
Lately I've just been thinking. I don't think I could actually kill myself but I just think about it. I think about what it would be like to be gone, what would happen to my family/friends, the easiest/fastest way to do it. It seems like such an easy out and I just don't understand what the point is of me being around. I understand I have good qualities but so what? The good I give out doesn't balance out the bad I give out no matter how bad I try.
