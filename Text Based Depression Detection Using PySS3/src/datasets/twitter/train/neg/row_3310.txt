Talking about my thoughts seems to invalidate themA few months ago, I was having suicidal thoughts one night. I texted my best friend and he talked with me. Before saying goodnight, he told me to text him again anytime I needed to talk, so I did several times. I'd tell him how I was feeling, how I didn't want to be alive, how I wanted to die. But I think that telling him so many times invalidated it in some way -- made it less serious. It seems like people think that if you're willing to talk openly with your friends, then you can't "actually" be suicidal. They think that you're supposed to show the warning signs, be less social, stop talking to people in general. But everytime I texted him I was 100% serious, though I probably tired him out from all my messages because at some point he stopped being so understanding and would just say "Sorry. Can't talk rn" or something like that. Or just leave me on read. Now I don't know if I should keep talking about how I feel. Nobody's gonna take me seriously, or believe me when I say that I am not doing well. I don't know what the point of this post is. Venting or whatever. I don't know.
