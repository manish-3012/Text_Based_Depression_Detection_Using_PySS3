I suspect that a friend of mine is suicidal, but he and I aren't very close. What should I do?He was already depressed when I met him and we're not close friends. If I were to talk to him about it, I wouldn't know what to say. What should I do?

EDIT: If it makes a difference, he became depressed when he broke up with his girlfriend three or four months ago.
