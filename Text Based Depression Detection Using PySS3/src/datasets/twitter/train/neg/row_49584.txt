I donâ€™t know how much more I can takeIâ€™ve been depressed since my senior year of high school when my cats passed, my family started to get weaker and I lost my best friend because I was in love with her. Iâ€™m a freshman now but I just feel so overwhelmed by everything. I canâ€™t make friends, the friends from back home are moving on, and I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I feel so isolated, so alone and thereâ€™s just no point. Iâ€™m in love with my best friend again and I know she wonâ€™t like me back and telling her is just going to push me over the edge. But holding it in has made me incredibly anxious and itâ€™s also making me worse. Iâ€™m overweight, ugly, insecure about my penis size, pretty much anything society holds high in masculinity I lack. I donâ€™t have any self confidence and nothing seems to make me happy anymore but my best friend. But she lives so far away and my feelings for her get in the way. I recently started cutting to and Iâ€™m just worried that Iâ€™ll end up taking my own life. I donâ€™t want to die, Iâ€™m scared of whatâ€™ll happen on the other side, but Iâ€™m also scared of living a life that accomplished nothing. I just donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m still willing to fight, but I just need a reason, and none have come my way.
