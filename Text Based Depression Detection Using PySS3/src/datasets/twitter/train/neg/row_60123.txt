I have the gun loaded and readyI have a 22lr revolver loaded, sitting within arms reach right now. Iâ€™m so done itâ€™s not even funny. Tell me why I shouldnâ€™t shoot myself. Hereâ€™s my problem; 

Iâ€™m a schizoid with severe depression, adhd, brain fog to the point that reading basic text messages can be hard, and binge eating disorder 

I get zero enjoyment from anything whatsoever and lock myself away in my room nearly 24/7 to keep from binge eating 

Iâ€™ve been to treatment multiple times, gotten professional help, meds etc but nothing has helped and Iâ€™m unwilling to try any of it again 

I had a job at a convenient store but was fired for not being able to do basic tasks and because I started to eat food from the garbage. 

Iâ€™ve started on adderall and vape but canâ€™t concentrate at all on anything and understand what it means to be retarded  

I have no skills, canâ€™t drive a car, have zero dollars to my name, and no drive to do anything.
