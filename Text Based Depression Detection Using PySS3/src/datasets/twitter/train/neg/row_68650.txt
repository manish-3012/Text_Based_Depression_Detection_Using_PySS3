I want it to be overI just donâ€™t know how much more I can take. I want to die, I have nothing left. Everything Iâ€™ve ever done has been a failure, Iâ€™m tired of being the fuck up, tired of being the one who lets everyone down. So this time Iâ€™m going to succeed at something and not let people down when I say I will do something. I sit here on my bed and itâ€™s the most uncomfortable thing Iâ€™ve ever felt, I donâ€™t deserve this bed, I donâ€™t deserve to sleep, I donâ€™t deserve to eat or drink, I donâ€™t deserve friends, I donâ€™t deserve anything I own, I donâ€™t deserve to live. I am Christian but I donâ€™t know anymore. I feel like god is dead. And to be honest, I donâ€™t care anymore, nothing matters. We are all just numbers anyways, Iâ€™d rather be another statistic than be a living shitbag. Itâ€™s gotten to the point where breathing hurts and it takes so much energy to move at all, writing this will put me to sleep I bet. Me heartbeat hurts my chest like itâ€™s a fucking hammer and I want it to stop. Itâ€™s become an every day obsession, suicide. Thinking of ways to kill myself or cause harm to myself in everything. Asking myself every time I pass a big truck on the road if I should just swerve in front of it and take my seatbelt off. But then I realize I have someone in the car or it will hurt the driver of the other vehicle. Or like if Iâ€™m on top of a building I think about just jumping head first but then everyone around would watch and hear me fall. I just want to go quietly, and I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone in the process, suicide by cop or join the military to go and get killed? The only people who would feel sad would be my parents, but they wouldnâ€™t need to live with the fact I killed myself. 

I just want it to be over, I want to fall asleep and never wake up.
