I canâ€™t live like this.There are worse things for sure. People with terminal illnessness, death, poverty, famine, injustice. 

Iâ€™m aware that my problems are not that big, yet they are big to me. 

My girlfriend of 6 years, who I planned to marry, left me. We also bought our first home together, that is also gone. Everything is gone. Iâ€™m introverted and have very few friends and I canâ€™t open up to them about this. Iâ€™m not close to my family either. Iâ€™ve come to realize I need to rely on myself, yet everyday is so heavy. Every task is heavy. 

Everyday is a fight and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve made any progress. I am so lost and abandoned. I spend so much time sobbing. I want to make the best of where my life is now, but nothing will come close to what we had together. Iâ€™m a fraction of who I was. 

Iâ€™ve lost hope. Iâ€™m tired. Tired of hanging on. Iâ€™m not winning this. I fear that one day Iâ€™m going to sign off and eat a bunch of pills and casually drift off. I donâ€™t have the will to pull myself out of this.
