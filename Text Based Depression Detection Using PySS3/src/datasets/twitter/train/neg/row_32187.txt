Possibly my suicide noteI'm really sorry you have to read this and have to feel some of what I'm feeling but here goes. I wanna start by saying sorry to my boyfriend, I love you and you don't deserve to feel how I'm gonna make you feel if I do this. To my parents, yes I'm gay and no you were never supportive before you claim to being so. To all of my friends, you are the best group of people I could have hung around with. I don't want an expensive funeral, I know you can't afford that and on the off chance I survived tonight I will delete this post
