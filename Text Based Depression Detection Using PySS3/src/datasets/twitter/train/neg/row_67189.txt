It's over19, been this way since 13. I'm not a bad person.I hate people, hate college, girls make me sad and make everything worse, kids in my generation have no morals and only care about drugs/getting fucked up and that's what girls find '"attractive", etc,  existential depression, everything is meaningless, can't find happiness. Can't find passion in anything. My world lacks color, all I see is shades of grey and I'm afraid it will always be this way. I'm done ;(
