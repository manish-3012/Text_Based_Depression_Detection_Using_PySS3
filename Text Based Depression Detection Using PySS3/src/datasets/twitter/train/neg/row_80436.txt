StolenI have a jar.. this is my jar.. and I donâ€™t want your jelly beans in my jar.  I want my own jelly beans where they are going to be miss valued, and made to look like something they arenâ€™t. You donâ€™t actually respect my jelly beans. And you miss represent why I have my own jar for my own beans. You stole my jelly beans and tried to break why it was important that I have my own jar with my own beans that meant something to me, the people that appreciated my jelly beans, and you tried to put things in my jar that werenâ€™t my jelly beans, you tried to make the jelly beans in my jar that I had for the people that actually cared about me ugly. My jar and my beans and value that I have for them. Has nothing to do with you or the jelly beans you stole from me. You made those beans ugly. And lie about where you got them and why you wanted to steal them from me. You know where to get jelly beans. And you tried to hurt me to get what you want. I hope that your jelly beans are ugly bathroom jelly beans. And you donâ€™t get to taste that they came from me. Cause you selfish, petty, and donâ€™t actually have any knowledge of how few jelly beans that I had. That I donâ€™t want to share with you at all. You poisoned my jelly beans. Broke my jar. And ruined my life. Your not my friend or ally. You steal and lie about what you like about me my jar and my beans that I had for people that you didnâ€™t know you didnâ€™t appreciate how you treated your or other peoples jelly beans.. your ugly and so are the jelly beans you stole from me.. I hate you and your self jar and the harm you cause by being the one hoarding not me. You a gross and disrespectful and juncted person for who you are and trying to make My jelly beans look like they had no place tasting good to my friends and family and the person that really loved me.
