Iâ€™m manic and off my meds, sitting in my car that has no gasThereâ€™s a suffocating weight on my chest that is scary, breathing is just as hard as dragging my slug body out of bed. Iâ€™m so beyond broke I donâ€™t have gas in my car Iâ€™m out of cigarettes. Nothing makes me feel better and I feel like Iâ€™m drowning. I feel like if anything got the slightest bit worse Iâ€™m slam my car door over my heade. Like omg this is terrifying and I feel so alone, so alone that when I reached out to my friend I was left on read so alone that Iâ€™m really posting on reddit. Just to ease the stress of slowly implicating in my car.
