No way out. No way to fix myself.I canâ€™t get a grip on anything anymore. My mood swings from moment to moment. Iâ€™m so tired I can barely leave my bed and I canâ€™t find joy in anything. Iâ€™m wondering how long I can live like this before I kill myself. I set myself up for failure and now my world is falling around me. I wish I just had the courage to down a bottle of pills and a bottle of whiskey.
