StrugglingIâ€™m honestly beginning to wonder if Iâ€™m just being kept alive as some cruel joke. If my suffering is just to the benefit of others in them feeling better for keeping a sick person here when they donâ€™t want to be. Iâ€™m a horrible, nasty person right to my core, so why keep me here? Iâ€™m so horrendous why bother to keep me alive? Iâ€™ve never felt more alone and my only comfort right now is that I could end it all for myself and finally be free. Iâ€™m past help and I just want this to go so I can feel some kind of quiet.
