In class todayIn sociology class we talked about teen suicide. It made me very uncomfortable. The teacher talked about how many teens fail suicide and not tell anyone, and the class was like â€œomg thatâ€™s so sad!!â€ â€œomg thatâ€™s so scary!!!â€ 

Funny that me, who has failed suicide many times and has never told anyone, was sitting right in front of them.  I was so uncomfortable. I donâ€™t wanna discuss suicide in the class anymore, but I guess thatâ€™s what I get for taking the class.
