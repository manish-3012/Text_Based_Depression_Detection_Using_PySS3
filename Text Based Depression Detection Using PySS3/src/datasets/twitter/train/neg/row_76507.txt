I can't take much moreI know I'm going to attempt again soon. And this time it really feels like it'll actually happen, or at least I hope to fucking God it does because all of this is pointless and worthless. Life is not worth living and I don't ever see it changing. No one cares about me and I'm pretty sure no one ever will. Cant get my own family to even like me lol... Why would anybody else?...
