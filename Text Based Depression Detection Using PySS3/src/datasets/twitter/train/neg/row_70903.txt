BPD ruined my lifeMy boyfriend (FP) has been ignoring me for a week. I've been asking for forgiveness and genuinely apologizing. He won't give me a sign he still wants me. Anxiety is taking the best out of this situation. Why must I be like this? I feel so unwanted. I wanted to hospitalize myself yesterday. Make him care about me, maybe. Have someone care. I really want to die, but I'm too exhausted to even attempt it. Does anyone else relate to this?? My mental illness ruined my life and I wish it would go away. I am still currently unmedicated due to insurance problems.
Thanks for reading.
