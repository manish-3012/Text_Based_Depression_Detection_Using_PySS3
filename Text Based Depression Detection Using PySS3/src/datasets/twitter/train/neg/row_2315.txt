I'm paranoid and I'd rather just die than deal with thisI can't eat, I sleep with the lights on, My depression is getting worse.

Someone broke into my car right before christmas and right after my dad's car alarm went off because someone tried to get into the vehicle.
I spend a lot of time alone here and I can't sleep without thinking that I'll wake up with someone in the house.

I'm paranoid, I'm scared, I'm drinking heavily just so I can fall asleep.
Someone please help me,
I'm tired of grabbing a blunt object whenever I hear footsteps.

I constantly contemplate taking sleeping pills just so that it will all go away.
