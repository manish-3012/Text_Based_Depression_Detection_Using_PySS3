This is a weird placeI don't know if it should make me feel better or worse...\. That others are contemplating suicide just the same as I am, in real time. Its a strange thing. I have wanted this for so long.. it's manifested itself in so different ways

I started preparing. I have told my mom that I am going to die young, that somehow I know that and she needs to know too so she can prepare herself. I literally said that to my mother

And other things. I feel like this pain is insurmountbale because it's a part of me, it;s icy and liguid and black and solid like coal but not it's everything at once and I will never ever not be a part of it

I just know the world will sigh in relief when i'm no longer a part of it... there might be little chaos at the beginning, a little adjustment period. and they won't know what a favor i've done them, at first, but then as everyone's lives go on a little lighter my existence will wane. 

i just have to figure out that adjustment period, make it a little easier for everyone else, and then i can just go on being dead. i never asked for this you know?
