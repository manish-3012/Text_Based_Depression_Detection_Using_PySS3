I've lost my "spark"I've posted on here a couple times before. And each time I wasn't sure what I was looking for. Maybe attention? Someone to talk to or relate to? Not sure. I know this time I guess I just want to vent and have this marked down somewhere.

I don't want to go into detail about every single thing on my mind right now because I doubt anyone wants to read a novel, I will just speak on the result of it; Of how I currently feel. Most of the time my emotions feel absent. And in turn I feel like a waste of space. Some things happened, I made mistakes, I wasn't treated fairly...it all piled up and in the end I think it finally broke me. So that's it, I forfeit. I can't recover from this one. I don't have the passion or drive to do much of anything I love anymore. I can't stop feeling jaded towards certain people and letting go of the past...I'm just broken. I'm too afraid to kill myself and I don't want to hurt anyone who cares for me, so I'm just passively letting it happen I suppose. My main regrets are that I wish I'd helped more people, made better choices, never hurt anyone whether purposely or accidentally. I never got to accomplish my dream...it's all over.
