Failed Attempt - My Gun Miss Fired...I was all alone sitting on a rock at the edge of a cliff. It was the prefect weather outside and the moon was shining. I felt emptiness and nothing Iâ€™ve been taking anderall the past week and rarely ate plus with sleep deprivation I felt no emotions whatsoever. 

I posted yesterday and I decided to reply back to everyone before I went through with pulling the trigger. Reading through the comments at the time I just didnâ€™t even care what any of you had to say. All of you sounded so dumb... not even going to lie. How are you going to beg and miss someone that you donâ€™t even know. I bet if I vented to you guys for couple weeks straight youâ€™d have enough of my shit and leave me on read. Anyway I still replied and I read through everything... why idk I love all youâ¤ï¸

Than I tossed my phone off the cliff and pulled my hand gun from my backpack. I sat there reflecting my life for about an hour than finally when it was dead silent and I just felt all alone consumed in my thoughts I put the metal behind my ear and pulled the trigger. 

This has to be some kind of sick joke... nothing came out I held my stance and just waited for something to happen. Nothing happen... I instantly became so upset and I tossed the gun off the cliff and sat there all night crying....

Eventually I got up and went back home. My parents were about to wake up and I got back just in time and slid into my room. I slept majority of the day feeling a bit better.

I donâ€™t know what to say right now... I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m using one of my old phones currently you guys deserved an update. Iâ€™m working as a intern right now my manger is going to question me tomorrow for not coming in what am I going to say... Fml I have the worst luck but I guess itâ€™s not my time to go yet.
