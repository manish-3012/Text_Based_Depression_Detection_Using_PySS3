What point is there if I can never be happy with my body/selfI am transgender(male to female) and 21 yo, but still pre everything and feel like I will never pass. It takes more than a year to even see a gender specialist(I still have to wait 8 months) and after that even longer to get hormones or surgery, which will be way too expensive for me to even consider. And even then it would take multiple years for hormones to take effect. I hate myself every day, I won't be able be female or even look close to it and I'll always have a label above me of being trans. What is the point of living or trying to. I just want it all to stop so I don't have to suffer all the time. I only think about wanting to get of this rotten ride called life. I have also been depressed for over 5 years, not having any energy to do anything. Just waiting till I have the gut to actually off myself and free myself. I cannot picture myself living on my own and working for more than a year with atleast one or more suicide attempts. Why couldn't I just be born right, why was I even born, I never asked for all of this
