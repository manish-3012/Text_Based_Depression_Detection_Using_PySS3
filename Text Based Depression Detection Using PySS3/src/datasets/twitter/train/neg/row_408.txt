15 and ready to go.Iâ€™m so tired of this all. Every single day, I am laughed at in the streets, put down by my peers and I just feel invisible. I feel meaningless. Just today I overheard some girls talking about how I look â€œanorexicâ€ (Iâ€™m a really skinny guy). Iâ€™ve tried to fix myself Iâ€™ve literally begged my parents to let me lift weights and gain confidence but they believe that it will damage my â€œbonesâ€ and â€œgrowthâ€. Even my brother (who is a fitness geek) has told them not to let me lift or do anything of the sort. Iâ€™m stuck and thereâ€™s only one way out. Iâ€™m tired of being the short (only 5 foot 7) , skinny, invisible, ugly guy but I just know thereâ€™s really no way out. This is really my last try. If anyone has anything, any genuine advice to give me then please just let me know. And just for reference, I resorted to plastic surgery after years of teasing a few years back. The only thing thatâ€™s changed is they just focus on every other flaw now.
