What's the point of living with high functioning aspergers/autism??I just want to preface this post by saying that I have not been officially diagnosed. However, I am very sure that I am a high functioning autist, as my parents, therapist, a psychologist, and I all believe so. I really don't feel like there's much I can do anymore, and I'd prefer to not explain my whole situation right now, but my parents and I can't get along for shit and they basically want me to get out when I'm 18. I've got this huge advantage in life, but I'm not doing a good job of keeping it, and it's expensive, so I think I'm probably gonna lose it and any chance I have of having a happy life. Everyone always says that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but this problem seems pretty fucking permanent; I can't change my brain. I'm not gonna get shit in life aside from what my parents provide me and I know it. I won't keep friends, a job, or anything. I've thought about killing myself had a pseudo plan, and even tried calling a hotline. My parents caught me talking to them and found out who it was and almost took me to a mental hospital (Which will surely make me lose that advantage I was talking about). I'm hanging on by a thread, which is the few people I care about and the slim chance I'll have a successful and happy li.fe life (as well as the lack of opportunity to kill myself without my parents finding out).

If y'all could give me any advice or need further explanation I'll do so until I'm fine or die :T
