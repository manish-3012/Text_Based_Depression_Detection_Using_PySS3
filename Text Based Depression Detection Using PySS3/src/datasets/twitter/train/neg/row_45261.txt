Just AfraidWhenever I post here I'm always afraid that I will be put back in the hospital or that I will hear that they are going to put me back there and I will do something that I will regret once I do hear it. I'm also just afraid of my future . Mostly because I'm useless . I've done nothing with myself and will continue to do nothing with myself . All that I want to do is stop existing but the fear of what happens after to the people around me keeps me from it . Only for so long though . I'll probably give up once I fail this school year . Have so much homework to do this weekend I'm just so fucking afraid of everything .
