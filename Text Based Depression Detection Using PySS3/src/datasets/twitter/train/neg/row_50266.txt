School is making me suicidalI want to sum this up as fast as possible..


I failed my grade last year so I am back in freshmen year. My grades have dropped so low, every class I am failing at. My school doesn't have anything alternative and my mom won't do homeschooling. And I asked my brother (since he sorta raised me) but he will only do what my mom tells him and she says no.

I can't stand to wake up everyday and go to a school where the kids will just judge me and the teachers will complain about my lack of work.

And like a post I read on here, I have never really envisioned my future. I never pictured myself living in my own house, all grown up. 

I just feel like it would be better on my end to call it quits and be done. I feel like completely giving up. I am too weak, I hate myself and don't want to care anymore. 

There is no other option, and I am so scared and I told my mom about my suicidal thoughts and she just says "ASK YOUR BROTHER!" As if that is supposed to help.
