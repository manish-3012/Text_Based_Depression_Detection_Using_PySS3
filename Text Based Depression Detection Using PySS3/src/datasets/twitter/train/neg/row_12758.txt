i'm just losti dropped out of college. my friends are all thriving. my mom doesn't think i'm depressed. i just say in the shower for an hour with some of the worst thoughts i've had in a long time. i wish i could just not BE. i just want to leave. my moms bf is homophobic so i feel like i won't be able to be myself. i want to paint my nails and dress how i want but for some reason i still wanna hold this idea of a perfect kid. im not religious but i asked for a sign to keep going. and i had a text from one of my friends. it's not a lot but it was enough. the text came right when i needed it. i'm going to keep fighting for my friends. the people i care about don't deserve to be put through me killing myself. looking through this community really helps. you guys are so strong and going through much worse than me. if anyone is ever struggling just remember that there's always at least one person that will miss you and be crushed that you're not here.
