I want to ask my dad about it and me expecting the worst answer he feels about me is already making me feel suicidalI want to ask him, if he really despises me, if he wished he'd never had me, if I had ruined his life, if everything is my fault. 

I'm already playing this scenario in my head, that hes yelling at me, saying yes to all of my questions and breaking things in front of me- letting all his real feelings out.

And you know, I want to ask this and face it, so it can inspire me and motivate me to kill myself for real. Because i dont have the guts to do it. 

My mother left me when I was 10, sure, that already makes me feel so unwanted and useless. So if I ask these questions to my dad and he agrees to every bit that I shouldn't had existed, finally, another reason to die. 

These are my deep inner thoughts.

I'm already tearing up as I write this. 

I dont know why I want to die so bad. 

Maybe I cant stand this life.
