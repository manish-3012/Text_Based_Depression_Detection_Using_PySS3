I found a single bullet by sheer chance.I wasnâ€™t looking. Itâ€™s the last thing I would arbitrarily look for. Iâ€™d look for the gun first...

Flashbacks of mental and psychological trauma are flooding like an ocean after an earthquake. 

Iâ€™m compliant with my meds, and Iâ€™ve been outrageously depressed which I can often expect between late June and September. But itâ€™s mid-October and Iâ€™m still down. I even changed meds and was okay for about a week. Probably a placebo effect. 

I left it where I found it, and somewhere know one else will. 

Iâ€™m not someplace where a gun is easily attainable. Not even with a license. But Iâ€™m obsessing over that one single bullet blowing straight through my skull. 

My psychiatrist doesnâ€™t take my insurance anymore, and most people donâ€™t because itâ€™s cheap. 

This is driving me up the walls, and I hate to use my Valium as a crutch. 

Itâ€™s like a voice in my head replaying, â€œ*This is what youâ€™ve been seeking. Peace. Freedom from chronic illness. Freedom.*â€

Fuck.
