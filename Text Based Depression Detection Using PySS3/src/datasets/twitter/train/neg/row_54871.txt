I can't go on anymore...It's like there are weights on my chest. It's like the breath is leaving my lungs forcefully. It's like I'm living in a nightmare coma that I can't wake up from. And no one can help me.

I am on meds (Trintellix, Rexulti, Klonopin, Seroquel) but they don't seem to be helping. I am too chicken to do ECT and no doctors will give me an MAOI.

I don't feel like I can go on anymore. This is just too much. Nothing around me ever feels real. It's all a dream.
