any advice/sources for informing a loved one of suicidal thoughts?I have tried google but everything seems to be about teens telling their parents.  I am 29, and after talking to people here and watching videos, I am about to snap and tell my mother.  She is the only reason I have not killed myself and I am really only wanting to tell her I am in pain on a daily basis.  I want her to know that when I am gone, whether it be via suicide or a lucky break that I am no longer suffering.  However, I am terrified of telling her because I do not know how she will react.  Does anyone know of any sources that would be relevant for an adult talking to their parents about this?  Maybe some advice on how to break the news that I did not go on vacation with the family because I was planning to kill myself but failed.
