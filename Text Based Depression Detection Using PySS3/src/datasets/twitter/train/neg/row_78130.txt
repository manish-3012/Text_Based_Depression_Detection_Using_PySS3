I am doneIâ€™ve always said that once my dog dies, Iâ€™m dying too. Everyone always thought it was a joke but everyone always thinks everything I say is a joke. Two weeks ago I was wishing for a sign to do it as I always do I just wanted to finally end this bullshit life I am living and I shit you not, I am told that day that my dog has bladder cancer and is getting put down the following week. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever cried more in a week in my life. Not when my dad died not when my grandfather died, this is what broke me. I couldnâ€™t stop crying on my birthday last week I sat in bed and sobbed for the entire day until I had no tears left and my chest felt like I was being torn apart. I am pathetic. Itâ€™s a dog. But I think this is the biggest most obvious sign to kill myself Iâ€™ve ever had. Itâ€™s like god literally told me yes end it already you fuck just fucking do it. I am so pathetic. And weak. I mean Iâ€™ve been asking for a sign and now I was given it on a fucking silver platter. I havenâ€™t smiled in 2 weeks. I canâ€™t laugh anymore. I think this is just how it is supposed to end
