I never seriously considered suicide until now.Hey, so, let me tell you my sad story. Basically, I'm a pathetic 23-year-old virgin who still lives with his mom. I want to go out, I want to be an adult, I want to be a man. But I'm not. I'm just a pathetic loser who's meant to stay here and just watch while everyone in life around me is getting jobs, careers, relationships, finding love, having the life I always wanted while I just sit here and rot. These feelings have been swelling in me for a long time. The catalyst was that I was stupid enough to ever think that me and my friend that I loved (who I was "intimate" with in the past) revealed that she now has a boyfriend. An actual man. A man with a job and who doesn't live with his mom. It's my fault for ever thinking someone so weak and pathetic and bottom of the food chain as me could ever have a girl like her. I'm just tired of going on living if this is what life is. I'm tired of the hurt, the feelings of worthlessness, everyone around me moving when I'm just staying still. I actually looked up some methods, but I can't find one that works for me. I thought about chugging some pain killers but I don't think that will do anything. Honestly, if I had a gun, I might just go through with it. Quick and painless.
