I feel worthlessIt may seem little to others but it has been some time Iâ€™ve felt like this. At work Iâ€™m treated like everything I do is stupid and I just canâ€™t get it right or flat out weird to them. My boyfriend acts as if im annoying him and just anything I say he cuts me off and changes subjects so I would stop talking. 

I went to a place where Iâ€™m a regular so I applied to the place, didnâ€™t get the job but just thought Iâ€™d give it a try. The second I come in the girl whom helped me out with info about applying and gave her my resume. She saw me today and kept avoiding making eye contact and was talking loud enough for me to not hear but I did and it just kinda bummed me out that she was being cold to me and talking shit to her coworker. 

Today is the day that I have lost that safe wall between me and the thoughts I didnâ€™t want to think of. I donâ€™t know who to talk to or do because Iâ€™m starting to feel like if I was to do something to end it, it would make it all better. I try to hold on but Iâ€™m just losing it..
