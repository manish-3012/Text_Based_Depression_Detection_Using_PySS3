help?:(iâ€™ve never posted on here before, but :/ maybe you guys can help. everything is fine when iâ€™m with my boyfriend or distracting myself. when i go home, however, there is no motivation to do anything. whether that be clean, work on my craft, go outside, workout, nothing. Iâ€™m just sad and the immense need to kill myself approaches because if i canâ€™t to anything, whatâ€™s the point. idk how to want to be okay/get motivation to do things anymore.
