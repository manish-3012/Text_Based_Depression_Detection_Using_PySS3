Not sure how to move onHello everyone, I've been suffering from depression since April, when a traumatic experience caused me to get extremely depression. The person who caused this incident apologized for causing it, but I still feel extremely bad about myself, and I'm very insecure about my personality. My mind tells me the only way I can move on is to kill myself so I stop harming others. The thing is, everyone I know tells me I'm a great person, but my overthinking and obsessive thought patterns replay bad memories and input false memories in my head to try to make me believe I did something bad that I actually didn't, and magnify the mistakes I've made to make them seem awful. It's then followed by the "I'm a horrible person" thoughts again. It's hard for me to reach out for help too, as I'll get thoughts like this: "No one likes you, no one loves you, and no one wants to help you, you're an awful person and shouldn't even be allowed to live." It's so difficult for me to cope with these thoughts, and I actually did a self harming act about a few weeks ago when these thoughts got so bad that my mom got emotionally scared and my whole family got put on suicide watch for me. Thank you for reading, I hope you have a great day.
