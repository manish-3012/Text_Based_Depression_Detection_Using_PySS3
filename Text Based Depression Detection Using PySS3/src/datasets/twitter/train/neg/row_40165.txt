it hurtsIn a twisted bit of logic I couldnâ€™t live with myself if I caused tremendous pain to those who love me, by killing myself. So I have to stay alive despite the lack of any hope or future until the death of a parent leaves me without a reason to stay alive, homeless. I cry all the time because I have wasted my life and the future a path of surety of pain, and loss until I finally work up the nerve to kill myself. And I know I weep because the reverberations of future horror is strong enough to reach me here. The knowledge that life is over, despite the years that may remain, is torture.
