I hate myself, I am a useless person and just a detriment to this world.I just don't have the will to live anymore. I drag down everyone I care about. I do not have a career going at all. My family, friends, even the woman that I love are all better off without me. With me dead, it will lift the weight off everyone's shoulders. Sure they will be sad for a while, but after that their lives will be better without me, I am sure of it. I am planning on setting a date and writing my goodbye letters. Goodbye cruel world, I get why you hate me.
