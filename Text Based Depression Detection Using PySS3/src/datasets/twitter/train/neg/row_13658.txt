I wrote this for a girl when I was 15. 10 years later, she told me this week it helped to save her life and sent it back to me. I don't know if it will help anyone, but here:In the wood, side by side

Through the dark we softly stride

Her fears she tells me with stories spun

Of what happens here without the sun

But darkness is not the only fear

She had while she was living here:

-

A drunken man with bearded chin

Stumbles over to strike his kin

My friend then watching horrified

Runs to the woods with teary eyes

 -

Now quietly we trudge along

Nervously I hum a song

Then we in a clearing sit

We to talk the pain of it

 -

In that forest her thoughts confide

To me young thoughts of suicide

Of how she tired with razor cold

To end her life and not grow old

 -

Two lives ravaged by another

By one who hurts his wife; a mother

All hope of life, had vanished then

But then one day she laughed again
