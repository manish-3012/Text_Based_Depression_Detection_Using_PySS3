I feel so lonelySome nights I just want to end my life cause I can't bear this loneliness.

I been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia for over three years now. Had my first big psychotic episode at the end of highschool (12th and last grade) caused me to stop going. 

All my somewhat friends from there vanished and I  haven't been able to form a meaningful connection with a person since I was diagnosed
