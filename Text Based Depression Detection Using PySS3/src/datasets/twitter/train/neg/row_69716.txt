some captivating title i dont knowRecently figured out parents are very narcissistic and it took several months away from college (am freshman) and then a week break at their house to see how fucked up I am. First of all, I probably blame all of my 'issues' on my parents when its mostly my fault for using them as blame instead of improving. My mom used to think Im perfect, i have a very high IQ, just the 'perfect child' and I was scared of messing up. She can't process negative emotions, I don't think ive ever felt connected to her, my dad tried to live through me with sports and screamed his head off when i didn't, feel like an extension of them instead of a real person (now they think im lazy because thats what ive showed them, no one believes in me including myself and since I make no effort no one should believe in me), I see all these classmates doing ok, and I'm failing in a shitty college, able to hold complicated russian lit discussions but cant do anything else, so much potential in so many things. Get really paranoid sometimes, feel like in physical pain. Instead of improving, I self loath and cause suffering so I feel 'exempted' since its easier than working on YEARS upon years of shit. Feel so apathetic and self harm ideations are distracting, no value for all human life including mine, (low empathy) feel better off dying. No idea if this'll be read, but ive heard it all just wanted to get this out. Life is so fucking awful, except for a few moments, and those moments cant always make up for the rest. Dont feel connected to anyone, lose friends so quickly I just dont make new ones now, dont want to live anymore. thats it. EDIT: also dont see a future for myself at all idk
