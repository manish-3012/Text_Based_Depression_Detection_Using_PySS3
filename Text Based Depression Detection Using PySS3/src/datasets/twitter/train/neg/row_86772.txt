Don't want to get betterHad depression for a few years and I was trying to get better. But now I don't feel like trying or even that I want to. Friends and family are supportive and have good advice. Paying for therapy, listening to me when I have a bad episode. But recently I have realised that I am not actually doing anything to help myself get better. It's more like I am simply paying lip service to myself and others to convince myself/them that I am going to put in effort. I attended therapy a few times but I didn't really try. Spoke about my low self esteem but when she tried to convince me that I shouldn't have low self worth it doesn't ring true for me. It's the same when other people try. I have people that care about me and want me to feel better about myself but I just can't take it on board.

I think that now I don't even want to feel better. It's become normal now and I'm more comfortable that way. It's easier than trying and I'm not convinced I deserve to feel good anyway with the way I treat others and the selfish thoughts I often have.

I don't want to kill myself because I can't be bothered to. But hopefully I'll die sometime soon. I know a lot of suicidal people say that they don't kill themselves because their family would be heartbroken. But I barely even think about that and I'm not sure I care. I think I'm just a bad and selfish person.
