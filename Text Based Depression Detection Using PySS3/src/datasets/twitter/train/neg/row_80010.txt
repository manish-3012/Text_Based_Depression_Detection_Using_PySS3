I don't know how to deal with me.For about 2 years now, I think of ending my life multiple times a day. The way I think about killing myself varies. I don't know exactly how the thoughts started. Everything I do, I think of how much of a moron I am. I constantly think of how much I hate myself, and how no one loves me. I know that adults with ADHD have a high chance of depression and suicidal thoughts. I want to seek help. But I can't afford a therapist and my insurance won't cover it.
