98% sure im about to do itim looking at my pile of pills that i know probably wont kill me, but i cant think of anything else i should do. i have 2 weeks until my assessment so i can get cbt. if i take the pills and ring for an ambulance they might start taking me seriously but then it feels like a waste of pills... i dont know what to do...
