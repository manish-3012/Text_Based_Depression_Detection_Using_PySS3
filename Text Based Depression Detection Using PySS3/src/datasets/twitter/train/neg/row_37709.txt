Parents who are â€œthere for youâ€ until your mental illness becomes slightly intolerable for them.Sorry my depression isnâ€™t just crying every other day. Sorry that itâ€™s also me isolating myself and keeping conversations short, because I want to kill myself. Sorry I donâ€™t want to be around you guys and be blamed for every small inconvenience or mishap. Sorry that MY depression inconveniences YOU so much and that ME WANTING TO KILL MYSELF makes your plans for the day skewed!
