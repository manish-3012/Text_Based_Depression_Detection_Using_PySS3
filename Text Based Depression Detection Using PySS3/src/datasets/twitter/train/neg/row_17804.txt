I've been happy for a bit of time but other things in life are making me unhappy and stressed to the point where I think suicide is okay.I'm happy, don't get me wrong, actually the happiest I've been in years but..I don't know. Life isn't right in a way and I feel it. My family situation is making it hard to even breathe and I feel like it plays a big part in this confusion I'm in. I can't tell if they're abusive or I'm overreacting. It's complicated and I can't just be open about it otherwise my family will know because my therapist will tell them. The last time it happened it made my life a living hell for being honest and it's making me keep everything I feel in secret due to fear. Kinda feels like I can't be honest and I have no help to understand what's actually going on in my life. I have no answers and it only gets worse by the hour. I just wish I could be less hidden in a sense so I can actually fully be happy without fear. It's dreadful.
