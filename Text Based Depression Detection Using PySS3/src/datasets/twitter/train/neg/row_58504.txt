Shoud i tell my school counselor that i selfharm and that i am suicidal?Hi so i dont really know the dos and donts of what u should say to a counselor. Yes, i cant afford a therapist yet and im still a college student. I just wanna ask if they will let your parents know if i told them that i selfharm and im suicidal? It's okay to tell me what your therapist did when you told them about it. I wanna seek help but i dont know what they will do with that kind of information. Thanks!
