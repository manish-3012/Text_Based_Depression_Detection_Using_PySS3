20 m feeling desperate, I want to die today.I'm struggling whether or not to shoot myself in the face with a taurus 38 revolver. I wonder if anyone in a similar position like me? I  do not go to college, I started working directly in the family business. Basicly my parents hand over me a business with 1 million dollar in debt. I never wanted to manage a business or become a manager that fast. It sucks, everything is crumbling down, I feel trapped. Today am getting sued by former employees, and found out that a trusted employee was stealing. My god what is this shit
