It is truly over for the semi disabledBeing semi disabled with language processing disorder and a physical disability is a death sentence.  The job market is hostile towards the disabled and I can't seek government support because I am not disabled enough. It is absolutely over. Genetics have screw me over and there is no hope left. Fuck capitalism for profits over empathy!
