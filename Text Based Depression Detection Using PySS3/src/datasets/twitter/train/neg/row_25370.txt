Hopeless &amp; LostGrowing up I was always put down by others (family members, friends, anyone.) I had a shitty self-esteem growing up. Ended up developing bulimia, being a mean person, selfish, hanging out with the wrong crowd, started drinking heavily at age 14 and ruining relationships around me. I honestly felt like an addict. Fast forward to today (recovered from bulimia) one of my shittiest mistakes is coming back to haunt me. I'll never forgive myself for that mistake. It's hurt someone who I am extremely close with now. I had to tell them before we took the next steps. I'm scared I will lose them forever. I just want to die tbh. I lost the best thing that's ever happened to me. Do I deserve to die for cheating? I want to take all their pain away. That person 9 years ago isn't the person I am today. My shitty self-esteem is coming back as well. I don't think I deserve to be happy again. I want to disappear.
