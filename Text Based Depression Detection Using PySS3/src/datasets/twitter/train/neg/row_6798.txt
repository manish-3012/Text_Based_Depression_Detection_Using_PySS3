Any adviceFirst of all sorry for my english, i'm german. 
I don't know were to start. I have a lot of problems, but i don't want to bother you all with that.  The worst thing is, that theres nobody i can talk to. I do have a girlfriend, but she only tells me to stop talking about that, as i will never commit suicid. I asked her, whether she can come visiting me, but she can't. 
I tried a lot of things to get that idea out of my mind, but it did not work. i would be glad for any advice now. Maybe things that helped you out. it gets worse and worse every minute. i do even have a plan how to do it, and everything i need for that. I can not go to any therapie here as we now live with this corona thing. 

Thanks for anything you can tell me.
