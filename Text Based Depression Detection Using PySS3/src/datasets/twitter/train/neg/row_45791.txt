17 here I'm fucking done with everything.Well throwaway so my brother doesnt see this and try to intervene. But I've decided that I'm done with life. and I've come to such a point to the thought of death isn't even scary, but more of a comforting reality. I have no more tears to shed and no more prayers to give. I dropped out of highschool, and was working on my ged, but I'm cramped up in my house all day and there is so much arguing that i can't stand it any longer. I'm overweight and can't convince my mother to buy healthier things. I've looked for work everywhere but no one will hire me. no girlfriend. I'm always put on the back burner when it comes to my needs. I'm always lowest priority. I've been sitting in my dark room all day trying to decide which way to go. I want it to be painless. If God sends me to hell then it will just be a sacrifice I will have to make. I know I could of done a lot. I have a lot of love to give, but I am constantly made to feel like dirt. my older brother doesn't like to do anything outside of the house with me. he claims because he doesn't have the time but i know its  because he's ashamed to be see  in public with me. I'm just so done it's not even funny. I'm ready to go, I have don't fear death any longer. I don't expect this to get much attention, but just know you've tried to help but some things just can't be fixed. you r/suicide watch have been more caring than my own family and i thank you for this. For those who believe in God, may he watch over you. For those who don't believe in God I wish you all of the happiness and well being in the world. Thank you. I truly love you all.
