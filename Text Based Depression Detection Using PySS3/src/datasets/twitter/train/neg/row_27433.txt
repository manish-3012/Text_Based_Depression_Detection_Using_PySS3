Mentally and Physically ExhaustedI'm so tired of dealing with depression and low self-esteem. Lately, my body has been tired 24/7. It's never been like this before. My mind is a mess. I'm tired of failing **all the time**. I have no one in my life for support. I am not strong enough. I'm afraid to die, but I don't want to live a life of failure or mediocrity.


I have about a month until i turn 25. I don't want to make it there.
