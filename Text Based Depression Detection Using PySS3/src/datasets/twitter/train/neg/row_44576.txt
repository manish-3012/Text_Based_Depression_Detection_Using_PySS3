I often write poems to express myselfHey, I wanted to share with you a poem that I wrote, I do it often when I feel lonely, I donâ€™t consider myself good, English isnâ€™t even my native tongue, but whatever makes you feel better, am I right? 
Iâ€™m having trouble sleeping, a lot troubling my mind, this is me venting.

â€œ

I sit in my room and look for a key 
One that you, canâ€™t probably see
A key that closes the door shut on me 
A door that when shut might set me free 

But I keep thinking about what will I miss 
Maybe the future is filled with much bliss
Maybe tomorrow will greet me with a kiss
But as time goes by, I stop believing this 

I leave the door open another day 
I still believe thereâ€™s another way 
Ignore the keys and maybe stay 
In the end, I might even be okay
