Just posting here for attentionI'm a nice person. Not ugly. Average IQ. Creative. Plenty of reasons to carry on living unabated. I don't get stressed out. I don't lash out. 

I don't feel like sharing my suicidal thoughts with anyone. Not even now in this post. Should I talk to someone IRL? Then I'll just be spreading my depression everywhere like a plague. 

I hate that this is a 'cry for attention'. I hate that eating makes me temporarily happy, then regretful. I don't work out enough. I'm so far behind my peers in education it's pathetic. I hate that I'm the ugliest offspring of my parents, &amp; the most intelligent, but I only tell myself that to reinforce a deteriorating sense of self-worth. I hate that I'm almost 'convincing' myself to be depressed now. 

I don't want to go to work another day. But I can't quit. If I quit I'd have to quit at life, I'd rather be bereaved with sympathy, than Live with a visage of failure. I guess I'm looking for escape. 

So now this past week throughtout my days I inspect ceiling adjunctions. "Would this support my weight?" Haven't bought rope yet. Probably will soon. Don't know how to tie a noose but google does. OoOoOo look how daunting my words are, whatwith suicidal ideas
