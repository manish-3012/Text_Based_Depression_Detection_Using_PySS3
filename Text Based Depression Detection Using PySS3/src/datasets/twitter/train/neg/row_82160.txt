Lost it all....Lost pretty much everything and I've been seriously contemplating ending it, even though things are starting to turn around it just overwhelms me and I can't shake it. It affects me everyday throughout the day. I have the means to end it and these past couple of weeks it's getting harder and harder to find a reason not too....
