I almost killed myselfI feel like I have no purpose. I'm always that one dumbass that fucks everything up and ruins everyone's time. I cant be social without substances. I dont know what I'm going to do with my life after high school. I cant seem to find someone to love, but for all my friends it's so easy. I can never fully integrate into a social circle even though I want to. My grandparents have both passed away within the past year and I have very little family left. I cant find joy in anything. Last night I took 2 tabs of acid, smoked a little bit of weed and drank a lot. I acted like such a dumbass and got mad at everyone. I nearly jumped in front of a truck moving down the road. My friends had to drive me home while everyone went back to the party. It's so fucking easy for everyone else. I wish I could just be blue pilled live a life of blissful ignorance. Suicide is seeming like so much more of an option but I know I'll never do it because I'm such a pussy.
