I think I've decided to kill myselfI have an autoimmune disease (Lupus) and watching myself quickly lose the ability to engage in my favorite hobbies is killing me inside. I am tired all the time, lately I haven't been eating, and I have no more help. I can't afford to live in the city I live in and I feel like I have ran out of options. I quit my job for another one, but they aren't giving me the hours I was promised so I am running out of money. I do not know how I want to kill myself so I have just stopped taking my medications in hopes that that will cause me to pass.
