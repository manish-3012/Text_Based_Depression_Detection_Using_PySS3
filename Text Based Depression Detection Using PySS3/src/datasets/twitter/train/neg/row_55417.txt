Depression and anxiety have returned and it's too much this timeMy mind is constantly thinking of new intrusive thoughts. I've been feeling this way since saturday. I'm on meds since early last year but it's like they suddenly stopped working. I now feel like before I took them. I have a very intensive job and it's hell trying to keep up this facade. It's like my entire life changed this weekend. I went from OK to longing for death. This ain't normal. It's like I feel anxiety 24/7. 

It's so bad that I am already thinking about just driving my car into a nearby river so I drown to death.
