Help me pleaseI need help. I acknowledge that, i just needed somewhere where i could rant knowing people will read it u know. I dont want to go to my friends they have had to deal with it too much for too long. I dont know. I dont even know what i want to rant about specifically. But all i know is that i am struggling to keep my head above the water. And life is just becoming too overwhelming for me. I just feel really shit, and i want help. I dont want to hurt this way anymore. I hate it. Please. I domt know what to do anymore.
