Took a large amount of trazodone and amitriptylineI just took a large amount of both of these medications.  I've been going through a ton of difficult shit and in the last 6 months I've lost my wife, my two dogs, my home, my career, and many of my friends.  I've still got family and friends who love and care about me but the pain of loss is unbearable at times.  The divorce is difficult, I'm struggling financially and can't afford a lawyer and am dealing with her wanting everything I have.  While we were together I was making 62k a year, now I'm lucky if I'll pull in 20k.  I feel alone, I feel like an awful human being, I feel unwanted, and I am tired of feeling hurt.  I want the pain to stop, I want to feel normal again.  

I don't know what I want from /r/suicidewatch.  Maybe to post here and stay awake while the medicine does it's thing through my system. I dont' know what I want, I just don't want to be here anymore.
