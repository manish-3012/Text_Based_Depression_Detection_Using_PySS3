Little help for the runt/failure of the family.Hi I'm a 18 year old soon to be 19 year college student working to finish his first year of college before he gets shipped off to Basic Training for the Army. I am 5'8" and weigh only 120 pounds. I come from a very messed up family where everyone hates each other for one reason or another. My mom, bless her soul, tries to shield me from it as much as she can but it still gets to me. 

For nearly 4 years now I have been thinking about suicide in its very different forms. Jumping off a building seems to be the favorite topic of my dreams since it involves some sort of fall from a building in all of them. I have never seriously tried to commit suicide that I know of. I have had days go by sometimes that I can't even remember clearly. THIS IS SO HARD TO TYPE RIGHT NOW. I've probably tried to kill myself during one of those days. The one day i suspect the most is after I lost my dog Bailey. I had never so DEAD before. It was like if i lost a brother. The damn dog had to come to me didn't he. why the fuck did he come to me. 

I'm posting in here because I need help but i don't want it. I don't know what to do with my life right now. So much is going on right now that I am going crazy. I am socially inept, look like a twig and have been called a genius even through I'm just another stupid guy joining the army. I can't sleep, think I have developed a form of insomnia from being so depressed half the time. The worst part is I can't stop myself from wanting/helping other people with their problems even though I can't even get control of my own. 

Sorry if this is really long. I just needed to get this out there somehow somewhere and being that reddit seems to have the same soft and kind hearts like have been described about my own, this was the best place to do it.
