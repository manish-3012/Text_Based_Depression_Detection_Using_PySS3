I don't want to kill myself, but I don't see the big deal about life.I've been depressed for half my life, and I have been suicidal, and I've made several attempts in the past. In the past year, my life has improved considerably and for a long time, I felt really, really good. But even when I felt good, when I thought to myself, "Wow, aren't you glad you never succeeded in killing yourself?" And the answer was No. I'm indifferent to my life, even when I'm happy, even when it's good. I think I would have preferred to die a while ago. Everything is such a burden, or just not worth it.. I know that my thought processes are harmful. I just can't imagine anything else. I can't imagine that all the positive thinking in the world will change who I am and how I think.

Now, for other reasons, I feel terrible. My life is still good, I'm still on medication, still in therapy, and I still don't want to kill myself, but I'm just thinking, what if my life is just points on a spectrum of wanting to die, where the highest is taking a fistful of pills and the lowest is Not actively trying to kill myself, but don't think I'd object to a bus hitting me and killing tomorrow?
