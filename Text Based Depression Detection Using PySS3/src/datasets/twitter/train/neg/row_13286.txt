i met myself under the waterwhenever i think of killing myself, the notion of doing it in a merciful way is always the one thing i try to avoid.
i guess iâ€™ve always thought punishment is what i deserve. and sometimes i sit and ask myself what it is iâ€™m punishing myself for, and i realize...
i realize that i need to punish myself for everything. who i am. what my existence does and has done to the people around me. 
so drowning always came to mind. 
i mean ... i fear the ocean, so isnâ€™t that the perfect place?
isnâ€™t it perfect to make sure that i suffer? 
thatâ€™s all i think i deserve by this point.

and still... iâ€™m wondering.
i donâ€™t know how to kill myself.
i canâ€™t make myself settle on what to do.
but i guess all i know is that iâ€™ll do it.
iâ€™ll kill myself, and thatâ€™ll be it.

i turn 18 in three weeks.
but i know i donâ€™t deserve to see that day.
i donâ€™t deserve to get to that age.
18 means freedom in so many ways, but i donâ€™t deserve that.
i donâ€™t deserve the chance.
all being who i am will do is cause more shame and resentment and disgust and anger...
all i ever wanted to do was make other people happy and being me ruins that entire notion...
it ruins all that iâ€™ve ever taught myself to be proud of.

i am a mistake. i guess my only purpose is to be erased.

i donâ€™t know that authenticity means anything when i, myself, am worthless.



i donâ€™t know why i made this post, or if anyone else understands any of this... but this is what i had to say i guess...
i never really did make much sense to anyone else.
