I want to die. Please give me a reason not to do it.So Iâ€™ve struggled with depression for a while but tonight is the first time Iâ€™ve seriously considered ending it all. I was in a ~five-year relationship with the most amazing man in the world. He was my best friend and gave me so much joy. He ended it for good a few months ago. Weâ€™d broken up and gotten back together in the past so I had hoped we still had a chance. It was this hope that got me through the past few months. Tonight I texted him and he told me he has no desire to talk to me or see me. I have no idea why. I miss him so much, especially our conversations, and I donâ€™t think life is worth living without him. Iâ€™m so desperately lonely, but trying to date other people is somehow worse. Every other man Iâ€™ve met pales in comparison to him. I truly donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever meet someone who is half of the man he is. He was the sunshine in my life and without him I feel like Iâ€™m drowning. I wake up every day, remember he doesnâ€™t want me, and want to go back to that state of unconsciousness. When Iâ€™m not crying I am like an emotionless zombie. I have isolated myself from friends, as theyâ€™re all tired of hearing about my ex. Iâ€™m still going through the motions of going to work so I can pay my bills and keep my cat alive, but I genuinely donâ€™t think anyone would miss me if I disappeared from the world entirely. Work would replace me. Not close with family. Only distant friends. Life is only pain without him. Please give me another reason to live.
