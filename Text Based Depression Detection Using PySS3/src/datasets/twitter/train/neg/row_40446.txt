Am so utterly suicidal but Iâ€™m so terrified I wonâ€™t succeed at it this time. I canâ€™t take another failed attempt. Feel like Iâ€™ve been living a half life ever since.Last time was in a coma for 3 days after an overdose on pills from the doc. They didnâ€™t think I was gonna make it but I pulled through. Everyone keeps telling me itâ€™s for a reason but every since then I just donâ€™t feel right. I feel off. Like I never fully came back. Idk I feel like Iâ€™m living a half life on borrowed time
