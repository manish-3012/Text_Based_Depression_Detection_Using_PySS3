no easy ways outi don't have pills 


nor a firearm


its the 4th so no public things like buildings/bridges bc families


I'm too scared to cut myself and bleed out


theres some isopropyl alcohol but its my roommates, not mine


plus it sounds like thats not super effective


I've got rope

 
but the hanging thing seems hard too


and i can't tie a knot for shit


i like the idea of just disappearing into thin air


but i haven't quite figured that one out


so i think for tonight ill be safe. 


there's no easy way out. 


maybe one day ill finally build up the courage. 



sleep tight reddit.
