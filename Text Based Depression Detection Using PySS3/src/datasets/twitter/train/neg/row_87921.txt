Why do I have to suffer from the things that which is not my fault?I feel like I'm stuck in an endless loop of pain. When I feel like I'm making some progress, something bad happens and I find myself sinking again. This started to be really annoying and these thoughts doesn't let me to have a normal day. I ask myself "why I'm doing that, I'll kill myself anyway" when I'm studying or something. The only minutes that I'm happy in a day was just before sleeping. Because I could think about a happy future and getting relaxed. Now, I can't even do that because I feel like those dreams are just dreams. They are unattainable, I'll never be able to make them come true and I'll kill myself. This just hurts. I'm not even sleeping peacefully for a while. I always wake up from nightmares and fall asleep because of tiredness when the sun is rising. All of these are so tiring.
If these all were my fault, it would hurt less. But being born this way hurts a lot more because it's just not your fault. Like, you did nothing to deserve all of the pain but you keep suffering, because of what? I'm tired of thinking about these, and sometimes, killing myself seems to be only way to end this loop.
