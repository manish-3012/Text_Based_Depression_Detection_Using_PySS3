I've lost everythingThis last month has been an avalanche of bad news. I left my seasonal job and most of my friends were there. I found out that I can't afford to finish college so I lost the rest of my friends and the last three years feel like such a waste of time. I haven't spoken to my family in weeks and we weren't even on speaking terms when we last spoke. My girlfriend just broke up with me because I can't show her that I care about her. Now I have no friends, no job, no family, no money, and no motivation to keep on going.
