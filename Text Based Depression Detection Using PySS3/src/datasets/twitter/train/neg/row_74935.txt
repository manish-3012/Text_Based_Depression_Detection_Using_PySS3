So...this is it.Ive been suffering for a looooooooong time now and today has tipped me over the edge, I just wanted people to know that I was a nice person, I love and care for all the people I've been in contact with and my heart was always filled with compassion. All i have ever wanted to do is help people and be happy but unfortunately that is not meant to be.
So tonight I'm going to do it...and I just wanted to say I am sorry.
Josh I love you, Mum please stop drinking, to my uni friends, youre all amazing and special! to olivia, dont be like me, you have so much more to give! To grace.C....you were my first girl crush haha! chloe, im sorry for putting you through shit,

And to everyone...I am so sorry that I am selfish enough to do this but  I feel so lonely even with friends, i have things i cant tell anyone, i hate myself and the way I look. I'm sorry for what I'm about to do and the people I am about to hurt.

I love you all.
