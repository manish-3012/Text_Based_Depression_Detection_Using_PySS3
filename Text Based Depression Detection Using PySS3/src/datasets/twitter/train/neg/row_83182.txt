this is the only place i can truly ventSo, I posted on here a week ago about commiting suicide in 6 months. 

I imagine for normal people, losing a significant other doesn't make them suicidal. But I was suicidal before, and now its 10x worse.

They were my best friend for years. First person I opened up to since i was a child.

I am alone. It's near impossible for me to connect with others.

it's not even so much that i have no interest in being alive, or wanting to do things. I do. But I cannot get myself to do it. My brain is completely fucked and I end up staring at the wall for hours. 

THIS is what makes me truly suicidal. i am such a failure. I can't do the things I want to do, no matter how hard i try. Its a horrible feeling.

Anyway, I've made a list of things I need to do before I kill myself.

# 1 being paying off my debt, 3k, not that bad. 

That's all i have so far...... not sure what i want to do. I guess I could lose my virginity, but I am celibate now. And have only felt sexually attracted to my ex boyfriend. 

I want to get a tattoo.

I want to cover songs on the piano/sing. Post it on youtube. What do I have to lost at this point.

I bought a wig recently so I can do cam shows to make money, but not give away my identity. I'm good with makeup so i can  manipulate the way I look. And colored contacts.

I want to go to cedar point and ride all of the rollercoasters again.

I want to go swimming. I haven't gone swimming since i was in middle school. 

I hope i can become fluent in one of my target languages. but i doubt it.

I want to go see the ocean for the first time.
