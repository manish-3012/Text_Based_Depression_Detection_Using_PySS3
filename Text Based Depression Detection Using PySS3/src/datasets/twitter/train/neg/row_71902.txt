It just feels inevitableRight now, in this moment, I donâ€™t want to die. I donâ€™t want to hurt myself. Iâ€™m just past the 6-year mark since I attempted. But in those 6 years, I feel like nothingâ€™s changed. I feel more stuck than ever. 

For the last few weeks itâ€™s been so hard not to feel like everything is not quite real. Itâ€™s just this constant anxiety of not knowing what the fuck Iâ€™m working towards or living for.

I canâ€™t imagine a life where I never consider suicide again. Even when Iâ€™ve been content or happy there are always moments where part of me just says â€˜end itâ€™. And especially now, looking back and trying to look forward... Iâ€™m long past the point I thought Iâ€™d be dead. And itâ€™s still so hard to imagine a future.

I donâ€™t feel worth the time and resources I cost my friends, my family, my world. I feel like the longer I stay here the more Iâ€™m taking from them when I eventually canâ€™t stay here any longer. 

I feel so broken, it just feels inevitable that Iâ€™ll hit a point where I canâ€™t keep convincing myself to live. Itâ€™s exhausting having to constantly convince myself to live. I just want to stop. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone and I know I would by leaving, but it just feels like the longer I stay the more people Iâ€™ll hurt eventually.
