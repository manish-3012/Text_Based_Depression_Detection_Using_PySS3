Scared and running out of optionsI've made a few posts on here and stuff 
but I still kind of want to die and I'm really struggling with dealing with my depression. I've been seeing a school counsellor everyday which has helped but I'm so weak and shitty ive barely been even going to class when I get to school. I'm behind on work, Ive got piled up tests that are really important for all my classes and assignments overdue.

I just always feel so down and depressed, I'm going to see the counsellor again tomorrow but if it doesn't go well, or if something doesn't change I cannot and I mean cannot keep going like this

I'm really running out of options and Ivr really been seriously thinking about suicide for awhile now.

I need advice guys anything, please I'm really scared.
