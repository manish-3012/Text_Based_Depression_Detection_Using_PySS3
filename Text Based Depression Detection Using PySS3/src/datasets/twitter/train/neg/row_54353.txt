Just a postI really didnâ€™t want to post and seem like I was seeking attention. Honestly I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting right now. I guess maybe I just want to share how I feel. I feel alone really flipping alone. Most of my life was never the most popular person. Until these past couple years where I became the party/rager frat bro that everyone loved. Just a few months later and man am I fuckin alone. My ex couldnâ€™t give a single fuck about me, the broâ€™s are all too caught up in their relationships to do much else. Hell even my closest friend, sheâ€™s seriously beautiful and seriously one of a kind is just that just my friend. When I was at the top before I guess I never really saw it coming back down, I was almost sleeping with 6 girls a week at one point. But none of that mattered then and none of that matters now because hey Iâ€™m here on winter break in my bathroom on my shower floor drinking and crying because I just feel so fucking alone. Iâ€™m sorry for the drunk rant I honestly donâ€™t know what else to do at this point I guess. I just want to be happy again.
