Tired of all the health problems.I'm a 240 lb, 5'6", 35 year old woman with MS, recurring cushings disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes due to the Cushings disease. I recently talked with my doctor about weight loss surgery, but she told me all of the weight would come back because of the Cushings. I've started cutting and clawing at my body because I am so angry at it, how could it do this to me? I'm tired of being laughed at, I'm tired of men mooing or oinking at me when I go out (this actually happened today, a group of guys did it from their vehicle), it happens very frequently;almost every time I go out; so I rarely leave my home anymore. I have a 5 year old son and I'm ashamed when I pick him up from school because I know I embarrass him.  I live in an area that is predominantly white, wealthy and thin. I stand out like a sore thumb. It doesn't help I have to walk with a cane. I've been contemplating suicide and fantasizing about it so much lately. I used to say that my son was the one keeping me alive, I need to live for him but now I feel like he would be better off without me. I have a somewhat large life insurance policy on myself that he would get if I died, and my insurance policy would pay out if I killed myself since it has been 2 years. I'm scared, I don't want to die but I'm so tired of my health problems. I don't know what to do anymore. My husband tells me to ignore the people that make fun of my weight, but it still hurts so bad. I'm not like him, I can't just brush away those nasty comments like he can. I wish I was never born.
