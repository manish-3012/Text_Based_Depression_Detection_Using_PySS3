I've lost all interest in being.I have survived this long for a couple of reasons: one, because I have such a great network of family and friends who love me and want to see me get through all of this, and 2, because I know I have a great mind and that I could actually be an asset to someone somewhere.

I'm almost done with this awful STEM degree that will open up so many doors to me, and that should excite me, to see some change. To be able to walk around on my own feet and see things I've never seen, to be able to give back to all of those who I owe everything.

Instead the only thing I feel is ennui. I don't care about software. I used to have passion. It's all gone. I have nothing to look forward to. I can't even bring myself to fake a little enthusiasm when my parents call to check on me.

I still don't have a plan, but sometimes I think about how miserable and average I am and can't keep from crying. To be released from all of this would be so nice. It just doesn't feel like I'll ever be happy again. I just want to send out a final message thanking everyone and go to sleep for the last time.

It's supposed to get better... but it isn't. I'm still waiting. Something will happen now and then that seems like it will lead to happiness, but thus far it's all been nothing but frigid disappointment. To protect myself from more hurt, I find myself assuming that it will be.

I need something. Or someone. I don't know where to find it. I'm running out of the energy to search for it.
