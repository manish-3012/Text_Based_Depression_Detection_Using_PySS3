I've lasted this long, but I can't last much longerIt's 11:27 pm here and laying in bed crying. This has been my schedule for the past month. Every night, without fail, I'll cry myself to sleep. Sometimes it's because I put myself down in my thoughts, sometimes it's just because I've let myself spiral down to this point. The only night this past month I didn't was the 24th of September, and that's because that night I got released from the mental hospital. I honestly don't think I'm going to make it through the week and I both hate and love that thought.
