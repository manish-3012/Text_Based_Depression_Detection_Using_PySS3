I want this to endI have been clinically depressed for round about 18 years, every day hating myself and sabotaging everyone and thing I cared about. It's turned into that sort of just monkey on your back whispering sweet terrible nothings in my ear at this piint.
 But I've had about 6 hours sleep between 4 days?  When I try to sleep I have terrible horrifying nightmares that wake me up in only after like an hour or so and then keep me awake for fear of going through the dream feeling of literal death. As I write this I am drinking an entire bottle of whiskey in an attempt to pass out and not dream and sleep because I know my body desperately needs it, and I am still dreading it with everything I have.
It's all getting so so much worse and I don't know what to do
