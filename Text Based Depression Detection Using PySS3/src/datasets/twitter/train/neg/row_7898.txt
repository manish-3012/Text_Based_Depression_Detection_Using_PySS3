Why did I have to be born?Why could I just not never exist? Why did my parents have to get me out here? Why do people stop me from killing myself?

I have tried a bunch of times now. I will change the method to a more expensive and hopefully more reliable one. I hope to do it this week. I hope not to fail and not to chicken out. I promised to say goodbye to one person I hope I don't destroy. I don't want to not fulfill this promise - I would have wanted to have this opportunity. I doubt they'll just forget me if I disappear. I hope they don't stop me.

I don't want to be helped. If you want more context on me, look up my post history.
