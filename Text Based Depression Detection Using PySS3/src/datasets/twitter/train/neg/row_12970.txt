just want to ventim not looking for any responses, i just wanted to say this somewhere where it wouldnt get the police called on me. i cant afford the hospital bills. i halfheartedly tried to die yesterday. needless to say it was highly ineffectual. then my ex came over, my friend found my sister on fb and told her and she came over, my roommate took all the things i was trying to use. i know i have a support network, and im lucky to have the people around me that i do. im on medications, im not as depressed as i used to be, im in no particular agony except heartache over a guy who was at least 50% sociopath and got mad at me for saying i loved him. its not like im not a bit of a sociopath myself, but i guess i was wrong in thinking we could be happy little sociopaths together. but im just so bored with this life. all this trouble for what? supposedly there are great and amazing things in the future but i dont really care. i just want to keep trying until i finally die a nice painless death. then i can stop worrying about work and money and love and sociopaths. 

i probably wont kill myself. ill probably get over this in a few days and life will go on as usual. i just wish i could rest.
