I need a bucket listIâ€™ve already decided to kill myself ASAP. Youâ€™re not talking me out of it. Iâ€™m a loser and no matter what I do, no matter what I try, no matter how much I want it, I donâ€™t get better. It gets to the point where, when I tell people that I fail, they assume Iâ€™m saying â€œI violated the laws of physics!â€ Fucking idiots.

But the chance probably wonâ€™t come until I leave for college. There is a chance, I suppose, if for example thereâ€™s a school shooting, but not much else can really happen now. Me dying before college is out of my control. So I have some time for a bucket list.

Before pitching ideas, I have some things to specify: Iâ€™m worthless and unlovable. Sex will not ever happen with me, and not of my own choice. Nobody would want this. Just think of the golden rule-Iâ€™m unlovable-before pitching an idea.

Something like â€œEating Malaysian Foodâ€ or â€œGame for 24 hours straightâ€ is perfectly fine, because I donâ€™t need someone to love me to do those things.

Thanks in advance.
