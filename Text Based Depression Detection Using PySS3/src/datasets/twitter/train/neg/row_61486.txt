Trans girl stuck in a Muslim CountryHi, my name is Aliyah, and I'm transgender MtF. I've lived in Colorado for most of my life, but when I lost my father and was forced to live with my abusive mother I tried to kill myself. Then I moved in with my brother whom I love dearly. The problem is that is very misogynistic and transphobic. He doesn't know that I am trans, but at one point he was frustrated with my sensitive emotions and condescendingly asked my with much anger if I had any balls and if I'd rather be a woman. That was almost a year ago and I'm only 17 and I haven't made any steps towards my transition (like taking hormones or anything). Later in the week I tried to kill myself with more effort. I took a lethal overdose of his anti-depressants (Wellbutrin Bupropion (Not recommended; very scary hallucinations)). I ended up going to a mental hospital again. And now I have to live with my older sister and her husband in Abu Dhabi. I feel so isolated here. I haven't really talked to anyone under 35 for half a year. There's no one to talk to about my problems because if I told my strictly Islamic family I'd probably get killed (&lt;-- exaggeration). I don't like it here, I just want to die and I miss my old life even though I hated it. I've been crying almost every other night this month and I can't take it anymore.
