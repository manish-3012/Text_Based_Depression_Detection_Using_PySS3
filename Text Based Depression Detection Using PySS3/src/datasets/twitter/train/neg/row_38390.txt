I'm not me anymoreI've lost friends, family barely speak to me anymore, I owe money - my life is a mess and I don't think I can go on anymore. 

Times when I try and stay positive or get things back on track I get knocked again and I don't want this life, I want a happy fun filled life but I don't know what it is that I am doing and I feel like I'm giving up, I don't have the energy to fight anymore.
