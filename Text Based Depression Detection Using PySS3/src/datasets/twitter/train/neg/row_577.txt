Unsure about lifeWell I'm about to tell people something I haven't told many or any if I recall. I'm 25 and about 5 years ago I lost my cousin to suicide but before that I had made an unsuccessful attempt myself. But ..... It ended up worse for me cause as the days went by my guilt of surviving my attempt amplified. Part of it i think I was told the way I was grieing was wrong
(Not crying ) I'm not sure anymore how much longer I can live with my supposed guilt. I feel like if I had died he would have 
gotten the help he needed. It gets worse on the day it happened. But part of me knows when I die it will be by suicide.
