Iâ€™m not living.Iâ€™m not even living anymore, I donâ€™t even live my life anymore; Iâ€™m just kind of drifting through existence. Iâ€™ve come to realize Iâ€™m not a very happy person, not at all anymore. It really has all just started to lose meaning recently, if Iâ€™m going to be blunt. I have constant suicidal thoughts pent up in my head. However, at the same time, I donâ€™t want to die. I donâ€™t want to die, I really donâ€™t, but sometimes it just feels like itâ€™s not even worth it, I donâ€™t feel alive anymore. I hate mostly everything that encompasses my life, this is pretty selfish because I donâ€™t actually have it too bad off. I mean, some people literally have one meal a day, yet I still feel so much more sorrowful compared to them. Iâ€™m not living, Iâ€™m just existing. I really am losing touch with myself, I donâ€™t really know what to do anymore. How to hide away these emotions that constantly clog my brain on a daily basis. I donâ€™t want to be awake, but then I also donâ€™t want to be asleep constantly. I donâ€™t want to be around people, but I also am fearful of being alone. I just canâ€™t decide anymore, I really donâ€™t know who I am anymore. I want to stop existing, but then Iâ€™d have to die in order to do that, and I donâ€™t really want to do that either.
