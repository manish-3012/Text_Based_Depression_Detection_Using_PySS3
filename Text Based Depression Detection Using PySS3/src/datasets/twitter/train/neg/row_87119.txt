Fiance of one month told me she needed to be apart for a couple weeks.We just signed a lease, got moved in, and pretty much the first day we were settling in she told me she was unhappy with my job and financial status. We moved to a new city, i just started working at a new restaurant(while I'm looking for a better job). I used most of my resources on the move, and she's at the apartment with my dog and all of my stuff. I told her that i didnt think healthy couples took breaks and she told me our relationship isn't healthy. I'm blown away by how cold she is being right now. I'm currently holed up in a shitty motel living out of a duffel bag. I'm supposed to be focusing on my new job, settling into a new city, and finding a new career. The move was so stressful and this situatin just hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm having trouble finding any reason why I shouldnt commit suicide besides my families feelings. I dont want to suffer just for the sake of my family. I have no where to turn, I'm living on credit cards right now, and i just feel so fucked over. I can't believe I'm in this situation less than a month into our engagment. I'm good to her, and try my best. We moved the area where she got her new job. She's going to be paid well, i won't make enough to make ends meet, she told me she would help support me before the move.

I tried calling her today but she wasnt sympathetic. Basically she threatened to break up with me if i continued to contact her. The problem is, I'm paying out of my ass for a hotel room on top of rent. I start my new job this Wednesday and i just cant deal with the uncertainty. I would never do this to her, and i supported her through school. I'm not perfect but we have a healthy relationship for the most part. Her job, the move, and our wedding might be getting to her, but i dont think she's being fair to me.


I'm really at a loss, and i literally feel like junping off a bridge.
