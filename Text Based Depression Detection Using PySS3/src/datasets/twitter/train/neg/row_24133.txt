Need advice/thoughts on my situationHi, Iâ€™m 19 years old. Thank you if you read this. Couple weeks ago I had a turning point in my life. I crashed. I lost it all, I lost my car of course, I lost my mom, I lost my job, the love of my life, my life, my will to keep going. Little summary about me; Iâ€™ve always worked very hard for things Iâ€™ve wanted. I almost went pro in soccer back in 2016. I got invited to run for the US in Australia last year, I got invited to the Olympic Trials in May this year. You can tell I could do anything if my mindset is good. I never thought this turning point in my life would come, I wasnâ€™t ready. Itâ€™s been like 8 weeks, I havenâ€™t done much since. I tried to take my life over 4 times, itâ€™s very painful seeing all your blessings crumble all at once after working so hard for them. My only job recently was making music. I was making money off it. It was going well, saw a light for me again and then my laptop got stolen. Another set back that made me think about destroying myself. I literally donâ€™t have anything anymore. I live with my step dad but me and him donâ€™t get along well. Iâ€™m not really wanted here. I want to go out and make shit happen for myself. I have so much potential but itâ€™s almost if I canâ€™t by being here in this house. Itâ€™s very depressing. If I couldâ€™ve kept making music I wouldâ€™ve been out in my own place by next year but itâ€™s all gone now. Any thoughts are welcome, I really want to hear opinions
