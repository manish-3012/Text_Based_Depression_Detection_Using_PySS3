I fucking hate myself.With everything I do, every word I speak, every thought I have, I grow to hate myself more and more. I have always been taught that in order to be happy I must love myself, but I just don't know how. I understand I can only be who I am, and since I am stuck with it forever I "may as well" learn to embrace it, but this is seemingly impossible for me to do. I do not want to be alive any longer, I am so sicking of going about my life, acting normal, while absolutely hating it, and myself. If I can't be happy, I see no reason to live. Maybe this seems like a very selfish thing to say, but anyone who cares about me enough to be affected after I am gone should care enough to not want me to have to suffer like this anymore.
