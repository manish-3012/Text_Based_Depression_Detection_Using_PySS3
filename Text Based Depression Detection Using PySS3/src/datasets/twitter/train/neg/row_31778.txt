My life is a fucking mess. Hard to go on. Want the pain to end. Wouldn't you end it with my situation?I'm broke despite an ok job @ 24 an hour. My ex gets 360 a week for CS and I never see my kids. I'm 54000 in debt with student loans. I was fired from a pretty good job in July where I made about 80k with it that I worked for 13 years. I don't have the social skills to make friends. In March when I caught my ex in bed a guy who turned out to be married I snapped and attacked them and I am facing criminal charges. I don't know If I can overcome all this shit and I also have no one to help me.
