Currently going through the worst depression of my lifeLately I just haven't felt like myself. One of my closest friends has cut contact with me. My girlfriend says she wants to be with me but doesnt actually show it. I'm too stressed about outside things and might fail an entire semester of college. I really don't know what I'm doing in my life. I sometimes have thoughts about why I'm even here or why I'm in school because the tremendous amount of debt I have and would rather everything just end. I often feel like I'm just going to end up committing sometime later down the line. I have nightmares of people leaving me which seems to be coming true. I just dont know what to do anymore. I feel like I  have good friends. I just dont feel loved by anyone. I lost the most important people closest to me and it sucks. They where people there for me before but now that I feel like this and have felt like this they've never been there it feels. I have no clue what I'm doing...
