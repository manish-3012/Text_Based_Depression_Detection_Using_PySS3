I keep getting urges to hurt myself/others.I hope this is the right place to post. 

I don't want to hurt myself. I don't want to hurt others. But I get sudden urges out of no where to do so. I'm not a bad person. I don't enjoy pain or seeing others in pain. Is there something wrong with me? I accidentally stabbed myself recently and kept wondering if it actually was an accident. (Slipped cutting something.) I didn't enjoy it and I got medical attention for the small wound. 


I sound like an insane person..... 

I might be depressed because I am unable to work due to a physical disability and I have no car. But I have a wonderful boyfriend and family that take care of me. How can I seek help when they'll lock me up the second I say I have urges to hurt myself? I've been dealing with this for as long as I can remember. I have NEVER acted on an urge to hurt someone else. But I have had accidents with myself. Never 100% intentional.
