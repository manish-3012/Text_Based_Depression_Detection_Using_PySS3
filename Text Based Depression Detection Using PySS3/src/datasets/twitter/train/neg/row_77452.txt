I can not go oni'm in the middle of my 2nd round of lymphoma treatment. Today I found out that it has spread to my bones,  my right leg to be specific. 

I can't do this anymore. Cancer has destroyed my life. I can only wonder where I would be in life right now if this never happened. My medical bills have not only bankrupt me but my parents as well. And now this. radiation. More chemo. What did I do to deserve this reality? I don't have the will to fight anymore.  I have stashed up enough medication to kill a herd of elephants.  I started drinking tonight for the first time in forever. I just needed to get the nerve to end this life that is destroying everyone around me.

I've already prepared notes for my family.  I want this rollet coaster medical ride to end for them too. And should he ever come across it, my psychologist, this is not on you. You are the only reason I fought thus hard for this long to begin with.
