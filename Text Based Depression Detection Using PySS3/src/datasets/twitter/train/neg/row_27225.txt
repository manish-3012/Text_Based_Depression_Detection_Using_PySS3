Who really cares, apparently it doesn't matter.Seriously, im a new father of twins, the mother has all but shut me out. Im lucky if i get to change a diaper and look into their eyes. I get to hold one of them, if both are being fussy. Aside from that, im relegated to going to work, and forking over money......... im so distraught. I feel like ending myself and allowing them to collect the insurance is the best option.
