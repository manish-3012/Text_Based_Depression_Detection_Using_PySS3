My ect exp :I underwent ECT.. . It's basically therapeutically induced amnesia. 
It makes you see life the way a child would see life for the first time. While ensuring your intelligence is intact .

This therapy is nothing but a "phone resetting" of a human. 

Ect did wonders for my depression. Which I did not even acknowledge that I had,despite attempting to jump off a building. I've got the confidence I was missing out on.., all these years. Like I said to sum it up,  it's  nothing but a " phone reset" concept. 
And within 1 day my sucky family faught and made me realise why I had chosen  to end my my life to begin with. 

Heard of MDR-TB? well my stupid family is capable of making ect resistant depression. 


But don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean to say ect is ineffective. 

Only after ect was I truly able to appreciate what I've  been missing out on. Just going to show rarely do the patients acknowledge that they require ect.

2 things responsible for my server depression were family and academics. ( that's another bonus of ect . You can establish the root cause  of the depression. If the cause is dumb enough to not change it's ways post ect, then you can confirm your suspicions of depression. (Eg in my case family. )

But, just keep these 2 precautions in mind:
1) watch out for your parotid glands... .  Mine were damaged due to the nature of ect, ask the person holding your anesthesia  mask to watch out.
2) heads up... . The smell and sensation of thiopental is ominous.  But,  u may also kind of like it sometimes,  so you never really know,  either way before you have the time to complain or enjoy it,  u would have "gone to sleep".

All the best.
