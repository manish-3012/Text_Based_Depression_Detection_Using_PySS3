I never thought I'd need so many people...or have so few...

I just can't stand the loneliness or the pain anymore. It's unbearable. I've tried seemingly everything but always come up short, leading me to believe I am simply unlikeable, unlovable, whatever. I'm alone and I've been alone for the entirety of the 24 years I've been on this earth. I get that I can be odd, eccentric, weird, or strange; even among self-described weirdos, I'm always the odd one out... I get that I am prone to commit social faux-pas. I get that I can come across as stand-offish, though I don't mean to. I get that people don't want to associate with someone who is sad as I often am, and I don't blame them--I wouldn't either.

I find myself in a catch-22 situation where to make friends, I have to already have friends; to be happier in general, I have to already be happy. But I try to make myself happier and fail. I try to tone down my weirdness and am still quiet as ever. Nobody notices. How could I expect them to? I've never once felt like someone truly sees me, why would anybody start? I try to reach out to others, just to talk; to hang out; to connect on any level and fail every single time. Nobody whose friend I've tried to become ever calls back (and don't get me wrong, I put on a happy face, make every effort I can to smile, look someone in the eye, and engage them on topics they seem interested in, even when it feels fake, but still I get the same results). It has been this way for as long as I can remember. I see people at school, in the park, in the streets, talking, laughing, enjoying each other's company, and I am so envious it makes me want to burst. I wonder if it would be better or worse if I knew what I was missing...

Anyway, I made my plan and wrote my note today. There are some things I need to do before I go, so I am not in immediate danger. I don't know how I am going to manage to give away my cat (the only source of happiness I have ever known)... I hope I can find the bravery to find him a better home instead of doing it while he is in the house and leaving instructions to whoever finds my body, but I just don't know...

Before anyone asks, yes, I've been in therapy. For the past 14 years. Been to multiple different therapists, psychiatrists, specialists, rehabs, crisis wards etc. etc. Hasn't done a bit of good. I've called the national suicide hotline as well and found them to be useless at best and damaging at worst. My parents are the worst people I could possibly bring this to (as I have found out the hard way). I live alone with my cat. Basically, I have no one.

I don't know why I wrote this. Maybe somebody else feels the same and takes comfort in the knowledge that they aren't (weren't) alone. But I hope not--I wouldn't wish this on anyone.
