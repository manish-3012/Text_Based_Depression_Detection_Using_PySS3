TitleLet me start by saying that I'm probably not going to kill myself. But I do want to.

I've been thinking about doing it for a few weeks now, really don't know who to come to besides you extremely nice folk. 

The only person I'm comfortable to open up to, completely, is my girlfriend, who I love more than anything else in the world. She is the main reason I doubt I'll end up doing it. Her brother attempted ages ago and she's still extremely emotional about the topic, sometimes breaks out into tears over the thought. She loves her brother more than me, but I imagine if I actually did succeed, it would be something like that and I don't want to do that kind of damage to her.


The reason I want to do it, I'm a horrible person. I don't blame my girlfriend for wanting some space (we're sort of broken up at the moment but she claims to still love me). Honestly, take my word for it. I'm selfish, self centered and a bit of a cunt. I say, with complete sincerity, that on the whole the world would be better without me. I really mean it, it would, trust me. There are other reasons I don't feel comfortable going into. 

So near daily thoughts about killing myself with a quick thought afterwards similar to "Yeah, that'd be nice, but it aint gonna happen". Should I really 'get help' like those depression quizzes tell me? If so, that's what I'm doing here. I can't go to my GF, she's under a lot of stress lately without this on top of things. 

A humble thank you to all of you guys, I used to come by here a lot to lurk when I was younger.
