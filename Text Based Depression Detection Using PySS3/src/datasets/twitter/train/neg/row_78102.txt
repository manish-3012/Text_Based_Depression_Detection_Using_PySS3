Donâ€™t give upWhoever is reading this... I know youâ€™re going through a tough patch in your life and I know it feels like itâ€™s only getting worse as time goes by, but please remain here. Think of your family and how they would react, think of your dog/cat if you suddenly abandoned them, and think about all of your friends and how you wonâ€™t be able to share a drink with or hangout with them. Please seek help and please talk to someone. We care about you and we love you.
