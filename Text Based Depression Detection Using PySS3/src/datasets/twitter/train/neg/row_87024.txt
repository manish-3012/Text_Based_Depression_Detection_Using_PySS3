Stuck in my head and canâ€™t escape myself. HelpI donâ€™t know what to do and Iâ€™ve ended up hear with a plea for help.

Iâ€™m 18 and honestly donâ€™t want to live another day. I have struggled with so called depression and anxiety for many years; I have been on many different medications with no results and have been to countless therapists for help. Nothing has come from any of this and I now feel that I am going to be stuck like this forever. 

I have this problem where Iâ€™m trapped in my head and canâ€™t express anything to the world. Inside my head itâ€™s like Iâ€™m screaming and thereâ€™s so much going on yet I can translate it into words or actions or anything physical. It leaves me with anger and irritation and shame and tension... and a deep hatred for everyone around me. 

As a kid I was really outgoing and energetic and funny but as Iâ€™ve grown up I have become introverted and I have severe social anxiety. I donâ€™t really have any close relationships with anyone. I am unable to actually connect with someone. 

Pretty much I hate interacting with people and when I do I donâ€™t know what to do with myself. I donâ€™t know what to say and am so self conscious. I try so hard to snap out of it but I canâ€™t seem to....

What can I do? I feel at such a loss and every moment more I spend alone with my mind, it feels like itâ€™s slowly melting me.

I donâ€™t know what anyone can say to help me but Iâ€™ve been told that expressing things is good. This is the only way I can right now.
