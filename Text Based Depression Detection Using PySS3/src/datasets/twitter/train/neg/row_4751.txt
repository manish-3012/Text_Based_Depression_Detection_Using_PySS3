This really fucking sucksMan, I'm really tired of being lonely, meeting people and never being able to form a friendship with them, people ignoring me and treating me like I don't matter. I just want someone in my life, someone I can talk to, someone who will care about me and love me. I'm so fucking tired of my life right now
