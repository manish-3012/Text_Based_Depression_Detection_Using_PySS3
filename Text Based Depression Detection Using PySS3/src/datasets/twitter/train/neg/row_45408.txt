I feel trappedI\`m 19 and I\`m at university but i feel so trapped. I wasn't too sure what to do when i left school and i fell into this course but i feel too anxious to change. My anxieties become worse and worse over the last few weeks. I don\`t particularly care what i do with my life i just want a sense of freedom. I really dont like myself and i\`ve been leaning on xanax to cope. I\`m terrified of growing old and i dont know if i can be bothered living 60 more years. I know i couldn't kill myself but im just looking for a way out this feeling.
