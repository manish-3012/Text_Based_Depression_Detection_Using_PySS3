i'm a young girl but nobody would blame me if i tried to take my life. my health is ruining me.i was in college, a sorority, and a long term relationship. now i can't have sex because i have an extremely painful condition that causes me to be in pain down there 24/7. and penetration feels like stabbing due to endometriosis, another condition i have that can be debilitating. i also have the autoimmune disease hashimoto's, which might not seem like a big deal, but it makes me constantly fatigued and have insane brain fog. i also found out that i have antibodies for another autoimmune disease that's extremely rare &amp; slowly hardens your skin and organs, slowly disfiguring you. it is hardening my esophagus and i have GERD now, so my throat always feels tight and like i am choking. i consider myself to be pretty, but i won't be soon. i deal with very bad dissociation (dpdr), it's nearly constant, i always feel out of body and disconnected from my surroundings. last year i went through a period where i was having 10+ panic attacks a day and i couldn't get out of bed. now i have insomnia from the chronic stress and get about 4 hours of sleep a night. i also have tinnitus which probably wouldn't be a big deal if i wasn't so constantly anxious that it's easy to focus on and it's awful. my close friends and even family, although they want me to stay alive, i can tell that they even know that taking my own life would be justified. it sucks. i'm tired of this. i can't wait until the day i get the courage to do it. i don't think anybody would blame me
