Just Told a FriendI've messaged this friend (let's call them Brooke) a couple times in the past when things became overwhelming, but I just feel so guilty talking to them. I know I should reach out and be open about what's going on, but isn't this too much to put on them?

I confessed I had a set day to kill myself, but I'm really scared I did the wrong thing.
