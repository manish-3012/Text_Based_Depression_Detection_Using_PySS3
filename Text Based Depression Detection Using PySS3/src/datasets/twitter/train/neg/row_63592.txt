Overdosing by noonIâ€™ve lost everyone and everything. My friends, my job, my motivation, my will to live. I keep fucking up and hurting people. I just donâ€™t see a point anymore. Iâ€™m a burden, Iâ€™m toxic, no matter what I do, I always fuck up and hurt someone so whatâ€™s the point? Iâ€™m better off dead.
