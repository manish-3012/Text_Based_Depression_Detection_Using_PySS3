Itâ€™s my first week of college...I feel like my life is ending. 

Classes will be fine, I think. They havenâ€™t started yet, but Iâ€™m feeling alright about them. I am an academically strong student. 

But interacting with everyone today...the orientation, the talking, it killed me inside. I go out with new people, laugh and smile and enjoy the time and enjoy them, and then go home and lay down numb and terrified that I canâ€™t keep it up. That they donâ€™t like me, that they just humoured me, that Iâ€™ll lose the few people I have. 

I hid my face in my faculty group picture. I do everything I can to avoid contact with the other people on my floor, because I donâ€™t want to be seen. I just broke down in the shower tonight. 

Iâ€™ll never feel interesting, or handsome, or loved. 

I want to know how long itâ€™ll take me to waste away in my room...
