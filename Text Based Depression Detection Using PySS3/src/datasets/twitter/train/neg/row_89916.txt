Iâ€™m planning to commit suicide soon. How do I prepare my SO?I love her. I just donâ€™t think I can do this anymore. Iâ€™m in a big city, canâ€™t get a job I care about, I have no friends bc I cut them all off in a bad time in my life and have been too scared to make more. I have no money and feel like a drain on our resources and my SOs time and energy. My ptsd is worse than itâ€™s ever been, just when it seemed it was getting better. Iâ€™ve made my decision, Iâ€™m just trying to protect the person I love. Do I leave her first? Do I leave a note? 

If this canâ€™t go on this sub let me know and Iâ€™ll fix it. Iâ€™m new here. This is all happening so fast.
