It's too muchI can't do this anymore. I need to get to bed soon but I've been putting it off because I know I'll wake up in hell tomorrow. I have to move back in with my parents tomorrow due to money issues and suffice it to say my mother and I... don't get along. Anything I show the slightest bit of interest in, she either discourages because it's "weird" and "people will laugh at you" or she tries to make it about herself more than me. Then she doesn't understand why I won't share my interests with her, thinks I in fact have no interests, and resorts to dragging me to things *she* wants to go to in order to "draw me out of my shell." She doesn't understand that I need to have interests and hobbies that don't involve her. She claims she's been going to a therapist who is teaching her not to do this, but I'm not holding my breath.

The bigger issue is that after 25 years of dealing with this behavior from her, I basically have no hobbies or interests other than getting high enough to numb myself from the fact that I'm bored and don't like myself. I got heavy into marijuana in college and never really stopped using it, but they've been more than clear about me not smoking in their house. I don't have any friends (obviously) and my dealer is a dick, so I guess I'll have to learn to live without it.

I know the obvious answer is "go find a hobby you enjoy, maybe make some new friends and you won't feel like hell anymore." The problem with that is I've been mentally ill from early childhood (autism, depression, OCD, and possibly BPD) and can't imagine any mindless hobby distracting me from that the way drugs do. There's also the obvious fact that nobody wants to hang around with a crazy person who needs prescribed meds just to not feel suicidal. I don't see a way out of this that doesn't involve me dying. I just want to feel okay sober and not cry myself to sleep every night I can't get weed.
