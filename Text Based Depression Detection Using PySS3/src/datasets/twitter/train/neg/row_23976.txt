What's the point?I'm 19 with no friends and no motivation. I just sit around the house all day. I've never been in a relationship and I'm too awkward to connect with anyone. The only person that I really talk to is my mom. A lot of times I just fantasize about ending it all. I'm tired of hearing "it gets better" because it doesn't. I've been thinking about cleaning my room out and setting a date. Ideally before I go back to college in the fall. Part of me doesn't even want to put in the effort to go through with it. I'm just tired of existing.
