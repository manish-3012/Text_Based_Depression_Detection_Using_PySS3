I just want to stop feeling this wayI've wasted my entire life and I cant ever get that time back and nothing matters because life is just suffering and loss and boredom and regret and pain and responsibilities and I just want to atop feeling this way but i have no idea how to feel better. I just want to make it all stop but I don't know which scares me more- having this life be it or an eternity if existing without any hope od it ending.
