I guess we will try...Hey. I posted here a couple months ago and since then things seemed to be turning around for me. But I should have known better. Recently I have been struggling with motivation to do anything. Work has been kicking my ass in a bad way and every time i work i feel like i just want to cut my wrists and die. And it doesn't help that I'm not able to sleep when I'm at home. I just feel... trapped. I wake up and the only thing I can think is 'I'm not dead.. looks like another shitty day' and I dont know how to fix it. I have been through the medication and it just numbed the pain I feel. And the therapist i was going to told me that i just needed to find love and i would be happy... anyway. I just needed to get this off my chest i guess.
