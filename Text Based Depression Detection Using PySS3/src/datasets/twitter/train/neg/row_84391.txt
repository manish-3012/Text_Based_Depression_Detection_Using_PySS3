I tried to Hang Myself it felt like a daydream I was unconscious for close to an hour!So basically the other night I tried to hang myself the noose worked perfectly but when I was standing on a small table waiting to step off I put the noose around my neck. Put on the song hanging tree from the hunger games. The stepped off with my left leg first. This is where it gets strange I think I went into a daydream because I lifted my leg back up but the next second I'm opening my eyes I'm on the floor with the noose tight around my neck insanely trying to get it off. But I was so confused because In my head i had lifted my leg back up but in reality i didn't. I had used two hooks into my ceiling with 8th screws I had used a reinforced part of the ceiling and tested first that it could hold my weight but the screws all just pulled out. So I failed and survived. It felt like the experience lasted a few seconds but when I checked my phone I was unconscious for close to an hour.
