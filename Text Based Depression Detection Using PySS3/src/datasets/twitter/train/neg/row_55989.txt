I can't put any more people through me.I'm a toxic dumb shitty teenager. I won't say no body loves me, some people do, but that's the problem. I know for a fact I'm hurting these people, and I know I'm fucking with their mental health with just the type of rant I'm writing here, and I know that in long term it would be better for them if I just took a gun to my head. But I can't, because there are people I love back and I don't want to leave them. But still, every word I exchange with them, I feel guilty. I feel guilty for putting them through the shit show I am. They give me everything they can, and I don't give anything back. Even if I tried my best, I'd always fuck up in whatever I was doing for them, just like I do with anything else. I can't find enjoyment anymore, I live a fucking ocean apart from the person who makes me want to live, I never do anything right when doing the things I like to do, and I'm only living out of habit. And I hate it. 

The worst thing about this is that I'm actually very privileged and lucky. I have some pretty nice friends, a gf, I moved out of my country to a first world country, am pretty wealthy, and am white with green eyes. Nothing really traumatic has ever really happened to me, and still, I'm here, wanting to kms and bla bla bla. Honestly, I'm a shame to the world.
