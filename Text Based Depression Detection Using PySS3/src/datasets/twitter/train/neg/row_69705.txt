Bad teeth banditI need to vent somewhere. Iâ€™m so fucking sad and angry everyday and it never goes away. Itâ€™s been like this since I was a small child. All I want is to die. I ruined my health by not getting braces. I have way too many dental problems for my age and Iâ€™m so scared. My teeth shouldnâ€™t be loose. My teeth shouldnâ€™t be this fucked up. I canâ€™t afford any treatment. I hear stories of people older than me who have bad teeth and they seem like they are really going through it. I just know my life isnâ€™t worth living and that it will only be pain. I donâ€™t have any family and barely any friends. I canâ€™t afford my cats medical bills either. Iâ€™m too poor for anything. I just need to be dead. I attempted all the time. Sometimes when I choke myself it feels like my teeeth are going to pop out of my mouth so I get scared to attempt that way because if I survive and harm my teeth more Iâ€™m just goin  to be punching myself in the face and causing more damage to my jaw and bones. Iâ€™m just so fucking hopeless. I try to recover and see the bright side but Iâ€™m always in this hole I canâ€™t climb out of.
