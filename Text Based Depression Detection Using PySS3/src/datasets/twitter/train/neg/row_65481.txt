Iâ€™m lostHi everyone, so Iâ€™m at a point in my life where I finally realized Iâ€™m lost, Iâ€™m 22 I genuinely donâ€™t know anything about myself as my entire life I realized I just mimic peopleâ€™s personalities and interests. Iâ€™m just existing, I still work the same dead end office job since I graduated barely scraping by, the only reason I say Iâ€™m still alive is my parents, I have the most supportive parents in the world and it kills me thinking about my mom finding out Iâ€™m dead. I was in a relationship for a little over a year with the girl I believed was the love of my life she genuinely made me want to better myself and I was insanely happy, tomorrow it will be a year since she broke up with me and I still am not over her at all. Iâ€™ve turned away other relationships because I always think about how Iâ€™ll wait for her. Alcohol is the only thing that brings me any sort of joy in my life. I really donâ€™t think I could live without it. I always see videos of people who go through bad break ups than have glow ups and am proud of themselves. I wish I could figure out how people do it, because in my head I genuinely believe that I donâ€™t deserve happiness. That the minimal effort I put into my life is all I deserve. Im grossly overweight and struggle losing weight and think thatâ€™s a large reason for a lot of my unhappiness and self hatred. Idk why but in my head I donâ€™t deserve better, that little voice in my head will always tell me that Iâ€™m not able to do something so why try, idk why but I get super defensive about it. If someone tells me Iâ€™m better than that Iâ€™ll aggressively say Iâ€™m not. I really donâ€™t like who I am and in my head Iâ€™ve convinced myself that I can pretend to be other people in order to get away and that I donâ€™t deserve to be better than who I am. I just kind of really wish I would get in an accident and die or struck by a bus or something because Iâ€™m way too big of a pussy to take my own life but holy shit I wish I could just die so bad.
