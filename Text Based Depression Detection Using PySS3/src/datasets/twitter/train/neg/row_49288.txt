I'm not suicidal at moment, but I took some medications and I'm worriedOkay so I took 60mg of zopiclone to get high, then 100mg diphenhydramine to sleep. But couldn't sleep so I took Belsomra 20mg and I'm getting extremely heavily tired. I'm worried if I sleep I might have taken too much and not wake up.  Earlier my whole body started heating up and tingling unpleasantly and out of nowhere it really shocked me. It happened again after that but not as bad as first time, which also makes me worry. Should I try to sleep (wont kill me), or stay awake (V energy drink)
