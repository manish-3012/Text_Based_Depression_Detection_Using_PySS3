a letter i wrote___-
i am so miserably depressed.  people are sending evil thoughts into my brain and it's all beyond negative.  i'm getting fatter by the second.  my days are largely empty.  i read a bit.  think about medical bills i can't pay.  think about all the mistakes i have made and collapse in a pile of sorry. ONE MORE NIGHTMARE is one more than i can take.  i feel like now that i have the energy to do something, i should finish putting my room in order so someone else doesnt have to and then do whatever i have to do to get off this planet.  i will always be poor/barely getting by, i would be lucky to get a masters and even then it probably wouldnt get me anything, i have no safe space, everything is closing in, i dont want to live as some pathetic parasite on society.  i can't pretend to function any longer.  and i finally have the energy to do this thing.
