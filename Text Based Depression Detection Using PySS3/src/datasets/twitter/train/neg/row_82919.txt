The only thing holding me back is that I don't want to do this to my parentsI'm 18 male, have probably been depressed all my life but since three years my mental health just seems to get worse and worse. I can't enjoy anything anymore and I feel horrible all day, the only thing that makes me slightly feel better is alcohol. I tried sport, therapy, meditation etc. but life is as shitty as always. I just wish I could get it over with but I really don't want to do this to my parents and I'm absolutely not a family-person. Even though I'm a worthless and horrible person I still know they love me. I don't want to ruin their life with my death, I know they could never be truly happy again. Wish I didn't had a family so it would be easier to end it all.
