Constantly paranoidI can't do it anymore... I wake up in constant fear for my life. I can't even explain it but I just always feel..paranoid. Its the only way I can accurately describe it. I reach out to people and they don't take my seriously. I can't go to sleep without looking outside my window 50 times. Sometimes when I pass by a usps truck I feel like the driver is out to get me... That's totally irrational and I realize it right after and I absolutely hate myself. 



Its been like this for 3 years. I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried everything. I live high up in an apartment complex and have thought about jumping out the window so that I don't feel paranoid anymore. The only problem is I'm too pussy to jump. I hate my life in the current paranoid state its in but I don't know how to change it or end it. 


What to do....
