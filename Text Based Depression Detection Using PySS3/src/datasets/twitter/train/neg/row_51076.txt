I'm too much of a coward to kill myself so I'm trying to live my life in fast forwardSchool, sleep. Eat, sleep. Breathe, sleep. Awaken, sleep. 

That's more or less my cycle these days. I don't have the gall to kill myself - I'm too scared to ruin my family, scar my friends, you know, the usual bit. And because I don't have that courage to end this fucking waste of time known as "my life," I've turned to just living in "fast forward mode" - that's to say, sleep more than anything else. Even if I'm not tired, I force myself to sleep. I'm living my life like one big, long VHS cassette - just keep fast forwarding until the end, until the good part comes. 

And it's hilarious how, despite how much I sleep, I'm still so tired. Tired of living, tired of being ignored, tired of being repressed and judged and made a last resort. I really just want this suffering to end by any means possible, but I hate this cowardice of mine...
