My life is a failure in all aspects. I have nothing.(Sorry for the run-on sentence. As you might imagine, I'm not feeling well)

I used to be considered "gifted" and skipped a grade, but now I am a failure in all aspects of my life: I am nearly 25 years old have a grand total of two friends, both of whom I sometimes fear don't care about me, I took 8 years to complete a 5 year degree in a field that I hate (I didn't change both because it would take my 9+ years to graduate and because they promised "100% employment"), never had a job (not THAT unusual in my country and for students of my uni but still) which I fear makes me unemployable outside of said country (I want to move because the economy is terrible), never had a girlfriend and overall feel like I have the life experience of a 12 year old. Even my own parents claim they're ashamed of me. I am becoming afraid of other people because I fear that they will find out that I am an utter zero life experience wise. I have recently become interested in programming but I look at this field and not only is it full of people who have been doing it since they were 12, but I keep hearing about how in that career, you're pretty much unemployable past 30 unless you go into management. I see no possible solution to this. What do I have to live for?
