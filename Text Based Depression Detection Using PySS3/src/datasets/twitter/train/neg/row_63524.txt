My family keeps saying i'm too old for being so anxious but if i'd kill myself they would say i'm too young to die.Im 16f and cant go outside,to the market, shopping , talk to people, cant order at a restaurant ect without having qt least a panic attack. And all my family says is that i behave like a little Kid ... i mean who is scared of those things at 16 ?!!!!!.
I didnt choose to make so many negative experiences nor to live... it just happened and i hate it .

I never tell them when i'm close to kms because they would probably say omg you're so young and life is beautiful      =&gt;        comepletely BULLSHIT. 

Age doesnt have to mean anything .
