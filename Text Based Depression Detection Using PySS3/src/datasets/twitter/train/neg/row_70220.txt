Don't wanna do this anymoreI just need a rest, im tired about being an asshole and making everyone bad, i really hope that everyone has a very good life, you know... i tried to make good things in my life and all of that is a fucking mistake, i can't even look at people at the face, i have lost all confidence and desire and i am always sad, shit, i really hope that god forgive's me and everyone that i love, though they dont love me. 

People just to love to fuck with me, people just love to ruin my life, people just hate me for no reason, people who I never interact just love to make my life a misery. Everybody defamates from behind my back but face to face they haven't got a thing to say. Ask yourself how do you think I can live with this? 

I'm trapped by my religion, feel like an outcast and my family will be mad if I tell them the truth or the lie, I feel like I'm in a cell where the lock keeps on changing whenever I find the key. People think that they know me, you don't fucking know me for shit. 

All I want is love but that's too much for me. I am reaching out for something for me to hold onto but i never do. Life is a lesson that we don't sign up for but we fatefully learn and as i grow older, time is what breaks us apart. Im full of shit, i had a dream but this ain't it.
