At another low point...I posted a few days ago about how I was feeling in my life and the various downward spirals in my life that brought me feeling down again. After cutting out some toxic people out my life (my husband and a friend) I started to revaluate my life and what I want in it to happen in my life to put myself in a better place mentally and emotionally. So moving forward I wanted to put my focus on finishing my bachelors. Planning on taking out a student loan for the summer to pay for classes and housing so I could put my focus on just school. I got denied by myself, asked my mom to be a co-signer it didnâ€™t work with her, asked my older sister she declined to attempt it even though I was the one she came to a few years back to co-sign on a car she was trying to get. Basically Iâ€™m at the point where I feel stuck and stagnant and every time I attempt to fix my situation thereâ€™s always something holding me back. Iâ€™m just really exhausted. Iâ€™ve been severely depressed for the last two years and Iâ€™m tired of â€œit gets betterâ€ when anytime I try to make it better things just never work out .. Iâ€™m just really tired of feeling like this honestly
