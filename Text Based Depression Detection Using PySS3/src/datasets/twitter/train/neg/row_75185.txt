Completely BrokenSo, Iâ€™m not really sure how much attention this post will get, if any. But I donâ€™t know where else to turn to vent a bit about my mentality and get some help for it. 
Iâ€™ve been under such an extreme amount of stress and anxiety. After a really bad falling out with someone, I started to get extremely depressed. I stopped going to my therapist and I isolated myself. Soon after, the quarantines started happened and it made everything worse. Iâ€™ve lost any sort of support system that was left for me, and I havenâ€™t physically seen anyone in days. I feel like Iâ€™m losing my grip on reality. The last time I felt this bad was the last time I attempted, roughly a year and a half ago. Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™m going to slip under and not be able to help myself. I donâ€™t want to leave my family and friends behind but, Iâ€™ve lost any sort of hope for a future. The only way I seeing my life continuing is if Iâ€™m dead. I donâ€™t know what to do about these thoughts or feelings. 
Thanks for reading.
