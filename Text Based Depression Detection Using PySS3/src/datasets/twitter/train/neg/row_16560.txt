Suffering bad, canâ€™t keep going like this.Iâ€™m a young male and my life has been ruined. I took Celexa which is an SSRI antidepressant last July for only 25 days and then quit due to side effects. Ever since quitting my sex drive is gone and I canâ€™t feel orgasms. Iâ€™m also emotionless with no energy. This is PSSD ( Persistent SSRI sexual dysfunction). Itâ€™s most likely permanent. I miss my old self so much. I have to fake being fine around my family and others without them knowing. Iâ€™m so numb and I miss orgasms and sexual feelings. I canâ€™t keep going
