Feel like I have no one to talk to about thoughts of suicideI don't think I could ever do it, but thinking about it is scary. I feel like its such a big burden to put on someone and I don't feel comfortable doing it. But it is really hard not being able to talk to anyone about this. I don't know what to do :/
