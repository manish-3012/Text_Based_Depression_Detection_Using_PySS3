I'm spiraling and need someone to talk toI don't even know if this is the right place. I just need to talk to someone. I literally have no one I can talk to without causing some sort of consequence. Some old thoughts and self harming behaviors are surfacing again....I'm desperate. Pm me. I don't want to post anything in case someone sees this. A woman's perspective might be helpful too. 

If this is inappropriate or against rules please delete or let me know I should delete
