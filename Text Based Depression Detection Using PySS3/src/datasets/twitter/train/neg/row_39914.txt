Found My Roommate - Called 911Not sure if this is the right place for this, but wanted to reach out looking for help.

I got home the other day to find a note from my roommate. He was sitting in the backyard, so I went to talk to him. I didn't know why he was sitting out there, but the note concerned me. I tried to get him to go to a hospital with me, he called the note a joke and that he should have thrown it away. The note concerned me enough that I called 911.

Once the police arrived and shined a flashlight on him, they saw the cut on his wrist that I had missed. They involuntarily admitted him to the hospital.

They're holding him for 72 hours, and then I don't know what happens. I don't know if he'll hate me or what. He doesn't have any family, and the hospital won't tell me what's going on. When they took him, they left his phone, wallet and keys at home so even when he gets released I don't know how he'll get home. There's so much running through my mind right now that I don't know what to do.

Any help/advice would be appreciated.
