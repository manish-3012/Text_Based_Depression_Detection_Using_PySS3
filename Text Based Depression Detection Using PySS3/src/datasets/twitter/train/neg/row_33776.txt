I'm scaredI'm having do many thoughts about not wanting to exist. I'm disappointed when I wake up every morning. If it werent for my family, I'd end it right now. Though maybe it'll be a relief for them too. I dont feel very loved or wanted lately. Everyone would be happier without me.

I dont want to do this anymore.
