I can't keep forcing myself to see the lightI'm so tired of fighting myself. I'm so tired of trying to be positive. I'm so tired of believing one day I'll be happy when I've never known really happiness or peace. I'm useless. I'm pointless. I'm never going to be apart of a happy family, my mom made sure of that with her own problems. I know my dad loves me but his life would be better without me, I'm a waste of money to him. I'm 22 and I don't know what I want to do with my life, I feel pointless drifting around life. I want to die but I don't want anyone on my life to blame themselves. I want to be able to die in peace. I want to not be alone. I want to not be afraid. I don't know how to fix myself and I'm the only person who can fix me. I just want to not be alone. I know I'm not making sense right now and I'm sorry.
