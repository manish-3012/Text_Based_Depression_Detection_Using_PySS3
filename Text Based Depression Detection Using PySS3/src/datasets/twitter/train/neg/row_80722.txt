I'm fucking doneI am an autistic 18 year old with a massive list of anxiety problems, over the past year everything has gone completely to shit, every single friend I ever had has left my life, and everyone else has either gotten completely fed up with me, or only associates with me out of pity. I recently got rid of the only genuine friend I had left because of an incident where she utterly betrayed my trust. I now have no connection left to humanity, I am utterly alone in the world, and utterly lost. I don't know what to do anymore, everyone hates me, even though I try to be nice. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fact that I haven't found a clean enough means to do it yet without raising too much suspicion, that takes my utter cowardice into account. What point is there for me to go on living if I don't have anyone left in my life?
