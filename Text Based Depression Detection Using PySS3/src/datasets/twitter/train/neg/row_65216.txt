I need advice please...I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was 11 and I'm only 13 now, I honestly think I would be dead if I didnt feel like it would hurt my family, and I just feel so alone. My sister has had mental health problems in the past and my cousin is currently in hospital because of an eating disorder and I dont know what I can do without putting more strain on my already stressed family. I am seeing a counsellor in school but if she thinks I'm at risk of suicide or self harm she can tell my parents and I always panic before seeing her. I cant tell my friends because theyd only worry about me more than they do currently. 
I always feel like my problems arent as important as others, but the amount of times I've imagined a noose around my neck or slitting my wrists and bleeding out is alarming and it doesn't even scare me anymore. I love my family so much and they're all so nice and my friends are lovely, I just imagine dying and it seems so much better than being numb or absolutely miserable which are my two default state of beings now. 
I dont want to leave them with the guilt of my death and the fact that they thought I was ok, but i just find death as an easy option. It seems peaceful once you're gone and i am so sick of my life and the guilt of lying to everyone. What should I do?
