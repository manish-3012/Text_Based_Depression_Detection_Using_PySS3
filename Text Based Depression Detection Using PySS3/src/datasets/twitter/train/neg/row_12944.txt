In Canada, what are the consequences of making a suicide attempt and recovering? [LONG text, sorry]This subreddit is very quiet, but I don't think my question would be allowed in /r/AskReddit. /r/AskCanadian subreddit is very quiet too. I hope someone knowledgeable can help me.
 
Please correct me if I'm wrong. When you attempt suicide in Canada and police or paramedics are called, this event is recorded in the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) database (as well as any relevant local police and medical databases).
 
From googling, I've found out that consequences include:
 
1. I won't been able to get a firearms license (a wise restriction).
 
2. I probably won't be able to [travel to] (https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2011/01/29/canadian_woman_denied_entry_to_us_because_of_suicide_attempt.html) or through the USA (suicide attempts can be recorded in the Canadian Police Information Centre database, which is [somewhat] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Police_Information_Centre) [accessible] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/canadians-mental-health-info-routinely-shared-with-fbi-u-s-customs-1.2609159) by the FBI and U.S. Customs and Border Protection).
 
If a person attempts suicide, recovers, and is able to become mentally healthy and live a normal life, what other permanent negative consequences are there?
 
Can insurance companies dig up this information? (Affecting extended private health, life, or even auto insurance eligibility?)
 
Will prospective employers be able to find this through background checks?
 
Will mental health history be covered in the Canadian Government Security Screening?
 
I mean, will you be treated like a convicted criminal, not allowed to work with confidential information (like someone who helps do your taxes or a medical office assistant), transport medical supplies (like insulin or donated blood), or transport hazardous materials (like a freight truck driver transporting a load of pool cleaning supplies)?
 
Security screening focuses on your [reliability] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance#Canada). I can't find specific mention of mental health, but I think that can be considered a significant factor of a person's reliability.
 
I also don't know the negative long term consequences of having "suicidal thoughts" or "involuntary hospitalization" in my medical record. Will this also hurt my ability to get a job or insurance?
 
I'm afraid to admit to anyone that I've seriously considered killing myself. I don't want to be involuntarily locked up for [three months] (https://www.legalline.ca/legal-answers/involuntary-hospital-admission-of-mentally-ill-people-and-length-of-stay/) or more. 
 
Years ago I had a psychotherapist who just kept prescribing different drugs which left me feeling extremely detached, unable to concentrate on anything, and a lot of other side effects (like dry mouth). I don't want that again. I hated those drugs. 
 
I had a very difficult time finding a psychotherapist who seemed right for me. I hesitate to say this, but I found some of them very unprofessional: one spent all of our sessions asking me technical computer questions and essentially getting paid to pester me as his personal IT support person (he was the drug pusher); another was working hard on an academic thesis with a really narrow focus which he forcefully tried to apply to all of our therapy sessions whether it made sense or not. He would ignore any patient problems or issues if they were not dream related and can also be drawn on paper. He adamantly refused to do anything else. I couldn't make this up if I tried.  All of this turned me off of therapy for years. Canadian healthcare might be better than in the United States in some ways, but there's a lot of flaws and problems, too.
 
In recent days I had been having increasingly frequent suicidal thoughts, but so far it's gone down and I've been holding steady. I managed to find a relative to talk to. Not a resolution or even a reliable source of support, but it's pulled me back from the edge. Also, finding [this] (https://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/health_information/a_z_mental_health_and_addiction_information/suicide/Pages/default.aspx) web page at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Canada) helped. It's slender comfort, but where the page explains why and "Who is at risk?" and "What aâ€‹re the warning signs?" - it was like a brief warm sunbeam because whoever wrote that web page understood exactly how I feel.
 
Thank you for taking the time to read all this. I hope someone can answer my questions. How screwed am I if there are records of me having attempted suicide, or being locked up in a hospital, or even admitting that I wanted to die?
