feels like everyone that wants me alive is a sadisti don't get why anyone would want me alive. i don't get why anyone close to me would want me to go through what i'm going through and force me to live with the pain i do. everyone's a fucking sadist. my 19th birthday is in a week and i'm considering doing it for my birthday, so my family and friends won't have to remember me on a day other than my birthday.
