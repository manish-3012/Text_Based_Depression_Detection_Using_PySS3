I really want to die, but I can't do it no matter what.Ha I'm a failure. I can't do anything I want, no matter what it is, no matter how simple. I just can't do it, my best friend and my only friend had abandoned me.

I have been bullied most of my life from a lot of people, the small group of friends I thought I had turns out are sometimes assholes, causing trouble in football games and shit, not to mention they never cared about my alcohol problem. Only one friend has actually left me, the funny thing is, she said I can talk to her anytime, few weeks later she stops answering my calls and I have no way to contact her cos she doesn't use social media anymore. She helped me when I was suicidal once so I doubt she just decided to stop talking to me willingly, I started to change and she was proud of me.

My alcohol problem was either me just being somewhat drunk everyday or I binged drink. I never felt addicted, it was easy to quit once I found the reason. But now that reason is gone, I just want to drink to avoid the pain.
