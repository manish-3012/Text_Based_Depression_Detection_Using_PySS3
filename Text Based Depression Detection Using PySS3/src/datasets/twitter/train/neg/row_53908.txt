I failed at my attempt but afterwards these are some words that helped meI failed 2 days ago, but thatâ€™s okay. Parts of me which I didnâ€™t fail, but I reached out and theses are some words that help me stabilize a bit. I hope some of you read this and it helps as well.

â€œYour absence will leave a void similar to yours but mine will always remain because youâ€™re not there. Your absence will throw my entire life off course.â€

â€œItâ€™s your duty to bury your parents not the other way around. If I had to bury my child, I will be devastated. There would be no words or actions I could do to mend that wound.â€

â€œIf you done all you can, then you can at least live on, for others, and hopefully one day you can live for youâ€

â€œYou donâ€™t want us to find out by your mom telling us youâ€™re no longer with usâ€

â€œIâ€™ll be punching the air because thereâ€™s no one to blame but myself.â€

â€œItâ€™ll make me wonder is there more I could have done the last time we were together.â€

Two days ago, I was at my end. I was no longer willing to move towards the future, but I reached out. Iâ€™m not strong enough to do this alone, and I took a step to attempt to get better. Iâ€™m not a quitter and Iâ€™m damn well not going to cut this attempt at life short.

Iâ€™m not sure what everyone is facing, but let me face it with you.
