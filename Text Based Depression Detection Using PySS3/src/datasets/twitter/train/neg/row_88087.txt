Why am I so scared to kill myselfI am convinced my brain is fucked up. I have clinical depression and anxiety. I cannot live like this. I do not want to continue letting people down. But why am I so fucking scared to die. I hate myself. I'm such a fucking pussy. Why can't I let someone kill me? Why do I have to do it alone?
