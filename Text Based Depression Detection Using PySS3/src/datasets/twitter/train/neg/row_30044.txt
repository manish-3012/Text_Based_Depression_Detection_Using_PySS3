I feel emptyI've always been pretty happy. I have a good family and great friends. Ever since sophomore year (of high school) started I've just felt so empty. It's not that I'm sad I just don't feel anything. I don't necessarily want to kill myself but I often think of ways that I could do it if I ever really wanted to. I come home from school and sleep everyday all I ever want to do anymore is sleep. I make plans with my friends and I think that I was to go, but when the time comes around I feel like shit for not wanting to. I don't have motivation to do anything anymore, even things I like doing. I cry about everyday and I usually don't even know why. I don't even know why I feel like this but I don't feel like getting better either. I've only felt like this for about 6 months but I feel like it's been forever. I think it would be right to tell my mom to get help but at the same time I don't see a point. I think trying to get help would be hopeless
