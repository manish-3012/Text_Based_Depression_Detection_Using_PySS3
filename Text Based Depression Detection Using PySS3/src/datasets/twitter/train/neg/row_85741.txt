I donâ€™t know who to turn toI just want to die. Iâ€™m trying my best to be happy and stay positive but I just canâ€™t . I want to reach out to someone but I donâ€™t know who. I have an appointment with my therapist next week but I donâ€™t think I can wait that long. I want to end it now. I donâ€™t know why I keep thinking these thoughts and why I canâ€™t just be happy. But it hurts to live this way. I just want it to be over.
