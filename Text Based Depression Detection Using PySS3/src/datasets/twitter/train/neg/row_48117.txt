Fiancee dumped me after moving across the countryI was a career firefighter for almost 5 years. I left everything behind for my fiancee to be closer to her parents due to health concerns. After about 4 months she's decided she wants to see other people. I've seen so much shit, again and again and again. Why is everything so terrible. What's the point of anything.
