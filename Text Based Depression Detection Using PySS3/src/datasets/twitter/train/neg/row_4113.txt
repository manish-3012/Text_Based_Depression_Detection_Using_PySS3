It has been on my mind...*Update* Hello I wanted to thank everyone that responded. I was in a very dark place weeks ago, but it feels like I have been able to move past it. You are all very king I appreciate your concern for me. 

I'm been thinking about suicide or at least hurting myself for a while now. I'm taking medication and it helps, but the thoughts always find a way of creeping into my head usually during times of high stress. I'm a recent college graduate and I have been experiencing high stress at my new job. I cannot seem to perform at an acceptable level and I'm really starting to resent my job and my employer.  The thought of being fired at my first job post-college is enough to make me go over the edge. I cannot stand the possibility of being a failure. In addition I'm disillusioned with life in general and I don't feel I will ever make any kind of significant impact in any aspect of my life. I'm really overweight and I have tendency to overeat which is only making me bigger. I see all the people at work getting married and having kids, and all I can do is feel resentment and loneliness at not having someone of my own. It doesn't help that I'm gay in an extremely conservative state.  I would like nothing more than to leave this world right now.
