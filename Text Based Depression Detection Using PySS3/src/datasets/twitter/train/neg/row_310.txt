Thinking about itBeen suffering from RSI for quite some time now because I over practiced guitar for 1 fucking week. 1 week and my life is fucked. Iâ€™m either in pain or my hands are aching. Parents keep telling me â€œoh youâ€™ll be fine itâ€™s fine, just go back to college itâ€™ll be okayâ€ every time I somewhat suggest I really need serious help. Girlfriend does the same. She just tells me itâ€™s gonna be alright/Iâ€™ll heal and gets upset when Iâ€™m down in the dumps. I just want my hands back. I want my life back. I swear to fucking god Iâ€™ll sell my amps/gear, buy a shotgun and blow my fucking brains out if Iâ€™m not better a year from today. I canâ€™t take this shit. I canâ€™t work, I canâ€™t have my only passion. I canâ€™t do anything anymore. Fuck everything. I want this to end.
