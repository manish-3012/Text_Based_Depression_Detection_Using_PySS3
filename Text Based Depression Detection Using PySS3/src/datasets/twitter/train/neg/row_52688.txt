Is there a convincing reason why I shouldnâ€™t do this?I dropped out of college. Iâ€™ve never worked a real full time job. Iâ€™m completely dependent on my husband both financially an emotionally. I struggle with anxiety and depression and I rarely feel like Iâ€™ve done anything right on the best of days. Now Iâ€™ve really fucked up. I cheated on him, in the worst way possible. I donâ€™t even want to go into the horrible details. Heâ€™s dating someone else now and I can see him drifting further away from me emotionally. Itâ€™s probably because Iâ€™m sick a wreck and canâ€™t give him the time and space he needs to forgive me. He says he doesnâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m his anymore and has stopped telling people that Iâ€™m his wife. Iâ€™m convinced that heâ€™s only still with me because he knows I have nowhere to go. I live to please him. I know that sounds unhealthy but I honestly canâ€™t help it, he means the world to me. I tried to be the perfect wife a for a while I was but as he says, I broke the contract. Itâ€™s been voided. This is the biggest fuck up Iâ€™ve ever made in my life. Even if I wanted to cut my losses, learn from this and move on, I have nothing in life to fall back on. Before this happened weâ€™d been trying for a baby for the better part of a year. Even my body is a failure. I canâ€™t live through this. Every breath I take feels like a small heart attack. Iâ€™ve been crying every night for weeks. He was patient at first but now heâ€™s starting to get angry about it. He feels like Iâ€™m being manipulative. I just want it end. Heâ€™s buying me a ticket to go stay with my mom for a few months. Iâ€™ve made up my mind to kill myself before then and I think I have about a week to do it. Iâ€™ve planned it all out and wrote my suicide note. Before I go, I was wondering if thereâ€™s any truly convincing reason not to do it.
