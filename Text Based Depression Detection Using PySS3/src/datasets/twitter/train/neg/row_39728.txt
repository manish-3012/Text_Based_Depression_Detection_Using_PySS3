One more thing crossed off the â€œguilt checklistâ€ todayI really think that my dog is the only thing keeping me alive at this point.

My mom would be destroyed if I died but sheâ€™s abusive towards me and only knows how to show love with money.

My dad chose his new wife over my brother and I when I was 8.

My little brother was the only thing Iâ€™ve been holding onto but he has a superiority complex and I today I found out he and my husband have been texting about me behind my back being â€œthe way that I amâ€ - I have PTSD from years of being stalked and assaulted. I had an anxiety attack during Thanksgiving and everyone was disgusted. The stalking is still going on. Everyone around me is tired of it and doesnâ€™t think itâ€™s a big deal. This person raped me and physically attacked me. The police never enforced the broken order of protection and heâ€™s still out there. 

My husband explodes on me in anger all the time and blames me for it. I used to have so much love and respect for him but now it feels like Iâ€™m living with a dumb brick who only cares about his dog. Because Iâ€™ve been sexually abused I canâ€™t be intimate with people who are threatening to me and so the thought of having sex with him feels like rape. 

I randomly cry for no reason, I just get choked up and canâ€™t breathe. I canâ€™t function at work and asked for a demotion so I could start fading away. I need Xanax to sleep. Iâ€™ve been in therapy for a year and itâ€™s not helping. Before that Iâ€™ve seen 4 other therapists. 

Iâ€™m in my 30s and everyoneâ€™s pressuring me to have kids. Fuck that. I know Iâ€™m at a huge risk for postpartum depression, even psychosis. Iâ€™m scared about what Iâ€™d do to a baby.

I wish I would die in an accident so that people would just fuck off and blame someone else.
