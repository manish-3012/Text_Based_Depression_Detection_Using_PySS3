The only thing that keeps me alive is my animals.Iâ€™m 22 and I still live at home. I currently have 1 dog and 4 rats that Iâ€™m mostly responsible for. The thought of leaving my family to take care of them just seems so selfish. They all have full time jobs and would have to hire a dog walker and probably give my rats away. 

Iâ€™d hate to burden them with that, but Iâ€™m also in such unbearable pain.
