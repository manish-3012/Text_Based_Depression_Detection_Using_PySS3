Constant thoughts of dying need advice.Hi, everyone i honestly donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve never felt like this before and i canâ€™t seem to shake it off. This past year i canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself i feel depressed because Iâ€™m so lonely. Iâ€™m looking for a relationship, but i feel like im constantly not wanted enough or it goes nowhere. Iâ€™m 24 years old and never been in an relationship before so i donâ€™t know what love is. Iâ€™ve used apps like tinder for 4 years now with maybe over 800 matches, but i havenâ€™t met a single person. I want to experience love because i honestly feel like thatâ€™s the true meaning of life, but if i canâ€™t experience it, then whatâ€™s the point in living. 

Long story short i want to do it, but Iâ€™m honestly to scared when i pick up a knife and i feel bad at the thought of my parents lifeless. At the same time Iâ€™m 24 and thereâ€™s always a possibility i could meet someone, but i feel soooooo defeated at this point.
