Overwhelmed and HopelessChristmas for my kid was a gamble against my safety net... The income tax refund.  My other safety net was tapped out for 5 years due to a transmission repair this summer.  I'm behind on rent and electric by 15 days and my loans by 1 to 3 months.  My car needed brake work and tires to the tune of $1390.  Maybe refund will cover it.  But I'm still behind.  Sure I'll dig out just enough to stay under water... Until what next right?  What next is going to drown me.  I hate living under this constant uncertainty.  I don't get to be happy.  It's not my place to experience any more than what I got during my failed marriage.

I am not sure what I'll do to myself when things finally give...  Hopefully it's painless. 37 years is long enough.
