What's wrong with me?I have been thinking about killing myself for a few years now. I want my death to just come already. I wouldn't mind dying, but I never had the strength to end it. The only thing holding me back from ending it is the people around me because I don't want to make people sad for my own feelings. I stay home all day to pass the time. I have constant mood swings and feel guilty for the smallest things. 

I have some "friends" , but I don't think they would understand. People describe me as emotionless, reason for that is that I keep everything to myself. I become to attached people very quickly. I become infatuated with girls so often hoping they could give me a new will to live. Once I give up on one girl, I just find another one to become obsessed with.

 I'm only 15 in high school. I could have high grades, I get praise from my teachers of how smart I am, but can never do the work. My sleep schedule is affected because of my procrastination making me wake up early to do homework. Even though I end up not doing it when I wake up. I'm a compulsive liar and manipulative of those around me. I'm just bored of life. I don't find enjoyment in much things and I just hope my time comes soon.
