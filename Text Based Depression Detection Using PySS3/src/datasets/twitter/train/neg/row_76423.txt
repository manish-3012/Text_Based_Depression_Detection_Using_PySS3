OkayKinda surprised things got to this point. I remember things in the past were bad but, compared to how things are now I canâ€™t believe lifeâ€™s even real. 

All relationships in my life have come to an end, maybe for the best, but itâ€™s hard feeling betrayed by the ones you love. I cant be mad though  as Iâ€™m deserving of it all.

I think about the future and donâ€™t see myself forming any new relationships. Compared to my past self Iâ€™m practically brain dead, so I feel the future will likely be a lonely one.

Due to things, I feel embarrassed to be alive, and feel ashamed of what Iâ€™ve become. This alone pushes me towards the edge, but on top of feeling Iâ€™ve lost everyone in my life I just cba anymore 

I have a lot to be grateful for, and in a way I am. But I just donâ€™t wanna be alive anymore.I donâ€™t act on my thoughts because I wouldnâ€™t want to do that to my parents, but I just dunno anymore.
