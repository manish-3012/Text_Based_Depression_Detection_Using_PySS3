Iâ€™m really thinking about killing myselfIâ€™ve really noticed over this whole lockdown thing that no one gives a single fuck about me.
Everyone uses me and I feel I am worthless and just straight up useless. I have no talents no skills nothing . Iâ€™ve got no one to talk to. Girls use me for attention. My friends make no effort to talk to me and my parents donâ€™t believe I have depression. I know the words Iâ€™m gonna wright on my suicide note. I know where the gun is. I have no purpose so no one will miss me :).
