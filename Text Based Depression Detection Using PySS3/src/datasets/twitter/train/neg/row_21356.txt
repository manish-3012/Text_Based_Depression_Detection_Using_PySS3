I dont wanna die but my family makes me feel like i want toim basically stuck between my sister nagging me on what to do with my life when im already following what she wants me to do with my life ( my sister is the head of the family after my mom passed and my dad left 4 of us siblings, im the youngest in the family). she wants me to take the nclex and so i did, she wanted me to schedule it, so i did. she didnt like my schedule so she complained but i cant re schedule cos all the dates that are convenient for me are booked. right now im getting more shit from her saying that i never listened to her and that i wasted so much time preparing. i dont know anymore. this nclex is sort of a big deal to me cos its gonna make or break my career since its the only way i can transition from student visa to working visa or possibly green card status. i dont wanna live anymore, i feel like i havent even been living most of my life since my mom passed cos my sister always pushed her decision on me.
