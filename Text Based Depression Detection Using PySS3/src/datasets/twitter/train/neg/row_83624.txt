Didn't get the help I wanted because I'm not willing to cry for help irlI wanted to turn myself into a hospital because I've got to the point where I have my whole suicide planned out, but had a burst of motivation to get better and was willing to talk to someone. The suicide hotline told me not to turn myself into a hospital because I was pretty calm when I called them, and the hospital is mainly for people who are thinking like "I'm going to kill myself on Tuesday". So, I'm not going to be able to use that resource because I'm never going to say those words, because I will kill myself when I feel like it, and people aren't going to find out until I'm already dead. Since I don't have that available, I can't really get help in the way I want it. When I have a burst of motivation, I want to get my shit sorted out by working hard on my problems, so I won't drop as low next time. Instead, I can go to my therapist once every 1/2 weeks, and my doctor delayed my appointment because they don't know how close I am to committing suicide. I will never be able to tell people face to face how I feel unless I'm very drunk. I'm pissed because I have to purposely fail suicide for people to really get how I feel and help me out. I'm sorry I am so entitled nowadays, but I now know that they have these resources out there, and there are lots of people using them, and I'm not allowed to. Anyways sorry for the rant, and I mean no offense if you are the type who can tell people your feelings in person, I get that we all have problems and I hope you all get better soon. But I just wish I could be taken more seriously before I'm already dead.
