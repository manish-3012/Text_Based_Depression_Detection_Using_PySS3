I want to die but donâ€™t want to kill myselfIt feels like Iâ€™m living my life because my family wants me alive. I donâ€™t care about my life I donâ€™t find joy in anything anymore. My psychiatrist tells me to get a hobby but nothing is funny and I suck at everything I try to do anyway so why should I even try.

I donâ€™t have any friends anymore and my family donâ€™t understand how Iâ€™m feeling. 

I also lost my job because of my depression and anxiety. 


Iâ€™m a complete failure, I dont deserve to be alive.
