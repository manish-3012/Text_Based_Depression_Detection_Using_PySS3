I feel weird and ashamed that I secretly want to be put in a MH ward for a few daysI know how Weird it sounds but Iâ€™m overworked and my heart is broken and all of the depression Iâ€™ve fought off for years has come rushing back full force. I canâ€™t help but think maybe being put away for a few days wouldnâ€™t be the worst option. In fact I feel like Iâ€™d enjoy it (speaking from total ignorance.) I donâ€™t know what to do. My parents have called me everyday because theyâ€™re scared I will kill myself. Same goes for a select few friends. 

I want to go away but Iâ€™m also scared theyâ€™ll keep me for a very long time and I just canâ€™t accept that for now. Iâ€™m rambling but I figured this would be the best place to vent this. What do I do
