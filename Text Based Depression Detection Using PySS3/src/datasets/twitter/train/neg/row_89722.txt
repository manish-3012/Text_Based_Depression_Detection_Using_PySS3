My best friend is severely depressed and I don't know what I can do to help.My best friends since we were toddlers had gotten severely depressed over the last few years. Didn't really see it coming untill it was too late. Went to therapy, lied his ass off to 'test' the therapist. She failed the test and now he think therapy won't help him because he outsmarted her. Had a period of medication but wuit overnight because he didn't feel like it anymore. 
Had a talk with him and he says that if it wasn't for his brother that needed him and friends that will miss him, he would've ended it ages ago.
It looks like he simply gave up and doesn't want to be helped and is only here for other people and not himself. I'm afraid that he'll be gone in the nearby future. He had a pretty sucky childhood with awful parents. Not abuse or anything but just awful parenting in general. Little to no love there.
So I come to you. I know if someone doesn't want to be helped or help himself, I probably can't help him either. But is there anything I can do? I'm there for him and he knows it but I don't know what I can say or do to help him. Any advice?
