Don't know what to doHello. First of all, I want to apologyze in advance for my probable English faults, sorry about that. I would like to say that it's not likely that I kill myself, but I think I need to unburden properly, and, as a socilogy student, I think online faceless people can be what I need.
I'm a stupid useless person, and I know it. I don't blame anyone, I just blame me. I'm not intelligent, my grades are horrible, and I don't know anything. I'm pretty uncultivated, and I don't know how to do a thing: I can't play any instrument, I'm not good at drawing, I don't write properly and I'm not good at studying. That would be enough to kill myself, and I would do it, but I have a wonderful girlfriend who cares about me. She love me, and I love her. She's the most beautiful thing ever happened to me. The problem is that I don't want her to be with me, not because I don't want her (I'd do anything for her) but because I'm a useless piece of shit. I'm going to fail in everything, and I don't want to drag her with me. I want her to succed, to have a full life. She deserves it, and she doesn't deserve to stand me. I know I'm hurting her, she sais that it doesn't matter, because she loves me and she wants to bear with my illness.
I don't know what to do. I wish she realize what I am, and the harm I'm causing her.
