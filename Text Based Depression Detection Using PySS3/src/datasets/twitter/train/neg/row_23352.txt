Recurring Suicidal IdeationI pissed my best friend/roommate off today. We just moved into a new apartment and I lost our dogâ€™s muzzle that we use to keep him calmer outside. She was a little upset and started to tell me that it was my responsibility to pack it  etc, etc. Sheâ€™s right, of course, but in a fit of childish rage, I overturned a box that I though just contained doggy clothing and other soft things. There were breakable objects that she held dear at the bottom of that box and I broke two of them. She was so upset and started to cry. 

I feel so horrible for what I did, and normally when stuff like this happens, I start to almost fantasize about downing my bottle of Xanax and washing it down with alcohol. I hate myself and how childish I can be. I hate that I am mentally damaged. 

I then get caught in a loop of â€œI will make others feel awful if I killed my self&gt;Iâ€™m so stupid for even thinking this way&gt;Maybe I deserve to die for being so foolish&gt;I will make others feel awful if I killed myself&gt;etc, etc. 

A part of me feels like maybe I am trying to make this all about me by having suicidal thoughts and not focusing on how my best friend feels. Iâ€™m not the one who lost something cherished, but Iâ€™m the one who wants to kill myself.
