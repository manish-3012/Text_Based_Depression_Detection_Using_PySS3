even when i think things will change, hope crashesI really don't know how many more failures I can tolerate. Failures in school, relationships, work... Nothing seems to be going right. Yes, there's all that bullshit that I live a privileged life with many opportunities but it's all shit if I just am consumed by thoughts of ending my life every single day. 

I want change, and I'm not waiting for it to fall on my lap, I'm really fucking trying my best. But at some point, it's enough failures and it would just be easier to end it now.
