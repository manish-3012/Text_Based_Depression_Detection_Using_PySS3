Supporting an unemployed and suicidal SO?Sorry if you guys get a lot of posts like this, I'm new to the sub. 

The title pretty much says it all, my SO is going through a job loss, living back at home, and has recently expressed to me that he's contemplated suicide a lot recently. We've been together about 6 months, he's 28 and I'm 24. He's used to making good money, so being unemployed is a big hit to his ego. 

I try to help him identity his feelings, which are mainly worthlessness and the constant idea that he's a burden upon both his mother and myself. His job prospects are a little better than average, he has an extensive sales background, which i know he's capable of tapping into given the right opportunity, but he has a felony which, in our state, is just short of the non disclosure time minimum. 

Reddit, I love this man and see his full potential, but at the moment, he doesn't. I've read some of the sidebar posts, on how to emotionally support someone who is suicidal, but if anyone has any advice from a similar situation I'd love to hear it.
