The day is nearI have been depressed for a while now, and everyday I hit a new
low . I been a frequent cutter, but I stopped because basically
my mom is on surveillance all the time. I hate when people tell me
things like "oh you go to a good school", because I feel like that's the
only achievement in my life I've ever had. I am so lonely. I am so
anxious. I want to live and be happy... but I can't.

I will probably kill myself by bleeding out.
