Homeless and really struggling to find reasons not to kill myself. I need someone to talk to.I'll keep this as short as I can. So I'm a 30 year old male. Currently homeless, and have been off and on the past three years. Due to physical conditions (let alone mental), I am incapable of working more then 15-20 hours a week. Based on that I'll probably be homeless for at least another two years, assuming I successfully applied for social security and disability right now. I've tried to get lawyers to help but they all say I'm too young. I've also tried to apply myself online, but I'm a moron and can't figure it out.

Long story short, I always have suii thoughts, but lately there's more planning involved in my thoughts. I just don't think I can live like this anymore. Being homeless makes you feel less then human, looked down upon by everyone else in society.

I'm not looking for anyway to talk me down or try to solve my issues. I simply want a friend to talk with about boring day to day shit. Even living in a shelter surrounded by over 100 other dudes, I've never felt more alone.

Even better, I'm almost out of data and would have to give out my phone number. Assuming anyone would want to talk anyway.

Thanks for reading..
