.Hi. Im 21.im a girl  sorry for the bad English. Its not my first language. When i was 10 my father burned my hand because i shaved it cuz everyone at school called me a gorilla. At the age 12 i got raped bye 5 guys for a month or two. After that my father found out and beat the shit outta me and made my life hell. Didn't look at me for months and called me a whore. I started self harming and burning myself.  I started eating to stop the self harming and i got overweight.  My boyfriend left me cuz i was fat and ugly and we moved to another city. Didn't have friends growing up although i tried to be social . After years i found a good friend that moved to uk and it broke my heart.  I've been bullied all my life... even in college. I hate the way i look and i hate my body and my scars but i can't help it i just want to cut myself deeper and deeper.  Recently my boyfriend broke up with me and tonight my best friend told me im toxic. I hate my dad and i have bpd and i don't feel motivated anymore.  I don't like my hobbies anymore.  I feel useless and crazy and i feel like if i die i could make a lotta people happy. 
Even my sister isn't here with me . She moved to another country to study. Im gonna kill myself.  
I just felt like i wanted someone to know. 
I don't know why. I could've been a better person... but its too late now . I will always be a piece of shit fat whore for the rest of my life. I just wish i was dead the fist night they raped me... i just wish they killed me. I tried to kill myself couple of times but i failed... this time i won't i promise.  I don't know why im writing all this. But i just ... i don't know.
