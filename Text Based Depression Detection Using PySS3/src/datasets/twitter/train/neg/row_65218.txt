I survived fentanyl.

About 3 months ago I overdosed on fentanyl with what I thought was a basic oxycodone that I randomly did from time to time (MAYBE once a year) after being offered a few by a friend who got them for a good deal. I had no idea at the time the cartels were pressing pills and after taking one I went to black in a matter of minutes. My boyfriend realized something was wrong when my breathing sounded off and was rattling, as well as my mouth being blue. 

I saved a few because it was extremely peaceful in that I was completely unconscious and when I woke I felt like I was being removed from a warm black womb. I had paramedics around me asking me what I took and mentioning narcan. I felt I was dreaming and was astonished at how painless it was. 

Anyways, I saved two pills for that reason and 2 weeks ago I was pushed over the edge by some bullshit. I took a fleck off and started hallucinating. I texted my friend a few doors down and began to chew the pill like a cookie. Why he didn't call 911 is a mystery to me but I suffered the most horrific hallucinations and never want to go through that again. 

I need to live. I am a 37 year old widow with two kids who need me. Do I think suicide should be legal for the mentally ill? Yes. Im deeply and severely depressed and have been diagnosed since the age of 5 by my pediatrician, two years after being molested. Ive suffered more shit than I can endure and im still here. I hate myself even more for that moment of weakness and hate myself for even considering ending my life without caring about the consequences of leaving them. FUCK!!!!!!

I've tried to kill myself so many times and finally found the key to bliss and could sing the anthem to M.A.S.H. emphatically. 

**Through early morning fog I see

Visions of the things to be

The pains that are withheld for me

I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless

It brings on many changes

I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play

I'm gonna lose it anyway

The losing card of some delay

So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless



It brings on many changes

I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin

It doesn't hurt when it begins



But as it works its way on in

The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless

It brings on many changes



And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me

To answer questions that are key

Is it to be or not to be



And I replied oh why ask me

That suicide is painless

It brings on many changes

And I can take or leave it if I...




That suicide is painless

It brings on many changes

I can take or leave it if I please

That suicide is painless

It brings on many changes

And you can do the same thing if you please**



I've been attempting suicide since the age of 9 and I fucking sucked at it. When things got serious a few years ago, I jumped from overdoses to hanging and when I wrapped the fabric around my neck, testing the strength of my closet... I knew I needed help. I finally saw a psych and was diagnosed bipolar, but the meds don't really help. Therapy doesn't really help and just pisses me off. Ive been depressed for far too long and I feel like I'll never be relieved. 

I'm clamped here, stapled by obligation. Some people wish things would be better and believe they will be better with a spouse or kids, but it wont help. Nothing helps. They think that just because some people can get laid and they cant (incels) that it will make things better and it won't. Just like drugs won't. If anything, not having to experience love finally, and seeing the cold pallid corpse of the living and breathing spouse you had just hours ago in front of you, seems almost better. He died of suicide and I blame myself daily. Trust me because I've fucking lived it and fuck you if you think I have it easier. I am not ugly, I am not awkward, but the pain I have inside is no less real. Fuck you if you think that means anything because when you are mentally ill, you are mentally ill. It sucks no matter fucking what. Its not a goddamned competition. 

I am lucky (I guess) that I have survived and have now resigned myself to silent suffering. From this point I will no longer tell anyone of my true pain. At this point, its all smiles. Im going to fake it and talk only anonymously. Ill answer all the studies etc, but other than that I'm done. I have only one friend who calls me out on my plastic smile, and he is the one I will be most careful around. 

Fuck it. Ill die someday suicide or not. Im here because I fucking feel for you. I am one of you. Im so sorry, but just know you don't suffer alone.
