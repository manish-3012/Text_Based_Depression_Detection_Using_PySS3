How can I help my friend?Reddit, I am in need of advice. Earlier today, I discovered a post my friend submitted to /r/SuicideWatch about killing himself. He said something about how he was going to drown himself during a school trip to the beach. I am very concerned for my friend, and I don't know how to approach him about it. He mentions that it is difficult to find someone to talk to, and I want to try to be that person. Any ideas?
