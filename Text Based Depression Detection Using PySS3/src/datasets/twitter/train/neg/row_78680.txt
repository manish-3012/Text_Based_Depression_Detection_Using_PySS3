Brother May have suicide planMy brother's internet friend (most of his friends are from an online game)  just contacted me saying my brother plans to commit suicide in a week-long method starting in a few days.  He is living away at college in a single room, and has maybe one good friend on campus.  She showed me a text he sent her about how he thinks he will be able to go through with it this time.  
His friend informed me that he has tried before by attempting to freeze to death, among other ways that she has not told me about, and that his reasons are because of self-hatred.  He also has had delusions in the past (she says he needs professional help).  He also recently changed his facebook photo to a plain black image and his statuses have become a little odd.  He is supposed to come home from college for the weekend, and seemingly he plans to start the day he goes back to school after the weekend.  
This girl from what I remember has also attempted suicide in the past herself.  And a couple years ago there were calls to  suicide hotline on my brother's phone but supposedly those were regarding this girl and not him (now I'm not so sure). 

I don't usually talk to my brother about issues like this, never really have. And he was obviously keeping it from me and the family and only mentioned it to 1 or 2 online friends.

What should I do?  What should I not do? And what would be a possible week-long method he might be trying if he is serious?
