Im not going to terapy.because once you are diagnosed with "Mental illness" everything you think(your values, views, opinions) is treated like it is just the ramblings of a madman,like they dont have any value or merit.
What if i am depressed because i think Society is unfair, unjust and selective? i saw  how it was and I CREATED a view about it that utterly dissapointed me and made me wanna die, im not some Sick bastard that cant see things clearly DAMM IT.
