I have Tylenol and a bottle of gin. I'm giving myself 8 hours.There are somehow not enough tomorrows, yet far too many all at once. I've fought for too long to believe there's a point anymore, but only because there will never be enough time to make a good life for myself. I'm young, but I've seen everything I need to see. I've floundered between depression and anxiety and gender dysphoria and dissociation since day 1 and it hasn't let up once. The pain just keeps escalating. College, transition, finding love, I've failed everything long-term I've ever set my eyes on. Where I haven't grown lazy and complacent I've been actively torn apart. Shouted down and manipulated and used and raped. I regularly have dreams about the latter. I haven't learned how to live in spite of everything, only how to exist in alongside it. That's not fucking enough. I don't care at this point that hypothetically it could get better, because a hypothetical won't make the low points worth it. I took a leap of faith in therapy and hoped that they'd know something I don't, but they're just teaching me shit I already know. No one's telling me how I'm supposed to live with everything that's happened, let alone why everyone demands that I do as they own me. I've fought too long and I don't care anymore. I've played the game and I've lost and now I just want to rest.
