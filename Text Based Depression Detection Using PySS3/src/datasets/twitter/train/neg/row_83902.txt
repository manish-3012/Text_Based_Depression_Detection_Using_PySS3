In a state of limboI'm at a point in my life where I don't see any options left ahead of me. It's hard to describe, but I guess many people here know the feeling. I'm just existing and letting my problems close in on me. I don't know how to fix them, so I don't actively do anything anymore. They keep getting worse and now there's no way out.

I find myself reasoning that the only active thing left for me to do right now is suicide. I know the other seemingly valid options I should have (get help, call someone, move, make some change in my life) but I have justifications for not choosing to do any of them. In a sense I can't be here, but I won't survive anywhere else either.

The fear of death is still winning for now, so I'm just continuing to exist and waiting for the demons to gather. I feel ashamed of my inability to change anything, which only makes me want to escape even more.

I'm writing because this night is especially long and dark. I'm afraid and ashamed. I would like to do something, but I'm afraid of everything.
