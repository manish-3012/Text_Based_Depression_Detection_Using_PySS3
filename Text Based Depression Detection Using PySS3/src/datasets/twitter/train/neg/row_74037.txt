I just tried to hang myself. Iâ€™m desperate for a way out.I just tried to hang myself. I took my belt out to the garage and put it through one of the rafters. I hooked it together and attempted put my head in but I couldnâ€™t reach. This was eternally disappointing and ever since Iâ€™ve come inside, Iâ€™ve been looking up every pill in my house to see if I could overdose, painless ways to commit suicide, and ways to do it with common household items.

I have nothing. No gun, no sharp razors, no intense medications. Hanging myself was my only hope and I canâ€™t even do that right.

Iâ€™m not sure what to do now. I thought I was going to do it today. Thinking about being alive puts a heavy weight on my chest. I canâ€™t do this anymore but I canâ€™t find a way to kill myself.
