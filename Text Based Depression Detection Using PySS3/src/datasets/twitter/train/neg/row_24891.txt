I'm a Psycho and ought to end itSo I've been on SSRI antidepressants for years and I think it's safe to say they've scrapped me of any empathy or goodness I had in me.  I don't feel anything hardly. I barely careally about other people. I don't enjoy anything anymore.  I'm lazy. I have no plans for the future. 

I'm starting to wonder if I've always been like this really and am only just starting to see it clearly. I was sensitive but only to myself. I was always hugely self-centered. But I used to care more. I used to care about being a good person. I used to want to work hard. That's all gone now. 

I'm a selfish, shallow prick. All I think about is sex. Not love, not compinionship, just sex. I'm basically a psychotic robot and I don't want to be this person anymore. I think I should just end it. My friend, who I briefly dated, got raped and I felt nothing. I hate to say it. I wasn't happly about it of course. I'm not evil, just pathetic. But I felt nothing. What now? 

Fuck me. If I'd known this would the result I would've chosen my OCD over this any day.
