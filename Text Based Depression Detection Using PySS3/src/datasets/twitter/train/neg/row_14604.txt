Financial deprivation leading to emotional immolationI'm less than 2 months away from going homeless, and I have no idea how I would react in such an extreme, hopeless situation. Probably all my inhibitions and established psychological structure would melt away, and that wouldn't be good for anyone. I mean, I wouldn't even be able to eat. 

I tried to make $20 per day, which would be enough to cover all of life's expenses, but everything online is too  irregular and unstable to make that kind of money, not to mention that you are prohibited from most online earning opportunities if you don't live in US/Canada. And there is no work in real life where I live (eastern Europe).

It's just piles upon piles of useless advice on how to make online money if you happen to live in US and Canada, which can't be translated into anything applicable to my situation.

I've cut ties with my horrible, toxic family a long time ago and never had any friends. I don't even have online acquaintances, so I'm completely out of any social networks except this sterile, online one.

Any ideas as to what I can still do in order to not descend into hell?
