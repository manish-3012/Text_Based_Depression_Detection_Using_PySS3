helping a friend's suicidal boyfriend 

# Hi, i'm Lucas i live in NZ and i have a friend who has been dating this guy for about 3 month now. she like him but his mental health issues are becoming too much of a strain on her own life. he was abuse as kid and his panic attacks and depression on a regular bases. the worse part of it those is that he is very suicidal and self-harming, his has also try to kill himself several times. he takes med and I've told him to talk to me about his issues because i have personal experience and I've read a lot about of psychology books/articles so i know some techniques that can help him. but tbh my friend doesn't really like him anymore, i mean she likes him as a person but his problems are over weighting what she likes about him. and she has own mental health issues, so she can relate. but she scared that if she breaks up with him, he could commit suicide. and he's been texting non stop all day and i just don't how to help the two of them. soz didn't time to check grammar i'm stressing a bit
