I'm not meant for being aliveI have so many reasons to be happy. I moved out of the town I hated from a job I hated going to. I'm working a job I generally enjoy. I'm closer to a few people I still call friend, and I guess I would have opportunities to make new friends if I had the time, money, or drive to do so. Despite all that, I don't want to be here, or anywhere. I go to the gym and go hiking regularly. I had a surgery I desperately needed a few months ago, and it went well and I'm generally please with it. I'm glad that I had it, but it still doesn't change how I feel about everything else.

I pay my own rent and utilities, but I still can't afford any of my insurance so my mother pays for them. So I'm a leech on her. I already attempted suicide once a few years ago and only ended up spending 8 days in a psychiatric facility. I don't want to go back to a place like that, because it means I failed. I tried pills last time. All that came of it was that now I can't feel my stomach. Can't tell when I'm hungry, full, ill, or anything. So not only did I fail in what I set out to do, but I screwed myself up even more.

Living is hard, and I'm not cut out for being alive.
