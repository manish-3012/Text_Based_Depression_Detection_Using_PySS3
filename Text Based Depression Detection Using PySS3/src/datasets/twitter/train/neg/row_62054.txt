Almost a year later, same issues. Ending things tonight.It's been almost a year  since my last posting, and I'm  really don't know how I got through the nine months. I've  passed my thirty-third birthday with no dates and my life is exactly the same. The past nine months have solidified what I've known all along.  I realize how I can't live without being married. I swore to myself that if I didn't meet anyone by my 33rd birthday I would get my Affairs in order and kill myself within six weeks. 

The six weeks have passed and even though I've taken several vacations and trips and traveled and gotten involved in my community and gone to lots of classes and therapy, I haven't met anyone. I realize that I'm not worthy of any relationship. If  I were  what people want to date then people who have no business being in a dating relationship would not be in a relationship and I would be. 

 So I have six hours until I end it all forever. All I'm doing is trying to figure out what to do with these last 6 hours.
