Life is pointless.I realized after being inside for 5 weeks and away from work that life is 1000% useless. I hate going to fucking work every single day for 13 hours a day, 6 days a week. I get some time off and Iâ€™m absolutely fucking bored.
I figured it out, life is pointless and I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I was abused my whole childhood by a babysitter to my step dad. Iâ€™m fucking tired of this life. Iâ€™m so sick of waking up every day to see others so happy while I pray and pray I get what I want. Well I wonâ€™t so Iâ€™m pulling the trigger.
