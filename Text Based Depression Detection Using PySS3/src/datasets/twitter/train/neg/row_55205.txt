Suicide or run away, please helpI hate living in this house. It is hell, torture day after day. My mom and her endless irrational anger, my sister and her manipulative conflict stirring and backbiting, her loud and obnoxious kids who don't have a care in the world for anyone else, my asshole brother who looks at me with disgust and avoids every room I enter. I just want to be out. I screwed up my life big time. I got kicked out of school and wasted a ton of money on entertainment, which was all confiscated recently. My future is nonexistent at this point, yet I am powerless to change it. My life is now being micromanaged and I'm no longer trusted to make any decisions. It's completely out of my hands now. I stayed up all night thinking and I decided I have two choices: suicide or run away. I'm 20 so technically it wouldn't be running away, but I have no job nor any savings and nowhere else to stay. I'd be living on the streets with hardly any stuff and no food. I tried looking up info on how to successfully get away but it's all too much. Getting robbed or arrested or abducted, having to sleep behind buildings in the cold, having to resort to stealing food and possibly landing in jail. And I seriously doubt I would ever land a job living on the streets. Even now I couldn't get hired so why would it work out there, where I'd be all dirty and unkempt. So I decided to kill myself. I don't know how but living here I don't have many options. I figure stabbing myself with heavy duty scissors will work fine. Please someone help me. I can't call a hotline, I will be heard and I'll get in trouble. Someone please just help me, I just need to be dead. I need to disappear, I can't take this any longer help please.
