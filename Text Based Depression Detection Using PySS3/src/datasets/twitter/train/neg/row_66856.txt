Wondering if anyone else is in the same boat.On Sunday I lost my job suddenly. I was let go without warning. I was so sad because all of my "friends" worked there, including my "best friend". All day Monday I was hoping to hear from one of my "friends". It's friday and not one of my so called "friends" has reached out to me. It is crushing me everyday. Not even the person I considered my best friend has even messaged me to say hello. I feel tossed aside and alone. I have had constant anxiety since Sunday with no break. Yesterday I thought about hurting myself and killing myself. I am always thinking about killing myself lately. I feel alone and worthless. I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't want to wake up lately. Everyday I wake up I am panicking and sometimes crying because I have no happiness in my life. I don't want to do anything. The usual things I find happiness in don't bring me that anymore. I want to die. I have always considered myself broken and this only confirms it. My "best friend" was the first one I had ever had in life. Guess I was lead astray into thinking that. All I do now is apply for jobs, think about hurting myself, think about killing myself, cry, and have a constant and never ending anxiety attack. All I want to do right now is hurt myself. I hate everything right now. Nothing brings me happiness. I have no one. I am no one.
