I've pushed everyone away and now I've got no one0 friends. 0 family. I know I've done it myself but I just don't want to be seen or talk much in this state. I keep hoping this horrible feeling just vanishes but it never does. Just hopeless now..  I'm stuck... trapped in a body I can't feel joy in. It's like I'm not even in my own body.. Just on autopilot. I hate myself. I've ruined everything. But then again I deserve this. I'm such a shitty person.
