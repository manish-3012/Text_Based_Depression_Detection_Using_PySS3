I'm finally seriously considering suicideI don't know what the fuck happened. I was doing so well. Then I just suddenly stopped eating. I have no energy, no joy. 

I just ruined my friends board game night because I was so quiet and mopey the whole time. I know they were glad when I left. I should have left sooner. 

My life is going nowhere. I'm a broken waste of resources. I know nobody will read this. I just want to get this off my chest. I also want to cry but I can't because I'm not right.
