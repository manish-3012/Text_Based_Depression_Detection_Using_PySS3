SomeoneWhat is wrong with me, is it my fault? I lost all sense of morals at this point because I'm always the issue. Im gender dysphoric as hell, no matter what someone always has it worse though. I haven't seen my friends for months, someone always has it worse. My parents refuse to call me their son, but they didn't kick me out, they still hold it above my head like a threat. That's what they did with transferring schools 'hey stop acting like that, its not like we transferred your school' not even a week later they did. What's next? Will it keep getting worse? They won't ever let me see my friends again, they won't ever let me see my old school where I was respected because 'being trans is a trend being pushed down your throat' I'll never hear my name again, just a reminder of what I can't leave behind. I can't fucking talk to them about how I feel, every time they say I'm selfish because they're trying so hard to 'help' (convert) me and I'm not thinking about their feelings. No matter what I do I'm selfish, that's all I am. I'm just a punishment
