I canâ€™t think of something to put here that isnâ€™t a clicheI feel like nobody cares about me. Like actually cares about me as a person. If I disappeared, I could easily just fade into the fabric of time and be forgotten or remembered as a vague fleeting thought. I never wanted to be important but I feel so alone in life and the world that I just donâ€™t care anymore about whatever is going on. I have a job, I have a roof over my head, I am managing to put food on my table but I just donâ€™t care anymore and it makes me fucking hate myself. Why canâ€™t I count myself lucky for the fortune Iâ€™ve had in just being able to live on my own? Everyone I try to reach out to in order to catch up or see or even fucking be around in is doing something with their lives and I am just rotting in my apartment alone, working to pay rent and eat but not moving forward. It never used to be like this, I had so much hope for myself but I wasted my goodwill on myself and stupid platitudes about how itâ€™ll get better soon. Itâ€™s not getting better. I sought and got help. It didnâ€™t get better. I started being fully self-sufficient. It didnâ€™t get better. What the fuck kind of a life is working 50 hours a week to have shit all time and still end up with no money or savings at the end of the week because living costs me everything?
