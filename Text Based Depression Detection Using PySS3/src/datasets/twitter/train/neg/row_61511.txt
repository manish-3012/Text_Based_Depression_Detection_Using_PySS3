I'm going to do it.I think I'm just going to fucking do it already. I thought maybe there might be something worth sticking around for. But I'm just a burden on everybody in my life, I fucking know I am. Nobody just has it in them to tell me to my face. 

People can stop pretending like they care and sure as hell don't show up at my funeral acting like you were my best friend.
