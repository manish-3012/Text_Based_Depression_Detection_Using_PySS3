I hate myself so muchmy mom and dad would be better off without having to pay for me and all my bullshit and my brothers and sister just think i'm fucking worthless. i'm tired of talking to people and bothering them with my problems when they don't even care and probably just sit and talk about me when i'm not there anyway.

i'm sick of living, i'm sick of wanting to die every single day and i'm sick of having panic attacks, i'm sick of spending every night thinking about ways I could kill myself and why I should do it. I wake up every morning hating myself and who I am. I spend every day wanting to die. i've felt this way for 10 years, it's never going to stop or go away. the few friends i have are better off without me anyway. how could they want to deal with someone like me every day when i don't even want to

i just want one day. one day where I feel happy and i dont want to die, but I guess that's not going to happen
