I donâ€™t mean anything to anyoneIâ€™ve come to the realization that donâ€™t matter to anyone. No one wakes up and thinks good or bad about me. Iâ€™m invisible to everyone, â€œgood ole Chrisâ€ heâ€™s always the nice guy when people want something from me. I think I must be deficient somehow because while a social person and love meeting and talking to people, I just canâ€™t figure out how to make friends. Iâ€™ve gone to meetup groups but everything Iâ€™ve tried seems fake. I am bipolar and have BPD, so that may be a cause or the root of my problem. But Iâ€™m 42 and Iâ€™m alone without any friends. At this point in the game of life I think itâ€™s too late for me. I want the rest of this life to be mercifully short.
