I don't think me being alive is usefulI don't think my existence has really helped anyone I love, all it has done is cause problems. All I have done is cause problems. My entire life, 20 years, I've been nothing but a nuisance. I ruin everyone I love. Like literally zero value addedðŸ˜…. I'm too scared to kill myself but I hope something will. I hope it won't be too painful.  I don't actively actively want to die but I'd be okay if I did. Less problems eh? Not just for me, for everyone who loves me. 
I am my own worst enemy.
