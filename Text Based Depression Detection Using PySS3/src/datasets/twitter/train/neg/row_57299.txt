Suicide in Portland, ORI've booked my flight. I used to live in Portland, but I made the stupid mistake of moving across country, to live closer to family.

When I get to Portland, I'm taking an Uber to a bridge, and then I'm jumping. No return flight, no hotel, no Airbnb, no seeing anyone. I'm done.

It's a beautiful city that I've always loved. I promised myself, years ago, that I would die in the Pacific Northwest. It's my only real home.
