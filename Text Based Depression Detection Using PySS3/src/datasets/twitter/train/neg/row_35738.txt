The hate is neverending.I've grown bitter over the years. I'm envious of pretty much everyone and it's driven me to the point of wanting to take my own life.

I hate women. I hate attractive people. I hate celebrities,,athletes and millionaires. I hate couples. I hate smart people. I hate tall people. 
I hate my job and my life. I cannot stop comparing my experiences to everyone's.

Idk what posting here will do because I feel I've already made up my mind and have begun taking the steps to end my suffering within the next couple of weeks.

If only I had a different life and was a different person.
