I don't see why I shouldn't do itI'm alone, pathetic, failing most of my classes, and unloved. I'm literally lying in my bed hugging a pillow. How much more worthless can you get? 

There's a knife a few feet away. All it would take is a couple of movements, and it would all be over. Or I could just take a few bottles worth of pills. So many possibilities. All lead me to happiness. So easy. 

It's not like anyone would miss me. Probably would be glad to be rid of me. 

Whatever. Not like you guys care. Nobody does.
