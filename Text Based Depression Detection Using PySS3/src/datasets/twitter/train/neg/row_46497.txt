I want to end the pain and sufferingAll throughout my childhood, I was abused physically and sexually. From the age of 6-11 and then again at 15 from several people, including my father. He was an alcoholic and drug addict. I am 21 now, and I can't get past it. I tried ending my life 2 weeks ago, and nothing has gotten better since. I started talking to a physiatrist, but that isn't helping. I have no friends because I'm a shy person, and for obvious reasons - I have no family. I literally have no one, and I mean that. I have a job, good income, good health. But that isn't enough for me. It isn't keeping me happy. Everyday I cry, everyday I want to end it. This is the lowest I bave ever felt, and I am over feeling this way. I want the pain to end, once and for all.
