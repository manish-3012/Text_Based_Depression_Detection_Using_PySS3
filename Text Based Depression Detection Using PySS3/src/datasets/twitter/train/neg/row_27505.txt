Real Talk From A Real ManHere is some real talk. When you are fat no one wants you. When you are ugly others recoil at your countenance. When you are mentally ill people distance themselves from you. It's just a fact of life when these three things align, you are for sure sentenced to a life of loneliness and regret. I know the sweat of desperation as you lay in bed wondering if anyone outside of your family even cares if you slip a noose around your neck. If you take too many pills, or you slit your wrists. All you can do is take the last exit life gives as a do over. Maybe next time I will be Attractive, Intelligent, Funny, and Strong. But, not this time. Not this night. I'm tired of going through life alone. I'm so tired....I'm exhausted by the weight of disappointment in not only myself but in others I have trusted. In the end all you get for your efforts is pure clean silence. 
So it's in this silence, that I write my letter, to my one friend, and to my family. Hopefully they will forgive me, but I'm tired of being everyone's reusable last option.
