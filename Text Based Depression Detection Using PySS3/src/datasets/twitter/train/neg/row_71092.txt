All over the placeI always felt mentally stable. I get anxious but I donâ€™t have anxiety. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m depressed or anything. I just have a darkness. I feel used to feel things now I mainly feel numb. My business is doing good. My family life is okay. My social life is good. Why canâ€™t I just be normal again? I always envision my future but yet I want to die. I never thought myself as suicidal but I donâ€™t want to live anymore, When Iâ€™m on a busy street. I hope someone will run me over and kill me.

Is anyone else like this? I donâ€™t know what to make of my thoughts.
