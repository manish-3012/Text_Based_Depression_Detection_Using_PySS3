NumbI am feeling empty, to the point of suicidal thoughts. I feel alone; I just moved across country and haven't made friends. I try all I can to make friends, but it doesn't work. My friends from home don't reach out to me, making me feel replaceable. All I can say to my boyfriend is "idk" when he asks what's wrong. It's to the point I need professional help to get the thoughts out of my head. I grew up all fucked up, and have always felt this way, but now I am starting to become emotionless to it all. I want to try and live a reasonable life, but so far I am failing. 

Sorry for keeping it so vague.
