I hate safetyMy house is so safe. My parents have all of the razors hidden, all the accessible pills arent lethal and any other method of suicide would be too slow and i would get found by the many people i live with. i would turn to my friends, but i made the mistake of having a load of friends so now i dont have any close friends who i can rely on. ive tried going to my school and they didnt do anything. even though i know it isnt true, it feels like nobody cares about me and yet they still dont want me gone. i had a few days off school recently and everyone seemed to notice despite nobody ever talking to me usually. i wish i had some way to die and end my lifes torment but every way is unreliable and dying would "be a waste of my potential" which i cant even live up to thanks to my constant stresses and worries.

It seems so nice, death. just an emptiness. it would be better than this pain that will never go away. i dont want to die necessarily, but i dont want to be alive. if there was any other option i would take it in an instant, but for now i must settle for waiting for the day when safety isnt ever-present.
