I've been weak lately, advice neededAt least once per week I think about suicide. I know, its selfish.

I just don't like how the world is. Most people are conceited and will walk all over you if you give them a chance.

I'm not outgoing, I spend most of my time watching tv shows or playing video games. I work part time but that's it. (I was studying at a local university but my student loan didn't go through so I had to drop out in November)

Like I said, I don't like how the world is, and at times (like now) I find myself thinking about how easy it would be to jump infront of a train or something. I know I probably won't do it, I don't wanna put my family through that, and I know that I'd probably be forced to reincarnate back here and I really don't want that either.

I guess what I'm asking for is advice on how to not be so weak. How can I carry on living and be "normal" with seeing the world as I see it? (unlike most people, I see things clearly. Not just the world, but people too. I'm a natural truth seeker and sometimes wish I could just forget how I see things and be asleep like most of the people out there.)

tldr: shame on you! It's Friday evening, I'm 23, and thinking about suicide, yay.
