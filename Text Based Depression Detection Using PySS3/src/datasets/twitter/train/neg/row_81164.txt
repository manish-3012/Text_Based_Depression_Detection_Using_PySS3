crushed by societyup until this year i have been pretty naive to the world around me. then this year i started to take a class that forced me to look at the world around me. books like â€œishmaelâ€ have exposed me to the truth of our society. itâ€™s hard to explain but now i feel like i have this profound knowledge of the universe that nobody else around me does. i donâ€™t want to be a part of this society that is destroying the earth and its helpless peoples. i want to break the chain and show the world that i would rather die than be a useless human who lives an average, pointless life. i have to get a job or ill starve on the streets. i have to graduate college or iâ€™ll never get a job. i have to graduate high school or iâ€™ll never get into college. the world and its rulers are corrupt and suppress any enjoyment i could imagine myself having. the people around me are so ignorant and it drives me insane. my parents are supportive but i donâ€™t really have a connection with them. maybe itâ€™s just a teenage thing but i seriously have a hard time even just making small talk with them. itâ€™s not their fault but i feel awful for making them feel like bad parents. after my first attempt, both my parents were completely ruined. i cant talk to them about how i feel because iâ€™m afraid theyâ€™re going to send me back to the hospital or get disappointed in me. i donâ€™t have anyone that understands me. i get my hopes up just to inevitably get more crushed than before. people are disappointing and i know people care about me but i still feel alone. i wanna die so bad . if anyone knows how i feel or just can support me please let me know iâ€™m starting to get scared.
