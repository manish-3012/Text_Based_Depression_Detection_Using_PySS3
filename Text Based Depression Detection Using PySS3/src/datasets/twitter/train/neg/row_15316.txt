I wish I wasnâ€™t so afraidFor as long as I can remember fear has controlled my life. Fear has kept me from making the decisions I wanted to make, and I havenâ€™t accomplished anything because Iâ€™ve always been so afraid of failure. I have binge eating disorder, and I am obese. I am so overweight that my health is poor as a result, but food seems to be the only thing that brings me any comfort these days. Without it I honestly feel like Iâ€™m going to die because the stress and loneliness is too much to bear

The only thing I can think about from day to day is the fact that Iâ€™m not doing what I wanted to do in this life. And I donâ€™t feel like I can change things. I feel like the person I am, the failure I am, is exactly what Iâ€™m going to be forever and I just canâ€™t handle that. I wish that I was different, but Iâ€™m not. I donâ€™t know how to change. I feel like I have already messed up too much and thereâ€™s no fixing what I have done. I feel like Iâ€™m too old, too unhealthy, Iâ€™ve just screwed up too much
