Stuck in a foreign country with my girlfriend in a place I'm not welcomeAfter some Christmas drama , my girlfriend's mom just told me ( without my girlfriend present ) that I'm unhelpful around the house and don't do anything other than stay at the computer . That her daughter and her have to do everything ( which I think it's unfair cause I really do try to help as much as I can ) and that she doesn't feel comfortable in her own house and that I'm the problem , among other stuff too.

For some context , I have moved to another country to meet my girlfriend while she lives with her mom. I've been here for 8months now and finding a job has proven to be harder than I expected even with me having some decent qualifications. Needlessly to say , I feel utterly useless not being able to contribute a lot to the house, from groceries expenses to living and etc. My girlfriend makes enough money to comfortably afford it all , but obviously this is not my desired outcome . I am out of money at this moment , stuck in a country that is foreign to me in a house where I'm starting not to be welcome anymore. I do not want to ask my family for help because I do not want to give them that burden and have them help me over and over . I am seriously lost and am desperately needing some guidance , please
