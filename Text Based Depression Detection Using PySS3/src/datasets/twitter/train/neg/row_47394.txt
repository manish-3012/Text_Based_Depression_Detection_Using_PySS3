Why am i still alive?It's not like anyone NEEDS me. It's not like i bring anything to the table. Everyone is moving forward and i'm stuck in the same place i've always been. I've never had a job and i don't have friends because of social anxiety, I dropped out of hs and college, and i'm probably gonna drop the EMS program i'm in. I have no motivation to do anything at all and now i'm just numb. Why is it so hard for me to function? Why am I even still alive? I keep trying to find a little bit of hope for my life and my future, but there's none. At this point, the only reason i'm still around is because i'm afraid that i'll fail at killing myself and i don't wanna feel guilty after everyone has bombarded me with questions and pity and tears. But eventually, i don't think that'll be enough to stop me from doing it.
