The climax of anger and discomfortI currently lay awake in my bed. My mind cannot stop racing. Despite, I can't even think what to type.

Anger is my most significant problem and it leads to more anger and more discomfort. I'm angry because I have no voice. NOBODY to voice my troubles, NOBODY to outlet my problems. They build and build. I have afew friends, no girlfriend, and a mother and father. I'd never pour emotional and psychological problems onto my friends, ever. I haven't had true companionship with a female in a solid 3 years. Regarding my parents, my mother is a damn dirty drunk who I find no comfort with. It's all about her. She loves to ridicule, belittle and degrade. My father has lung cancer and loves to wallow in self-pity. It's evident he doesn't care for my struggles or my achievements. I hope to be an accountant and just yesterday I told him my final grade in my managerial accounting class was a 98. I thought he'd be proud but I got a unfelt "good job" and a phony goddamned handshake, that's it. If they cant even appreciate my achievements, it's no wonder they cant genuinely listen sympathize for my problems. 

I have no sole source of anger, but I do believe there is a tipping point in which an explosion will become ultimate. I find true rage to be euphoric, because it is a TEMPORARY RELIEF to ALL my problems. Unfortunately, true rage always comes at the expense of others. A truly unfortunate day for them.

I was going to end there. If there was one wish in the goddamned filthy world I can be granted, itd be a simple walk through New York City on a cold winter day with a light snow. I couldn't bring myself to cry until this moment, as I type this, as I imagine this one simple wish. If a body catch a body coming through the rye.
