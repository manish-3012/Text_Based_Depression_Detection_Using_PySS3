Tattooing suicide noteI think I've finally crossed the line from being depressed to being suicidal, I dont feel guilty about it because I think everybody secretly thinks I am a burden anyways. Figure it'd be pretty unique if I got my suicide note tattoed to my back before I go. Still have a few things I would like to try before I cancel my subscription, but there's something peaceful about planning ahead. I think that I'm finally ok with the idea of nothingness and the great beyond.
