"Mum would be sad" is basically all I have leftI don't understand it. I don't have the worst life. When I read the posts of others I'm shocked about what they have to go through. I can't imagine their amount of pain. But still I don't want to go on anymore. I want it all to end and the only thing against suicide that comes to my mind when I think about it, is "Mum and Dad would be sad". 

What is wrong with me?
