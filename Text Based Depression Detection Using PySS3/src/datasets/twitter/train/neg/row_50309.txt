I just donâ€™t want to feel so bad anymore.Before I start I want to say that Iâ€™m not going to commit suicide, but I do have thoughts of it. My second thing I want to say is I doubt youâ€™ll read all of this (and thatâ€™s perfectly fine) but if you do then thank you so much for your time. So I guess it all started back when I was 7 years old and the most important person in my life (my nana) died to cancer. She used to spend so much time with me so it hit me like a truck when she died. Years later I started thinking about life as more and more people seemed to drift out of it and ultimately abandon me. In the end, my thoughts turned to narcissism and pessimism. Every day I struggle seeing the good side of things, an example being if I won the lottery I would be more focused on the taxes Iâ€™d have to pay on the prize than I would be on winning it. This led to anxiety, stress, feelings of worthlessness, and so on. I could go into more detail on my life but I feel like Iâ€™ve taken up enough of your time so thanks for reading if you made it this far and I hope you have a great day.
