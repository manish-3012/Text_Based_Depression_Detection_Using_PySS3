Want to kill myself after work todayI decided last night I would do it. I know exactly how I'm going to do it, where, when.

I've been casually suicidal all week thinking about dying but now I feel better that I have an actual plan.

Idk part of me wants everything to change so I don't have to kill myself but I know nothing will change so I don't really have a choice if I want to stop suffering.

On the other hand I could take my meds and go see my doctor but I don't want to try anymore. So I guess it's my fault.

Idk what even the point of posting this is maybe I want to change my mind maybe I want someone to say my life will turn around but even if they did I know my life won't turn around and that's just wishful thinking.

I guess this is pointless.

I'm so stupid.
