Reasons to live?Are there really any good reasons to live? I currently stay alive because I love my cats and partners, but that's pretty much it. I have other "unimportant" reasons, like the tv show bob's burgers, but I mean, sure, I love it, but if I die, then it doesn't really matter. This doesn't truly bring me the feeling that I need to stay. Life is kind of meaningless when you think about it. Sometimes I just want to stay under the blankets forever with my partner's jacket and wait for it to end. Isn't this all we're doing? Just waiting for it to end?
