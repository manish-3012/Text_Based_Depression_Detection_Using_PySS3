I just want to be physically done.Even in a sea of people, in a place thatâ€™s supposed to be meaningful for me, Iâ€™m holding back tears and a massive breakdown. Everything in my life is a mess and Iâ€™m so beyond lonely I canâ€™t stand it. Why continue to walk this life when youâ€™re rejected by everyone. I keep trying to find a reason Iâ€™m still breathing but even through goals and help keeping my new apartment from crisis centers and a job I enjoy, I canâ€™t keep from falling apart anymore. I have no spark left and I just wish I could find a meaningful connection that doesnâ€™t reject me, for just once.
