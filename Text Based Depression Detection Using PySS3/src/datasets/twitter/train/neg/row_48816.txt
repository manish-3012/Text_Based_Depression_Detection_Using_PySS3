Thanks everyone who spoke to me, but i made up my mind.I realized I can't bear to return home. The decision is liberating. For the first time in a long time, I have clarity, I have a purpose. It's gonna be all right. The world goes on. Thank you for being there for me and sharing my last moments. Take care.
