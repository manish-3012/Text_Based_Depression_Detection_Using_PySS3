PromisesI decided I'm gonna try. Ditched my plan of killing myself tonight. I'll see if I can keep going. How long.

He said I can't do it because I promised. That is true. But he promised he wouldn't leave and yet it happened. I guess I'll just try to stay strong a bit longer and in the end if it's impossible, I'll give up. I'm doing it for him. Because I still love him. Because he is the best person I've ever had even though it's all ended.

I'll keep posting, I know, because I need to vent. I just need some comfort. Some love. I'm gonna go keep my mind busy now.

People on here are great. I appreciate everyone who is putting up with my posts.
