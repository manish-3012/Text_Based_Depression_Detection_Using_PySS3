Me Just Trying to be a good personI'm only 13. Last year I met this dude on a video game. A week later after getting to know him he tried to OD. Before that he put something in a discord chat that he was going to kill himself. I helped him through it. Almost 1 year 2 months later (today) Another friend of mine decided to do the same. I still don't know if he is ok. (will keep updated). After a game of league of legends he got really mad in voice chat. HE was also dealing with this other dude saying he was going to kill himself if the first guy didn't fully forgive him (because he fucked up really bad saying he was going to do someone thing to first guy's friend). So that mixed with this is really getting me fucked up man. Oh yeah i forgot to mention even before of all of this this other dude was popping pills. That was all today. Someone please help me. All of my online friends have serious depression.
