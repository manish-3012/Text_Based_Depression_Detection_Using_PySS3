helplessi donâ€™t know how to even start this thing, iâ€™m sitting at a sheetz smoking cigarettes at 11 at night because i fuckin hate this life man. everything stems from this one fucking girl iâ€™ve been with on and off for the past 3 years and i canâ€™t help but fucking love her. sheâ€™s my everything and the only thing that makes me happy. but then sheâ€™s also the fucking person who makes me lose my god damn mind. i swear iâ€™m going crazy. every day feels like a cycle where i wake up and either go to work for 10 hours or go to class. i only ever want to talk to my girl but half the time she doesnâ€™t want to talk to me and then makes me feel bad for it. but sheâ€™s literally the only thing in my life that makes me happy. iâ€™m working 40 hours a week and going full time to college and the only highlight in my day is if she responds to my texts or if we hangout or see each other of anything. fucking christ. this probably doesnâ€™t even make sense because my mind is in a haze. i havenâ€™t been able to think clearly for the past year and itâ€™s effecting everything in my life. my life is fucking falling apart. all i want is to be happy again, i donâ€™t remember what it even feels like to wake up and not be depressed and sad all day. i donâ€™t have any fucking friends anymore, everyone i talked to or associated with doesnâ€™t hit me up or talk to me anymore for whatever reason. i canâ€™t help but feel like everything in my life is falling apart around me and i canâ€™t stop it. i canâ€™t tell you how many times iâ€™ve thought of killing myself. this only reason i havenâ€™t done it yet is because in november my cousin took his own life and i saw first hand what it did to my family. he was the same age as me. my grandfather took his own life before i was even born and i know how much itâ€™s effected my father and grandmother even if it was 30 years ago. thatâ€™s the only reason i havenâ€™t fucking done it yet. this life is fucking insane and i canâ€™t help but feel helpless. everything is fucking torture.
