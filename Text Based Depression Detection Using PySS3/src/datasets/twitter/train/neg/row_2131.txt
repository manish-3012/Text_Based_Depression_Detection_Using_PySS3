I attempted todayGoing to keep this short, found out my ex is engaged and drove me over the edge. Cried for 30 minutes, then attempted (will not describe the method) and then called my 2 good friends and told them. They now put me on suicide watch (didnt call the cops or anything). I am a mess. This is not the real me.
