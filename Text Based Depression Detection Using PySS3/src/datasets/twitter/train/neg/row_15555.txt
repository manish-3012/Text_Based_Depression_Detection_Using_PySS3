No job, no money, no prospectsI decided to go back to school to get a degree so that employers would even look at my resume. This was my last option and I can't do it. I've now had a panic attack in **both** classes that I'm in and I don't think that I can see this through. I have no other option though. If I don't pass my English class, I'm no longer allowed to go to school at the college I'm going to. If I can't finish college, I'm not long for this world. I can't do this shit anymore. Severe panic attacks in class aren't conducive to me or others learning and it's killing me. Literally.
