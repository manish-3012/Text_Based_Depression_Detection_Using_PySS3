If everything will go the way it goes now i should be dead by Sunday.Im just gonna go as far from the city as i can, hopefully after sunset cause i want to see it for the last. Then ill just find a tree and hang myself. I can stop worrying about school and all the projects that i didnt do, no need to worry about a future, and it will end the pain for once.
