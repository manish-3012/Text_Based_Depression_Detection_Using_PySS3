I Have Thoughts of Wanting to Die AgainI suffer with depression and anxiety and take medications to help me cope from day to day. I often go weeks just feeling nothing and then weeks being in a massive slump that I canâ€™t eat, sleep, go out much, work, study or do anything. Iâ€™ve been in a bad place for longer than usual this time, itâ€™s been several months and I have fallen behind on uni and other things as a result which only served to worsen my anxiety.

Itâ€™s not a story I tell or like to think of but I have tried to kill myself a couple of times over the last couple of years and the thought of doing it has recently crept up on me and itâ€™s on my mind almost constantly. I struggle to get to sleep so Iâ€™ve resulted to taking a handful of pills before I get into my bed every night for the last few months and after about an hour or two Iâ€™m out, usually for over 12 hours... which neither serves me any joy but also ruins my chances of ever catching back up on the work I have neglected to do.
