I don't hate youI almost killed myself because of you, but I don't hate you. Trust me, I've tried. I've tried finding things that I disliked about you and multiplied them by a thousand and here I am, I still don't hate you. You're just a human being who is fucked up and jaded just like me. Sure, you may not be depressed and suicidal, but nonetheless you're a narcissist who doesn't know who he is. You're one person to your family, and then another person to your friends. In the mist of all that, you don't know who you really are. 

Sometimes I wonder if I'm dead to you. Then other days, I wonder if you think about me. Here and there, I'll get some "sign" from the universe that you thought of me. Some song we liked playing in the background, or some phrase you used to say that was reiterated by someone else, or that french bulldog we always wanted just suddenly reappears walking down the street. But maybe the sign from the universe is all bullshit. Maybe what we had was a lie, a farce. It was never meant to be. Or maybe it was. Or maybe we're fucked up, or the world is too fucked up and imbalanced to even maintain a healthy, loving relationship. Fuck do I know, maybe that's why I'm writing here. 

By the way, I'm not depressed and suicidal anymore. I'm better now. If only you were patient with me and just waited. I actually found the right balance of natural medicine that saved my life and I feel more normal than I ever have in my entire life. But I guess that's your loss now. 

I will always love you (but from a distance).
