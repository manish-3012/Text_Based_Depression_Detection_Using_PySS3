This pandemic has beaten me.M, nearing 40.
Attempted suicide at an early age, head injury, amnesia, had to start all over again. Low self esteem even though I've done some cool shit in my life.

Working in the same place for four years, just moved to a new department and had a chance to build something new. Was in a somewhat happy six month relationship. A dream project I had died recently but I was starting to overcome the loss. 
Working out, living with a roommate and about to move into an apartment I bought. 

Due to the pandemic, the relationship ended, two friends went into deep depression (one even attempted suicide) and I just fell apart. Couldn't work from home, work out, the social isolation just kicked me down. 
Pretty sure I forgot to take my antidepressants, stopped showering, shaving, eating right. Spent most of my time watching old movies, youtube (just to pass the time, not even enjoying any of it). 

Friends coworkers stopped calling, the manager still sends messages once in a while, asking how I am but I'm sure I'll get fired if this continues. 

My parents kept coming by, calling to make sure I took my pills. This morning they came by, decided they had enough and forced me to come back to thier place (my old room). 

I just gave up. 
Don't care any more. 
Thoughts of suicide are coming back and I'm running out of reasons to dismiss them.
