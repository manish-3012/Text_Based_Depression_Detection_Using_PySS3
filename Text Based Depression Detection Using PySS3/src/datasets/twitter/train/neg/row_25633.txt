Nothing is working.I've listened to everyone's advice here... Nothing works. I think I've reached a point where it's too late to change anything... I don't know if this is goodbye. Nothing has changed. I'm scared of what I'll do to myself.

I really just want someone to talk to who truly understands... I have a few of those people but we don't talk enough, and I never know what to say to them. I just want a hug...
