started typing out a noteI don't plan on doing anything really  but i really don't see things ever getting as good as i want them to be, i feel like a prisoner in my own life, i don't want to be me, i want to go back in time and stop myself from becoming who i am now, or even better be born into another famiy, one without a narissist, one with real family love or connection, i've been isolating for years, i don't know how to be social and noone seems to want me around, i don't like the way i look, i don't like the direction my life is going in, i am envious of so many people, i don't even take care of myself anymore, i just want things to be so much better than they are but i don't see it happening, i hate this so much i'm on the verge of tears, i feel like noone truely understand the extent of how much i hate who i am now and who i have been in the past aand how my life is going now, i want to be someone else so badly, i want to forget this life ever happened and start over, i'm fucked up, alone and pathetic, i don't want to be me

if it takes telling people i want to kill myself to take me seriously, love me and help me, so be it
