Nothing will ever get better.I hope this will finally be the year that I fucking shoot myself or slit my throat. 

I will still be working at the same shitty job dealing with stupid people for little to no money. I will still be too broke to afford plastic surgery or a personal trainer. I will still be too broke to afford therapy so I'll continue being depressed and anxious literally 24/7. I'll still be surrounded by friends I don't even like who don't even like me. I will still not have anyone in my life that I have anything in common with. The man I love will still not commit to me. I will still be a fucking failure of a human being with no drivers license or college degree. I will still live with a family that doesn't love me that I don't love. Everything will still be fucking garbage. 

I really pray and hope that I work up the courage  to run into a tunnel and lay down on some train tracks or jump off a bridge. Pray for me!
