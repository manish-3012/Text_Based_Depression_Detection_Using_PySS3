Iâ€™m 23 and am considering ending everythingA few months ago everything was fine. Was living in a flat, had a full time job and was feeling great about everything. Then the flat mate we were living with had a mental breakdown and kicked myself and my 6 month pregnant partner out. We then had to move towns back to my mothers and her partners. I thought everything was going to be okay, I was job searching and looking for our own place. One day I was on the phone to a potential job when my mothers partner barged in the door demanding I â€œget my fat lazy ass off the phone and help with dinnerâ€ to which the employer heard. He then grabbed my phone and smashed it. I left, but then my partner was in hospital for baby pains. So I met her at the hospital and went back to their home. I woke up the next morning and he told me I should kill myself and that no one would care, and that I was to leave immediately or else he would beat me up. So I left again, with no clothes no money, nothing. I had a friend who said I could crash on her couch until I found something else. That didnâ€™t last very long, so I moved into another place with another friend. My partner left and moved back to the original town we were living but moved in with her sister this time. I ended up finding a place, and a job which I enjoyed a lot. But living in different towns with no support and a baby a month away I needed to come back and live with her again because she was getting too sick to take care of her other child. So I left the place I was staying, resigned from my work and are currently staying on the floor at her sisters. They are wanting me out as the apartment only has 2 rooms and with my partners child, her sisters 3 children, her sister, her sisters partner and my partner there is not enough room for me. Iâ€™ve tried getting help from WINZ (I live in NZ) and Tai whenua for emergency housing but no one will help. I have no friends here to stay with and will be out on the streets in the next few hours.
I feel like thereâ€™s no point anymore, Iâ€™ve no home, no where to stay, no money, and only 2% left of charge left on my phone. I have no charger. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll make it out I donâ€™t want to live on the streets I would rather not live at all. Iâ€™m so lost and donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m sorry everyone I didnâ€™t know where else to vent
