I really want to help my friend, but I don't know how to anymore. Please helpMy friend is at the 5th suicide attempt ,and just gotten out of the hospital the 4th time last week. She only tells me she wants to die, after she takes about 50-70 pills of antidepressants and benzodiazepines so I could call for an ambulance. Ironically, she is heavy on medocations , the same she uses for suicide attempts. She has no family, I live in another city, she doesn't want to move with me and I have school and work in my city so I can't move with her. She is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder. I literally have no clue how to help her anymore. I talk and visit her as much as I can, give her advices of she wants some, try to keep her occupied with all sorts of activities. If anything works, it's only for awhile. After that, it gets worse. The medication is destroying her. All her hair falls, the medical checking is very bad, is dizzy and on the verge of fainting all the time, hallucinates sometimes and all sorts of other things. She has a psychiatrist and psychologist she goes to, but everytime, they only give her more medication and are making her feel bad for wanting to die. She already changed 4 psychiatrists. 
She wants to die because she can't stands a rejection from someone she loves. Today she texted me again, telling me she wants to overdose again. I don't know what to do anymore. Has anyone have any advice on how to help her?
