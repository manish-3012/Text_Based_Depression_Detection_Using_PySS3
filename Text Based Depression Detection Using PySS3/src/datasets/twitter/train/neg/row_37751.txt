I'm hopelessI really don't know what to do anymore, I'm hopeless, helpless and can't help but feel that I'm running out of time. I've been dealing with depression over a decade now, losing most of my teenage years and half of my twenties because of it. I'm stuck in this endless loop of self - loathing that I can't get out of. With emotionally abusive parents and friends that can't to be bothered I have no one to talk to. Days have no meaning, my anxiety is going through the roof and I'm doing nothing about it but cry and hate myself because time flies by so fast and I haven't done anything with my life. Last couple years have been awful and I wish everyday to be the last because I can't do this anymore. I don't even know if any of this makes any sense I'm crying right now so it s what it is.
