Hiding my scarsI'm about to go on holiday with my family and will be put in a position where the scars on my arms will be easily visible; this is because the warm clients would mean I'd have to wear t shirts or be topless. I don't know how they'd react if they so them and I really can't be asked explaining everything to them. Does anyone have any idea on how I could hide the scars on my arms.

FYI: I'm talking about the scars on my forearms; It not necessarily where I usually cut but there are still scars which are definitely noticeable up close.
