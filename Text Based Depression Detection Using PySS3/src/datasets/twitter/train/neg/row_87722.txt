I guess I now know the day I'll dieI (m 18) once posted my story on the subreddit depression and everything but I never have really thought I'll come here one day.

Today I lost my last hope, a good friend of mine I am in love with today told me that we wont getting together and I now that is a weak reason to end his live but that hope was the only thing that prevented me from killing myself. I was sexually abbused when I was 5 by my cousin, I was bullied till I was 15, nobody ever loved me and I was rejected and hurted so many times, my mother hates me since the day she got pregnant with me, my dad only loves me when my sister does something bad or rejects him, I'm in therapy but this is not enough because everythig brakes apart. I already survived a long and hard depression that nearly killed me back then I didnt cut myself or something like that. Today I injured myself for the 7th time with an cigarette. Three over the last month three today and once in august.

I ordered razor blades to slit my wrists and I am planning to do it on the first of january. I'll do it that way so I can suffer in death. It feels like i deserve it that way.

My best friend is the reason I am alive now 'cuz he teached me that there is a good side in live, but I lost hope and the will  to try it. The blades will arrive on thursday maybe I wont be strong enough to take it till 2020. I wanted to do therapy 'cuz I was to scared that I will kill myself when nobody is watching me, now is that moment I was so scared of and I'm kinda relieved.

I didnt really take much effort to make sure every word is written correct so I'm sorry for that.
