Complex trauma survivor: Whatâ€™s the point ?Before anyone says â€œgo get some therapy,â€ I already tried various therapists. Lots of reading. Lots of research. Life coaches. Psychics. Medication. The whole gammut. Unfortunately, those experiences caused more harm and damage because not many providers are trained in my specific life experiences. I have met a few good therapists and a few good friends. 

Something bad happened recently, and it brings back all of the bad things that have happened to me and were said to me. I am in a massive amount of debt for trying to get help for my concerns, only to be left feeling worse and now having all of this debt. There was a massive traumatic event that happened in 2014 that led to all of this. 

I am hesitant to explain, because my life is so complex. If anyone wants to offer kindness or can give me a reason to live, that would be great. I donâ€™t want to be here.  If youâ€™re a complex trauma survivor and have advice, that would be good too. 

I am cautious to post on another subs (I have tried them), but getting misunderstood isnâ€™t helpful to me.
