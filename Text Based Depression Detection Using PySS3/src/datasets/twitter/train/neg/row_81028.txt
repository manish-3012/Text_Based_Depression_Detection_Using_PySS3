Feeling suicidal. Now what?  I feel a little silly posting here since I don't have a whole lot of reason behind why I'm feeling suicidal. Every now and then I get terribly depressed. The feeling hits me from nowhere. It seems like its been happening more and more often. I don't know why. But this is the first time I feel a strong desire to end my life. I know I shouldn't, and I've never been one to consider suicide, but suicide appears to me as a logical solution to the way I'm feeling. I don't know why I'm feeling suicidal but I need to deal with it and I don't know how.
