This Is A GoodbyeUsing a throwaway account because no one needs to know who I am.

It's really hard when the only person in your life shuts you out and doesn't want to talk to you. I'm so lonely and I don't have anyone to vent to anymore. They said that they care about me so much and that if I need to talk to them that I can. But then they begin to remove me from social media? I don't even have their phone number. I'm not even going to bother with trying anymore because I'm done. I've been pushed far past my limit and I just cannot take this pain anymore. Loneliness and hurt coat every inch of my body and I don't even have anymore to help me. They knew that I was already very upset and that I needed to talk to someone, then they go ahead and leave. 

Maybe I'm looking into it too much. But for some backstory, she is already stressed and hasn't been on social media for a while. So now I feel even fucking worse about putting my problems on her. I don't know what to do.

I'm writing this to leave something behind if I do go through with my plan. I'm sorry to everyone that I hurt. I don't deserve the pleasure of living on this planet anymore if all I do is hurt and stress people out. I don't have a use anymore. My one use has vanished and that is it.

Bye
