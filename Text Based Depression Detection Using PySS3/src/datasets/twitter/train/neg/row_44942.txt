I'm an extrovert, and I have no more energyWe commonly say that extroverts need to be around people to recharge. However, it's not always easy to find people to recharge you. Maybe you don't have a lot of friends, and it's difficult for you to meet new people. Other times you may have a lot of friends but none of them can provide you the right type of recharge or validation.

I do have a lot of friends, but it's difficult for me to find validation because we're all so different. It's similar to feeling lonely at a party of people because you don't really fit in, or you can't find the qualities in people you need to make you feel like you belong. To make matters worse, I find the most effective forms of validation for me are through physical touch and quality time, something that's commonly associated with dating.

Recently, I've noticed patterns in my behavior that confirms my hypothesis. I've been intensely depressed for a month and a half now. Whenever I go on *quality* dates, my mood improves for a short time - sometimes a day, sometimes half a day. Eventually, it goes back down and the physical pain in my chest comes back in addition to the lack of motivation and energy. I've lost the ability to function. I can't eat, work, shower... I've lost 13 pounds in the last month. My body feels weak. It's giving up on me and I don't care enough to fix it. I'm ready to go.

Relying on external validation sucks, and it's not something I can control. No matter how many opportunities I give myself (dating apps, Reddit, social media), I can't force connections. I can't force people to want to hang out with me. In fact, it's come to the point where I've run out of new profiles on all the apps. It makes me feel really defeated. The more time passes without that validation, the more intense the pain, and ultimately the more I feel pushed to the edge.
