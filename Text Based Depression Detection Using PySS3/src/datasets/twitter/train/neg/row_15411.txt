I just don't know what to do.Hey. I've been struggling with high functioning depression and anxiety for almost two years. I don't know how it started but I'm guessing it's my parents. They constantly fight and my dad has extreme OCD and ADD. He refuses to go to a doctor or get any medication... And takes it out everyone else in the house.

I know they love each other but sometimes I just can't. My dad constantly tells me how much of a disappointment I am and how I do nothing right. My mom is better, but the same. I feel if I told them about what I'm going through, they wouldn't believe me because I'm not traditionally depressed. They would probably tell me other people have it worse and I need to suck it up.

As with many people, some days are better than others. Days I'm out with friends or doing stuff I enjoy are better, but as soon as I'm home or the smallest thing happens I just want to curl up in a ball. And the things I enjoy (painting, horseback riding, gaming, and sound engineering) my parents disapprove of or make fun of me about. My favorite thing is my job. I work/intern as an audio engineer doing church services, high school graduations, etcetera. I feel like my boss cares about me more than my family.

My parents are Christian but I'm a deist. I can't tell them. Things would be different and I can't lose my best friends. I feel out of place at church, and even talking to my youth pastor he was not nice to me about my lack of faith. I have the best friends ever who know nothing of this. My family acts so perfect and seems so perfect from the outside.

The only reason I havn't ended it all is I don't want to put my family and friends through it. I just can't take it anymore. I'm only a freshman and I have no hope for the future. Maybe it's time to think about myself and be done. Sorry for the rant.

tl;dr: I'm a high functioning depressive who can't deal.
