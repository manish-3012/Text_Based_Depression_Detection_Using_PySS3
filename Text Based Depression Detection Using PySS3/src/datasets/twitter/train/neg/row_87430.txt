This is itIve had enough. My life is miserable. I have no friends, my own parents hate me, and everyone around me is living a good life while im in constant pain every day. All summer iâ€™ve been looking for a job, well this week i finally landed an interview after all that time, but it turns out i need an id. I Have all the required paperwork for one, just need transportation, i told my mom about it, what does she tell me? Shes â€œtoo busyâ€. I cant. I just cant. All FUCKING summer shes been on my fucking CASE constantly CONSTANTLY telling me to get a job. Hereâ€™s the fucking opportunity and what happens? Jesus christ guys i just cant anymore. Iâ€™ve been sober for years now and been doing great in school, all i want is enough money for a drivers license then a car. Impossible without a job. I am 17, at this fucking rate, i just wont make it in life. I cant.  I really cant. Im good for literally nothing and i an a fucking loser and a coward. I wish my life was just even slightly better. But unfortunately its not. I will be overdosing on fentanyl later tonight. I am not looking for a mind change, iâ€™ve made up my decision. I will be smoking a nice blunt and listening to help me by hako yamazaki (beautiful song) and sleepwalk by santo and johnny so i could be at peace and happiness during my final moment. I never wanted it to come to this, to think i was such a happy child this is what iâ€™ve turned to. I have no one to talk to so here is where i vent. Goodbye guys and thanks to those who took the time to read this useless post.
