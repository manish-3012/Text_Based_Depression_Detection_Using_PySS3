When you are the source of your problemsMost often people want to kill themselves because of problems coming to them, like abuse, bullying, illnesses etc. But how do you cope when your problems are caused by you and only you? 

I do cringeworthy shameful things and spill spaghetti out of my pocket way too often. Shame, embarrassment, regret and low-self worth run through my body everyday at a great intensity. I don't feel any sort of direct sadness, lonelines or grief, so that probably makes my problems a little different from most others here. I often invalidate myself because of this. I feel like since every problem is caused by me, I'm not allowed to treat it like a problem. But I am still allowed to validate my feelings. This is a rational thought in my head, so I guess that's a good start, but I can't bring myself to feel it. I still feel ashamed, embarrassed, regretful and of low self-worth all the time.

Does anybody have any tips on how to overcome these feelings?
