Decided my suicide note would be a poemI went to rest deep within the earth,

gentle wind blowing the grass above me,

soul at ease. 

Never another tomorrow, never another yesterday. 

I wish so much you wouldnâ€™t cry,

I am in my loveâ€™s arms again,

and my love for you is everlasting. 

Goodbye.
