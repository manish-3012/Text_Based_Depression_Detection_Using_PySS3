I've reached my breaking point. [22/M]I'm poor and I have always been poor. I flunked out of college three times after being forced back and I just couldn't do it each time. My parents don't own anything. I can't get a job. I have no skills at all and when I have tried to get a job I'm just nervous as fuck and I make a ton of mistakes and I get fired fast. I don't even have experience. I ended my relationship of 5 years with my girlfriend a few months ago, and I regret it. She's not interested in getting back together. I'm fat. I'm a loser. I'm not good at anything. My parents think I'm graduating on July 20th,  but little do they know that the only thing I'm graduating from is life.
