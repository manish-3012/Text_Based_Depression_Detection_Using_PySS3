Am I at the end?Iâ€™ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I tried it a couple of months ago and it didnâ€™t happen. I feel like Iâ€™m at my wits end. Iâ€™ve called the line, that was stupid. I canâ€™t afford counseling and my insurance doesnâ€™t cover it. I feel as if the people around me are tired of my constant struggle with depression and Iâ€™m to a point where I feel like I just want all of it to be over. I honestly donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m not productive in my life anymore. Iâ€™ve lost just about everything. Iâ€™m just winging it at this point and I feel completely hollow.
