Iâ€™ve seen to many of these
Before I get on with this I want you all to be aware that I donâ€™t care if I get upvotes or downvotes cause of what I say, Iâ€™m speaking my mind and that is that so deal with it. And please read it all.

Iâ€™ve seen to many people saying theyâ€™re going to commit suicide and I gotta say Iâ€™m done with it, I donâ€™t know if people are actually debating on doing it or if they are doing it for the attention but either way itâ€™s not okay at all. People go through things I know this Iâ€™ve been through to much shit, Iâ€™ve been abused by my father, I lost my dog that I grew up with I have so many things going on in my life right now but Iâ€™m still here, Iâ€™m still alive and Iâ€™m pushing through it... people may be suicidal from rejection from a crush or depression I would name more but there is to many and I want to get to the point. You may think you have no one to go to or no one to trust, but there always is someone to talk too. Itâ€™s not worth killing yourself no matter how old you are, I if you need to talk then I am here, I will listen to whatever you have problems with, I know it sounds weird for me to say that since no one even knows me but if you need to talk we can we can trade things that happened to us and our names to prove that weâ€™ve been through things and youâ€™re not alone. People care and so do I. So please reconsider and think of youâ€™re options before you decide to kick the bucket.
