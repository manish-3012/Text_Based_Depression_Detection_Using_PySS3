I wish I was allowed to commit suicide.I hate how suicide is so stigmatized by society, and how much guilt-tripping there is surrounding the issue. I am not "mentally ill" for being suicidal, rather my wish is a product of rational choice. I no longer believe that life is worth living and I am not interested in living it. Everything in the whole world dies in the end, and I would rather that end be sooner so as to avoid putting up with all the hardship in between. I can hardly bring myself to be interested in anything anymore, so to me the world is at best boring and at worst painful. I have little interest in "improving" either myself or the world, as both things turn to dust in the final analysis, along with any accomplishments I or anyone else might make. I just want this whole pointless existence to be over already, as I see literally no point in it continuing. I am aware that this might hurt people around me, but honestly their entire existence, let alone any pain they might feel, is as fleeting and pointless as my own. I just wish it was socially acceptable to see that suicide can be a rational decision and to act accordingly. Maybe then people would not feel so trapped in a worthless life, and would be able to commit suicide in a relatively safe and painless manner rather than using their own makeshift methods.
