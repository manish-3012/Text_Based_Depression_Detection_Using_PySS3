Life is so...Crap!! I have had such a hard time recently! In September 2015 my Nanna passed away which was extremely difficult to deal with. I do class myself as someone who can handle a lot and this wasn't the first time I've had to deal with someone close to me passing away... However within a few days of my Nanna passing we find out that my mum has got cancer, and again I think I've handled it well and even though she has become much better with the treatment of radio and chemotherapy things are still continuing and she hasn't been able to eat since October last year however things are looking up which is good. 
So with all of that, I also had an extremely high maintance job which I worked for 10+ hours a day and had been there for 5 years working shift work and had finally had enough. I decided to leave my job and have a lovely Christmas time off as I haven't had Christmas off at all within the last 5 years and then start looking for a new job in the new year. I eventually found a job which was office work and completely different to my last job which I thought was what I wanted but even though the hours were better the job was 100 times worse! So I jacked it in! I've never been this person just to give up cause I don't like the disappointing others and I do care what people think however I couldn't stand it. So now I find myself jobless (however I do have an interview lined up shortly but I'm counting on getting it), without my Nanna, my mum who is getting better but is still a long road ahead, and even though I do have an amazing partner by my side I feel like I've messed things up and on a destruction path (I hardly drink and don't do drugs) and I don't know what I'm doing at all, I want to cry but I can't, I feel like I need to be strong for everyone around me.
