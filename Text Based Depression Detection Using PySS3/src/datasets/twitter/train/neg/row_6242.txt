It's still there, but I realized the hypocrisy in my suicidal ideationTo not waste anyone's time with all the reasons I have for wishing I was dead, mainly because I'm not sure I know all of them, I'll cut to the main and most important one.

I feel like I'm a burden to the world, and to the people I love.

I've always seen my dad as a Saint, willing to stay with me, when my mom didn't. I didn't exactly make it easy for him, being autistic. He suffered through a kid who didn't like to be hugged, as well as a secondary abusive relationship, in an attempt to make my life as comfortable as possible. He still loved me, more than he loved himself. He is the only person my dumbass brain cannot convince itself, is lying when he says he loves me. 

My reasoning so far has been that if I we're never born, his life could have been better. He always wanted to be a captain on some ship, sailing around the world. I can't change the past 19 years, but I can make his life easier from now, by ending mine. 

It wasn't until recently I realised that if I actually do kill myself, it won't make life easier for everyone. Maybe most people I know, but not my dad. The last 19 years of his hard work will be wasted, unless I do something with it. All his sacrifices will be out the window, and it would be my fault.
