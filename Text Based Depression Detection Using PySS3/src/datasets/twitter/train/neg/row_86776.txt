I planned to do it today.I w as gonna do it today. One of my friends asked to hang out with me on vacation. I brought her along because I know I wouldnâ€™t do it with her here. I still think about it though. Right now Iâ€™m in Hawaii Iâ€™ve had a blast here but I feel like if someone came up to me and put a gun to my head I would just breathe and close my eyes. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going through half of what anyone here is. This Reddit has been of help to me. Please just find a reason even if itâ€™s for one day. My reason was allowing my friend to hang out with me during the holidays tomorrow I will find a new one. Just find a reason everyday.  I was gonna hang myself that was my plan. Not tonight though.
