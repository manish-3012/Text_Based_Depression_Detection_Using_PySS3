Lockdown 2So I'm in the UK and we're heading for a lockdown 2 and I'm incredibly terrified because last lockdown was the last time I tried to kill myself
I can't have a support bubble because I live with my mum but my mum is no support to me at all and I can't even see my boyfriend
I have no idea what to do because even when I try to phone someone my mum stops me yet I'm 22 and she shouts at me as soon as I start having a mental breakdown
Last time I got in touch with a helpline they made me even more suicidal by saying completely the wrong things when I told them I thought I upset everyone and no one likes me
