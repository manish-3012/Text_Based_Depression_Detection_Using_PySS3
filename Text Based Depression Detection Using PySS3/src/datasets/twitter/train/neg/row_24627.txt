Thinking about doing it.So, I'm 16 and living in Valdez Alaska. People who I become good friends with have a tendency to move away. I've never had a girlfriend, and I have no idea if I ever will.  I just feel so forever alone. People at school torment me for everything I do. The isolation of this town kills me. My life is so fucking tedious. Wake up, go to school, homework, practice, homework, reddit, bed. It never fucking changes. It doesn't help that my parents are pushing me to the limit. I get Bs, they want As. I get As, I better keep it that way. Both of them are super religious. I'm atheist, and I'm forced to go to church every Sunday and am getting confirmed against my will. My mom can't take the fact that her "little boy" has grown up and treats me like a goddamn toddler. Trying to convince her to see my point of view is no good. She just "nopes" anything I say and makes up her own words. 

Nobody has any idea how I feel on the inside. I'm stretched to my limits. People say it will get better. I've waited five years. Nothing's fucking changed. I still go to school with douche bags and girls who will never like me. I still endure endless fat jokes even though I've worked harder than any of those assholes. I just can't take it anymore. I've had enough with life. People tell me to wait, and that the best years of my life are ahead of me. Bullshit. I can't take two or more years of this garbage. Sometimes, I think about taking all the pills I can find in the medicine cabinet. Would it be like falling asleep? Do I have some kind of spirit? If so, where will it go? Hopefully somewhere that's better than this hellhole.
