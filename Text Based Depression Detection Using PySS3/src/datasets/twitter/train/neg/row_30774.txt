30 days30 days. That's when she said she would be gone. As I woke up this morning from my restless sleep all I could smell was the scent of her, left on the pillow. As I try to just get myself together for work I feel like I'll just break down at the drop of a hat. It doesn't help that my job revolves around pissed off customers. I think it'll be good to get out of the house but I have no motivation for anything. All I want to do is crawl under the covers and never wake up. I write this all as a way for me to cope with what I'm going through. Just as a daily reminder until the countdown is complete.
