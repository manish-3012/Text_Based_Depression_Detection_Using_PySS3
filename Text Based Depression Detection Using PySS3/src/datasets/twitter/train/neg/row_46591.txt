iâ€™m going through with it after christmasiâ€™ve recently ordered the tool im going to use to go through with it, but it would be nice to spend one last holiday with my family. that and i want to make up for last christmas when i was in a shitty mood all christmas day. people always say it gets better, iâ€™ve been waiting 3+ years for that to happen and itâ€™s only gotten worse, i love my family but i genuinely donâ€™t think i can do this anymore. iâ€™m so mentally exhausted and i just feel so numb all the time. i donâ€™t want to die but i also donâ€™t see myself being able to keep up with life anymore. i guess iâ€™m posting this because maybe there will be that one piece of advice that will make me think over my decision, but so far all iâ€™ve heard are empty promises. iâ€™m sorry if this sounds stupid, iâ€™ll probably delete it later.
