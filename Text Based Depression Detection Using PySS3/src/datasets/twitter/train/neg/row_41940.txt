.I cant eat, i havent had an appetite in years. For years i havent have the energy to regularly shower or brush my teeth, i get tired just from doing literally nothing. My hair is falling out. Everything is a chore, even sleeping is a chore even though thats the only time i can get a break from this existence. I just want to be alone, completely alone but my friends get upset at me for not wanting to interact or for deleting my social media, saying that i shouldnt have to isolate myself. But i do need to isolate myself, i need to be completely away from everyone, because everybody is tiring me out when im already so worn out from these years of suffering. It doesnt matter who ; my parents who i hate, or my friends who i love, If i cant killnmyself right now, i want to at least kill my presence around other people, i want to be left in complete peace all on my own so that i can learn how to do a simple thing like take a fucking shower at a proper time again. Im sorry for this post that doesnt make much sense, and i KNOW it is up to me to try and get into better habits, I just need to write something somewhere right now. i am not asking for any help or advice
