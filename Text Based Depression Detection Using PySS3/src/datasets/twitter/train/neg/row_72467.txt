I feel in pain every day, but I still tell myself that I am being weak and dramaticMy boyfriend told me he was possibly trans and just confused about his gender identity in general. I can't be with him, it isn't fair to him. I am not attracted to women or feminine traits, and so I wouldn't want him feeling like he had to keep me in mind while going through this journey.

But fuck, we have been together for almost 5 years. I am 21. All my adult life I have never been alone.

There is a guy that I like too, and I thought he was interested in me, but now he won't even respond to my texts. I am obsessing over him and not acting like myself and it is scaring me.

I am afraid to leave my boyfriend. I am afraid of all the tiny steps it involves, him figuring out where to live, separating items, finding someone to rent his room, dealing with a new roommate, living with him while this all is happening...every day I come home to him and feel like I am going to be sick. I feel so much emotional pain that it is actually hurting me. Every night I imagine different ways to kill myself. I wish I didn't have family or friends and could just be gone without hurting anyone. I imagine this every day, but still tell myself that my pain isn't anything compared to other people. And that I deserve it, I am a weak and bad partner for not going through this with him.

I never found it hard to focus in school or work, but now I am. I don't feel like myself. I can't do this anymore.
