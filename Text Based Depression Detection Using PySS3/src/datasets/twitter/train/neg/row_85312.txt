I took pills and I'm dyingHey 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have been having problems for so long. I have a mental illness (depersonalization/derealization). It greatly diminishes cognitive abilities. I had a traumatic experience when I was young. I am a homosexual and my dad tried to kill me when he suspected that i might be a homosexual. I didn't understand why i felt that way, but now I do. It doesn't matter though because I couldn't solve anything. I isolated myself for over a decade and that caused all kinds of mental problems. Anyway, I talked to my dad about changing my major in collage some years ago, and he refused to let me leave engineering. With my mental illness, there was no way that I was going to succeed. I just couldn't comprehend anything and I was failing, so I changed my major without telling him. I told him that I was doing alright in collage. At the beginning of this semester my dad was having money problems and was losing his mind over it. So I told him I was graduating this semester, which was a lie. I have one more semester to go. Now, the semester is over and he thinks i'm going to get my degree in a few days. Now, nothing is resolved. Not my sexuality, nothing. There's no way out. I'm fed up with everything. So I took 25 pills of paracetamol at once. The google search said I would see the symptoms after 24 hours, but it's been less that 2 hours and I'm already seeing the symptoms. Now, I feel so dizzy and I'm vomiting. I'm sorry if I'm not making much sense, that's because I can barely concentrate. I feel so dizzy. 

Anyway, it just hit me that I might be going to hell. And I'm realizing how sad and shocked my mother and sisters and brother are going to be. And let me tell you, it's terrifying. 

I'm not sure what to think and what to do. I know I don't want to stay alive because there's nothing that I want. My problems are more than I could handle. 

What do you think guys. I think I'm absolutely losing my mind.
