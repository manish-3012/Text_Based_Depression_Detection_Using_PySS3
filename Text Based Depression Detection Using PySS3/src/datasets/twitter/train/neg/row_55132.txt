I hate this fucking bullshitWhy the fuck am I forced to become a slave to society when I didnâ€™t even ask to be born in the first place? This shit pisses me off so much because now I have all of these burdens placed on me that I have no choice but to address(hunger, thirst, discomfort, pain, etc.). They were forced upon me and now Iâ€™m just expected to go along with all of this or else I suffer and my body tortures me for not meeting its demands. Fuck this shit. I find working a job(which is something most people are forced to do)unbearable, agonizing, and a waste of time. Now Iâ€™m forced to either deal with this shit for decades to come or go through the horrible and painful process of killing myself. I mean wtf is that? Iâ€™m fucking trapped and it hurts knowing that the society that brought you into this world doesnâ€™t give a fuck about you or what you go through and its always going to be about serving the system or else youâ€™re seen as trash. Iâ€™m fucking done and I want to escape from this prison so badly.
