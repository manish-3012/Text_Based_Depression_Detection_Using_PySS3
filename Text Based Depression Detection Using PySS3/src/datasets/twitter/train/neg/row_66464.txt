Interesting observation...(my English is not that good)Most ppl who end up committing suicide become more or less okay with the decision and fix a date when they would end up doing it ...that crying phase and depressed face happens when they are still fighting with whatever reason is causing them having suicide tendencies and hopelessnes in finding solution to that problem ....this what my friend told me who himself was a psychiatrist n stuff ,who btw ended up committing suicide after a year he told me ....(he travelled all around the world for a year)

Problem starts when people become okay with the decision of committing suicide like fuckin okay just like they are okay and not stressed about making decision about which clothes they are gonna wear or which they food they are gonna eat in the dinner ....

That face is the last phase which is the phase of no return ..most ppl will commit suicide during that phase ...for many this can be a day or two ..maybe a year .....depending upon things they wanna do before dying that give them sense of happiness ...
