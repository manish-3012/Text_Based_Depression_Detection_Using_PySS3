How far can Guilt get you?Over a decade ago I tried to commit suicide by driving off a bridge and failed in an incredibly improbable fashion.  A lot of people who do that seem to have epiphanies about how they really want to live after all, but I never did.

My epiphany was seeing the full extent of harm it would cause my parents.  They looked like they aged 10 years overnight.  I knew they loved me, and my death would hurt them, but now I can't un-learn the extent of it.  I want to die but I haven't been able to bring myself to hurt them that way.

So I graduated high school.  I graduated College. I got my office job. I got my big promotion.  I occasionally up the dose on my meds because they're the only thing keeping me alive, but it's getting harder and harder to force myself to make it work.

My parents are really healthy - big into nutrition and exercise and staying active.  They're getting older but could live another 20-40 years easily.  I've always told myself I could just wait until after they pass away, but I don't think I can make it that long anymore.

I don't know what I want out of posting this.  I've talked circles around this with therapists and psychiatrists, and there's no "solution."  I guess my hope is that someone here has had a suicidal loved one find a way to commit suicide without hurting those they leave behind.
