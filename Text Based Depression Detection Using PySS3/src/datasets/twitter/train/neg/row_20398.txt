I'm so tiredEverything seems to be finally coming together, but I feel empty.

I have a good job, money, friends, family, and it all means nothing to me.

I am so easily able to pretend to everyone that it's fine and I'm okay. 

No one knows how I really feel, which is that I just want to die. 
I don't see what the point in having money for is? What am i saving for? Nothing makes me happy, I have no aspirations or dreams for the future. 

There was one person who I could tell everything to, and who made me feel alive, and they have gone.

I love my friends but it's not the same.  I do all the right things, I keep busy, I eat healthily, I've been doing exercise, interacting with people, but I'm so tired of it all. I'm tired of feeling so awful all the time. Why should I carry on?
