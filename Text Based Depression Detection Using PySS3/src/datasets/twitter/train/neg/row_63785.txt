I just wanna dieHey, my brother just committed suicide he was 14. He was having a hard time in school and wasn't really good at anything. My father was so hard to him because of the grades he got. He had a lot of friends, but suddenly he just couldn't take any more. I feel so guilty for his dead, i didn't helped him or make him calm down after he cried because i got a bad grade ( the reason why he cried was because my dad was yelling at him). What do i do. I have no friends, bad in school i am only good at computers, i have tried to kill myself twice but i just couldn't. Please. I am 14 years old with no future. :(
