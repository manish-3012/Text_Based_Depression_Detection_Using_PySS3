My reply to a suicidal person might be controversialI'm suicidal myself, but since I've cut out many toxic people in my life and have started working out and feeling more confident in myself, my depression has been easier to handle. 

This person who added me on snap felt so unloved and was gonna end it, but I have lost too many people to suicide and depression, including myself. I am tired of it. I find it selfish for teens and young adults to take their life before they've even lived until their mid 20's. 

This was my reply to them telling me that because the person they loved didn't love them and kept leaving their paragraphs of declarations of love on read several times and that this always happens and that they are unloved. And was going to kill themself and how he wasn't the same.

Me: Don't be like that. You have an entire fucking future for yourself. Honestly, you sound selfish. You only care about yourself when I promise you, that there are people in your life who would miss you. I get that you're sad and feel unloved, but you can fucking change that. Getting hurt and heartbroken and feeling unloved is part of growing up and we all have to go through it. Being depressed doesn't give you any fucking right to tell me you want to kill yourself. You are still young, grow up, handle your depression by fucking finding love. You can move to a whole new place and find love. Stop thinking that life is pointless when you haven't even fucking lived. You were given a life because you fought to fucking have one. So instead of ending your life before it fucking even started, they to fucking find something that is worth living for and live for it

Hate me if you want for what I said, but I've lost too many people to suicide who never even fucking tried to get better and I fucking almost killed myself for not even trying to live before my life started.
