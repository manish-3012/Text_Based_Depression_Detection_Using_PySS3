What would you say to them ?What are the things that people around you do to help you but it acually causes more harm ? 

I often find that people who really try to help are the ones who acually do more harm then good. For me personally, I would say that it helps me when I can be left alone, when there's less pressure, less expectations and in general just letting me deal with my problems in silence instead of explaining myself all the time which makes things worse and causes more anxiety. Especially when people start to give you this negative attention that makes you feel like you are always this depressive, sad person and that is all they seem to notice. It's almost like you stopped being a real person.
