Im 18 and suicidal. Anyone wanna listen?I cant help but think about what it would be like to die. My family thinks im antisocial and bitchy, my parents think im ungreatful and a whore. I cant get a job, I dont have a license. I feel like im the ugliest person alive. So whats there to live for. All I have is my fiance and Im sure he probably thinks Im attention seeking. So I guess I will have to try something. I googled how many sleeping pills it would take to die. I dont feel anything anymore. The cuts dont hurt me now. Its like my feelings and body are numb to everything. I cant talk to anyone about this because they will send me to an insane asylum. What should I do about these unwanted feelings?
