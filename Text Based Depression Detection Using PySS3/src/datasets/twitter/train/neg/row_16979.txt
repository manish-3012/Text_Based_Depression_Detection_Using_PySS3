Thinking about eating a bunch of my medications. I don't think I really will. I just want to tell someone.If I tell my family about it they kind of go overboard and get all up in my business about it and try to talk to me about it even if I say I don't want to. I just honestly need to tell someone without causing other people around me major distress. What should I do tonight that doesn't involve suicide attempts or self-harm?
