I donâ€™t know anymoreI know my life isnâ€™t as bad as other peopleâ€™s. I donâ€™t know why I am how I am. I donâ€™t want attention. I am seeking help. I have a friend who cares so much and itâ€™s nice to open up to someone after so many years. But itâ€™s getting harder. I feel trapped. Now more than ever. I started cutting again after about 3 years. The pain inside lately has hurt so much. The suicidal thoughts have been coming back. The thought of dying, itâ€™s seems so nice. But I know I canâ€™t. I know I have people I care. And I donâ€™t want to hurt them. But at the same time, I donâ€™t know if I can keep up this charade. I pretend to be happy, pretend nothings wrong, help everyone. I started cutting again a week ago and no ones noticed. No one cares. No one asks how I am except for one person. And even then I canâ€™t tel her everything. I canâ€™t tell my counselor everything. I canâ€™t even begin to tell my parents because they wonâ€™t understand. I donâ€™t really expect anyone here to help as much as it is me venting. And I have a lot too say. This year, has been so thee worst I felt Iâ€™ve had in a long time, but itâ€™s also been the best. I started new hobbies, made a good friend(the person I talk to now a lot). Iâ€™ve done things I never couldâ€™ve thought myself doing. But at the same time, Iâ€™ve become more suicidal. Iâ€™ve felt more alone. I went from making excuses to not replying to text messages. Putting my phone in sleep mode. Crying every two hours. I just donâ€™t know. Therapy isnâ€™t helping. Talking isnâ€™t helping. The pain is just too much. And i donâ€™t know what causing it. I canâ€™t figure it out. But i want it to end. I want to be free. Iâ€™m tired of feeling. Sorry itâ€™s so long but i donâ€™t know where to post this. Iâ€™m tired of burdening my friend with my problems. I just feel lost, and alone. And the only comfort or relief I feel is a blade against the skin. It helps the pain. Makes it external. thanks for reading.
