Don't think I can continue faking anymoreI don't think I can continue faking everything anymore. 
I have to fake my laughs at work, I have to fake my behavior with friends and family. 
I try and numb down my thoughts and feelings by listening to music, basically at all times when I'm awake. 

I feel an immense amount of pain which is making me doubt if I want to continue living. 

This isn't the first time that I've felt horrible, however I've never experienced this level of continuous pain before.

I wrote and rewrote this post several times, while pondering why I'm even writing it. 

I don't know.
