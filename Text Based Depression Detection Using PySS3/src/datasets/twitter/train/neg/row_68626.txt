I dont know what what to do anymoreI[M18] had a pretty rough few months and have been dealing with daily suicide thoughts for over a year. Last summer I had a pretty bad ecstasy addiction. I stopped because of my ex getting back together with me. In November I was in a car accident. 2 people died on scene and the 3rd was in hospital for months. I am now stuck in court facing 3 felonies because they are trying to blame the whole thing on me. Recently my ex broke up with me again and got back together with her ex a day later. My mental space is completely messed up and my whole life changed for the worst. I don't really know what to do anymore and suicide looks like the best way to stop everything and just get out. I dont think I would be missed very much as I dont have any type of relationship with my parents or sisters. I have maybe 2 friends that still talk to me. I dont want to be a problem for anyone anymore. 

I'm not really sure why I'm writing all of this. I guess just to vent or look for advice. My life doesnt really look too good and I would just rather not deal with it.
