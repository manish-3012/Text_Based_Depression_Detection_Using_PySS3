...... Give me the scars and pain I deserve ......I don't deserve to be here anymore.

I can't do anything right. 


I love myself for who I am but I'm more of disappointment to myself because I can't get where I want to go. All I want to do is go to school but all there's always something keeping me from getting there.


There's always financial aids to keep me away from it. 

I hate life.

School is my help; it is my safe place.

i can never make enough. stripping isnt even enough. nothing is. i cant even get a decent job. what the hell is wrong with me. i'm nothing but a piece of shit. people keep telling me to wait another semester; another semester; another semester. it's not about logic it's about me needing this.
