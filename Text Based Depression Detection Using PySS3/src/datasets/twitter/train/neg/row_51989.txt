Think I might do it before starting UniversityI just don't want to keep playing this game. I can't fathom how I could keep working for 40 more years. I'm already exhausted.

I'm an older student and often wonder what I'm even getting a degree for and why I'm still going to college. 

I feel we're all so disconnected, lacking empathy, lacking compassion. But yet a lot of people have their heads buried In a phone all day. Instead of enjoying the moment we have to stage a new story to post to Instagram. Instead of enjoying each other's company, we're snapchatting our food. I barely feel human anymore. Everytime I seem to make new friends they just end up using me in someway. It's so discouraging to think that middle school me was right. Things wouldn't get better.
