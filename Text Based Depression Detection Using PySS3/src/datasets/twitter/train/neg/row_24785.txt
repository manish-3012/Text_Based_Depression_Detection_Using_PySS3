I feel like everyone would be better if I were goneI feel like my emotions bring so many problems and issues and stress to everyone around me. I try to keep it to myself but it ends up getting out. I feel like such a waste of space, just harmful to those around me. I just stress out my dad and he already is probably feeling just as shitty as me on top of his work and taking care of the family. God, I contribute nothing to this world. I just want to leave, I feel terrible and just want to die already. I know doing this would break his heart but I just hate being alive.
