Iâ€™m holding it all in and iâ€™m about to explodeI feel like I canâ€™t keep it to myself anymore or else iâ€™m going to kms. I canâ€™t talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them iâ€™m healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t talk to anyone else I just canâ€™t I canâ€™t open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and sheâ€™s also a teacher and I barely know her even tho iâ€™ve known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I canâ€™t talk to them I canâ€™t talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying iâ€™m good now when in reality iâ€™m not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I wonâ€™t bother her ever again. and so I didnâ€™t. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying iâ€™m good now and I stop talking to them. Iâ€™m not ok. I finally accepted the fact that iâ€™m going to kill myself very soon. Iâ€™m not sure when but I know I am. I canâ€™t get these thoughts out of my head. I canâ€™t stop cutting. Iâ€™m about to kms, just not yet though I canâ€™t leave my dog. I havenâ€™t talked to anyone in a long while and everyone thinks iâ€™m ok. Iâ€™m not though. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I think iâ€™m just gonna keep it all in and kms soon. Thank you for reading.
