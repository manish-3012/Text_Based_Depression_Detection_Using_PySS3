Who should I see if I have suicidal thoughts?I had my problems in the past, but I met this girl online, we were talking like 1-2 months, she's amazing, gave me courage to live, but it changed when I asked her about her height, she said that she's 172-173 cm, I'm 170. All of a sudden I realized that I'm a short guy. Never in my life I had this in my head. Now all of my problems are back, plus height thing. The biggest problem is that I lied her that I'm 173 cm, I'm thinking about killing myself for the past 3 days. Should I talk to a friend? Psychologist? Psychiatrist?
