I've worked so hard, i'm so tired.I have struggled with mental illness since i was a child. I remember at one point in time being so happy and full of laughter and light and energy. As the years have gone on however, i've felt more and more hollow. Sometimes i don't recognize the person in the mirror. Eyes that had the light of the world in them are now dim and dark. Smiling, an act that used to be second nature now is so difficult to do that the effort it takes only makes a facial expression that is ugly and grotesque. My chest feels so heavy and tight and constricted that the deepest breath i can take is a gasp. I feel so empty, so starved for relief that the vast majority of wrong choices, bad decisions and actions that have unintentionally hurt other people have been done only in desperate, misguided attempts to feel something, anything at all besides pain, emptiness or despair. I've never wanted to hurt anyone. People have told me to keep trying, keep fighting. They say they need me, they say they would be devastated if i weren't there. I don't want to hurt anyone, i know there are people who love me and would miss me. i want to keep fighting, for their sake if not for my own. 

But my fellow redditors, i'm so terribly tired. I've got nothing left. Either i feel numb and hollow, or I'm in so much pain constantly that it makes me tremble. I feel like i'm being tortured. 

When people ask me what i want, all i want to say is "please tell me goodbye. Please just tell you love me, that you understand, that you hope i find the rest i so badly need." 

Could somebody please just tell me goodbye? Could somebody please just wish me well? That they hope i find my peace? That i find rest? 

I'm so tired
