Hurting myself out of revenge to my parents.Since I was a kid I had almost no friends, I had only my tics, anxiety and depression. As a kid I wondered almost every day why did I had to shake my head, blink too much and stutter. I'm 16 years old now, my parents are horrible people and I think about suicide every day, the thought of having an option out of this life probably just helps me feel like I'm in control of my life, the fact is that I have no control in this life. I have nothing in my life that makes me feel anything good. I only have hatred for my dad, I pretend every single day that I live in some sort of a normal family. I want to kill myself as a revenge to my dad, just to make him suffer just like he makes me suffer every day pretending that he wasn't a sick piece of sit when I was a kid, pretending that he didn't yell at me and beat me and god fucking knows what else that I don't remember. I'm done with this shit I never had anything except suffering in my life, he ruined my life and I'm going to ruin his by ending mine.
