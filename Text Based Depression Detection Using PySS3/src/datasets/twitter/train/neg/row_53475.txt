Anyone else here want to die before their parents do?This may be a skewed mindset, but I want to pass away before my parents do. I dread the funeral, seeing relatives and just people people people everywhere "comforting" you and probably be asked to do a eulogy, say some final words in front of them, what the house will look like after, what to do with their stuff afterwards, more uncertainty added to the already prevailing uncertainties, etc. 


Ever since this depression stepped up a new level last November, just the thought of seeing their coffins -is unthinkable- to me. I want to be dead really soon. Quick and clean. I don't self-harm but I constantly daydream of stabbing myself or think of a bomb going off in my hands or being trapped in a fire. 


I want out. I want out of this life so bad. I want to be the first to go.
