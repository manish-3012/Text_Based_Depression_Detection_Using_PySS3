I can't take the pain anymore. Fuck life.My life is already full of so much fucking mental pain and agony, so what does the universe throw at me? Two cavities, one of which is on a wisdom tooth, which will probably get pulled. I don't want to deal with the fucking pain. I hate physical and mental pain SO FUCKING MUCH. I'd rather blow my brains out, than to spend another second on this piece of shit Earth.
