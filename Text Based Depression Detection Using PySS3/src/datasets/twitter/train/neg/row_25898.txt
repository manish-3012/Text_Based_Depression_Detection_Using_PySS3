Dumb question regarding Kate Spade and her method. As a survivor, I'm curious.It was reported she hung herself from a doorknob with a scarf and died by asphiaxation.  My question is: What prevents one from simply UN\-tying the scarf?

The reason I ask is because I tried to hang myself at age 11 and I felt like my head was going to explode but of course, I was completely sober. 

When I see suicides like this on the news I always wonder how they were feeling physical during that time.
