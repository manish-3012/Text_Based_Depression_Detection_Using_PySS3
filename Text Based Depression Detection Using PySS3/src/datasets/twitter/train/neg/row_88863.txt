Life is good but constantly think "Time to kill myself."I've fought hard against this, and seem to be on top. Life has been good for about a month. The biggest change was realizing that I had a choice in how I react to a situation. I feel so much stronger, and can find the positive in any situation.

But I still get these thoughts out of nowhere. I was putting leftovers into the microwave today, and thought "Well, time to kill myself" and started planning how I would do it. I just froze. No idea where that came from.
