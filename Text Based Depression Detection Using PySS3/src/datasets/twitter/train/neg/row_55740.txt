I see no other way outSorry for the long post but Iâ€™m scared with how I am feeling! 

Iâ€™ve tried believe me I have tried. To start with I was bullied very badly at school and ended up leaving with no qualifications hardly as I hated school but Iâ€™m not a stupid guy. I went to college (age 16 UK) and completely transformed myself. I made loads of friends, oddly most of them went to my past school lol. I went out with them all the time drinking and itâ€™s still the best time of my life, I was so popular. Then my grandma died and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever recovered. Bless her but it was the worst possible time it could of happened. All these friends were not there for me and I slumped even deeper. 

I came out of it again when I was 18 when I got a girlfriend but she cheated on me in 2 weeks. I was still ok and began to get friends again but nothing really ever took off. Iâ€™m still a virgin now and Iâ€™m 26, not really bad looking and Iâ€™m in good shape as well. Between the ages of 20-24 I literally did nothing. I had 2 operations in that time and just worked, Iâ€™ve been getting worse and worse though since I was 18 and Iâ€™m just going to get even worse. 

I quit my job 5 months ago for a lot of reasons. I dated my childhood friend within that time. She said she liked me but wasnâ€™t in the right frame of mind and she was at university a lot so she said she didnâ€™t want a relationship. I got drunk for 4 days straight and it ended in a breakdown with my parents consoling me. My dad said I could beat it and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to do. Iâ€™ve got fit and healthy, went to the doctors and applied for over 200 jobs and Iâ€™ve finally got one. 

I just donâ€™t feel ready at all, today was my first day and it was awful. I couldnâ€™t motivate myself and I was really tired. The job is awful just taking rolls of fabric off a conveyor belt. My boss kept asking me if I was ok and it was doing my head in. I canâ€™t stand the job but I canâ€™t quit again. I told my parents I hated it but Iâ€™m going to stay. I canâ€™t get any other job this is the best I can get. I try so hard with everything yet my life is awful. I donâ€™t see the point anymore. Why carry on if I hate life so much, itâ€™s just not for me. My first day drove me insane nearly and Iâ€™m staying. I wonâ€™t kill my self because a lot of people will miss me and I would never want to upset them like that. But Iâ€™m living a nightmare. I am depressed, stressed, anxious and a nervous wreck around everybody. I havenâ€™t been able to concentrate on anything for 2 years. I made mistakes today and I didnâ€™t give a crap I just let them happen, I wouldnâ€™t care if they sacked me I am not fit for work. I just wanted to disappear today. I donâ€™t care at all anymore. Itâ€™s only going to get worse.
