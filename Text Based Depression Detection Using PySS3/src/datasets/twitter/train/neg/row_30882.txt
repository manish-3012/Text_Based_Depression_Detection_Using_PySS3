anyone ever been part of a suicide investigation?Like if it looks like it could be an accident (car crash into bridge, stepped into traffic, stumbled onto train tracks) how closely do they investigate to determine suicide or not?

I need it to not be a suicide for insurance reasons. I am wondering what happens after when it looks like an accident. Like  I'm not going to leave a note or anything but I do have it in my medical history of a previous attempt 10 years ago. 

If my friends and family tell the police or insurance investigator "he seemed fine" will that be enough? 

I read online that conclusively determining suicide requires clear intent like with a note. Otherwise it's an accident.

Of course I would wipe my laptop and my phone of this kind of stuff!
