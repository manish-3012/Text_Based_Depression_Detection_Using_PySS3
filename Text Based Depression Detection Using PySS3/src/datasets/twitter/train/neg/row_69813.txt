Would you live with brain damage?I have a severe brain injury/injuries from when I tried to taper off a psyche drug,I cannot process anything,think,remember or feel much of anything it was compounded by the fact that I couldn't get any real sleep for six months so it just deteriorated and deteriorated and never healed to the point I'm non functional now and can't register anything.

I was unable to stand all October and November and had vertigo a sure sign that the brain injury was deteriorating.
because I have a mental health history no one is taking me seriously at all and thinks it's part of my mental illness,therefore I cannot get a neurologist,rehibiltation or any help,I've tried at the hospital twice.But truly I don't want help anyway there's nothing they can do it was like my brain was wiped out when it happened.

i was a painter,poet,writing novels everything before it happened,with a hundred interests if you asked me before this I wanted to live a thousand years.

Sincerely if this happened to you would you go on? And what would you live for?
