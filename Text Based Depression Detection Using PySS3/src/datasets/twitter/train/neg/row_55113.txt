I have no desire to live. I am purposeless.I've always been very reserved and other people do not take it kindly. I rarely call my parents; not because I don't love them, but because they are always telling me what I should do with my life. I live with my older sister and she bosses me around to no end. She's a blatant hypocrite; She rarely talks to my parents, but yells at me when I don't. It's hard to have a constructive conversation with her because she takes everything personally. My parents clearly favor my sister and brother more than me, but I see why. I hate my job. I don't have any friends. I'm an idiot. I try so hard to achieve things, but it never happens while everyone around me just seems to be getting ahead in life. I don't understand how people can be so happy in a mundane, tragic world. 

I feel like this sounds like some cringy diary from an angsty 12 year old, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.
