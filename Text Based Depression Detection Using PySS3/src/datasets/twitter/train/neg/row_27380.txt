What do you do when nothing works and no one is left?I just finished making a noose and was going to use it until it was too high up, I cant even get that right. I've tried 3very medication, every method, every thing. But I just cant take this pain anymore. I'm tired of being sick and alone and in pain and no one understanding or caring. I just need to give up. I need to not be here. I need relief
