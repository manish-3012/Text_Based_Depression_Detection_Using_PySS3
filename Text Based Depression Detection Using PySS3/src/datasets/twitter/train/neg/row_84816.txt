Having thoughtsShe's gone and it hurts that she left but it hurts more that she left for a rich guy.  Six years of pure love and  she left me for money.  She's still my wife for now and we were pregnant but she lost our baby.  All I wanted was to be a husband and father.  Now I'm nothing. She even took our pets while I was deployed.  I came home from the middle east to nothing.
