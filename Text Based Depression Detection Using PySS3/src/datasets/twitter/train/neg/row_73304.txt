What's the most painless methodI don't care for " oh life is worth living, don't do it" 

I've been stuck with my family for too long, my mother is abusive and my farther is her bitch is there anyway I can end it fast and painless, I've already written my note to them and how they treat me like dog and my sisters and brother like saints when I try to be my best, I've looked up for a positive attitude for years and it's taking it's toll on me, I want to feel wanted and loved and that's something my family can't support, I really think they just hate me, my mother cheated on the man I believed was my father for 15 years and had me, meaning if she was a good person I wouldn't even exist, I'm nothing to her but a reminder of why she's a horrible person and I can never be otherwise
