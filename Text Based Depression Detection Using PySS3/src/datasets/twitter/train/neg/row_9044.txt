Why is it so wrong to commit suicide?I don't get it. Why is it seen as such a bad thing to commit suicide--people treat it like the plague. People have literally told me they won't let me die, and I can't give up, there's so much to look forward too blah bla. Why do they see it as so wrong? Why do they make me stay alive when I want to die so desperately. Maybe because I'm suicidal I never understood the stigma and fear towards it.
