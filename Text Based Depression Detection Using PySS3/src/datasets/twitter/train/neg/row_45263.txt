Help: I ended a relationship with an emotionally abusive ex-wife and started one with a girl who's also very messed up. I want out and don't know what to do. I feel caged and the only way for me to be free is for me to be dead.For anybody willing to read, this is what happened with my ex-wife - it was very serious:

About a month ago I got very drunk and drugged up and met a girl in the local drinking hole who was also drunk an drugged up, and we ended up in my house. This all happened in a drugged up haze. She saw the squalor that my ex-wife left the apartment in, and cleaned up the whole place. She said she needed somewhere to crash for a while and I said fine. I could not make decisions. One day I come back from work and find all of her things in my apartment. I got "comfortable" and she was constantly seducing me for sex, money, etc.. and I almost have no money. I'm back to going out after work and getting my body full of substances. 

This girl was/is very promiscuous and is also an alcoholic. I'm literally scared shitless. I was not in my senses. I went from one hell and entered another one. I see no way out. She claims to have been operated to not have babies. I was stupid and we did it without protection (please do NOT judge me over this - I could not think when this happened).I could be in a horrible mess, and probably am. Now I see no way out at all. Nothing. And I'm just contemplating ending myself. What if she has a disease? What if she's lying about her operation?

I don't know. But if my family finds out about this (they shunned me anyway) they'll just mock me - and mock me when I'm dead as well. I should just finally have enough balls to end it.

I have OCD, generalised anxiety, and depression that can turn clinical. Had it since I was a kid. Now I'm 35. She's 29 and has clinical depression (so she says).
