Just wanted to put this somewhereI (18F) don't like talking to my friends about anything because I don't want to bother them or bring down their mood. I am not their responsibility, but I think this a lot and didn't know who else to tell. Every morning I wake up and regret not killing myself the night before. The only thing holding me back is that I am afraid it will fail and I will be left in an even worse state of life than before.
