Why am I still here?This past year has been a fucking roller coaster on the emotions. Four different times Iâ€™ve came very close to acting on my plans to end my life. The only thing thatâ€™s stopping me is my dog. Out of all the things, I never would have thought heâ€™d be the only thing keeping me alive. I adopted him from the pound and over the time Iâ€™ve had him, heâ€™s became very attached to me. When I moved away to college this last semester, my parents would report back heâ€™d search for me and mope around when he couldnâ€™t find me. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the overwhelming guilt that my dog would be shattered or not. 

This time though, Iâ€™m actually a little scared. I flunked this semester, lost two scholarships which made college possible, and my parents are kicking me out. Iâ€™m afraid this might be the true end. I wonâ€™t be able to take care of my dog. Iâ€™ll end up inevitability failing him like I have everyone else in my life. 

With the situation hitting like it is, Iâ€™m having the hardest time sleeping as more thoughts of ending my life slip into my mind. Maybe I should just do the deed, and make the world a better place.

Anyways, sorry for wasting your time today
