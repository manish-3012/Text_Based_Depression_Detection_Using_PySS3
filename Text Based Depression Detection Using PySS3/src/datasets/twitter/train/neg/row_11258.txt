It's my birthday. I hope I won't live to see another.I trusted my boyfriend. With my heart. My life. He hasn't broken up with me but he's been ghosting me for a month. He hasn't burned the bridge. I wish I was dead. I'm always told how ungrateful I am or how spoiled I am. I just want to be happy. I want my boyfriend. I want to be happy with him. That's all I want for my birthday. But I can't have nice things without BPD ruining them. I want to overdose so nobody will ever have to spend money and time for my wellbeing. I wish I could disappear.
