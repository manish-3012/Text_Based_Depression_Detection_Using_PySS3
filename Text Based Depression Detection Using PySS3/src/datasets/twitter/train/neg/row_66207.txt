Yeah Iâ€™m pretty much doneThe person I cared the most for hates me now because of how I act how I think and how depressing I am, it lead to that every conversation that we have is an argument. 
Iâ€™m hurting people by gaslighting them and guilt tripping them unconsciously which these habits have been pushed on to me by my parent while also having autism which ruined my relationship with others even more because of me not understanding them and being insensitive to them.
The person I was interested in lied to me not being interested in romance and is now going out with some dude
I canâ€™t even die properly while trying to overdose I threw everything up and now everything in my body hurts.

Iâ€™ve completely given up and lost everything
