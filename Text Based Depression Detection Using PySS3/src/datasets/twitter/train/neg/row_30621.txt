I donâ€™t know whenHi. I think the main reason why I get any suicidal thoughts or attempts any more is cause of fear of speaking out about something that someone may not understand and that me wanting that thing is ungrateful cause other people are struggling or doing just worse then me. 

I havenâ€™t successfully followed through, though I have had 3-4 it in the 23 years that i have been alive.
