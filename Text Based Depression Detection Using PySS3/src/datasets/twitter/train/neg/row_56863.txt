Venting a LittleI've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now. I'm actively trying to get help for my depression and anxiety but am nervous to tell my doctor and therapist about my thoughts because I'm scared I'll be involuntarily committed as a result and I just can't have that happen to me. It really hurts because I want to try to be a better person but I can't even be honest to the professionals without fear of consequences.
