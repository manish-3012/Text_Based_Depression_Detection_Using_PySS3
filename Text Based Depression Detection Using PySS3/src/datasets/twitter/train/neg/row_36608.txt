finally doing itjust spending the last few hours with my cat before I head out. if the cliff is empty I plan to stay through sunrise but if there are other people I might have to change plans or go to a different spot. either way iâ€™m never clocking into work again. i hope it doesnâ€™t take to long for them to realize and find my cat but iâ€™ll leave plenty of food and water running. if it wasnâ€™t for my cat i wish my body would never be found
