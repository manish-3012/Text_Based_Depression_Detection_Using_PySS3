Im the last of kin im my family, and im too tired to keep up this frontMy grandparents who are close to being in hospice are my only remaining relatives in this world. They are my life and joy. I'm a bipolar and severely depressed 24 year old that has a bad gpa, manic episodes, no income, and friends that have left me for better pastures. I am not envious nor jealous of the success of others, nor do I have the motivation to aspire to a modicum of success that would pay back the massive debt I'm in to pay for a life worth living. I'm single, gay, and do not have a person in life I truly care for. Posting here you may realize I do not have any career for my life either but being a pragmaticist and having studied economics for my life I see the trajectory that the variables in my life equate to.  I'm so tired of having to be a "symbol of life and hope" for others because of the circumstances of aging this far. I'm tired and I don't see the point of living to 2019.
