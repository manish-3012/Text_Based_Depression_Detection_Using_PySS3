Last resort I guess?Well, I've made many attempts and nothing seems to do the trick. My body just doesn't want to give out when my mind does. Falls, hanging, various pills/booze combinations, drugs, walking into traffic, nothing seems to work and I always "miraculously" survive. How likely am I to be shot if I go to a shitty area and start sxreaming6the N-word at the top of my lungs? I didn't want it to come to this... But I can't take this anymore.. Life just keeps slinging mud at me and I'm tired. I'm already dead mentally, my body just doesn't want to follow through so I'm trapped in this shitty shell...
