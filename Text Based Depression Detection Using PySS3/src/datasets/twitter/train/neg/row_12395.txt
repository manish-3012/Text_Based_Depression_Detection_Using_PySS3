My mother is a nurse in times of Covid and I am just a burdenI wish I had her discipline and would help her at least a fraction of that what she has had given to me.
Bought me books in elementary school, taught me even when in high school although she â€œonlyâ€œ could help with checking the answers in the book.

And I am just such a big disappointment. She should have born another son instead.

She even bought me a watch with an imprint â€œmother's joyâ€œ after my high school graduation.

Cannot kill myself because of her but I am such a disappointment to all her efforts.
