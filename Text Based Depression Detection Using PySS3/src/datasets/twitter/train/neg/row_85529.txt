Should I wake up my mom?I'm under a great deal of stress and I have mental health problems. I'm in my last year of university and I don't have much social support. I've been thinking about suicide seriously for the past few months, but lately it doesn't scare me. I had an event today...something that shouldn't be a big deal but is affecting me and making me think I might not graduate and I want to go and do it right now.

It's almost 1 AM and my mom is asleep. I don't have anyone I can call right now. But maybe it's just a thought and it will pass if I go to sleep. Should I wake up my mom or do you think I'll be unnecessarily worrying her over something?
