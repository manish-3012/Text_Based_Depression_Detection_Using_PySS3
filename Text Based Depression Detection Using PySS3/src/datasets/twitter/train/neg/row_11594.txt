Iâ€™m beginning to think I just want to disappear &amp; for my old identity to die. And Not actually kill myselfI hear a lot of people talking about how they would be fine with just moving away and never talking to anyone from their past again, changing their name, identity, etc...essentially killing their OLD self.

I used to get excited from the thought of killing myself, but now I think that what i really want to do is disappear and observe humanity over time. Like a time traveler in a coffee shop.

Does anyone else feel the same?
