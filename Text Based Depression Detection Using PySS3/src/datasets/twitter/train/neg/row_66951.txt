So lonely I can't take it anymoreHey all

I moved city a couple of years ago now and I've never really felt at home here

I have a few fleeting friendships, but no go to gang of friends to reliably hang out with regularly

Its been going on too long now, im drunk on my own and if I had a gun I'd end it all.

I'm so sick of being lonely and spend nearly every weekend by myself

I have more alcohol and prescription drugs, I just wish I'd not wake up in the morning.

I'm now 27 and feel like I've completely wasted the last 5 - 10 years of my life. Oh to be young again so I could try something different but I feel like its too late.
