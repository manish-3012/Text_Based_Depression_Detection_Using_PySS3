I don't know what to doI just noticed that my family members are trying to get closer to me for some unknown reasons. I've been avoiding them like plague for the past few months. Lately they would try to get to know me before subtly insulting me. I had autism and I honestly don't know what to do. They just remind me of my old friends whom used me just to buy their shit and talk trash about me behind my back. I just wanna avoid them. I feel like a fool forcing myself to be friendly around with them.
