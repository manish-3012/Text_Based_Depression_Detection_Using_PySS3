I think I'm breaking. I don't know what to do anymore.The last 6 months of my life haven't been the greatest. I left my abusive husband with my two young sons, was sexually assaulted by my "best friend" and I'm in love with my ex's brother. We're in a very discrete secret relationship. It hurts knowing that we'll never become more, and I'm ashamed and disgusted with myself that I'm in love with and sleeping with my children's uncle. 

My constant fucking failure is killing me. I can't get my head out of my ass. I can't be the best parent I can be. I keep thinking about how if I didn't have my kids, I'd be gone by now. I'm trying so hard to hold myself together. I fuck up constantly. From custody issues, to falling in love with the worst possible person. I can literally do nothing right. I think I'm the worst person I know. 

I was so excited about starting school this summer. I convinced myself this was my real break, my game-changer. I was going to get an education and finally be able to support my children. Well I'm failing miserably, and stopped going all together. Now I'll never be eligible for financial aid. I fucked up my last chance. 

I hate myself with such a bitter passion. I cut myself occasionally, and the urge is getting stronger each day. I feel like I need to be punished. I feel worthless, and I frequently think the people in my life would be better off without me. The other day I was holding a knife and tripped on a toy and almost stabbed myself. I was kind of disappointed I didn't. 

I'm angry at myself for giving up on everything so easily when I have two amazing little boys to look after. They deserve so much better than me, and I think that's what kills me the most. 

I don't know if I'm suicidal, I probably am. I want help, but how could I ever get help? What if my boys get taken away from me because I'm unstable? They'd have to live with their father, the abusive POS. I'm at a complete loss. I want to crawl in a hole and die.
