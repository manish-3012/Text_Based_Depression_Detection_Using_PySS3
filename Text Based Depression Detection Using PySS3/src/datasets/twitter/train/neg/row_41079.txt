Looking for any reason not toI am a 28 year old male whoâ€™s been struggling with mental illness since 1999.
Iâ€™ve always felt that Iâ€™ve had strong support in my life early on..
However in the past few years, more so the past month or two, Iâ€™ve felt that I have been completely abandoned by everyone Iâ€™ve loved.
My family, friends, doctor/therapist will not take me seriously I canâ€™t cry for help any louder.
All I am seeking is someone to talk to, someone who can listen.. 
but I fear that time is too late, Iâ€™ve been completely alone and havenâ€™t seen or talked to another human being in over a month 
And I think that Iâ€™ve reached my absolute limit for what a human being can withstand, I fear that Iâ€™ve spent one too many days by myself, and not only has my inner self stopped talking me out of taking my own life.. but I keep warming to the idea of not being around anymore. Though selfish.. at least I wonâ€™t have to suffer anymore 
    One Last Cry For HELP
