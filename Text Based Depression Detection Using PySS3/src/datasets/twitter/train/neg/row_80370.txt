my parents are kicking me outMy father and mother are divorced and my dad lost the privilege of my respect when him and my stepmom decided to abuse me both physically and psychologically. Now, my mother is kicking me out for smoking weed and I have nowhere to go. I was starting to be so happy but as always it just gets ripped away in a violent and sudden event leaving me feeling empty and cold. I don't want to die. I really don't. I just have run out of options. I guess my entire struggle through depression my whole life has culminated into this one catastrophic failure of my life and ultimately my end. 

This afternoon I will jump from the highway 21 bridge where it crosses the Boise river. I will deeply miss leaving behind my brothers and parents and it is nobodies fault but my own. It has always been my fault. 

The funny thing is I have always known that I would die by my own hand. I just never thought that the day would come so soon that I must take my own life. Today I will become a pioneer into the dark valley of death as we all must be one day. I can't say that I am ready to die but the world is ready for me to pass. I can't describe this feeling of closure. It's time for me to go plain and simple and there is little I can do to stop it.

I know why Im posting here. One last desperate cry. One last deep breath before the plunge. I'm hoping that I can be saved but I am hoping against hope. Not all the good will in this world can save me, however, and I expect no reversal of intent. It is with great shame that I leave now for my final act of selfishness before the long dark that awaits me.

I thank you all for your efforts here on this sub and abroad, but you can't save them all.

Farewell.
