I'm gonna die eventually anyway so why wait? Better sooner than later.What's the point? Living in fear of the inevitable, not knowing when or how it'll go down. If I did it, I'd have control over how it happens. With enough planning I could make it painless.

Plus, no more anxiety and depression and all that shit
