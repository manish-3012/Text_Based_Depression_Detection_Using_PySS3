Peer has committed suicideI am a PhD student and struggling to balance life and study. One of the PhD students has committed suicide two months ago and it still bothers me. Despite that I feel sorry for him, I know that I have had many many many times that I wanted to come under a bus. I know you might say: Just quit the PhD. It's just not that easy to waist all this time and money. If I stop my PhD, I will have a gap in my CV. I have invested one and half year and a lot of money that I used to pay for my childs nursery. I just feel that I am a failure. I used to cook great new things, now I just put some tasteless stuff together. I am moody. I have had panic attacks and I hate myself. I feel like I am a terrible mom. The suicide today made me realise that it's sad for people around you to find out that you are gone. But I just understand the pressure. I don't want to die because of my daughter. I want her to have her mom. I used to enjoy my studies, but lately, I just don't. I do nothing. I just can't get over how much I hate myself. Don't worry, I won't commit suicide, but I don't mind dying.
