I Need Someone To Talk ToGood evening, reddit. I need help, this is my cry for help. I'm struggling and suffering. My boyfriend of four years recently dumped me, let's call him X. Before X, I was with a guy that we will call Y. When Y broke up with me, I attempted suicide. I lived. I didnt take the time to become a stable human before jumping in with X. Now that X is gone, I'm afraid of falling into those thoughts again. 

I don't want to kill myself but I dont want to be alive. I've been googling things like suicide by cop and how to get run over but I don't want to do it. I need help and I dont know where else to go. If anyone would like to try and help me through this tough time so I don't let those thoughts consume me, please do. I need you, nice people of reddit. Please help me..
