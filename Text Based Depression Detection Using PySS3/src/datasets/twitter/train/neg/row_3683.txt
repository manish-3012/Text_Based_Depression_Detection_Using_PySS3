Haven't drank heavy in yearsMe and my wifehad a severe communication and I ended up texting someone about stuff and I shouldn't have. I hate myse acting before clarifying but I hate hurting my wife. If she leaves the phantom of alcohol that's loomed over my shoulder for years wants to comeout. Of she leaves I want to get so drunk I pass out and don't wake up for a long time. My whole life's been shitty I was sexually abused as a child for many years, I lived in a filthy house my whole childhood. I drank severely in early 20 s. I stopped when I met this woman. But because of miscommunication and mostly my stupidity, I've hurt her greatly. All my life has been hard but this time it's on me and hurts unbelievably bad and if she leaves or i wake upand she's goneall I will be tempted to do is drink. I'm unsure if I'm actively suicidal but there's plenty of times I wish I wasn't born or could just disappear. I hate myself. I hate hurting the one I love most. Especially the one that loved me enough to marry me. I just think I'm so stupid and worthless. I don't deserve anything good And I just feel lost and disappointed in myself. I feel like a burden and a waste space.  And hurting my wife's heart and soul is the worst pain I've ever encountered.  I don't hit, yell, abuse,or anything, just am the world's biggest idiot and I don't think I deserve to see many tomorrows. She does not know how tempted I am too blackout drink, she loves me a lot but just knowing I hurt someoneso genuine kills me. I'm gonna try to not drinkas I haven't had hardly any alcohol in years granted very special occasion and little in amount, but thismight be what sends me Back. Why should I wake up? I haven't done anything for anyone.
