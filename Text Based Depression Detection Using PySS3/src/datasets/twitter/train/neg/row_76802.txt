I thought I was getting better.It had been a while now since the last time this happened. Before this, it would be small bouts of sadness and suicidal thoughts. Nothing that stuck to my mind for too long, probably around 2-3 days at a time. But it's been over a month now, and it only gets worse as nights go by. 

There hasn't been a single night where I haven't cried. My chest feels tight, it's hard just to breathe. I can't shake off this overwhelming feeling of ending it permanently. I just might.
