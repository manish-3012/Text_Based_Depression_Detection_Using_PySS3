Pandemic has made the world worseI was already depressed.  I am 55 I have tried several ways to try to get Covid and hope I wouldn't do well.  I am fat too.
I cant visit  my my because she is afraid of getting Covid from us kids.  Everything has been cancelled. I have chronic back pain.  I am tired of being here and have prayed I would die some other way.  I dont want to be here anymore.
