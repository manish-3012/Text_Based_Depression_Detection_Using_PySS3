Someone attempted suicide and his family blames me. Now I want to attempt suicide.Itâ€™s a very long and draining story, but a person I have never met attempted suicide but he lived. He blamed me (I didnâ€™t bully him, harass him or do anything evil like that to him) and now his family messages me constantly, blaming and threatening me.

They have good points too, and I blame myself for what happened completely. It was my fault, I caused it. And now I want to die.

Itâ€™s a long and complex story, but all I know is that Iâ€™m at least 55% to blame and I want to die because I made him suffer.
