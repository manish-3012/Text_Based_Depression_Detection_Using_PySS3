HmGod i just might spam here all the time. Anyways i wonder will life always be like this. Will I always be like this. If things are better would I not be depressed anymore. I'm tired of feeling suicidal for the smallest things. I'm tired of trying to fix my brain. I'm tired of even talking it out. It don't make me feel better. It's like just opening wounds, and letting cold wind hit it. 

What could help. I dont know. I'm tired of feeling sick. I'm tired of feeling hurt. I don't wanna do this. And tomorrow I'll wake up and feel slightly better and then it just comes back. I hate crying myself to sleep every night but most nights I do now. I'm tired. Really tired of this.
