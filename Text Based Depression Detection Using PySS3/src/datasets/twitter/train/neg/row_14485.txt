If I don't find a decent Job within a week I'm going to kill myself.I have Bipolar. It prevents me from functioning. Therapy does not work. I am 23 and live with my parents and can't afford a car, or an apartment.  I've worked a string of shitty retail jobs that I can't hold cause they make me so fucking miserable that I stop functioing. 

All my friends have managed to get decent jobs at this point, even without college. They all make at least 13 bucks an hour and have their own places. I hate living at home. I hate not having savings.

I am looking at some of the big job mills in piittsburgh to find a big boy job. If I don't, I am going to kill myself. I'm done being dependent.
