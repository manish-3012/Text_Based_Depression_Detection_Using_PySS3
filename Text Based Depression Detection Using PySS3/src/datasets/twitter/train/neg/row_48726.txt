I have nothing.I'm so tired of always feeling sad, unmotivated, lazy, and the list goes on. I have no friends, no actual education, no one that loves me, no physical contact with anyone. I'm unemployed, so I have a big fat minus in bank account. I can't even afford to pay the rent. All I do is just sit. I accomplish absolutely nothing every day, and I don't know how to turn it around.

I constantly just want to end my sad meaningless life. I live on the 4th floor in an apartment building, and I look down at the ground from my big window every night. One jump and all of this would be over. I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to the edge every day.

I've finally found someone that likes me, but she lives on the other  side of the planet, and since I have no money, there is no way in hell I'm ever going to visit her, so it's just like a carrot on a stick, which makes it even worse. I'll never touch her. I'll never get her. It's just there to tease me.

I'm so exhausted.
