I canâ€™t get away from my abuserI made this account in the case my main is being watched. I am 25m who got out of an eight year relationship last year who is still being stalked and harassed by my ex girlfriend. While I was with her, 6 of the 8 years together was daily belittling and condescension. Now that Iâ€™m out sheâ€™s gotten increasingly desperate for my attention in the past few months, claiming just wanting to apologize but blowing my phone up with texts and calls. Calling my family. Getting in fights with my mother and grandmother in public. Showing up at events Iâ€™m going to. Iâ€™ve asked her multiple times to leave me alone and she refuses to listen. Sheâ€™s become more aggressive lately and was known for making fake accounts even when we were together to monitor my activity, which she has now used recently to spread rumors about me. Iâ€™ve finally filed for a restraining order but the temporary order has been denied since most of the harassment has been limited to the internet recently, and even after deleting all my social media she still is contacting my loved ones. I just feel like sheâ€™s going to get away with this like she does everything else and Iâ€™m suicidal as fuck. Sheâ€™s trying to turn friends against me and in some aspects she has won so I have less support than I thought. I just canâ€™t get away. I canâ€™t get out. The other side is calling me and I need to answer.
