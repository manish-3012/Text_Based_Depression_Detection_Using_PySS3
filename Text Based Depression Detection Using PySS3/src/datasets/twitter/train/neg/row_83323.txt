I have absolutely no one. Short version: 

* I have a parent with terminal cancer. 
* My significant other just ended our relationship because of that. 
* My work is a mess. I love/hate my job.
* My friends have no idea how to deal with my situation with my parent.
* My therapist keeps cancelling our appointments. 
* I am a Doctorate student and school is a mess. 

I have never felt more alone in my entire life. 
I never thought I would say this as I detest suicide but I have no other option. 
I have NEVER felt that there was no way out but this time there isn't. 

EDIT: So everyone says this is a place to ask for help. To find support. I came here for that. Instead I get downvoted and ignored. That is disgusting and so fucked up that I can't even find the words. Why the fuck does this subreddit even exist?!
