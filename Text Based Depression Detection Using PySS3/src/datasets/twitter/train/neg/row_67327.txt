my severe body dysmorphia and lack of hope for the future has gotten the best of me. Iâ€™ve tried over and over again, but I think now is my time.I donâ€™t really want sympathy, just want to feel peace for the first time in probably 12 years. I have a boyfriend and a grandmother who love me, but they understand.
