I feel like a prisonerI feel like I have a life sentence that I have to just live out until I can die respectfully. And I can't stand it.

I tried killing myself about a year ago. When my parents and sister found out, it nearly destroyed them. I have never regretted a decision so greatly. I can't kill myself while they are still in my life. That sounds like a good thing, but it frustrates me so much. I feel that the rest of my life is going to be putting on a happy face, keeping them content until I reach old age where I can finally just off myself in peace. The whole time, I won't go a day without wishing that I could shorten my sentence. 

There is truly no good decision. If I kill myself, I will permanently destroy my loved ones. If I keep on living, I will suffer until whenever death decides to finally call me. I can't talk to my family about this because I finally got them thinking that I'm fine, and I can't bring them to sadness again. There's nowhere I can turn here. please help me.
