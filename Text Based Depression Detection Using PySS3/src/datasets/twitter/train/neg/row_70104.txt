There are so many people who love me, and I have such a long life ahead of me, but I still want to die every single dayIn the last 6 month, I've gotten more and more depressed.  I haven't talked to anyone about it mainly because for a while I didn't think it was legit.  I thought I was just kind of down and when things picked up again so would my mood, the opposite happened.  I know how many people love and care for me.  There would a huge hole missing from many people's lives if I killed myself.  My family is pretty well off.  I can go to a good college, get a good job, and go on to lead a successful life if I work hard. These are all things I would like to do, but I still can't shake the feeling more and more that I just want to kill myself.  The feeling gets stronger everyday, but I still have the feeling in my gut that I won't act on the feeling.  I'm so scared that eventually that gut feeling won't be there anymore.
