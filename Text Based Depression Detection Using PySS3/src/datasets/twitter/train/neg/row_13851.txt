I don't love anything anymoreI used to be so happy. I loved everything under the sun. I could find the beauty in cracks on the sidewalk. I remember having strong wonderful emotions. Now all I feel when I look at around is disgust.  I started a SSRI three weeks ago when I was crying uncontrollably for 8 hours a day, half the time for no reason at all. Today I can't get out of bed and all I can think about is ways to die. I made a list of people who would really be hit with my death but ended up realizing they'd all get over it eventually. 

I can't do this. I don't even know what this is anymore.
