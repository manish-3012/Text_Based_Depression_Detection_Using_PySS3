Someone give me some motivation...To suicide now instead of waiting. I planned on suiciding next March a little before I turned 20, but I am in NYC with limited gun access. I could risk hanging or overdosing, but I don't want to risk surviving. I don't want to survive. They say better things happen when you wait, so I will wait till I have access to a shotgun. I need the most lethal method, so i'll use a firearm. I am already set on the method and time. I'm not leaving any notes. Everyone wants me to suicide anyway.

Any motivation to do it now?
