Help with a friends whoâ€™s not feeling wellShe is my best friend and she is not answering me (or my friends) since yesterday. On her twitter account, she wrote two days ago â€œI donâ€™t want to be alive, I just wanna day todayâ€ and â€œAu revoirâ€ (Goodbye in French).
However 5 days ago she wrote about Demi Lovatoâ€™s tour bÃ©casse sheâ€™s going to it and she was so happy. Last week I invited her home and she seems happy and confident about her life.

I know she broke with her boyfriend because he cheated on her, let her dream about a future together, then going to his other girl. She had been cheated on a first time two years ago and then attempted suicide. But her family send her to the hospital and I went to see her (it was my birthday and she called me the day before I visited her).
Last month, she was sad about her (ex-)boyfriend and I tried to comfort her. She told me she wonâ€™t tried to harm her, because she didnâ€™t want to go back to the hospital.
I thought she felt better. She found an internship that seemed to interest her, she was going to move out with her sister (she lived with her boyfriend before the breaking-up but now she couldnâ€™t afford a place for her alone).

Now I donâ€™t know what sheâ€™s doing and I want to help her... I ask her sister but she doesnâ€™t know too (they were going to move out this week, so she would see her later). And I donâ€™t even know why I came here to ask for help...

(Ps: pardon my English, I may have made some typos. Also, I donâ€™t know if I can post this in this sub. Iâ€™m sorry if I canâ€™t.)


EDIT: I texted her mother, sheâ€™s fine (as sheâ€™s alive, because her breakup still hurts her).
