I will never forgive my parents for having meIâ€™m a senior in high school right now and Iâ€™ve never not been depressed. Iâ€™ve never enjoyed being alive and Iâ€™ve always had a condition called depersonalization, which is a part of what I think is borderline personality disorder in my case. 

I donâ€™t want to deal with all this college shit, I donâ€™t want to retake the SAT, I donâ€™t want to join the wage slave workforce, fuck all of that. I will never forgive my parents for having me and making me apart of this shitty world.
