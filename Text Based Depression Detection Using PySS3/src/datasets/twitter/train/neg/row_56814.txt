I just have to thank all redditorsReddit got me out of this , not friends
I didnâ€™t  tell my parents cuz I didnâ€™t want to scare the heck out of them
My friends knew because I told them not because they NOTICED , I got helped by a social not by people. That is something bad: people who donâ€™t even know me helped me more than my closest friends.

Thanks to yâ€™all , if you hadnâ€™t been here I wouldâ€™ve killed myself weeks ago

**THANKS**
