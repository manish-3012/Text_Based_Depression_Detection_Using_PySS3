I feel like I can' talk to anyone in person anymore, I feel like they will just forcefully send my to the hospital because it is "in my own interest" or some similar BSI want to die more than anything, there is no hope I have been through 8 years of this. I believe people should have the right to die if they choose. The pain is beyond anything drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, other psychiatric drugs, alcohol, tobacco, etc) can help me with let alone words. I hate everyone that pretends like they want to help or if they do want to help me or are too stupid to know how to fix me. I am not interested in incremental progress the pain needs to stop now one way or the other. I have already been to the hospital it is worse than hell.I feel like I have exhausted all the options available to me.
