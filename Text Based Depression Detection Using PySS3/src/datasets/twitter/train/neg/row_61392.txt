I dont have a second to be alone. I cant drink. I cant smoke. I cant work out. I cant do jack shit because this country is like the murder capital of the world and Im a pretty young girl who doesnt speak the language, so Id probably get raped and murdered in a heartbeat. _x000D_

Im going stir crazy. Ive been up all night because of the time difference and my two aunts and one cousin are sleeping out in the living room, which means I cant watch TV in there. I went to the spare bedroom to try to sleep, but surprise, another fucking cousin is sleeping in there. I cant go anywhere and I cant do anything. I feel so trapped and I dont know what to do. Im not really a suicide risk but I cant help feeling like Im on point of hurling myself out a fucking window. I cant sleep because theres nowhere for me to sleep. My grandpa will wake up soon and need his computer room and then Ill be really fucked. I HATE HATE HATE it here. I didnt even want to come to begin with. I dont care much for family, and I truly dislike being near my mother. _x000D_

P.S. Forgive my lack of apostrophes, goddamn Spanish keyboards arent worth their weight in shit. _x000D_

EDIT: THanks to those who offered advice. I was probably unneccesarily angry last night. Everything just feels so much worse at night, you know? Anyway, thanks. I may last.
