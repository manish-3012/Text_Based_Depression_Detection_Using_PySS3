My best friend is going to commit suicide after his psychosis , help me....I wonâ€™t get into the background because itâ€™s too long.
But basically my best friend got suicidal after he got a psychosis from psychedelics.
Currently heâ€™s depressed and is smoking alot of weed to cope, the only thing in life that interests him is drugs , and ironically for some reason, drugs arenâ€™t affecting him at all, so heâ€™s  planning on killing himself soon.
One part of me wants to scream at the motherfucker for being so selfish, while the other part wants our last memories to be positive...
I have been dreading this day for the last 6 months and itâ€™s coming , and i dont know what to do......
