Today I asked God to kill meI really meant it, everytime I ask him, I really mean it. Death is better than my life. There's no hope for me at all. I dont know how to live properly because Im a diagnosed schizophrenic. I dont know how to live normally because Im a diagnosed schizophrenic. Im in pain. Im too depressed to do anything. I cant pack my bag when Im going away on holiday, I cant take a shower, cant change, barely eat dinner. Depressed af. I have no friends, no boyfriend, cant interact or think properly because Im schizophrenic. Ive wanted to die since 2015. I cant believe Ive already hit 2017. And my life is getting worse. Im going nowhere. Im getting nowhere. They say theres light at the end of the tunnel, but fuck, the tunnel is too long. Im going to take alot of sleeping pills tonight or if I see a good place, I'll try not to hestitate and I'll hang myself. I really hope I die. Its going to get worse if I wake up in hospital because theyll keep me there because Im suicidal. If God loves me he wont allow me to wake up in hospital, he wont allow me to wake up at all.
