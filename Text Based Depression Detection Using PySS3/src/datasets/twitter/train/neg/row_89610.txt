I feel.......nothing.I feel nothing, absolutely nothing at all. I am indifferent towards things I would have previously been happy or sad about. 

I feel listless. Just sitting and watching the day go by and I feel nothing towards that occurring. 

I have no motivation. No interest. I am content to sit in silence in my home. I am content to have no human contact with anyone for the past five days. 

My mind is empty, almost eerily calm. It makes me wonder about disappearing from this world. I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™ve arrived at a decision to let go or if any wave of emotion will eventually come and hit me to try and provide me with direction. 

I. Feel. Nothing.
