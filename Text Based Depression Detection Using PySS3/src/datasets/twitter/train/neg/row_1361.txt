Seeking a pen pal to navigate the stormsI am sure many can relate with me; I am really struggling with being honest to those closet to me about just how low I am. I am looking for some escapism and a friend. I want to be a friend to you and carry each other through the storms. Because the sun always comes out again. Maybe not today but someday soon. Take care poppets. It may get choppy.
