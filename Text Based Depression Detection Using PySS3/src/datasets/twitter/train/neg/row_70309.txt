Tired of explaining myselfI keep posting on random forums hoping I can maybe get some help from people and I just get a momentary "things arent so bad" but then a couple days later I feel like everythings futile again. I have a previous post on /r/depression which explains alot of what im going through but recently its mainly been the thing of having no friends, I know a few people in my class (my school has tiny classes with like 5 people) but I dont really relate to them at all. I have no real hobbies and the place I live is shit and theres nothing to do and my parents dont drive, how am I supose to even meet new people its like even if I try I cant. I'm 15 by the way so i cant drive obviously. Sorry this is a really messy post I just thought its worth a shot, again..
