I'm Slowly Losing ItI keep getting visions of jumping off a high bridge, after all my other painless suicide methods failed. I'm scared I'm gonna just say fuck it one day and jump. I don't see any reason to live anymore, I'm useless, short, ugly, and fat. Can't even get the motivation to go to the gym. It's not even about girls liking me anymore. I just hate myself so much.
