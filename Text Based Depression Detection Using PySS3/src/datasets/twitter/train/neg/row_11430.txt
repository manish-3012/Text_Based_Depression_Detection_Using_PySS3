I wanna die so badIm 16 and I want to die but I don't want to commit suicide cause I attempted once, not long ago,and failed. I was at the hospital and then transferred to a teen mental health facility. It was embarrassing for me.I didn't want to label myself as a depressed, suicidal teen, So I lied to all my therapist about how I'm always feeling great and that incident was just an episode. But the truth is my anxiety has been gotten worse aswell as my depression and sometimes I wish for a deadly disease to die.
