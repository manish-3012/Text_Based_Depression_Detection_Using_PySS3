Can't kill myself but I want to.Honestly, my life is not even bad but I just can't find the urge to get up in the morning. I have no purpose or goal in life and everyday feels like a pointless struggle. I'm introverted and have social anxiety so even leaving my house is a constant battle and other than college I don't do much. I would kill myself but I'm too afraid of the pain and I don't think my family could cope with it at all either. I don't want to seek medical help since I know my parents wouldn't look at me the same ever again. I just needed somewhere to talk so I ended up here.
