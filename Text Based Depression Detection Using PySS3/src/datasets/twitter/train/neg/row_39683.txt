It's my birthday tomorrow. I'll only be more alone and depressed by then than right now.I feel like I've ruined my life and broken friendships. I've asked more people than I can count to do something, have fun, or go somewhere with me and have gotten all 'No's. I'm positive most of them just don't want to. I'm sure they don't like me. 

I've been told I'm fun and kind, but I hate myself and I'm convinced others do as well. I feel like shit texting everyone I know to try to get just one yes, one person who thinks of me as just a decent person to go to a movie or something similar.

I can't take it, I feel even worse just sitting here knowing I'll be alone tomorrow and most likely always. I don't want to die. I really don't. I just can't stop myself from thinking about this and how it's almost some utopian solution. 

Thanks for reading, if you did. It means the world. It really does.
