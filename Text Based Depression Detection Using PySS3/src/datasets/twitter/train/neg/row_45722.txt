Random thoughts of DeathLately it feels like everyone I love and care about leaves me, or only keeps me around to control me. I feel like part of the reason I feel like I don't belong anywhere is because I was an 'accident.' No one cares about unless it's out of obligation and because I can be painfully naive and easy to use. 

My Mother has already turned some family members that I love and cared about away from me after I moved out of the house.
I feel like I try my hardest to help everyone, but I can't even manage to help myself.

I hate having this pain so much, my anxiety is at its peak and I never feel like I'm as happy as I used to be. No one is even going to miss me when I'm gone, I don't have any friends and my whole family is slowly but surely turning against me, all thanks to my Mom telling them things that aren't true.

I donâ€™t always feel like suicide but I do get random thoughts here and there, especially on my worst days.  

Thoughts of the pain hurts so much everyday, but I'm too scared to follow through. I don't want to feel any pain if/when I die, but I also don't want to feel this pain and fear any longer.

I don't know...I just don't know...
