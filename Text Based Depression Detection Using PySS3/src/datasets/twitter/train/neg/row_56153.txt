Damn, look how crazy it is!Holding your breath until you pass out, letting your lungs fill up with water. Why make it seem like the worst thing? It's only the worst for those still asleep, still blinded by themselves.

Most of you are still there, thinking that's the only place to be. It is notâ€”oh, it is not.

You want people to care about you? You want life to have been made for people like you and me too? Life was never made for anyone else but itself. You are a speck of dust in the midst of a storm. You are no one just like me.

We want to be connected, but the storm is the one in control. No one CAN care about you. Life has already been made. You are already here. The only move you have is to do exactly what you want. Just like life does. It doesn't care about you, you shouldn't either. Go do ruckus!

Don't keep yourself sane. "Rationale" is the lie you are being sold. The purpose you were given is to fit. Haha. Suck my fucking dick! I'd rather gargle mercury than be part of the "fit" I was intended for.

Keep playing video games, be annoying, sell drugs, keep fucking the police ;0. Stop following rules that don't work for you.

Only kill yourself in the sheer realization of beauty. Bliss. Don't stay locked inside of yourself. Don't die without seeing first. Please, wait a little. See things as they are. It may not be the time to do so, and that's fine.

If you decide to do it anyway, that's okay. We're all bound to it.

We are beautifully fucked up. It is no one's fault. Much love!
