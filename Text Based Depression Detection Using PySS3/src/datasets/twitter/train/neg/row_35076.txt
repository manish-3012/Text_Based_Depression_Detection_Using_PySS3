I don't know if I will ever get betterI have had depression for about 6 years. I hid it from everyone for 4 years, until I finally told my partner 2 years ago. She pushed me to get help, but it isn't working. It keeps getting worse.
I was a psychology major in college until I had to drop out a couple weeks ago. This was my.junior year, and I very much understand depression and the treatments for it. It makes counseling feel useless, because I already know what they are going to say. 
I want to get better, but it doesn't seem like it's going to happen. I have been on medice for a year, and the doctor's have switched my medicine 3 times. I have very strong suicidal thoughts. They were particularly bad one day, so my partner took me to an emergency walk in counseling session. The therapist sent me to the hospital, where I stayed for a week. It was not something that helped me (it is definitely something that can help others. And I don't want anyone to be discouraged from going if they need help). It just was not helpful for me. I had a lot of downtime, which is when I get stuck in my head. Their program was also based on group therapy, and groups of people make me nervous. 
I have been going to therapy for a year and it just is not working. I feel as crumby as I always have and I have no idea what to do.
I hate the burning negative feelings I have in my chest all the time, and I hate doing things. I can't get out of bed, and I absolutely despise myself for every bit of it. I know it's not rational, I know it's the depression talking, but all I want is for my life to be over, so I don't have to feel this way. It just doesn't seem like I will ever get better.
