Dying should be easyWell, today I rang Lifeline. It sounded like a 12 year old on the end of the phone who didn't know what to say. 

I have 2 kids and if not for them, I am pretty sure I wouldn't be here. 

Sure, I have the GP, the psychologist, the medication, and even much of the time the desire to be OK...but I just cant find peace.

My husband sexually abused me among other things for 10 years. When it got to the stage of my little girl asking him to "stop it daddy"...I had to go. If I didn't, I genuinely believe I would be dead now. I'm not sure how. At his hands or my own. But definitely dead.

Even though he is not in my home, he still bullies and controls me through the children. Yes. The kids love him. After all, he is their dad. But it's so much more complicated than that. He has been charged of raping an 8 year old child. Denies it of course. Do you think the Family Court helps me? DHS? No. They don't. I'm really on my own in this messed up system. 

To add a few more layers, I am blood related to the victim. I've gone on stress leave in my job as the IT manager was sexually inappropriate and HR did nothing. (Is a man implying that he is masturbating on the phone OK? Or saying he will get his peaCOCK feathers out?). And now I have been made redundant while on stress leave.

So tell me.....how can I survive? I don't want to. And yet if I don't, what will happen to my kids? 

I guess I am asking for permission to die.
