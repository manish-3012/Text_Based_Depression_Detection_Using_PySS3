I don't deserve anything anymoreI honestly don't know why I deserve to live by this point. I have tried to lose weight over the past 3 years to absolutely nothing has changed (despite my efforts), I'm a disappointment to my family, my friends don't like hanging out with me because I'm constantly depressed and they've told me they're sick of it, I can't accomplish anything I put myself to, and on top of all of that my speciality is basically fucked. Honestly it would be better if I were dead by this point and no one would care if I were dead anyways.
