I forgive the world for not being able to helpIâ€™m going to leave in a couple days. I have a plan so nobody has to find the body, and everyone can move on. I donâ€™t want to die but I need to, it is inevitable. 

But thatâ€™s not the point of this post. The point is that I forgive the world for not helping me and people like me.

- I forgive my family for thinking depression is just something that makes me a sad instead of something that keeps me from functioning, because they just couldnâ€™t understand 

- I forgive my friends for never reaching out, because they could never had known why I stopped talking to them

- I forgive redditors for not responding to my pleas, because there are just too many people with too many problems

- I forgive schools for thinking that counselors could help, because a few deaths a year doesnâ€™t effect them

- I forgive everyone else for thinking â€œI should just stop being dramatic,â€ or â€œI should just push through itâ€
