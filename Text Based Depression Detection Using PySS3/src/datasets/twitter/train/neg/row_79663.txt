I wanna dieWhenever I wake up, I get frustrated that I did. I have PTSD and am clinically diagnosed with depression. I feel horrible about myself. I just want to end all these. I don't know. I just wanna get lost, maybe. 

When I was a kid, I am afraid of dying. Now it's apparent that that's what I needed.
