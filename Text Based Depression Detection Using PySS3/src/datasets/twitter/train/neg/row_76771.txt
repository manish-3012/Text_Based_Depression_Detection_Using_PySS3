I think my family member 4 hours away is suicidal and I don't know what to doHe is going through a horrible time with his wife (separated), they've both lost custody of their kids to another family member, their cars have been repossessed and the house is in foreclosure. 

Financial and other help has been offered many times but declined. 

In the last 4 weeks he has been increasingly hard to reach, and has stopped going to work- a job he enjoyed and has been doing for years.

This week culminated in a break-down-the-door week check by local police. His wife and work both called for a well check. He admitted he is really depressed but declined further help.

He is still not responding to family, with the exception of acknowledging that he is alive to one of his brothers and he's exchanged a few texts with my husband (not his brother or blood relation). I don't think my family is taking this seriously enough and I think his increased isolation from work and family, coupled with his admitted depression is a huge red flag.

We haven't been able to confirm but it seems likely/apparent that there are substance abuse issues as well. We have no idea how he lost the kids, either, but they are safe and have visitation with him weekly.

I think a couple of his closest family members should drive to him and basically reiterate that he is loved and wanted and encourage him to get medicinal and mental health therapy.  My only goal is to make sure he knows he's loved and wanted and we are here to support him in a variety of ways.

Is this the right approach? What else can we do?
