I'm ready.I'm ready. I'll give my thoughts a week to clear up, but I'm ready. I've never gone through with anything in my life... this probably won't be any different.. with just proves how worthless I am, but I simply can't handle this teenage angst. I know that I am dumb (I am constantly reminded that I'm dumb by certain friends) for planning to end my life, but I know I'm not meant for something greater- I'm not going to find love. Even if I were to find love I wouldn't be able to keep it. I never have been able to because no one wants to be around a Debbie downer. But I need you to get me through this, why can't anyone see that? I know that my behavior Is dumb and disappointing and you don't want to have to deal with my drama, but I need you. You have the ability to make me happy. But that's selfish of me- I don't make you happy.. So, Lord, I'm am thankful that you gave me a chance at life, and I am sorry that I'm not strong enough to handle the basic stresses of life that everyone has to go through. I'm ready. Lord, if you don't take me first, I'll do it myself. 

And what do you know. They're messaging me right now. :) Fate or coincidence.. I'll guess we'll find out in a week.
