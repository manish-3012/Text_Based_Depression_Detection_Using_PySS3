The top post of this sub is fucking baffling."If you were going to do it you would have done it already"

Yea OK, i guess I'm not looking for reasons to end it and am just looking for sympathy as to to how my life isn't that bad. 

Whoever you are, fuck you. You clearly don't comprehend what can go on inside the mind of a person other than yourself. 

Maybe you'll have a real life experience one day instead of chalking it up to "you're having a bad day, talk it out".
