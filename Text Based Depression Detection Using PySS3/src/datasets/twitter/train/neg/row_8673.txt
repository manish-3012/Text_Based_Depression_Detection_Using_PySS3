It's the only option that's sure to make me happier than I am nowI can't handle my depression. Therapy makes me more and more anxious. I don't know myself. I can't discern my personality from what I think my personality should be. Being asked relentless questions about what makes me feel depressed results in me hazarding guesses that are certainly wrong but the therapists seize and run with despite my reluctance. I have no idea what I enjoy, I can't remember being genuinely happy rather than momentary pleasure. I can't see me taking any options in future other than suicide. It feels like my life has been about waiting for death for some time but frankly I can't be bothered to wait.

I'm posting here because I really don't want this to be my option. What reasons do I have for life? I can't see any beyond the standard cliches which I've already thought of. Help?
