I've began to plan out my final daysI've decided that January 8th will be the day I leave this earth. I began writing my suicide letter today. I'm not an amazing writer so this is hard for me. But I figured I would just speak from the heart and get started early because I have a lot of people I want to write to. I want to spend the last few days doing things that I love and spending time with those who love me. I love going on bike rides, boba milk tea, watching studio ghibli movies, and playing guitar; therefore, I'm gonna spend the next week doing all of those things lol. On January 8th, I plan on deleting this account, printing out my letter, eating one last dinner with my family, and then heading to where I'm going to do it (I don't want to do it at home because I don't want my parents to find me). I think I've kind of come to terms with my impending death. I don't know if any of you have seen the new Pixar movie, Soul, but it really opened my mind to the idea that your purpose in life is what you make it. I've found purpose in my friends, family, and the small things that have made me happy. I think I would be doing myself a disservice by continuing to keep living knowing that my depression will only worsen as time goes on. With that being said,  I thank you all for your kind words and messages. Seeing your guys' posts on here really made me feel like I'm not alone in this. I've lived 19 full years. I've had my ups and downs, but overall, I'm thankful for the time I've had here. Depression is a bitch and I hope you guys can all get over this hill. Unfortunately, I'm not as strong. I'll probably make one more post on here before I pull the plug, but if not, it's been a pleasure :).
