Closet SuicidalIâ€™ve been suicidal on and off throughout my life. Iâ€™m one of those smiley depressed/suicidal types so not even my partner of 12+ years really knows. Heâ€™d probably be completely shocked. Iâ€™m successful professionally, have a great personality (not very look-at-me but generally pretty social and quick to laugh), etc.

The last time I really outwardly struggled was when I was a teenager. In my early twenties, I became severely depressed and suicidal, but we were too young and drunk for him to really know what was going on other than thinking I was really lazy and messy all the time. After that, I was always able to be depressed and suicidal almost exclusively inwardly and without many outward symptoms.

Weâ€™ve had a baby who just turned a year, and honestly I think Iâ€™m the lowest Iâ€™ve ever been in my adult life. Itâ€™s starting to show, but mostly as new-mom-frustration, not depression. My husband mostly just finds me annoying when Iâ€™m like this.

I tried going to therapy the other week, but I mostly smiled the whole time and made light of everything. I didnâ€™t even tell her I was depressed or suicidal. I just talked about all the stressors in my life and she actually complemented me on how together I was despite it all (Iâ€™ve got a lot of family drama going on right now that I wonâ€™t get into).

I just canâ€™t get myself to admit feelings anymore, not even to myself. Honestly its sometimes difficult to feel my own feelings. I think Iâ€™ve numbed them out a lot over the years.

When I do feel, I just think about suicide and how I should have just done it before I had my daughter because of the traumatic effect suicide has on children. I will never tell her about my suicidal thoughts because my mom was constantly talking about suicide when I was a little kid. To this day, whenever she gets upset she talks about not wanting to live because Iâ€™ve done this or that. I never want to do that to my daughter.

Not that I would ever tell anyone outside of anonymity, but I almost regret having my daughter because now I canâ€™t kill myself anymore.

I just wish I could get myself to talk to someone. I feel very alone. Today I just really wish I could end it but I could never leave my daughter to be raised by whoever while my husband has to work all the time.
