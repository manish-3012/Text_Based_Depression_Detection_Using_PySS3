Killing myself over shameI don't have to worry anymore. About anything else either. There's always people ready to shame guys like me just because they don't understand. I know I'm too far gone to bounce back and get tired of being alive. Someone told me to move out from wherever I am and I'm already homeless and can't afford to do that.
