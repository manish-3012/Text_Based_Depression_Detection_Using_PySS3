Stuck, can't see anything ever getting betterI'm 20, suffer with severe depression and anxiety, have severe hand tremors and tics, all which make me physically impossible to work. Lived with my ex girlfriend for 3 years and we split up a few months ago and I can't get over it at all. I'm back living with my mum and bully of a stepdad. I can't function without benzos or alcohol, the only way I can make money is by selling drugs and I can barely make much of a living anymore, I'm too anxious to be happy at anything and I can't see myself ever getting better. Even when I'm flat out drunk or high off benzos or beta blockers I'm still a nervous wreck, I have no idea what to do I'm completely lost .. :(
