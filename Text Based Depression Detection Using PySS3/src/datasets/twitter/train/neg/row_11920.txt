Would 30 anti depressants, 20 Vyvanese and 20 Lexapro make me die?(15f). I tried to overdose 3-ish weeks ago. I failed. I took 27 anti depressants and i ended up in hospital for 2 weeks. I want to try it again today or tomorow. I have no reason to live at all. Iâ€™m a worthless fuck and i can prove it. I get bullied for having Schizophrenia and depression and ADHD, people make fun of me for it and they call me crazy, i mess up everything, i hurt myself because voices tell me to, i want to die. I canâ€™t live anymore. Itâ€™s my way to escape from them. When i was in hospital i passed out like 3 times from fear. I hate the hospital so itâ€™s my plan to take lots so i donâ€™t have to go. My therapist now knows i tried to kill myself. Iâ€™m scared of everything. I need to go.
