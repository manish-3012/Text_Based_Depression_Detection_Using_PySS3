Seriously want pure, honest, advice.As someone who is becoming more and more suicidal daily, just lost his job, no insurance, and has been struggling with this since early teenage years, what do you suggest?
My wife knows, at least as much as she can without being to view me objectively.
Her father, sister, and aunt all took their own lives.
She actually discovered her hanging sister as a child, needless to say you can see why any realistic plans of suicide and numerous suicide notes have gone nowhere. I'm too scared of why it would do to her.
I have passions. I have dreams and desires. In the most humble way possible, I have talents an abilities some are even envious of. I say that because some bring up things like that to pour yourself into.

My first attempt was 14. My parents are religious conservatives and are very against psychiatry. A lot of their beliefs have washed over to my life in waves of guilt.
I've done some therapy in the past but I was so young and immature then.
I also have had Severe chemical dependency issues from very early on.
I've spent over 16 months in a faith based treatment facility.

I'm wondering at what point should one show up at a hospital and declare " I am not safe to myself?" Which I have done years ago.
My wife and I need me to be working, if I went away it would present so many many financial issues.
I just feel like there has to be answer, I now know its not any drug, as I've spent much time with them all.
Are some of just cursed? I believe that sometimes no matter how pathetic it sounds.

Sorry for the long post and typos/grammar. I'm on my phone.
