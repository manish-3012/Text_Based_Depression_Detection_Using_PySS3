i genuinely feel afraid for my life.i'm scared that it'll happen soon. the urge to end it all has never been so strong before. i don't want to die alone, so wouldn't it be better to just go now? i'll at least have one person crying about me. i would drink, overdose on all kinds of pills, and then jump off the bridge. i would call him one last time just to hear his voice, but i'm sure he'll probably stay asleep anyway.

from all the times that i needed someone most, no one is here. it hurts that i can't cry to anyone without feeling like i need to force my emotions down my throat. i just want it all to end. i don't want to cry anymore. i don't want to silently scream out for help because i know that no one will ever come.

i don't want to put myself through this anymore. i wish i would just die. i really want to leave.
