Here we are againIf I canâ€™t help myself should I just give in to the thoughts and not wake up tomorrow? Or is that even a stupid question be honest please.. I really need help but I donâ€™t know where to begin. I have been to the doc for med  the worked for a little while then the suicidal thoughts grew stronger and louder now they are back to normal but i seriously need advice.. been talking to my buddy at work he seems to know what to say but when I go home the thoughts demons what every they are tell me they are lies and not worth listening to him.... as bad as this may sound itâ€™s getting worse over time and I donâ€™t know how long I can keep going... Iâ€™m sacred for my family cause I donâ€™t want to leave them but I feel like Iâ€™m a waste of space, a failure, a waste of oxygen... I just want these thought/demons to either end it all or leave.. please help Iâ€™m in desperate need
