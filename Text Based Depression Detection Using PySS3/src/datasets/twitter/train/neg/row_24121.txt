I feel like a stranger with my partner, and stranded in a faraway placeHi folks.  Posting on a whim.  730 AM.  Sleeping on the couch (or not sleeping at all, I guess) after leaving the bedroom around 3 -- my partner wanted to stay up late texting her ex.  In bed.  Fine, do whatever you want.  I can't deal with it.

I don't have much of anything.  I did, but I gave up all of it to move to be with my partner.  I got a really nice job, but lost it to a lot of shit, but the depression has been real and hard to shake.  I need support, but the only person I know here is her and more often the support she needs doesn't seem to feature me.

I live with her in a sublet in her parents house.  I have pretty bad social anxiety so they think I hate them, but really I appreciate them and respect them, I'm just not socially adept enough to really do well having to see them anytime I need to visit the bathroom or prepare dinner.

I feel like a waste.  I depend on her and get family here, and the job hunt is going poorly.  I hate it.  I hate thinking about home, but I miss feeling secure in my own space.

I want to have a bed that I can go to and not be reminded about her ex and the garbage she dumped on the floor of our relationship concerning him.  I want to not feel excluded in our bedroom, because I have no other space in this place.

I feel that I have no tools to change my circumstance, right down to being financially dependent and my nearest friends and family being a thousand miles away.

I'm going to try to sleep.  I'll check this out when I wake up.  If you took the time to read, thank you
