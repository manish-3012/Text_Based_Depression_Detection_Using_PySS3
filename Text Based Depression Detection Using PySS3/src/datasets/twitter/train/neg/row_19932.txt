Guilt only thing stopping meI feel like the only reason I havenâ€™t tried to end it again is the amount of guilt I felt from everyone having to deal with my first attempt, and I almost fantasize about my family dying cause then I wouldnâ€™t feel guilty about ending it. I just feel like even when Iâ€™m happy now, life just doesnâ€™t seem like something I want to continue from an internal source. So basically Iâ€™m not jumping off a bridge because I donâ€™t want to harm/ burden those around me. 

This has also led to a lot of passive thoughts where I will intentionally walk alone at night or walk across the street without looking hoping some outside force ends it for me so I donâ€™t feel the guilt of doing it myself
