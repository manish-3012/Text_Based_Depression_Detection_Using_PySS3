Can someone talk to me?I'm 21f, a senior in college. I commute to 40 minutes each way to school everyday and commute 30 minutes to world every weekend. My family doesn't have a lot of money so this car was from 1990. All of my money went to fixing the car since it always had problems 

Well, yesterday while I was driving on the highway my car started smoking and trembling. 
I got help from my dad and we found out it is totaled. I've had the car for four years and I'm just devastated. 

Now I have to depend on my parents for rides to school and they can be very overbearing and make me feel worse. 

I owe the school $1,500 in remaining tuition after aid and scholarships. And I still haven't been able to find the money for even payment plans. I

I'm just so overwhelmed. I am also a transfer student from last year, so I already have basically no friends in school since I also commute and know no one still. I always feel so alone on campus since Im one of the only minorities. I also have mild OCD, dysthymia, and social anxiety disorder, It makes everything so hard. 

I have an internship three days a week, I'm in my senior year of college. I have so many bills to pay now. I have no car. My depression is getting worse and I'm feeling more alone everyday. I have one friend to talk to but he has other things to deal with and I don't wanna keep burdening him. 

My cousin killed himself 3 months ago and I kind of feel jealous of him since he doesn't have to deal with the stress anymore. I just feel like I need someone to talk to.
