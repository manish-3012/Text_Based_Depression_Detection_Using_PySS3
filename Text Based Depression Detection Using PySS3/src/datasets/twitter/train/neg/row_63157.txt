I cant remember the time when I didn't want to just end itI made this account just to say this. I am not whiny. I am fully capable of leading a good life. When I applied myself I used to get good results out of life. The first two years in college I was one of the top students in my engineering class. lately I've been slipping, and its gotten to the point that I don't care about anything. I feel like I act as my self, but I am just not interested anymore. This might sound like depression to you, but to me it feels like being dead is not worse than being alive. My life has the potential to be good, but I don't believe its worth it. It concerns me that ending my life might have a negative effect on some people, but I doubt I would care after I die. So, whats the point? I know everyone has problems, and I know mine. I even feel like I know what I should do at this point, or at least how start going about things, but I never do it. I always end up ignoring my own good advice to the point that I feel trapped in a state of poorly managing things. I do not want this to be too long, point is there has not been a day in recent memory where I did not contemplate suicide. Tall buildings, bridges, guns and lots of planning is all I think about sometimes. If I kill myself on a whim, I will not regret it. I am here because no one is close enough to me (or ever will be) to be told this. But I don't know you, which makes you OK. One last thing, don't kill me on the grammar, I don't really speak English very well.
