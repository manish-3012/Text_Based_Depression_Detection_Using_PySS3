I hate being a mom.I'm a stay at home mom and I cannot stand this. My kids are two and one. All they do the entire day is scream and cry about nothing. They have been like this since they were young. They do not play with toys or with each other. They just scream and cry and run around creating disasters. I am not parent material. I've hated kids all my life and I'm not sure why I thought having my kids would be different. I love them but I can't stand being around them. Since having them, I have been diagnosed bipolar and severely depressed. After trying many medications, I was put on 225mg on venlafaxine (Effexor), 2mg of Abilify, and 25mg of Adderall. I also moved back in with my parents who see me as nothing but a burden and have stated numerous times that if it weren't for my kids, I'd be out on my ass. I am constantly harassed and ridiculed by my parents because of the mess and  constant crying from my kids. There isn't one day that goes by we're I'm not being blamed and screamed at for something, most of the time something very minuscule. My parents are narcissists and only care about what other people see/think of them. I do not have any friends to turn to and my SO seems to think I'm merely feeling sorry for myself. 


I have been contemplating ending my life since this past June. I cannot take anymore screaming and crying. I cannot make my children or family happy no matter what I do. Medications aren't working and I'm ready to give up on trying something else. I'm tired and I wish I never had to wake up again.
