I'm exhaustedI've been going out with this girl but recently broke it off because she's been telling me how ugly I am and that thats why its so hard for me to get a girlfriend. When I tell other people about it they talk about how much of a bitch she is and tell me I'm "not even that ugly". Of course its hard for me to beleive them. It wouldn't affect me except her claim to fame is that shes "brutally honest". At this point I don't care if I hurt the people around me by killing myself, death would be so much better than what I'm living right now. I recently tried but failed, but even that feeling of being so close brought me peace.
