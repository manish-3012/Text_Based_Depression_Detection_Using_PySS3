Literally donâ€™t even care.Can you die with Benadryl? 

Iâ€™m an alcoholic and I relapsed around a week ago. Got my phone and wallet stolen. Whatever. Try again the next day, right? Like try to be sober. Going well until today. Found out whoever took my phone put photos of me messed up and naked online. Too cool. Go out and get beer. Family member went through my car and took the beer. So now I have no beer and the knowledge of all this shit. I literally do not care. Fuck everything. Fuck everyone and everything
