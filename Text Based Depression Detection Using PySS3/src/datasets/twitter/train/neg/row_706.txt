Piling up I have severe depression and aspergers. I am 23. I'm gay. I cannot relate to people outside of a very small group of people and part of how I learned to relate to others is through drugs. I am on and off but don't really associate with my old friends who still use heavily pretty often. When I do I feel welcome though and not judged so long as I'm getting high with them. I don't have the social skills or life skills to make my life any better because I am a terrific failure. I've learned to surround myself with people who wouldn't judge or criticize me even for my own good. I stopped talking to a lot of my family but they didn't want anything to do with myself or my dad and siblings anyway. I've wanted to die for more than 13 years. I'm really really tired. The only thing that would drive me when I was younger was thinking eventually I could support myself making artwork and music or just creating. As much as it's the only emotional outlet I have left I realize how pointless it is without already being wealthy. I work retail. I will never afford an education. Taking loans is suicide anyway.  I hate myself and I'm fully aware of the deep resentment most people feel for the fact that myself and people like me exist. I am going to kill myself eventually because I can't possibly live in the us being who I am. Escapism was really the last thing I had left. Pretending that there was a place and people who gave a shit about me and escaping into that fantasy. I won't ever stop hurting and I don't have a life outside of feeling that pain anymore.
