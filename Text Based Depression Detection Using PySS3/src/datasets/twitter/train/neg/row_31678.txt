I want to dieI'm an engineering student and I recently completed my 2nd year( 2 semesters per year) but i failed 4 out of 6 subjects in 3rd semester and now 4th semester result came and I again failed 4 subjects out of 6 even though I tried so hard this time, i even failed the subject which I understood the most . I just found out that maybe I won't be allowed to move on to next year. If that's the case I will drop out of college because my mother doesn't have enough money. I will kill myself if this happens. I am studying hard to pass those subjects alongside this semester's subjects. I want to die.
