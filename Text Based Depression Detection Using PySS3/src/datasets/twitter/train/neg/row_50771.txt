Having a rough weekend (X-post on r/depression as well)I've been with the company I work for for five years. At a couple points other employees bailed and I was the only employee, my boss has sung my praises and said they couldn't have continued without me. I feel like I've invested so much of myself, and really built the business up into what it is today. 

Several months ago a new girl was hired. I don't like her, and I get along with EVERYONE. 

She dislikes me assigning her projects, and doesn't want me to "boss her around" dispute the fact that she has no prior experience in this field. She often makes mistakes, and her excuse is always, "Well, nobody told me that!". Yet, when I see her doing something incorrectly and correct her, she gets angry and volatile. 

I've discussed this with my boss, and his reply was to try harder to get along. I feel betrayed, after everything I've done for this business. 

I'm looking for a new job, but am sad to be leaving the many clients I know and love through this one. I'm also worried this girl is going to make mistakes that will bring harm to all these people I know and care for. 

My depression is making this worse than I think it is. I feel lost and alone. I'd love to talk to someone for a little while.
