Therapy not working well, I'm afraid of what I might do. please help.I have thought about killing myself most days for the past 5 years.  I used to appear as depressed as I felt, but thanks to years of INTENSIVE therapy I seem normal to everyone around me.  My friends even describe me as a very positive, goofy guy.  I'm a student and I generally get very good grades, I have plenty of friends, and I stay pretty active.  

Last Fall I started college and therapy wasn't as  available as before, but I didn't notice a mood change.  About two months ago, I started seeing a school therapist after freaking out and cutting myself.  I don't find it to be any help and I have been getting more depressed.  I haven't been to any classes in the last two weeks and some days I don't get out of bed.  I tell my roommate that I have a cold and my friends that I lost my cell phone charger.  I am now failing all my classes and I've gained about ten lbs in the last couple weeks, but I don't care.  I don't know why I feel so hopeless, but I can't imagine continuing to live.  Even if I had a life like kobe bryant's or bill gates' I would feel the same way.  Why do I feel like this?  Is there any way to make it stop?  I feel like I've tried everything, and I don't know what to do at this point. Not being alive is looking more enticing every day.
