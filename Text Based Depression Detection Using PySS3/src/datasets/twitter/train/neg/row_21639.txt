I turn 30 today and life surprised me.I thought I would be someone by this age. I never had concrete goals but being a single 30 year old lady who works a lame job and lives in a shitty apartment wasn't high up on my list. I wasted my entire life, the best years are all gone now and I literally never lived at all. Worst of all today I got a wedding invitation from a girl who I was once friends with (we had a competitive friendship) and to see someone actually succeeding in life hurt me a lot (which I know is pathetic, I should be happy to them). People are marrying and having kids and I haven't ever even dated. I know it's too late to change things. I should have done so much when I had the time-things could be so different now. I would matter. People would care about me. In life I always fantasized about having someone be interested in things I had to say or my opinion or even something stupid like my favorite book. My biggest regret is that I never had a love in this life, even if it's not true I want to believe when this life ends I might get another chance and I could live better.
