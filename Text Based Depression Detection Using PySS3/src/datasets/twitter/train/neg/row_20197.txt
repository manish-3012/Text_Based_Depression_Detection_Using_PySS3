I'm gonna blow my fucking head off any second nowSo I'm a keen film maker but when I have 800 (legit) word documents with 1000 words with film ideas, your brain will blow the fuck up literally and I just want to quit. I want to silence by endless thoughts, my sleepless nights and just end it now. I cannot stand it. I can spend 1000 years locked in a cage and still won't get it done. With constant interruptions like family and friends, I need to be locked in a cell for the rest of my life with no human contact until i get my shit sorted out which will be a long god damn fucking time. One message from a phone company, or one unnecessary message from someone throws me right off track. I fucking hate this mentality and know that no one else in the world knows what I'm going through.
