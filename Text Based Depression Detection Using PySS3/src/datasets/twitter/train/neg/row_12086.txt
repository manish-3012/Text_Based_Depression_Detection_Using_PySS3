I really want to kill myself.I would talk about this to my friends, or my boyfriend, or my family, but I feel like as soon as I open up about it they immediately think Iâ€™m just being dramatic and Iâ€™m over reacting. I just made a pros and cons list of living, and I ended up with one pro and probably 15 cons. 

My only pro is that I would get to watch my daughter grow up. All of my cons are strong and heavy. They are outweighing my pros. 

I think about it every single day. Itâ€™s horrible to be alone because I just think about how much I hate living, I hate existing. 


I think the only thing that stops me from doing it is that Iâ€™m scared to die. Not because of the dying part but I donâ€™t know what happens after that. Thatâ€™s the only thing that holds me back. 

I have attempted suicide before but it didnâ€™t work out. I just needed to type this out. I needed to get it out. I wish everything would be bright and I wouldnâ€™t hurt like this. Everything is dark and I canâ€™t breathe.
