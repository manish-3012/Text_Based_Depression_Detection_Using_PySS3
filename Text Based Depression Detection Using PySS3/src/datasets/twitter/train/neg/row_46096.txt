I really need help/adviceLooong backstory, here we come.

I am 17, almost 18, and a senior in high school. My parents divorced when I was very young and my mother remarried when I was young. My stepfather is a piece of shit who used to covertly touch me, has always belittle and constantly yells at me and my mother, and used to physically threaten me all the fucking time. While drunk, too, though I dunno if that makes me feel better or worse.

My father was out of the picture from age 8-13 due to a shitty marriage, and though I have to drive two hours to see him, he is in my life. I tell him more than I have my stepfather. Who can blame me? However, my dad has no job and stays at home to take care of his girlfriendâ€™s daughter. I love this girlfriend, sheâ€™s amazing and my dad is happy. But no money from him. And Iâ€™m about to go to college. Can I get a wahoo?

Anyways, Iâ€™m done. I tried to kill myself a few years ago. Iâ€™m back at that point and really pushing, but itâ€™s not holding out much longer. I am trying to rack up as much scholarship money as possible to sever all financial ties with my stepdad as soon as I move out, but itâ€™s not working. I canâ€™t be under him for four more years. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I canâ€™t go to community college because I have already finished two years through dual credit, so either I stick it out another four years with this constant torment, or I sever ties and never get anywhere. Or I die. Iâ€™m really trying to avoid that.

I need advice. I need help. I canâ€™t stay in this state anymore. I canâ€™t be near him. My dad canâ€™t help. I donâ€™t know what to do. Please help me get out of here. I donâ€™t want to die. I have dreams. I want to accomplish them. But I canâ€™t do it if heâ€™s paying it. Please.
