My Mind is Fucking SickI keep telling myself not to end my own life "just yet", because I haven't met my ultimate goal weight. I don't want people to remember me as fat. I want to be so small that I'll be fragile and easy to pick up. But on the other hand, I really don't want to be alive anymore. I really hate my own thoughts.
