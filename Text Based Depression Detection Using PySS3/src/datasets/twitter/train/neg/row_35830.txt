Alcohol saved me tonightThis has been one of my worst lows Iâ€™ve ever gone through. I wrote out letters and just wanted to numb the feeling before then. I drank a lot of alcohol, but it made me sleepy and Iâ€™m about to pass out as I type this. 

Depression is a bitch. It doesnâ€™t discriminate and will affect any and everyone. I have a decent life from the outside, but I am drowning inside. If youâ€™re reading this and contemplating tonight, please stay another night with me. Go to sleep and fight another day.
