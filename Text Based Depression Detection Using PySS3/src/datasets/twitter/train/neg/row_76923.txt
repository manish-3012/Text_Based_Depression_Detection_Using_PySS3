Iâ€™m a stupid screw up idiotHi so this is like a vent of my emotions rn so idk 
Read if u want I guess, canâ€™t really change it

Iâ€™m on online class right now. All Honors classes and I am currently failing every single class. Not only that but Iâ€™m in my sophomore year where every grade goes on your permanent record, the thing that jobs look at to decide whether they should hire u. 
I really am a fucking screw up if Iâ€™m the only one in my family of 2 brothers and sister who is failing. One of them is in the grade above me. And heâ€™s got straight As and Bs in the same classes.
Today my mom said I never ask for anything and have good grades right now so sheâ€™s letting me have privileges that my brothers donâ€˜t. Not to mention, my birthday in 10 days. So my brain just says â€œwhy try if your already failing, itâ€™s too late, itâ€™s already almost the end of the semester.â€ And I am currently crying while writing how useless I am in a notebook and on here so... this is probably not helping but idk. Donâ€™t know what this accomplishing. Donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m doing this. Donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m here on earth.
