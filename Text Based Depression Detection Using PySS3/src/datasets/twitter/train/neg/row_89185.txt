Massive debt. No job or education.My phone just got deactivated, that's how bad my debt is. All told it's about 23k from trying to start a business and failing quite well.

I also have a rare form of cancer and treatment makes me tired and depressed, not to mention the effects of the cancer itself.

I have a small time gig that could probably pay me a bit but I have very little little motivation.

I was seeing a therapist but there was some problem with my insurance and I couldn't even afford the copay anymore anyway...

Not sure what to do. I don't want to hurt my family or the oher people around me. Maybe bankruptcy would relieve the pressure of debt, but without my computer hardware I can literally offer no value.
