28 Ativan and a nearly finished PhDI just got out of the hospital and December is graduation but I don't think I'll make it that far. I'm such a disappointment, anytime I look at my dissertation I have a panic attack.

I have a just filled prescription and maybe it will kill me. I know it would be better with alcohol but I don't drink; I hate the taste. What a stupid thing to worry about when trying to kill yourself...
