I need helpI feel like I'm not appreciated by anyone. My parents pay so much attention to my brother, he's the 'perfect child' in their eyes. I'm such a fucking failure. I feel like I'm never good enough for anyone; my girlfriend, my family. For once in my life I just want to be good enough for someone. I feel so much fucking pain, and I can't handle it. I don't have anyone to talk to because my parents won't listen to me. It's always about themselves or my brother. I just want someone to care about me, and no one ever does.
