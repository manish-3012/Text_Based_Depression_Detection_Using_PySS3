Life after rapeI am a girl aged 21 in one of the best institutions in the country, doing physics. In the 1st year of my college I met a guy who tried a lot to impress me and i started liking him. We were never committed as he wanted me to improve because i was dumb and all. he started threatening me about small and big things- about life, my parents etc, but i thought it will get normal. eventually we got physical by consent, but then it started getting forced. he used to insert pen in my vagina sometimes for experience. He demeaned me in front of everybody all the time. i finally took a stand and cut off from him, after which he asked me to meet for a very important meeting and raped me again. all my work, everything was affected. i somehow managed. i complained against him and after a period of trials he was thrown out of the college. my work, project, everything is affected but one of my professors asked me to "keep the two things apart" when i told him my situation and why i am not able to work on my project, even when i have tried my best to do as much as i can. i am very keen on working hard, but he has written a very nasty mail writing i have done ZERO work on it. i am feeling suicidal and feel there is no point of life. some of my best friends have betrayed me. people talk behind my back saying "i was asking for it" and my life is screwed. what should i do?
