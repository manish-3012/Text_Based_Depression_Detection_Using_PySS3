I'm afraid to....  But I think I should really be talking to somebody right now.I think I really need to talk to somebody and I'm very soft hearted and easily intimidated and I'm afraid of even making this post because I'm terrified of reaching out....  My situation is complicated, I'm 25, a female....  I don't know what else to say.  I'm just sitting in tears and I don't know what to do.  I used to have a cousin that was a big brother protective type and he just kind of vanished(that isn't why I am posting, but that WAS who I would normally talk to) so I don't have anybody to talk to.

Edit: You guys are amazing.  Thank you, so much.  I was able to stop crying and finally calm down.  Tomorrow will be the other especially rough day, so if anybody is available to talk then(only if it isn't any trouble for you and you have some free time), I'd gladly appreciate it.  I hope I can do the same for some people in my position in the future.
