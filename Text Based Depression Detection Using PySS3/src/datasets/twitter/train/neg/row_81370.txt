I am making what might be my last phone call.I'm ready to kill myself.  I started to take the ibuprofen.  I could do it.

I told a friend I would call him and counseling services before I killed myself.  I want to be talked out of this, but I can't do it myself.  If it was just me, I'd kill myself right now.  I can't take the fear of being this depressed for the rest of my life.

EDIT: I've been talked down for now.  I still have no will to live, but I have somebody that I owe a night.

EDIT2: It sunk in what I did, and oh my god, I'm alive, and this is the greatest gift possible.
