I am sick of everything, especially of people's hypocrisy.Being lonely and mentally ill, and to top it all, unpassable ugly tranny is nothing but painful for me and I just don't see any other way to fix my problems except suicide. I told some people that I plan to kms soon just to let them know I will be gone, but I regret doing this now. Why are the same people who never ask how are you doing and in general don't give a shit about you and your life are suddenly care if you kill yourself or not? I just don't get it.
