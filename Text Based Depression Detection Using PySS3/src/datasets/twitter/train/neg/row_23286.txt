Iâ€™ve wanted to die since I was 9 and I still feel horrible.Honestly I donâ€™t even have like that much of a big reason to be depressed or suicidal, I have a semi okay family, roof over my head, food, etc..  and people say oh youâ€™re only 16 you donâ€™t have problems!... god I wish..  I feel like the meds are just a lie to make me have a short burst of happiness before it comes crashing down to reality again.  I just.. I feel so out of place, like I donâ€™t belong here, like the only thing that will make me feel fulfilled, is offing myself and being gone for good.. idek why anymore, it just seems so alluring and tempting and every time those bad thoughts come back, they get worse and worse...   Iâ€™ve tried to off myself before, and I would be lying if I didnâ€™t say I regretted it after.. but I feel like I need it, like this time I wonâ€™t regret it anymore, but I guess thatâ€™s just all in my head.. god I wish I could make it stop.  Depression honestly is like the demon on my shoulder whispering into my ear, draining all my energy, taking my motivation and will to keep going..
