I'm 31 and mother. But still need selfharm..I started selfharm when I was 18. And I still do it often. 
I'm very suicidal. Attempted suicide many times. I have an experience of staying in ER for two weeks because of OD. 
Now I don't have family. Only my son is my family. 
My parents are left me. But maybe I left them... 
My ex husband was so terrible.
Sometimes I feel I was born to be suffered..  
I have never felt happy in my life. Always I had to care about what People think of me. 
I have lots of scars on my body.
And today I have hurt myself too. 
It's like punishment that I still live. Because I'm not the person who deserves to be happy and be in the world
I'm already 31 but I can't stop selfharm. 
I know I'm crazy ...
