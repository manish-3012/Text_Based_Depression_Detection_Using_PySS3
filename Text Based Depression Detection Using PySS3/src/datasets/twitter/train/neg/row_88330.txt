I don't want to do this anymoreI've realised it would have been better for everyone if I'd just succeeded when I was fifteen and killed myself.  Yet here I am at 31 and I'm the failure I always thought I would be.  It would have been better if people looked back thinking of my wasted potential, instead of seeing how useless I really am.  I spoke to my old therapist today and she's made it seem like she can't see me anymore and there's no hope for me, like I've explored every avenue, I've tried every therapy.  I'm just a lost cause. It breaks my heart that this is who I turned out to be. I wish I was dead.
