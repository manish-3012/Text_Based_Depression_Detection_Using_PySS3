Is life worth it? Was thinking of killing these ppl and then myselfGot into a fight and got jumped by 6 guys in a soccer fight. Been fantasizing about coming back next week and shooting them all and then myself. I'm not even depressed as I write this but I honestly don't find life exciting at all. Why not kill a few people who I dislike before I go? Is life really worth it at the end?
