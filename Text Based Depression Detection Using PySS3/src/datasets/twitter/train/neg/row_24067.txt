At what point can I say that it just isn't my fault and that nobody actually wants to be around me?I have anxiety sure, but I work with it the best I can. I've tried talking ro people irl, they'd just end the conversation the moment someone else came in, the feiendships are only limited to a common working environment and cease to exist when we leave the place.

I'm not visually pleasing and I'm tired of my family complimenting me all the time to boost my ego. The moment I walk outside my soul gets crushed. I'm just an onlooker at other people's lives. Might as well not even exist.

All the girls I've tried being a friend with or tried to get to know them just ditch me at the nearest possible opportunity if they even give me a chance to talk, whic most of them don't.
I've tried five different dating apps and reinstalled them a couple of times and get no matches on any of them even with my best and most interesting pictures.
My instagram and facebook accounts are cemeteries.
I followed a girl I knew whoch follows everyone back, but she couldn't even take a moment to press follow back.

I'm a nonexistant entity now, so would it make a difference if I just stopped existing for real?
