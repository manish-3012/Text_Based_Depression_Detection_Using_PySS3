Kind of ironicSo when I was 5 I had open heart surgery and then when I was 10 my dad died of a heart attack, he did stuff with his life (not all good, he could be a pretty shitty person) but I often wonder if I had died when I was 5 would he have lived, he wasn't a total bad person. My life is very dull I'm disabled and don't do anything with my life he worked, had kids (obviously), had good friends, yes I have a partner and a step son but other than that I don't contribute anything to this world. I feel like a waste of oxygen
