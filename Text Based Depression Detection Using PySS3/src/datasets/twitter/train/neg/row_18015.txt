It'll never go away and the thought makes me consider attempting again.Around this time last year the same thing happened. A month of panic attacks, ambivalence, then attempt. Right now im at the 'panic attacks' state but im just so tired. 

My OCD causes me so much pain and knowing that itll never go away is what makes me suicidal, and its why i attempted last time. I handled my anxiety and depression flawlessly for years on my own but when my ocd began it flipped a switch and now im pathetically mentally ill. I havent had a single day of good rest in years. I no longer have a job, ive gained so much weight even though i was previously overweight, im not in school, and despite professional help its not getting better. The only thing keeping me around is my mother. It would crush her if i attempted again or succeeded. I love her so much. But when will i be able to rest, im so tired ive been trying so hard for so long but it doesnt go away it doesnt get better.

sorry if this is unclear as i mentioned im in the panic state right now and typing on mobile while like this is difficult
