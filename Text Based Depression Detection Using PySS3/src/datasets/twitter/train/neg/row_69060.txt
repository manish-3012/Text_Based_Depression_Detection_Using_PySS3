Just a RantI am so fed up by people telling me to get a new medication or go do this or that. They don't know what my mental illness is, how are their suggestions suppose to mean anything to me? Do they not think that my family, doctors, and psychiatrists have tried literally everything? I have tried every conceivable medication and strategy. This is all there is, how do they not understand that? I have no energy to educate strangers on something that they know nothing about. I shouldn't really be posting this here because i should expect "suggestions". I know they mean well, it is just that there is no reason to invest what little energy i have to inform strangers of every single thing i have tried. I don't know why i posted this here.
