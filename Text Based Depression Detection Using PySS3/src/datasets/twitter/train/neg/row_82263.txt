Found a coworkers suicide noteHi everyone.

Im not sure if this is the correct place to post this but last week Friday I found a note on my coworkers USB drive. It was under n folder which was named 'keep out' - but my curiosity got the better of me. I saw a word doc inside named "to my family and friends" and knew instantly what it was. He wasn't near me at the time so I skimmed through it and he basically said sorry and gave instructions about what to do with his possessions etc.

Were not very close at all but we do have some common ground and chat about it every so often. 

I don't really know what do - if I should tell someone or try talking to him...

Side note: I checked and he created the document on the 24th of January.
