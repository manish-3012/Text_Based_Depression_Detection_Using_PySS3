I cannot cope with life anymoreI donâ€™t know what to do. I hate my life and have for some time. I live in a shitty apartment, and only just about scrape enough money to pay rent every month. I hate my job, Iâ€™m fairly new to it but Iâ€™m terrible at it, itâ€™s so fucking stressful and everybody expects so much of me there and Iâ€™m just not capable. But I canâ€™t quit, otherwise I wouldnâ€™t be able to pay rent, Iâ€™m trapped. I donâ€™t know what I want to do with my life, I never have and donâ€™t understand how people do. I have no plans, no ambitions. I really am such a waste of life. Iâ€™ve got nothing outside that aswell, and particularly during this shit corona time there isnâ€™t even anything else that can distract me from this shit existence. I am scared to die, it does worry me. But I canâ€™t go on feeling like this. I canâ€™t go on feeling as low as I am, every day every night, only to wake wake up the next day and do it again. I want out this life, and I can only see one way to do that. I canâ€™t go on anymore
