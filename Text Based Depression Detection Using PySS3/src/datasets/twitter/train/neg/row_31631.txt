Alone on the 4th of july, Never felt like this before.This is the first 4th that i have been really alone. I am a college student just finising my sophmore year. My "friends" are off at some party somewhere which they didnt even tell me about. I spent today drinking cough syrup just so i wouldnt be awake thinking about killing myself. Every firework that goes off just sends me deeper into this depression and i just cant take it. MY best friend is away and i have noone i can really talk to right now. I rarley thought about suicide when i was younger and even shamed people that did. Currentley my life is pathetic i have been isolating myself from peple to the point where all of my freinds dont even think about me anymore and the only people that really care about me are my family. i dont know what im looking for in this but i needed to get it off of my chest to someone
