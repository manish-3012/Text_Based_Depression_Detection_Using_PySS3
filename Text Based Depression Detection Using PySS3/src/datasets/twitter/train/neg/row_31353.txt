I tried my bestI tried my best to survive and stay alive... I really tried for years. I donâ€™t have any feelings, no emotions (I canâ€™t really feel anything, Iâ€™m sociopathic). 

I donâ€™t have friends any more because I isolated myself (well I never really had friends).

I just hate this world and all people around, Iâ€™m done I have to go. Iâ€™m sorry.
