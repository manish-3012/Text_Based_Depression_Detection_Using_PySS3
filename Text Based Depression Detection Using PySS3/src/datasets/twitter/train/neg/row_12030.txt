Just one of those days.Holy shit I never thought I would post here myself, but here we go. I have these intense mood swings, one day I feel I can conquer the world. Planning ambitions to make my own company and be successful in life. Today though, I am feeling crushed by sadness, it has been happening slot lately. I am a 23 year old college art student (great life choices) and I just feel like I have so much on my plate that it might just be easier to take the cowards way out. I think about quite a bit, hell I have even made suicide pacts with myself. I thought things where turning around for me, I was getting into art shows and I have been asked to be a teaching assistant for a grad program. So that was a plus. Then I met this girl who I just fell head over heals with, but I feel I am being led on. She refuses to say we are anything, and she just is memorized by her ex. Of course I am the rebound guy. The thing is, no matter how many people say how great my life and how bright future looks... I just feel so fucking empty all the time. I think about suicide all the time, and I feel like I am being pushed closer everyday. I don't think I have the guts to do it, but it feels like a shadow that is always behind me, whispering insults and depression into my ear. Christ, I am spilling my guts on r/SW. I'm not sure if I can pull myself out of this.

Edit: Forgot to add I try to fight this creeping darkness by making jokes. Just laugh it off, but even now that is failing me.
