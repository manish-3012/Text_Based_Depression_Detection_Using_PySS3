headaches after trying to strangle self then gave upi've been making multiple posts on this sub i hope it isn't too much.

i tried to die again, same method with the belt, can't really get myself to go unconscious. i stopped trying to kill myself when i saw how stupid i looked with a belt around my neck and i ate two granola bars and heated up food from my fridge and now i'm here.

my head hurts and i don't know if i am suffering from any type of damage and i don't know what to do with my life.

many folks from this sub have wanted to message and chat with me and i can really only offer my discord through PM if that's something someone is interested in. i need help and i have stopped wanting to get help for a few days now but i guess i want help again.
