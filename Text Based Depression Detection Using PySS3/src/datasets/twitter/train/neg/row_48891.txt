So. I ruined something with someone amazing. I know I could live. It's possible. But why?I managed to fuck up something incredible. 


I have never felt the amount of self hate that I do.    


I know logically suicide sounds crazy.  It will hurt some of the people I know who are alive.   But this isn't about them.  It's about me.    And in all honesty. I'm coming up with blanks on why to exist.
