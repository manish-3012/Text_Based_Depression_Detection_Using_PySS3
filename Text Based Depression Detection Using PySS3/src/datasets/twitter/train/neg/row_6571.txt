I want to die.. I can't take being so alone anymore and I just want it to endIts been a long time sinceive done anytnphing with friends and weeks since ive actually felt like i belonged with anyone. I keep trying ti reach out to tbem but they keep pushing me away or ignoring me. Part of me wantx to attempt suicide tonight or just get drnk or od or something. I cant take sitting by myself staring at a blank screen or moving thru life when no one cares... 

I just want the pain to stop......
