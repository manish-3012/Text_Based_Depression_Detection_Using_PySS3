cant take it anymoreim only 14 but im failing school.i have no motivation for anything anymore and i want to kill myself. ive already tried overdosing but i didnt take enough pills. i only got dizzy and nauseous and forgot everything quickly.
i dont see myself living to or much past 20.
whenever i tell people about this stuff, they laugh, or say 'same' as if it's nothing. i attack myself so much and have mental breakdowns pretty much daily, yet nobody in my life cares. they all take it as a joke.
i'm tired of living. i cannot do this for much longer
i have over 100 pills in my house. 90% are my mom's. i could easily down all of them and that'd make sure i wouldn't be alive.

nobody would miss me.
