No point in living like thisIs it that hard for anyone to say hi to me, or talk to me a minute? We don't have to be buds, but atleast aknowledge my existence.

My whole college class is together talking now. When someone comes, he's always greeted with smiles and greeting of others. When I come they look at me and immidiately look away. Am I supposed to be the first to say hi to them? Should I try to force myself into talking? I talked with some of them before, but only when I started.

Why has everyone in this world decided to collectively hate me the moment they see me?The fucking glances are literally killing me. Their fucking smirks, their gossiping...

Trying to go around town, especially today, is awul. All those different people with their SOs. You can be anyone and find someone to love you, but apparently you can't be me.
