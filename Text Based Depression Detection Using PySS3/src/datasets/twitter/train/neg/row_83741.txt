are panic attacks common?honestly, I've been trying hard recently to keep myself together, and it was my golden birthday this Saturday (24). I had my first ever panic attack and the rest of the day just sucked because of that. I legit thought I was somehow going to explode or go into a psychotic episode.

My relationship with most of my family is ruined because of my ex gf that I have known for a decade + and been with for years, which I would rather not get into. I feel stupid that I was expecting a happy birthday from her. I'm not sure why I am so hung up on her. I feel like she's the only one that could make me not feel suicidal, but she doesn't want to talk to me again.

I've never felt this low in my life than ever before, I don't think I can quite kill myself yet though unless it gets any worse. I've been driving without a seatbelt the last 2 days, but wouldn't ever get myself into an accident on purpose. I just wish some drunk driver would hit me and just kill me. It just started snowing where I'm at, so maybe I'll lose control or someone will hit and put me out of my misery.

I hope if you're reading this, that you are having a better day than mine. Thanks for reading and letting me express my feelings on here to you strangers.
