I wish depression naturally caused deathOkay so before anyone gets offended at what I'm about to say, just trust me when I say that I don't wish people with depression would die, but I wish that it could kill *me* naturally. Yes depression does kill in the sense that it can cause suicide (and often does) but I wish that this mental illness could cause a more natural death. Like for instance, if a person leaves diabetes undiagnosed, it could be fatal, as is with many other diseases and infections. Why does something like depression make someone want to die mentally, but not allow them to? In a sense, it's just suffering that may end because it makes you stressed and more susceptible to certain things, but it will never end your suffering by itself. 



I'm gonna be honest I am in so much mental pain. I have nothing that makes me very happy anymore. I hate myself more than anything and anyone. I really want to die, but I don't want to make people grieve over me. I think eventually I might go through with it though. I have so much shit to deal with, not sure how much longer I can do this.
