Wanting to die but I canâ€™tIâ€™ve had manic depression for years, suicidal ideation included. I thought once I was out of my abusive household and medicated the thoughts would go away but they havenâ€™t. I still have a strong urge to kill myself. Tonight it came from no where and I have no outlet. So here I am. 

Iâ€™m not afraid to die, I genuinely want to. Before what was stopping me was my family but Iâ€™ve moved away. Now itâ€™s my job, I take care of the elderly as a personal support worker. However, itâ€™s just not doing enough at least not for tonight. I just donâ€™t know what to do. 

I know better than to give in to the suicidal parts of myself but eventually this nightmare has to end, right? 

Iâ€™m not in danger, I donâ€™t want anyone to panic I donâ€™t have anything in my apartment I could feasibly kill myself with. But Iâ€™m really struggling..
