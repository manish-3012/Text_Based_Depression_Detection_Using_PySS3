People don't understand me.I can't take it anymore. I hate that I must put up a facade to mask what's actually going on. I want to genuinely die and get it over with.  Freshman year is right around the corner and people at school already despise me because I was involved with toxic people during middle school. My mom is very controlling over my life. She wants me to be the best. That might seem like good intention, but it's overwhelming. She's abusive emotionally and physically. My dad doesn't see what's happening. My sister has gone through the same thing and has attempted to commit suicide 3 times. Now, she relies on drugs for sanity. I don't see my sister anymore. Please, if anybody can tell me how to go the quickest. I have not done it yet because I'm afraid of the pain and darkness that might come after.
