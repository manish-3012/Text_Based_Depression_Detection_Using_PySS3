I just want to get this out there, hopefully I'll be ok CW: Suicide methodsCW: Suicide, suicide methods, don't read if you don't want to hear my explicit bad thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight I just want to end it all. I'm constantly tired, and I'm sick of fighting for a future where I'll be depressed until the day I die from an accident, suicide, or sickness. I get virtually no joy out of life. I've been suicidal as long as I understood what death is. I've searched for help, had diagnoses, and been medicated. What I take now has helped sometimes, but I've been really struggling lately, and I don't think it's ever going to get better. Tonight I strongly considered \[and still might\] a few things:

1. downing a bottle of beta blockers, chasing it with a bottle of tequila, and smoking weed till I'm unconscious. 
2. getting in my car, drive until im on a stretch of interstate with nobody else around, get my speed up as high as my car can take it, and whip my steering wheel until it loses control, throwing me out of the car
3. Jumping off of a parking garage, landing on my neck
4. Walking into the most dangerous part of my city until somebody murders me
5. The classic toaster in the bathtub
6. Drink the bottle of tequila until my blood is as thin as my will to live, and slicing every blood vessel I can find till I pass out 
7. Suicide by cop? 
8. Just suck it the fuck up and try to just keep going until the inevitable happens. 

I'm not looking for any help, I don't want to call a fucking hotline, I don't want to think about my loved ones, I don't want to think about my future. I just want to die now, or wait till it happens on my own.
