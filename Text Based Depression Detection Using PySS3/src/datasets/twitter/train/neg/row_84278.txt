I am so tired of living in fear all the timeIt's tiring. I am scared. Of people mostly, but also being homeless, fear of losing money, fear of rejection. 

I've had a therapist before, I was treated for social phobia disorder. It was great but it was 2-3 years ago and I don't know where to turn now. I live in the UK and the therapist I saw was on the NHS so it was free. I don't think I would be classified as bad enough to have it free again, so I would have to pay to see a therapist. 

I'm tired of having no money, working shitty dead end jobs just to live. It's been like this for 5 years. What is the point of living if I spend most of my waking hours afraid and miserable? I work and then come home and browse the internet for 4-5 hours, then sleep. Weekends are the same. Everyday I wake up and want to quit but I am too scared of being homeless and broke. 

I am too scared to go out and meet new people. People generally think I'm awkward and/or stuck-up and avoid me. I get so nervous I stammer when I talk to people and my mind goes blank. I haven't ever been in a relationship and I'm 25. I've only ever kissed one person!

I go to the gym alot, and exercise did help for a while but now it doesn't. I don't know what to do. What is the point of carrying on if I'm unhappy all the time?
