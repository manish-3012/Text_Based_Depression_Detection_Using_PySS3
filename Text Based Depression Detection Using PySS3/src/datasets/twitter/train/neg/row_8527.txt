I'm not suicidal, just really fucking beat up and sadI met a girl, playing an online game 5 years ago. I knew the moment I heard her voice that she was the one I wanted to be with. It took 2 years after we met for her to be available, and even close to a position to want to date again. 3 years later, and a year after being engaged she just dropped me. I quit my job, gave up college, and put all of my focus on making her happy.

She isn't a bad person, I don't resent her. It's just I planned my whole life around "us". I'm unemployed, I missed out on 3 years of college, and I'm all alone. I'm not a very emotional person, but every imgur story, or sappy youtube video sets me off. I can't stop crying, I just want to sleep forever.

I had a decent job interview today, so hopefully things will turn around, I just want someone to know that I'm not ok. I don't think I'm ever going to be ok. I waited for the right person and I got thrown away.
