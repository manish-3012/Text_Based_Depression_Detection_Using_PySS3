the main thing stopping me right now is that there won't be a second chanceI have a fentanyl patch which I can heat up to output more and a bunch of sleeping pills I almost don't care who it hurts I just can't take this anymore. The main thing stopping me now is that I only have one patch so if I fail or regret it and get rushed to an emergency room there is no second chance
