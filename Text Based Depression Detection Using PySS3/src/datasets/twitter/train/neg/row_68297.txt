I was close to slitting my throatThey had an abortion 2 years before I was born for medical reasons (personal).

I have all these existential questions.

I just can't continue living.

People have abortions all the time and have kids later.

I get used. No one really cares about me and I was abused my whole life.

I can't take it.
