What's the fucking point?It's all in the title. I fell in love over the summer with the most amazing girl. She's gone from my life now because of a series of small mistakes I couldn't fucking fix. Now I'm stuck on this stupid college campus with no friends, poor grades, and the only fun I ever sometimes have is getting wasted. I just want to die. I want the pain to stop. I miss her so much and I was already stopped once by my parents because I ran my mouth to her friend and her friend told the principal who informed law enforcement. Suicide being illegal is a crime in and of itself.. I just want the pain to stop. Idk why I'm even making this post, no one usually gives a fuck about me. Girls just come drink my alcohol and leave. Guys just don't even come. Only reason I haven't offed myself yet is because I'm waiting for my ex's soccer season to end because I don't want my death to be a nuisance to her too... That and I need a more effective way than popping a bottle of tylenol and slitting my throat
