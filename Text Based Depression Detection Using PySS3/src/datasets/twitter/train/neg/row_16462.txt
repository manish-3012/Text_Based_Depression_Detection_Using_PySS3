How long do people close to you grieve?Hey. I'm one of the folks seriously contemplating suicide.

 The only thing that has kept me away so far is the fact that it would hurt so many great people close to me, but I'm beginning to doubt the impact. Look here:

The answer by user Maria Elisa Vettia claims that after like 3 days, Noone gives a shit. It's probably an exaggeration, but I want real data from people whose loved ones have killed themselves. How long did they seriously grieve? Does anyone know where I can get this data? I don't want wishy washy no its not true. I want information from people that have experience with that. 

If it's 3 days, then shit. It's a no-brainer for me.

Cheers, q
