life is just so sad and dullLife is so dull.
I've lost interest in almost everything.
I can't find any words to say when I'm asked why I'm depressed.
I have everything anyone could have ever wanted.
Yet I live every single day like the last, endlessly moving into the future which holds nothing of any significance.
I cannot continue living like this.
I'm on antidepressants, have counselors, and have all the support I need.
None of it helps.
I still want to kill myself every single goddamn day.
I can't go on like this reddit.
Depression for no reason at all.
I have no reason to be sad yet I've become this emotionless zombie mindlessly walking through each day as it comes.
I don't care about what happens to me.
I don't care about my personal health.
I don't care about anything anymore.
Everything is a waste of time.
I need help but every time I get said help, it just gets worse.
I can't do it reddit, I'm tired of living like this.
I can't do it anymore.
