I don't even know why i'm doing thisI already did the research. Made sure i have access to oxycodone. Wrote my note and left clues so there is no mystery as to why or how i died. All thats left is to take it. 6 225 mg of oxycodone and i should be out like a light. This is gonna be a long read sorry. Im 19. Im turning 20 in april. Never had a job (not for lack of trying believe me). Im still a virgin. I've always had a girl that liked me just couldn't get things going. Finally found someone and she dislikes me because of my complexion(im used to being made fun of because of it, but when she does it theres a little more of a sting). If it was my weight or something i could change it wouldn't be a problem, but my dark skin is something im stuck with i acknowledge that. My school life is going smoothly i guess but i always feel that my efforts are going to waste. My future is dim. Im just hoping dying is like a reroll and i could find happiness in the next life.
