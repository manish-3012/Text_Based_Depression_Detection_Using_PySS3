Here to talk!Hello everyone. I posted this to r/depression as well. Anyways,

I've always been told I'm a good person to talk to, so I joined "Peer Listeners" at my college. That basically means that I'm trained to be a good listener. I genuinely enjoy talking to people and helping others.

As a third year psychology student, I feel that I should put myself to use, maybe get some experience before I get shoved into the professional world. I CANNOT give professional advice, I'm not nearly qualified to do that. I am simply available as an open ear with an open mind. 

I would consider myself to be extremely understanding. As someone who has suffered from horribly low self-esteem my whole life, I strive to help others overcome any detrimental perspectives they may have. 

In the past I have mentored and counseled children for various things, but I want to work with people of all ages.

So let's give this a go. If you have questions about me, please feel free to ask. If you want to send me a message privately, we can do that as well.

Sometimes it's nice to simply have someone to talk to. I'm a friend :)

UPDATE: Thank you everyone who has taken me up on my offer so far. I am very happy to talk to anyone that needs it. 
Tips for the general Reddit population: appreciate the little things, get outside or find a hobby that makes you happy (exercise has been found to reduce depression and stress! Try exercising your body AND mind!), and stay open minded! Never forget how HUGE the world is, with limitless opportunity :)
