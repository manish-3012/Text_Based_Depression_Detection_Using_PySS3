I don't see any point of going furtherI'm failure. My parents think that I'm worthless and I've should never be born. I feel alone. I get up early, go to school, come back to empty house, and I don't know what to do. I don't have anyone to talk, because my "group of friends" broke up some time ago. Everyone of them is having happy live beside of me. I'm average at everything, at school, my look is average, I'm average. I can't feel joy of doing things that I used to like. I can't stand looking at happy people spending time with each other. I feel freaking jealous. To be honest I've some kind of friend, sometimes she asks me how I feel, because I don't remind her someone who I used to be, but I don't wanna bother her with my problems. I think she's doing that only because once I helped her, and now she thinks that she owes me something. I consider her as someone who is always for me. And because of that I'm scared of worring her more and more. I hate myself. I can't stand being with myself. I hate looking in the mirror because I see fucking loser. The only thing that keeps me alive is thought that future maybe will be better. But this thought is getting weaker and weaker each day. 

I want to be like I used to be, but I can't. I feel dead inside. Like I don't care what will happend to me. I don't care if I will die tomorrow or any other day, because I know that none will remember me.
