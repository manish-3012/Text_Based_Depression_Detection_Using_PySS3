Periods to be finished...?I feel like my life just consists of periods. Waiting to finish school, then wait to finish college, wait to get a job. I feel so consumed and lost no matter what i do, just sucked in this stupid cycle of ordinary boring life (that i didnâ€™t choose and want to live in the first place) and I donâ€™t have time to actually live my life. I mean whatâ€™s life anyways? Just a bitch, ainâ€™t it? 

But most importantly iâ€™m tired of waiting to die because I donâ€™t think that iâ€™ll die soon/young. So fuck it imma do it myself, about the only thing I wonâ€™t wait for to happen because i can actually get it done. Only problem is what if I donâ€™t actually die? Iâ€™d feel so... I donâ€™t even wanna start...
