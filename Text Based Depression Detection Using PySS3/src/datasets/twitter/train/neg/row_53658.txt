Feeling very alone. I've felt this way for 30 years.I tried to add more context but I just can't right now. I wrote this two days ago... fml

My partner of 11 years has told me

They don't want sexual intimacy more than once a month.
They don't find me attractive since I've gained weight in the last 11 years.
That I have no sense of style and don't dress well.
That they love me.

What would you do?
