I want to die because no one likes me but I have a problem because I like meFrom the outside my life looks wonderful; I am pretty blonde who lives in a nice area and I am bubbly. But I live in the council estate in that nice area and all people see is pretty. Its funny I used to be the ugly, nerdy girl who wanted people to think shes cute and now im the pretty one who everyone thinks is dumb. I've never been on a date before, men usually just want to fuck me and toss me to the side. Both my parents have NPD and I have no friends. Its getting sad now that I go clubbing by myself. It's been 10 years and I havent had a friend that has lasted longer than a couple months. I am wonderful but its hard to keep thinking that when no one else seems to see it. Seems like im doomed either way.. what's the point anymore?
