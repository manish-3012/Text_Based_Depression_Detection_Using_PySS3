Depressed for half my lifeBeen depressed for well over half my life and I wish I had killed myself when I first got the notion. Putting it off has done nothing for me. Apparently things get better. Not seen it so far. I could probably carry on forever, but there's no point. There is nothing in this world that I want anymore. I get no enjoyment out of anything I do. No one but my work would even notice I was gone.
