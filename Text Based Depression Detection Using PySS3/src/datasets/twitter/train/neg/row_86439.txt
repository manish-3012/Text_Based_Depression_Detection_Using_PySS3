No one cares about meI donâ€™t bother to hide my mental illness, because Iâ€™m an adult and I think itâ€™s important that people know that this is what it looks like. Also I think itâ€™s bullshit that I should have to put in all this extra effort to pretend Iâ€™m happy just for other people so they donâ€™t have to feel uncomfortable by my existence.

Anyways the point is everyone I know knows Iâ€™m suicidal and no one gives a shit. They send me a text telling me how much they care about me but if I actually respond they start ignoring me pretty quickly. No one wants to deal with me and I agree that they shouldnâ€™t have to. Iâ€™m so fucking lonely. I couldâ€™ve killed myself days ago and no one would have noticed yet. Seeing pictures of everyone I know having fun together while I sit in the dark alone just proves that it wouldnâ€™t matter if I was gone. If anything itâ€™d just make things better because no one would have to put in the token attempt at pretending to care if I die. I donâ€™t know why I havenâ€™t done it yet.
