Shits been hard.Yesterday i was at the grocery store and a grown man touched me inappropriately. this brought back hella bad memories from my childhood, so that blows. also this is kinda stupid but i really, really like someone, and all iâ€™m getting is mixed signals. this makes me confused, and i really hat being confused. so yeah, iâ€™m probably not ginaâ€™s kill my self, but god damn, i havenâ€™t wanted to this much in a minute.
