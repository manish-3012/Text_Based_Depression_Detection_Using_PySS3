Exhausted with the struggle and just so tiredIâ€™m just so tired of it all and donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I know Iâ€™m not actually brave enough to do anything but Iâ€™m just so tired of being miserable and lonely. I cry constantly and feel like I have no one. I canâ€™t even muster up the will to do my hair or bathe half the time. My kitchen is a mess. I just feel like I have lived feeling like crap for so long and Iâ€™m just so tired of it. Iâ€™m tired of wanting to cry all the time. Im tired of being angry. Iâ€™m tired of feeling unhealthy and undesirable. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like I am failing at life even when by a lot of standards Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like I canâ€™t even get help because I donâ€™t want to be red flagged. I just want to be ok. I canâ€™t fathom doing this forever and feel so stuck in a permanent hell. Sometimes it gets marginally better and then it always just goes back to hell.
