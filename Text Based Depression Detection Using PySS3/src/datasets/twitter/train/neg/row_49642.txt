ReasonsI'm responsible for others and I'm afraid of the after unknown. That's it. That's all that stops me.

Parent, spouse, grandparent. No friends. Family sucks. Midlife crisis? 

Recent job loss, having trouble finding a new one. Gen X =middle child syndrome, and I'm a real middle child. Gen X gets overlooked for the millenials and younger. Two degrees, yet obsolete.

I want to do so many things, yet I can't due to my responsibilities. I feel trapped. This is not the life I wanted nor planned. Cliche'.

I don't want to be married anymore. Don't want to be responsible for others anymore. Don't want to do any of this shit anymore. I'm tired of it all. Overwhelmed. Tires of being used, of being expected to take it, to fix it, to do it.

My mind never stops, even in sleep. I have to exhaust my brain in order to sleep. I'm always tired, but the doctors say there's nothing wrong. I'm not manic, just mildly depressed. I can't tell them how bad it is, labels. What would people think. What would my family think.

I can't tell anyone because of the repercussions. I live near a huge hole in the ground. Would be easy, but I am too afraid to do it. I just knuckle down and move through each day. False front. Hopeless.

I've thought of having myself committed just to get away from all of it. To give me the excuse to drop it all. To make them do it instead of me.

No one knows the real me, they don't care to and I'm guarded. They believe I'm an awful person, but I'm not. I'm struggling to survive.

I want to thrive. I want to feel joy, and happy, and hope.


I'd like to walk away from all of it and disappear as I  travel wherever I land. Find myself, finally. Eventually cease to be.


Not all those who wander are lost.

You aren't lost if you don't want to be found.
