Regret not going through with itEnd of last year I was in a real dark place and just simply didn't want to exist anymore, I spoke to friends about it and family they all said the same things, time heals all, you'll bounce back from this and a load more bollucks but none of them really made a difference to my decision. One day I decided to change my mind thinking I'll never know what 2019 would be like of I die righy now so I tried as hard as I could to gather my life back together. I struggled in every way possible and their has been no changes in me I haven't grown or shifted my perspective. Its been the worst few years of my life and I just hate how everyone keeps saying 'it gets better' no it doesn't I've had the worst worst worst of times over the last 10 months and I could've saved myself all this pain. I've become to hate everyone and antisocial because I've lost all my confidence and self esteem. I wish for the day I don't wake up because living now is a waste of time. Life is shit and there is nothing anyone can say to change my mind. I hate everything, everyone and myself. I just wish I could implode sometimes.
