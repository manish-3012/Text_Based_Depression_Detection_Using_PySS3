ending it tonightI'm no exaggerating when I say that I cannot bare to be alive anymore. EVERYTHING brings me pain. I'm so fucking lonely and alone and worthless. I am ugly, failing college, have no friends and ultimately I am worthless. I have no desire to work or do absolutely anything in life and I can't fucking do it anymore. I hate this world. I hate this place so so much. I hate everyone and I hate that no one cares about me. Why was I brought into this world just to feel pain? I feel so much pain every day I can't do it anymore.
