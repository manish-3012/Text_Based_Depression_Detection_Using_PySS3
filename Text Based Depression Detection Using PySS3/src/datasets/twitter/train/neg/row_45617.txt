I Hate EveryoneThis is my second post, my first post was a few years ago. I really fucking hate everyone now. They all still talking behind my back, and they keep mocking me. What hurts the most is that their my family. I always think to myself, "Is ending my life make everything stop?" They dont even consider my feelings, and my opinions. They always wanted their way. They keep calling me stupid and other names. A few days ago, me and my family were arguing, and my aunt was hitting the back of my head with her fist, and i told her that i can report her to the police but she always comes up with a stupid reason like "You cant do that, your just an immigrant" and all of my family agreed with her. I told  my mom that im gonna run away cause i dont wanna live here anymore. She didnt even didnt say anything, she just tell me how stupid I am. Even my sister agreed......... I just want someone to end my life right now, i just want to get hit by a car, or get shot in the head because i cant take it anymore........ Im sorry about my grammar.
