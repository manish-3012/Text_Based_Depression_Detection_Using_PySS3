imma take 20 paracetamol and 10+ random pills in a few daysprobably. i really want to do it. the past weeks have been pretty rough for various reason. i dont enjoy life at all. the only thing i do is eat go to classes and sleep. i have like 12 hours of class everyday, saturdays like 2 hours of class and 3hour tests. i have like 4 friends but they have other friends and i rarely go out with them. an ex friend of mine is immature and way too overdramatic and she mocks me and makes fun of me in front of everyone just because i didnt answer to an okay and some other texts on time cause i was literally asleep. theres literally no point in living for me tbh. im so done. i hope this isnt just talk. i really hope i do it someday. i cant imagine myself continuing.
