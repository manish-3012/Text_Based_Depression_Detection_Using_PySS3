Why is life so unbearable?All periods of my life have been followed by great pain. I canâ€™t remember that Iâ€™ve ever felt happiness, even as a child. Iâ€™m afraid to kill myself. I took all the pills with me and was planing to take them near the quay so I could just take them and throw myself. Unfortunately Iâ€™m coward, I couldnâ€™t do it. Now I canâ€™t live and canâ€™t die and I hate myself.
