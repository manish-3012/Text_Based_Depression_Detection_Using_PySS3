My life is over at 20 years oldHello all. I am a 20 year old balding male. My hairline is trash and to make matters worse my head is HUGE. I have bipolar, depression and crippling social anxiety. Balding has been the cherry on top. I wear a hat 24/7 even in my room when Iâ€™m alone because I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. I pop Xanax all day to try and numb the pain and it works for a little bit but it all comes crashing back twice as hard once I come down. I donâ€™t know how to communicate with people anymore and I donâ€™t know how to keep a relationship. I used to be one of the â€œpopular kidsâ€ but after my dad passed away I feel into a deep dark hole. Iâ€™ve been arrested numerous times, been in rehab, mental hospitals, you name it. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is because of my mom and brothers. If I didnâ€™t have them Iâ€™d be dead long ago. But itâ€™s getting to the point where even their love and support isnâ€™t going to be enough to keep me alive anymore. Iâ€™m either going to be the guy who killed himself, or the guy who went bald and 20 and looks like a child molestor. Which one would you choose?
