Everything in life is telling me to just give up and kill myselfNo job. No money. No love. No ambition. No passion. No future. What do I have? Arthritis, depression, mediocrity, and as of this week, fucking kidney stones. Just when my life couldn't get any more shit I have to piss fucking razor blades. Im done. I can't take it anymore. Life is so fucking cruel.
