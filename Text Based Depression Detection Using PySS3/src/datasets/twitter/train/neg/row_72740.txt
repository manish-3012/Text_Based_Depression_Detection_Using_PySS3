Girlfriend attempted suicideI am sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, I just need love. 

36 hrs ago my girlfriend angrily took two handfuls of sleeping meds. Current in hospital after I found her unconscious in her bed. Attempted cpr and called the police and she was ok. Strong hallucinations but unsure what will be final diagnosis in terms of depression and shit. She is with family now. 

12 hrs ago my asshole dad fucked up and was unfaithful to my mom. He is now being blackmailed by a minor and his family business, friends, everything he has is risking being destroyed because he doesnâ€™t think before he acts. 

Guys I need help. If anyone out there can help pls send it all. I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t stop my life and drop everything. I have to keep marching forward like everything is okay but deep down I am ruined.
