HELP! I Think my little sister is seriously thinking about suicide. What can I do to help?So today, my dad sent me text to my littler sister's tumbler page and saw that she was saying goodbye to people and how she wouldn't be missed (very suicidal sounding stuff). I just texted her to see if she's willing to talk, but other than that I don't know what to do. Any advice helps.
