HeyUmm.

Where do I start with this, itâ€™s currently 00:33 and Iâ€™m unable to cry, Iâ€™m a grown man with a history of bipolar 2 and a assortment of issues.

Iâ€™ve always fantasised about suicide, I never thought I would make 30, Iâ€™m 38 now. I donâ€™t have kids or a wife, relationships struggle with me and I donâ€™t want my children to have or experience what I have.

So what am I trying to say, well, help.

I am so close to the line, the only thing stopping me is my parents, but Iâ€™m not sure about that any more. Is this life for me, even though Iâ€™m so lucky to be alive and not dying of cancer or anything.

So why do I want to feel I want to die almost daily?

I can have a good day and suddenly I feel I want to drive head on into a truck coming the other way, I running out of strength the older I get. I keep thinking make it through to tomorrow but this is a ongoing struggle and I donâ€™t think I can do for much longer.
