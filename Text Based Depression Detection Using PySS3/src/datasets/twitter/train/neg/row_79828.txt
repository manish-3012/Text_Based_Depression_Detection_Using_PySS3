Sorry another post todayOk so I've been thinking of ways to try and improve my life even though they both sound dumb
1. Anorexia, if I stop eating then I'll lose weight which is part of the reason why I'm suicidal but my family loves food and we have a whole cupboard full snacks and fatty foods so I probably couldn't resist.
2. Run Away, well pretty self explanatory but I'd probably die since I have zero survival skills and no money. 
I'm well aware this is dumb, any more ideas just let me know but so far killing myself is #1 on the list.
