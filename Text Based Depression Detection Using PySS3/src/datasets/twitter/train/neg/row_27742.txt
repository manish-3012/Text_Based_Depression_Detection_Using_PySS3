The Desert (A Poem)This is my first time writing anything like this so I do apologize if its bad

The 6' by 6' room  
My prison of emotions  
Entering the room  
My emotions loomed...  
Emptiness...  
Desperate...  
Hopelessness...  
My mind once a forest  
Slowly turned to a desert  
Trees to dunes  
lush bushes to dry cacti  
Happiness and Sadness  
so different yet merged as one  
The once plentiful trees of joy  
now turned to dunes of despair

The bottle of tequila in one corner  
The small stick of death in another  
They were my only escape  
Helped my mind hallucinate  
It created an oasis in that desert  
An oasis of hopefulness  
All superficial  
An imitation of what others felt  
Ultimately my organs whipped with the belt  
I didn't care  
Hoping the substances would work  
Desiring they would slowly kill me

As my loved ones slept in peace  
I got drunk and high waiting for release  
Walking the tightrope  
Looking death right in the eyes  
"STOP!"  
"END THE PAIN!!"  
I pleaded  
To change the wasteland  
To nothing  
Asking him for a bullet to the brain  
or a bloody knife to end the pain...

This was my first time writing something like this but if you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts writing is a great and healthy release mechanism. I do apologize if this poem kinda sucks but this is just how i feel and if anyone has any tips or criticisms about the poem please DM cause i really want to fine tune this poem, as it keeps me distracted from my depression. :)
