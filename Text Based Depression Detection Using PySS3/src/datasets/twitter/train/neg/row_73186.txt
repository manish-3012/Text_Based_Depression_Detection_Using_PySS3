I'm envious of alternative futures that can't beAnd it's pathetic that I can imagine a world where I am happy and long for it to the extent that a life beyond what I had expected to live. And to be worthwhile in my depression to talk about themes and tragedies that don't exist. I am torn between a hatred for the concept of Destiny to believe nothing I can do changes anything and the failure of a reality to long for.

I don't do anything. I used to get drunk as an excuse for my actions but now i don't remember. I don't know anyone I more than tolerate. Nothing will meet expectations and I can't forget anything without losing my only happy memories.
