Every time I think life is becoming bearable, everything falls apartI just don't know what to do anymore, I've been struggling with depression for 5 years, and after I attempted to kill myself and failed, I tried to turn my life around, and I succeeded for awhile: I got a good job, made good friends, and found a girl who I thought was the one. Then everything got swept out from under me, i lost my job, my girl left me, my friends left. Now I'm back alone with only myself to rely on, and I swear the hardest part of everyday is lying awake at night wondering if it's even worth it to keep pushing on. I don't the answers within me, all I feel is empty, and every night suicide is the only recurring thought. I just want to feel ok again, I have forgotten what that actually feels like
