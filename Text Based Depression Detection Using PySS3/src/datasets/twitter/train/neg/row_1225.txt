Just hurt to much and I'm so tired.It's been 9 months since my wife of 15 years left. She started immediately (was most likely cheating) dating a friend of mine. They broke up a few months later. Now she's getting married to a different person, he is a great guy. My kids love him, as she likes to brag to me about. All our old friends, my own kids, even her family that I loved and was closer to me than my own, they all are thrilled about this engagement. 

I drank heavily when she left. For months. Ended up so depressed and drunk all the time that I went  to the ER because I wanted to kill myself. I spent 37 days in a facility doing counseling for my depression.

I got out and was feeling good again. Got a new job, got my own apartment (was forced to move back home with parents as I couldn't afford lawyer and rent etc.etc).. I thought I was turning the corner and my life was going to be ok. 

And then boom, it hits me all again. Like she just left yesterday. I'm so sad again. 

I've dated a few women recently, they all suck compared to her. I can't stand any woman for more than sex and a brief conversation. Honestly I can't stand when one of them texts me. 

I'll never be normal again. I will never love again. I will always be this sad, alone and hurting. I am so tired I can't do this anymore.
