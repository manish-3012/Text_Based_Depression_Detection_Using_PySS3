Had a particularly bad day.I'm 22. The last few days have been quite bad. I finished studying physics at uni last summer and I've done nothing since. Nothing really interests me. I'm in group therapy that's not helping. I have no idea what to do with myself. My parents don't know how to help. Don't really have any friends. I'm quite lonely but I'm not very good with people. I've always been a bit of an outsider.

I've gone for walks in the cold with the intention of feeling cold. Today I went for a long walk with a swiss army knife in my pocket, sat down in a wooded area, but I faltered. I'm not sure how serious I was. I don't see a way out of this, I've really screwed up my life.

I wanted to do something "worthwhile". whatever that is. One of the professors suggested I apply for a phd at the uni but I didn't because I ended up freaking out from the stress of upcoming exams, a mass of doubts about myself, and being completely clueness. I should have accepted. At least it would've kept my mind busy.
But these doubts have only grown since then. I look through lists of phds and jobs but all seem as pointless as the next. And on days like today everything seems pointless. How can I ever by happy when I'm incapable of closeness with another person, and nothing interests me. Sorry this is a bit long winded. No matter how I try to write down how I feel, the words feel hollow and only capture a piece of the picture. I don't really understand it myself most of the time.

Edit: I forgot to add I often retreat into videogames or mindlessly surfing the web as a distraction from bad thoughts. Just of late I seem to be on my laptop constantly and when I stop and try to think about the future I have bad days.
