This emptiness eats me since years and I don't expect it will ever stop.I don't know how I should feel about this. The voices inside my head just won't stop. For years I told myself that I just need to reach a self-built checkpoint where everything gets better, but now I don't see anything anymore.
(You can skip the following part since it's a shitload of everything that turned to me this spot where I am now.)

**my past**

I never were positive minded, I went through many stuff that already made me realize in my early teens that I have huge struggles with my own way of seeing the world. It started with anxiety issues for several stuff but actually my first loves got me to a psychological state that I really seeked to die already around 14/15.
People told me its just a phase, general puberty stuff. So I tried to deal with my personal problems, tried to live like everyone in my age back then, finished school and started higher school.
There I met my "real" first love, because it lasted for the long relationship I've ever head. But it started to get down until we realized that we probably will be physical separated once we finished high school. She turned into an abusive girl, that fucked my mind up by every chance for every reason. I had selfharming tendencies, broke my own fist by punching at walls during heated discussions with her, she got to some mental phases where I'd rather die.
So the time came, I started going to university, only could see her once or twice per week and I realized she's cheating on me with my best friend. I was at the lowest point in my life, for weeks. Everyday I hated myself for losing her, even though she abused me mentally for months before. I started blaming myself because I took this dual degree at the university, but it was my only chance for getting well-paid and safe somewhen in the future even though the Job itself is annoying.
I switched between sleepless nights and crying by every chance where I was alone over the loss of her, yet I started to learn and learn for best results during my first term in university. It worked out, but the wounds and self-harm remained. I got into drugs, experienced the first perfect moments in my life since I lost her. I keep drowning myself in my leisure time in playing a particular video game, or trying other drugs. One stayed, and still is my at least weekly follower since 3 years now.

The university got worse, I got worse because I still hated myself and that study itself. Nothing could fill the emptiness that slowly killed my motivation so I ended up for the whole years of my study in a permanent "fear" of losing the only thing that was kind-of well promised for my future. Yet I couldnt made it properly, dropping stuff, the need of repeating exams.
My drug abuse turned from a great experience in a simply "just get high" to feel numb. Numb of everything. My common sense kind of made me still trying and finish with so many phases of mental weight downs the study.
I graduated in the end of August this year. The work I got into turned out to be somethingelse than expected, just something I can't do by myself so I fell during last month in another hole all over again.
3 years of a integrated degree programm that I didn't like at all in and enviroment of people I hated so much in a daily life of nothing but waiting for free time to stick to this game or wait for free days to do drugs. And now the well promised career entry that I can't managed. I just can't quit it since I would end up in a big loan of paying back all the college tuitions to my employer.
Now I requested another career entry, far away from home where I just know an somewhat online-friend. I work 'til friday at my "old" work and have to start next week at my "new" one.

I barely managed to find a rental apartment, but only at november, so I have to live by that friend til there. 

**where am i now**
I doubt everything. I doubt it will turn out as a really better work, so I also have to move away from my environment in a capital city just to earn money that I dont need in a job I dont like. But its safe..and well paid..everything I always got flustered back then I should get an proper education. I just do what I'm supposed to do, what everything always expected of me. 

I see nothing anymore. I always seeked out for my graduation, to maybe finally have a more peaceful life without the urge to numb my mental pain. But it won't stop.
It will never stop. Is one shit barly gone, the next is waiting around the corner. I don't know why I am doing this besides my common sense of living a independent, financial safe life.

But for what? 
I never found a compareable person/relationship since I lost my longest relationship and I don't think it will come in the future. Nothing makes me happy, no matter what I do, even if i force my self to go out, it just feels worse than getting high or sticking at home. I hate myself, I hate my whole way of seeing my daily life since I know other people would be happy about a more or less secured life. But I can't. 
Since years I always wished to die, and now after I had my worst three years in my life I couldnt imagine any better than not waking up anymore every night I go sleep. Yet my survival instincts just never turned me dead, only quite close to (over dosage, toxic mixes of different drugs etc.).
If I wouldnt know that I'm precious for my family, I guess I would've ended up killing myself already. But now when I move far away from everyone, I don't know if I can keep this up.
I hate my life. My own mind, those voices inside my head will never stop and only wait for every chance to turn me in this dark cycle of depression every day. No matter to whom I talk, no matter how many times I try to take help, it doesn't change anything. I just life because I'm supposed to without any purpose. A endless pain, no matter what circumstances because I couldn't imagine anything makes me happy.
