Sick of it(When things are normal) wake up, go to the mirror and see my ugly ass face , constantly feel like wanting to off myself , gym and I'll see how many others look so much better than I do,  go to work and be teased often for being dumb, come home and never speak with anyone, eat , repeat , die.

No doubt I'll die forever alone. I'm unemployed rn. My 2nd dream was to join the military so I could have a chance to die in war. Now I'm ineligible. I'm unemployed for a year. Cant wait to off myself
