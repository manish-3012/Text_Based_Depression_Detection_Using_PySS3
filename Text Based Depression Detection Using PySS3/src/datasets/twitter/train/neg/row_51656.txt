why shouldn't I kill myself?1. can't connect with anyone, isolation and loneliness. but im a social person so i have huge desire to be around ppl.

2. unhappy/low energy all the time, health is failing. 

3. no money, broke, no skills, mental issues, learning disabilities

i have nothing but pain. why is it perfectly fine for everyone else to live a meaningless life but me?
