Life feels pointlessI don't get what life has to offer me.  I have always been terrible at everything. School, work, relationships, etc. I honestly don't feel like it matters to anyone or will even change something. I don't feel happiness. My friends are enjoyable but I honestly don't care about them at all.  They are just as insignificant as I am. My family has always been abusive, but so what, there are millions of people with abusive families, so why does mine matter? It doesn't. Nothing matters to me, not life, not others lives, nothing. I don't feel rewarded no matter what I do. I can't seem to find all of this good happiness feeling everyone talks about. So, I started using drugs. Which seemed to allow me to feel good. I started smoking cannabis recreationally almost everyday and it made me appreciate life a little bit and I actually felt happiness. I also started abusing opiates and opiods. I used to take 60 or so mg of Oxycodone a day, or hydrocodone or hydromorphone, whatever I could to be honest. But I don't feel anything from them anymore and I have tried to OD but just end up in the hospital or feeling like shit for days. That isn't fun for someone who is trying to get any enjoyment they can from their shit life. I don't go into much detail about my personal life because honestly you shouldn't care or need to know, it just sucks. I just want a peaceful way out. If I could OD on cannabis I would, it would be the best way to go, but you can't... Oh well, I am just posting here to leave something that may eventually be significant behind, maybe, I doubt it but it is worth a try. I think ODing on morphine should be the way to go. If I am not gone by the time someone reads this then maybe some simpler suggestions to go quick and painless? Have a good life
