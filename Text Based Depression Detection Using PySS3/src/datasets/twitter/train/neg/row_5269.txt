My mom will die if I kill myself.I tried killing myself a while ago and was placed in a mental institution for a week. My mom told me that she has spent most of her life raising me with no other purpose in mind. I've thought many times of running away so as to emotionally distance myself her. Or cutting all ties when I am adult and make sure she never finds me. She put a lot of pressure on me by saying that but she has a sad life and some where in my mind I think what she said is true. I never viewed my suicide to have collateral damage, in fact I've tried to avoid it. What do I do now? Wait? For what?
