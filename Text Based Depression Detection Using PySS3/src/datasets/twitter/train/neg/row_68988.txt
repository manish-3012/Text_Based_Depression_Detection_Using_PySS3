I just have no reason to leave. I see only void in the future17 years old male graduating high school this year and probably will end myself after that. I have abusive family who fucked up my whole life. I have social anxiety, depression and rage inside of me to hurt or even kill people. I have no social skills no friends no dreams... I never went outside for 5 years ( beside going to school ). Only thing that keeps me happy is video games and tailoring. Seeing kids of my age acheving their dreams having a life that they always wanted just makes me sick. Why, why I have to suffer...
