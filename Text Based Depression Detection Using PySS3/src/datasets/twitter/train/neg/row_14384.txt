Give me a reason not toI've given up. I'm solely living for the sake of not hurting those close to me, but the smaller that circle gets, the more people I lose or alienate, the less reasons I have to live. Please, help me find another reason to live; the thoughts are getting stronger and more drastic, I don't know how much more I can take.
