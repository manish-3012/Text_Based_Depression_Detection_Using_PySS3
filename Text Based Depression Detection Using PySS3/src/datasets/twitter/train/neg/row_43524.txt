The letter I'll leave behind me.I tried to pick myself up but I couldnâ€™t,
I gave so many signs,
But no response, I cried I screamed,
Yet it was never enough to generate a response,
All I wanted was help, but never got it,
So I take matters in my own hands,
I didnâ€™t want to because I didnâ€™t think I was able too,
Now I know Iâ€™m not able to pick myself up,
Iâ€™m too broken, too hurt, too lost,
I hope no one blames them selves,
Because it was never one reason,
It was my whole life,
Nothing ever went how I wanted it too,
Every time I thought I was happy,
Something came crashing into me,
Knocking me down and back into this hole I was stuck in,
I tried to wait for happiness 
But some times a man just canâ€™t handle it,
Iâ€™m writing this with love,
Because I donâ€™t want anyone to blame themselves,
My entire undoing was my own fault,
I ruined my relationships,
I lost my parents trust,
Their faith in me,
I messed up my education,
I wasnâ€™t strong enough to handle heartbreak,
I pushed people away,
I know some loved me,
But loving someone doesnâ€™t give them a reason to live,
At least not to me,
Because for so long I was put down,
Blamed for things I didnâ€™t do,
And it was my entire fault,
I destroyed that trust with so many,
So if there is anyone to blame for this tragedy,
Blame me; Iâ€™ll take the pain with me I promise.
