Itâ€™s too much.Iâ€™m sorry, itâ€™s a throwaway account. I donâ€™t want anyone to know that it was on purpose. Iâ€™m going to do it soon. Iâ€™m going to die soon. Not to complain, I know that this isnâ€™t the sub for it, but itâ€™s not like it matters. Iâ€™ve been kicked out of my house, and Iâ€™m 16. My entire family has turned their backs on me because Iâ€™m a monster to them. My friends donâ€™t really care, they think Iâ€™ll be fine, and maybe I did too well on convincing them. They just nod off my problems and place theirs on me. Itâ€™s fine, really. But Iâ€™m not sure how much more I can take. Maybe Iâ€™ll throw myself off the bridge in town, or crash my car into a tree, or overdose on something. Idk. I want it to seem like an accident, I donâ€™t want my best friend to think it was her fault. Sorry, this is probably incoherent but I donâ€™t care too much right now. Thanks for reading, anyway.
