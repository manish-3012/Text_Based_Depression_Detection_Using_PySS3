I canâ€™t do this anymorethis lockdowns pushed me over the edge. My work keeps me going, but now I donâ€™t have any. At school, I seem like that typical bubbly girl whoâ€™s friends with everybody when in reality, I have noone. I think Iâ€™m going to break up with my boyfriend before I do it. I donâ€™t want him to feel bound to me in death.
