I (21m) canâ€™t be alone anymore
I just canâ€™t live like this anymore. Iâ€™ve never felt like anyone in my life has loved me and it is becoming apparent that I wonâ€™t get to experience that. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ever going to be good enough and I just canâ€™t deal with it. Iâ€™m so sick of being alone and I canâ€™t do it anymore, I drink and smoke weed all the time just because I canâ€™t go to sleep while I think about myself.

Nobody wants to be with me and I donâ€™t blame them. I hate everything about myself and 6 months of therapy hasnâ€™t even made a dent in it. I just want to die. All Iâ€™ve ever wanted is to have someone who thinks Iâ€™m good enough to spend my life with and Iâ€™m never going to have that. I canâ€™t stand how I look when I see myself in the mirror, Iâ€™m going into debt for a shitty worthless history degree, I will never have any money, I just have nothing that makes me have any worth as a person at all. It feels like the only reason Iâ€™ll ever have to wake up is to make someone else money.

I donâ€™t care about sex honestly, like of course Iâ€™m sure that is an important part of any relationship but I just want to be with someone who wants to be with me. Iâ€™m just not good enough. I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore. I donâ€™t want to wake up tomorrow and have to be sad all day because nobody cares about me. I feel like Iâ€™ve put everything I have in to other people, but if i were to man up and end it tonight there isnâ€™t a single person on this planet who would care. I feel like a burden, I bring nothing but the same consumerist bs that everyone does with no benefits.

I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I feel like a waste and Iâ€™m just not going to be able to this much longer on my own. It feels like Iâ€™m just counting down the days until itâ€™s not worth doing anything anymore. Iâ€™ll never be able to cuddle someone, Iâ€™m never going to be able to spend any of the holidays with someone, nobody has ever cared about me and itâ€™s obvious that nobody is ever going to have a reason. Iâ€™m tired of being a waste of resources. Iâ€™m tired of trying so hard to make it work when it just isnâ€™t going to. And Iâ€™m tired of asking for help when nobody is ever going to actually care if Iâ€™m okay or not Because Iâ€™m ugly, because Iâ€™m overweight, because I have a useless degree, because my hobbies are so fucking stupid that nobody with have a brain is ever going to want to spend anytime with me, because I am the fucking worst. I blame Absolutely nobody for wanting nothing to do with me and the only thing I want is for something to kill me so that I donâ€™t have to worry about doing it myself.
