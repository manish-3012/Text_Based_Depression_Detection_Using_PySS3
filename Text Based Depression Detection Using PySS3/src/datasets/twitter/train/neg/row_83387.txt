Urges increase when aloneI'm 18 currently living with my parents until I go off to college. They're currently not home and my suicidal urges have just increased so much because they're not home right now. Does anyone else's urges increase when alone? If they would've left tomorrow instead of today the I would've been gone because my payment comes in on the 3rd.
