I can't finish my paper; I'm going to get kicked out of college againI've had to work full time to support myself and pay for my own schooling - I don't get financial aid because I failed out 5 years ago. I managed to hold things together until spring break but things quickly started falling apart. I'm constantly tired and exhausted and haven't been able to keep up. I might fail a class because I can't understand the material and don't have time to study and if I can't make an a on this final I will fail and they will likely kick me out again. I've been trying to write my term paper for another class but I have half the page requirement and can't concentrate on it. It's already late and if I don't finish it in twelve hours I won't be allowed to turn it in at all. I can try to stay up to work on it but I have to work tomorrow too. I'm just sick and exhausted and I feel alone. My family refuses to help me with anything and I don't see the point of continuing because I can't even get anywhere with my GPA anyway.

I can't go get help because if I do get institutionalized then I'll definitely fail out again and be in a worse situation. If I fail out I will kill myself.
