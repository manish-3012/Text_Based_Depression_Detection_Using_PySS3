How meaningless I am.There is billions of people on this planet so the chance of me making any difference for the long term is pretty much zero, and Iâ€™ll be lucky if Iâ€™m remembered in 4 generations because I donâ€™t know my great great grandparents and you probably donâ€™t either. Nothing I do will matter in thirty years anyway so why should I even try anymore.
