Iâ€™m scaredI donâ€™t have anyone to talk to so Iâ€™m posting this here. Iâ€™m sitting in the woods with a 9mm I just bought today. Iâ€™ve never shot a gun before in my life so Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll mess up and just end up living and being horribly disfigured and in a lot of pain. I did research on where to shoot myself in the head but Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll fail.

Iâ€™m just sick of being a burden on everyone and being so mentally ill that I ruin everything. I just ruined a relationship with the best, most kindest and loving person on the planet because my anxiety and depression are so bad. I have no friends and my father is already so disappointed in me and I always need his help for money and stuff and I donâ€™t deserve it. I donâ€™t want to negatively impact anyone else anymore. I just want to go away
