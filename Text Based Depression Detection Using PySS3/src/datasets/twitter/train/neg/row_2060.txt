How to go on?I have no clue how to proceed staying alive anymore, I've been through everything and it will happen again, everything I do and have ever planned doesn't work out for me. 


Nothing feels right - why not going for suicide when there is no way it will turn out good in the end...?


Of course it may get better, but after a while it starts all over, being worse in the end.
