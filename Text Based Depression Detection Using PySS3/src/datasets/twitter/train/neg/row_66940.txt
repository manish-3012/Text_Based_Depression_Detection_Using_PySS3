I feel like I'm about to lose sanity. Overwhelmed with anxiety. Suicide becoming a daily thoughtI have been have huge depths of sadness and despair for 2-4 hours at a time about every day for the past 3 months. These attacks have been getting worse and I start to contemplate suicide as a legitimate option more and more. I don't know if its a chemical imbalance but I feel more and more anxious everyday. I live in a crowded fraternity with 4 people living in an extremely small room so I'm never allowed to be alone and I always have to worry about being social (and its hard as an introvert). Before I moved into this house at the begining of the year I could just lose my mind in videogames like WoW or LoL but now I don't have a desk so is like I have no escape and i've taken up daily pot use which seems like it is amplifying my anxiety. Its like it gets me feeling ok for an hour but then I just crash harder than I was before. I can't tell if its my housing situation, an emerging chemical imbalance, or bottled up emotions something along those lines.

Can anyone relate to what I'm feeling? Are there any resources that will give me more information to make rational decisions during these bouts of depression? Its like half the time I see how silly it would be to end it all but I just feel terrible at those times and logic doesn't seem to matter. Is this a phase? Do I need to go on antidepressants and if so will they dumb me down or make me into something I might not want to be? I'm worried.
