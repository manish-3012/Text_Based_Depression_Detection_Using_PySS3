End of the line... Nothing left worth living forMy parents are dead (19 years ago and 2 years ago); I'm not close with my siblings. I have very few friends. I dislike my job, though I'm very successful at it (at the detriment of my personal life). I hate my apartment; I hate the city in which I live. I have anankastic personality disorder, which drives me to battempt perfection at everything I do (exhausting, to say the very least). I have an autoimmune disease that causes me constant, intolerable pain for which there is no cure and with which there is substantial societal stigma, given its burden. Tonight, my boyfriend of just under a year broke up with my because he wasn't ready to move in with me/get married and didn't consider it fair for us to date any longer because that's the direction in which I wanted our relationship to head (and he, obviously, did not).

I'm at the end of my rope. I had suicidal ideations that I didn't disclose to anyone before my ex-boyfriend and I started to date. I have nothing for which I want to continue living. I have a very detailed suicide plan that I have not disclosed to anyone (give notice at my job, give notice to my volunteer organization, have Goodwill pick up items worth donating, throw away everything else, give notice on my apartment, send personal letters to my living family and remaining friends wishing them luck, prepare suicide note, eat a last meal, and execute suicide plan).

I'm posting here in case anyone logs into my computer after my death to show that there was a rationale for me dying. Best of luck to those in this forum who make it through this hard time in their life. I hope my death is prolonged and painful... It's well deserved for the failure I've been during these 32 years.
