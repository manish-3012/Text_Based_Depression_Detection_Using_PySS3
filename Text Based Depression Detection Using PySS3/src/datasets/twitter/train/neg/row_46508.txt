Not worthy of living nothingHave posted on here before. Still regretting getting led on, used as a comfort blanket for her, she stoped talking to me almost 4 years ago and never got a reason and probably never will. Living like a teenager in an almost 27year old body. I havent worked in 10months and cant see myself getting a job ever again due to having a checkered work history and poor qualifications. Im a dishonour and a disgrace to my family especially my mum who still does almost everything for me, she doesnt deserve watching her own son being miserable she should be happy. Ive even mentioned about killing myself to my mum and dad and they almost seem accepting that its more than likely this will happen. Want to kill myself before the end of the year and will be doing my best to do this
