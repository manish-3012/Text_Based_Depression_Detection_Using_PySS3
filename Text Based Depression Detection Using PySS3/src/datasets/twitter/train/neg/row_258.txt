hello, i've been struggling a lot with my mental health lately and i've tried to look for a person to reach out to but i can't.i'm 15 now, i've been having issues with my emotional and physical health since the last 2 or 3 years. lately it's becoming really hard for me to be strong and not fall apart. i've been crying a lot too. even though it helps a bit, i just feel very empty. i can't properly explain the feeling. my physical health is also detoriating, i'm currently on medications for kidney stones and i feel very tired ( probably because of it). i don't have any friends that i can talk to about this.
