What's the actual point in living?I'm almost 19, freshman in my local community college, music major. I'm failing most of my classes because I literally can't try or put in effort. I got through high school with minimalist effort and because the teachers liked me. 

I have no idea what I wanna do in life, realistically. My dream job would be to play video games professionally, like Smash Brothers, or to be an independent music composer for video games, shows, stuff like that. I know none of these will happen.

I'm depressed, anxious, a lot of things. My family won't take me to the doctor because they don't believe me because "it's common" or "over-diagnosed."

Here's the point of my post: I don't want to live. Life sucks. Money rules everything. The purpose of life is to be successful by doing what you love right? But unless you're super talented, you're fucked. What's the point of going on, taking classes that have nothing to do with my major, just to be subjected to a 9-5 minimum wage job for the rest of my life?

I've wanted to kill myself but I told myself I can't because there are people who care about me. Mainly my brother and my girlfriend of almost a year (anniversary is tomorrow).

All I ask is for some kind words and advice to keep going.
