I'm not killing myself tonight, or tomorrow, or MondayIf I'm entirely honest with myself, I will have to reevaluate on Tuesday and go from there, but I at least have a reason to live through the weekend. I will survive until Tuesday for my roommate who needs someone to love him while he's hurting. I will wait to remove myself until he his stable. And I'm ok with that.
