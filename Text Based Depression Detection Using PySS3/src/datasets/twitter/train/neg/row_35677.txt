In college, have no idea what I'm doing, pretty much a nobodyI attend a very expensive college, but have no idea what the fuck I'm doing and I feel like I'm squandering my parent's money and my own time just being. No idea what I want to do for a career, no motivation to study. I feel like I nobody and have no purpose in this world. I keep hearing that everything will be all right and just trust in me and God but I can't do it anymore. I just want to drop out or kill myself or something.
