Losing hopeSo basically I finished university last year and in the process of revising for finals gave myself severe rsi. I did really well at Uni and I've just started a really good job and am going to be forced quit next week because of the pain. 3 years studying for a degree which I can never use, never be able to leave home, just a burden to my family. It's really sad, but it would be inconsiderate for me to continue living.
