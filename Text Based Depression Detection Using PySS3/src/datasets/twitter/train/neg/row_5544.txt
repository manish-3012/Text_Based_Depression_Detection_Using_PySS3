Should I be scared of this? Man charged, jailed, and held on bail for $60,000 for a minor hand injury to a cop while climbing on a bridge's rail while seeking suicide.Title should be enough, but here's [the article](http://registerguard.com/rg/news/local/32594825-75/man-who-tried-to-jump-off-newport-bridge-charged.html.csp) anyway.  

I mean he was wanted for robbery but I don't know the details, perhaps he robbed then insta went to the bridge to avoid jail? Maybe it was years ago?

Either way, the article states what the title says I believe.
