The only main reason i was continuing to live i don't have anymoreI've been struggling with self harm for a while now and I'm at the point where I'm addicted to it. People always say addictions stay with you forever and you always have to fight it and i dont want to live the rest of my life dealing with the burden of self harm. Having addictions is so frowned upon i don't want to live with that judgement from my family or other people. My dad is a drug addict i have issues with him and have always vowed to be nothing like him. Last night i realized I'm exactly like him he is an awful father. He has addictions and now I'm addicted to self harm i dont want to be associated with addictions and drugs or have people think of me differently my whole life.

I've always wanted to have kids when i grow up and that was the main reason i was staying alive so i could have kids but if I'm awful just like my dad those kids don't deserve to have me be their mom. I've always been very close to my mom and we have had drug talks and she has made it very obvious she fronds upon it so i thought if i have a self harm addiction what if my mom thinks I'm a screw up? She did nothing wrong she is a great mom so the reason I'm a screw up is purely my fault and my family doesn't deserve to have a burden like that.

As i was crying i thought why me why do i have to go through this? I'm so selfish thinking why me? That shows I'm just thinking about myself. I genuinely think i deserve this and i deserve self harm i genuinely don't understand why anyone cares about me anymore. We are all going to die eventually so if i kill myself I'm just doing the inevitable so i think i might just take some pills soon. I deserve it i deserve all of this all of my pain and self harm.
