I've held on for as long as I could, but my grip is starting to slip.One thing after another, everything eventually turns for the worst. Even those most loved, do not reciprocate life-changing decisions. School, girlfriend, car, money, work and social, each one was a finger holding on and now i've barely got a grip.
