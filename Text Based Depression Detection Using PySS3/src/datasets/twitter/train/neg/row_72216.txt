Suicidal boyfriend?! Please helpHi I'm 19 years old and my boyfriend is too. He's been acting strange lately and he's told me that he's suicidal. He's got a messy past. I really don't know how to handle this and I really want to help him but I don't know how. Any advice would be really appreciated. I'm super worried about him.
