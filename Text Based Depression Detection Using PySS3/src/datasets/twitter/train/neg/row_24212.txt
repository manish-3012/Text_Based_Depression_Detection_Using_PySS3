Canâ€™t stand it anymore
Itâ€™s been almost 3 weeks since I lost her. My best friend. My partner. My world. I know you should not make someone the focus of your happiness. But what can you do when youâ€™re around that person and they just make everything so much better. Itâ€™s been 3 weeks since she left me. We stayed in contact but the pain is too much. I finally asked for some space, but thatâ€™s only after days of her saying thatâ€™s probably what we should do. I had to ask for it.I just keep getting sicker and sicker. Eating less and less. Feel like constantly throwing up. Feels like Iâ€™ve been torn apart. I love her so much. I regret even asking for space. I miss her so much. Just hearing her voice calms me down. She had my whole heart. Still does. No one could ever compare to her. She is so beautiful and special. And now I have probably lost her to someone else. People constantly tell me to just move on. That there are other girls out there. More fish in the sea. But I donâ€™t want to move on. Sheâ€™s my love. There are other girls out there but what has that have to do when sheâ€™s the girl I want to be with and love. There is plenty of fish but sheâ€™s the only fish I want. They say with time things get better. While itâ€™s still fresh. I just feel like Iâ€™m getting worse and worse. 

I canâ€™t stand the fucking pain anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Only reason why I havenâ€™t cut again is because I know how disappointed people will be of me. But I canâ€™t take it anymore. I feel like cutting is the only way as I cannot stand this fucking pain. Iâ€™ve felt pain before but never like this. I just want to leave everything behind. Just cut and cut again. I just want to feel something else. I wish I didnâ€™t feel anything anymore. 

Iâ€™m sorry.

TLDR: pathetic rant.
