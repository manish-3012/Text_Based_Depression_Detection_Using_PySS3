Some things will never changeI'm 36f. I've always had slight depression but after I gave birth to my last child 3 years ago, something changed in my head. I've tried therapy, medications, self help books, reaching out to friends and family, college, work, things I used to enjoy growing up, focusing on my kids, you name it ive tried it. 

But it seems like it was all just things I was doing while feeling this way. It never made me not feel this way. And that is why I cant continue life this way. I know I wont grow to old age, because there is absolutely no way I can continue feeling like this for that many more years. Just the last 3 has been the biggest struggle of my life. 

I dont know when it will happen, but for now I hold on until I literally cant anymore. Maybe another year, maybe another 5 years. I consider myself strong so likely the latter. But it is inevitable.
