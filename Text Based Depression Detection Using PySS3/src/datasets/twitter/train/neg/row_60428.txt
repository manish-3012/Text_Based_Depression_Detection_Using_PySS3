What is it like to die?I know the brain relases chemicals when we begin to die and this scares me.  I had hallucinations after surgery once and also when I consumed too large of a quantity of edibles.  I hate hallucinating.  I can't imagine having to suffer through that right before death.

This is one thing that's somehow keeping me alive right now.  I think death must be peaceful, but the idea of tripping at the end feels frightening.  I wonder if this happens to all people, regardless of method?

I'm so exhausted.  Not sure I can or want to keep going.
