My friend tried to kill herself and instead of feeling upset, I feel jealous that she had the guts to do what I so badly want to do.I feel like the shittiest friend and the shittiest person in the world. I just got a message from my friend telling me that she tried to kill herself last night. She's fine, but she's in the hospital right now. I immediately burst into tears when I found out, but I was crying for the wrong reasons. I was crying because I constantly think about killing myself but I'm too afraid to try. I was crying because I'm jealous that she tried to kill herself when all I can do is sit here and contemplate it without actually doing it. I have this sick feeling in my stomach that if she had succeeded, I would have been even more jealous. I know, it's horrible, I hate myself more than anything in the world for having these thoughts. It's like I feel numb to the fact that my friend could have died, all I feel is jealousy that I don't have the guts to try to kill myself as well.
