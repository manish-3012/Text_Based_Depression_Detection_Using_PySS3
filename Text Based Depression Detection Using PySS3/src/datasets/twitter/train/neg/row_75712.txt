Instead of killing myselfClearly I donâ€™t have the guts to end it all, as much as I want to because Iâ€™m so drained and tired. So not only are my eating habits fucked and my weed intake is increasing, Iâ€™m also gonna stop caring about people outside of my friend circle. I literally do not give a shit about anyone else. Yâ€™all should do the same, as soon as I stopped giving shit (and I really stopped giving a shit), I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

In fact, Iâ€™ve become so apathetic, when I found out Naya Rivera died, I felt nothing. Yes, I am aware itâ€™s a tragedy and itâ€™s terrible that it happened but I literally felt and feel nothing. Usually, I would feel something but I feel nothing. Every time I read articles about COVID-19 patients dying, I feel nothing. 

At first it sucks but once I stopped caring and stopped feeling for anything and anyone outside of my family and friends, I think itâ€™s going to be the one thing that fucking saves my life. No, not â€œI thinkâ€, I KNOW.
