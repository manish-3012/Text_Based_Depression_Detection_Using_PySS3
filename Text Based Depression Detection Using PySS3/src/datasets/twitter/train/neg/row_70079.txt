reddit, i just created a subreddit to help people from cutting themselves. i hate karma whoring, but please upvote??? (mic) (xpost from iama)/r/stopcutting if anyone needs help, i am trying to build up a community for help. its just now getting started, so if you could tell your friends about it, that would be great.i know this is karma whoring, but i am doing this on a throwaway account because to me, this isnt about karma. this is about making a well known place on reddit for others to go to when they need help. you can ask me anything about the subreddit, my intentions, how you could get involved, etc. =]
