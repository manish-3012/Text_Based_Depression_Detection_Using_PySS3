Good byeI always felt like those around me really take me for granted. I canâ€™t do it anymore. Iâ€™m not perfect but I can at least say that Iâ€™ve tried. This world is not for me. I always wanted to leave a mark before I go. 

Please if you have someone whoâ€™s not too far gone like I am, talk to them. Be there for them. Support them. They need you more than ever. Donâ€™t let them slip. You will regret it when theyâ€™re gone. 

The world would be a better place if there was more love.
