I canâ€™t do this anymoreItâ€™s my 22nd birthday in 2 hours. I spent the entire day thinking of ways to end things for myself, driving around looking for places I could do it. I really canâ€™t do this anymore. Nobody loves me, I donâ€™t love myself, I am always painted as the bad guy. Some topic came up at dinner about a 93 year old woman who died on her birthday, and I told my mom jokingly â€œwhat a cool way to leaveâ€, and she shrugged me off. I asked if she could spend my birthday with me, I told her Iâ€™d love to see the new Aladdin musical and she said â€œwhy didnâ€™t you tell me earlier? Thereâ€™s no tickets now.â€ So I asked her if she could have tea with me instead, and she said â€œsorry, Iâ€™m busy, maybe another day.â€ My uncle said he would swing by our place tomorrow to wish me in person, but his husband told him â€œno weâ€™re too busyâ€. My brother left my birthday dinner early because he was tired. I was told today by someone that I thought I loved and I thought loved me back, that he really couldnâ€™t care less about my thoughts surrounding how I want to spend my birthday. 

Iâ€™m writing this here because I have no one to share these thoughts with. I donâ€™t want anyone to know that Iâ€™m thinking of ending it, until I have actually done it. I hate this day, I wish I wasnâ€™t born, I wish I didnâ€™t have shit birthdays every year. I wish for once I didnâ€™t spend the few hours before my birthday crying, I wish this pain could just end.
