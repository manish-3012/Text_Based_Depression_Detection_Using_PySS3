Todayâ€™s the dayI canâ€™t do it anymore... my only hope is that thereâ€™s something on the other side

If your suicidal, please try to stick it out, your strong, you have stamina, your one thought away from seeking help... But Iâ€™m weak, and I canâ€™t do it anymore, Iâ€™m drained mentally, I feel worthless, Iâ€™m in a hole that I canâ€™t get out of, Iâ€™m a nobody... I donâ€™t wanna bore you with my life story


I guess Iâ€™ll leave this world knowing that i might of made a difference in hopefully one person... bye everyone! If thereâ€™s an afterlife, I hope to see you there, and if not than itâ€™s whatever, anything beats this shitty world... You reading this, please donâ€™t have the same fate as me, please...
