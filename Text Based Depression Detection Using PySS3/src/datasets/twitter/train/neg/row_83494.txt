When there's truly nothing leftI'm going to be 50 in a couple months, parents are dead, no family to speak of. My husband sent me packing a year and a half ago because he couldn't deal with my physical and mental disabilities anymore. I've been in chronic pain for 15+ years due to a roof falling on me. The only thing keeping me going right now is my dog and a promise to my mom on her death bed. I've attempted suicide 6 times, the last time ended me up on life support for a week and a lengthy stay at the nut house. I'm very physically ill and just don't see the point in suffering anymore, no one will ever love me again, my quality of life sucks, I'm alone I just want to be done already
