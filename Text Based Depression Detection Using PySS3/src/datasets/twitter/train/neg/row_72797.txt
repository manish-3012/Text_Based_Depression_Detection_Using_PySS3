I have to not think about it and just do it. Iâ€™d rather die young.Well come the latest hour on 6/16 that gives me a little less than two weeks to live. I have spent every day planning it out more naturally than trying to keep my life going with no motivation. Suicide is a permanent answer to permanent problems. I canâ€™t even begin. I just want to be with my loved ones and I doubt Iâ€™ll ever reunite with them. Thereâ€™s so many false illusions and fairy tales. Not for me.,not going to ever happen after the seconds of grief and my insides dying.
