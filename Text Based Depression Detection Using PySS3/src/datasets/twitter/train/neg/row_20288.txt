Iâ€™m tryingThe only thing that keeps me from killing myself is the fact that Iâ€™m scared of how much it will hurt and i know everyone around me will be disappointed. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

My parents always compare me to everyone who is better than me in even the slightest way. I worry so much about my grades that I stop taking care of myself. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to them but they just yell at me and call me weak. My friends try to help but in the end they arenâ€™t much better off than I am and I canâ€™t keep going on like this. I just wish they could see that Iâ€™m trying as much as I can right now.  

People always say it gets better but I donâ€™t see it happening anytime soon.
