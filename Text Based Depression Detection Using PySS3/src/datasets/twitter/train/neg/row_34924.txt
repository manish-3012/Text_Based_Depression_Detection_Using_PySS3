If Im Feeling SuicidalWhat do I do?  I just lost my third job since January due to behavior at work(basically being kind of boisterous unintentionally) in an office environment.  I have been sober from a decade long heroin habit for 7 months and I feel like I can't piece my life together.  I have just been thinking over and over about how much Suboxone or how many bags of street fentanyl it would take to break through my Suboxone dose and kill me.  I feel like I don't fit in anywhere and I think most of my family is tired of me not having my shit together.  What mak s the job loss so distressing is that I was really trying this time, I didn't call out or fuck off on purpose I was really trying.
