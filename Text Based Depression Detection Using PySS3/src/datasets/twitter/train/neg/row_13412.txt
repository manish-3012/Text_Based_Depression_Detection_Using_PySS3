Donâ€™t want to kill myself but feel like I have toMy emotions have been more erratic than usual this week. Once I realized the date, I attempted to remind myself it is probably just my PMDD. My mind doesnâ€™t care what it is. I canâ€™t live like this.

It feels as if most of the people closest to me are against me. I feel like they are often gaslighting me. Maybe my depression and anxiety are making me gaslight myself. I canâ€™t tell when my anxiety is justified. I canâ€™t breathe. The pain in my chest is so tight. One of these days my heart will give out. Will that be a form of suicide?

I am afraid that Iâ€™ve unintentionally made many lives worse. I burden those around me with my illness. Sometimes I think they wish Iâ€™d just shut up and die. Sometimes I have dreams that theyâ€™re murdering me.

I was okay today. Most of my day was wonderful and productive. Coming home again to an empty apartment, alone with my emotions and the negative thoughts of this week is terrifying.

I wrote a letter to some friends the other night. Iâ€™ve written many letters that have gone unread. Burned, thrown out, deleted. 

I read a post last night that said â€œYou donâ€™t have to end your life to live a different one.â€ I think Iâ€™ve lived a couple lives by this point though, and Iâ€™m afraid this will linger with me through any I may have after.

Holding on is exhausting.
