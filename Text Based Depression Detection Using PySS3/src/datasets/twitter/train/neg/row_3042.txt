Want hurt to stopI went to meet my long-term long-distance partner in November 2019 and everything was fine till February 2020 I went to buy him a birthday gift because no one else in his family would and then his mother called us and threatened us and we got home and she screamed at me and threatened to beat me up because she thought I was getting him a passport to get him to come back with me I had never thought about getting him a passport before that night then the pandemic hit and the border closed and I stayed because I didnâ€™t wanna leave him there but I got sick in May and I had no choice but to go home in June or I wouldâ€™ve died from May till June we lived in a motel I was 19 he was 21 I had to take out on an emergency loan so that I wouldnâ€™t be homeless the day that I was going home he promised he would only be a few months and we would see each other but now itâ€™s December and everything has only gotten worse his mother is using power of attorney to keep him there I have PTSD from being sexually assaulted and I have more PTSD now from what his family did to me I have severe OCD I have to leave here I have anxiety and I have depression and I have severe codependency on my partner I havenâ€™t seen him in months Iâ€™ve barely been out of my house since I got home I have a therapist I have meds it doesnâ€™t help nothing helps the only thing that would help is the situation getting better and I donâ€™t have any faith that it will I just want my partner I just want him I donâ€™t want anything else we worked so hard we got him an exemption so he would be able to cross the border and his family ruined it all I want is him it hurts it hurts Im tired of it
