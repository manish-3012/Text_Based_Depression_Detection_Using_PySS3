Hey guys...Hey, guys, it's me and I am known as Yamcha in the internet world. I have all sorts of friends in the internet world but I don't have any in real life world. I wish I was able to make friends but being me doesn't make me any friends so I can't be myself at all, I pretend to be funny so I can make friends but I guess it doesn't work in many places. People hate me and I make soo much fusses everywhere when I try to be myself. Idk if my existence is worth being on this Earth? Idk I've been playing hide and seek with my dad for 16 years now, and Haven't found him. I have depression diagnosed by my doctor and most of the time I try to get away from the real world by playing games but the more I play games more I want to kill myself because I realize how much of a loser I am. Well, I just wanted to say this before I decide to go..
