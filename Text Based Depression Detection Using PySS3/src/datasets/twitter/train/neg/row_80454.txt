I want to k1ll myselfI donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I have very religious parents. When my father found out I wanted to k1ll myself a year ago he said I was selfish and that could if I wanted to. Itâ€™s been a year since then and I thought things would get better and start looking up but itâ€™s so much worst. Besides depression there are many factors to me wanting to mostly that I messed up. I did something I canâ€™t take back and my parents wouldnâ€™t let me live down if they found out. Everyday is so dull and Iâ€™m always so anxious. Iâ€™m wondering why Iâ€™m even living anyways and how I should do it. I donâ€™t want it to be too painful. I donâ€™t want to go to hell either but I feel trapped.
