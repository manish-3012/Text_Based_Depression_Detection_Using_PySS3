hey guys i just made this account!i made this account with the utmost of privacy because i can't be found out... maybe i hope someone connects the dots? i don't know.   
anyways; i've been dealing with a lot of hopelessness; i'm scared to admit it to anyone because i have to "be a man". this virus has closed so many doors for me; my problems are so minuscule compared to what i've read on here, i just wanted to ask you guys:  


What if i never find out why i was born? 

i've been trying to find something i'm good at; a passion, a talent, something i can say i do with pride, something i can stop disappointing people at. i've looked everywhere to try and see how i can know what i might be good at; i've done personality quizzes, i've done "future career" quizzes but none of them lead me to anything. i'm at the last straw; can someone here help?
