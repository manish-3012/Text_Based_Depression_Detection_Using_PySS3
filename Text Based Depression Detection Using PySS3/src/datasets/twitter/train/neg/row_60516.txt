Toxic emotions,dont read if easily triggeredThis stupid fucking virus has wrecked my entire fucking life
I spent 2 years of high school (2018-2019)being depressed,suicidal,stressed due to a major exam that decides my worth as a student in my country,casted out by everyone in my school and I finally graduated at Dec 2019

I thought maybe after this i could finally feel happy and finally be able to realize my dream of going overseas once as an exchange student for a year.I got chosen to go for an exchange to Japan that was originally set for departure at 1st April.

I thought everything could get fucking better after I left my fucking high school but look the fuck now

I dunno when the program will be extended to,i dunno when the movement restriction order in my country will be uplifted,I dunno when I can be free and feel happy again

I've been binge eating the whole time because i was bored and depressed.And i gained 7,8kg for this.And it makes me even more depressed because I hate my weight and my ugly appearance.Fuck my life.Fuck.

I've been trying to watch movies to distract myself from my toxic thoughts but my house wifi connection sucks hell.It hasn't been upgraded since 2015 because it was signed under my father's name and he died during 2015 and my mom finds it meddlesome to upgrade the wifi (plus she wants my sister to reduce her wifi usage so she doesnt wanna update it)

I tried to do a lot of things.I tried to distract my thoughtss but I feel so empty and alone.I tried talking to people but they never wanna talk with me.They always seem to be busy and have some form of enjoyable entertainment for them to feel entertained.When i talk about how depressed I am the whole conversation ends.

Is this what u mean by "I will be thr for u when u r sad and depressed","i care for u","dont say u have no friends,if so what am i?"
