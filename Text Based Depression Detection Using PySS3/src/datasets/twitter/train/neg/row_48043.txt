I tried to commit suicideMy plan was to freeze in a river. I walked an hour and a half to a spot where no one could see me. I took a life jacket, tied a rope to it and and tree, and began walking into the freezing water (it was probably extremely close to freezing temperature). I put my hands in the water, and I could feel the blood rushing out of my fingers. 

My rope ended when I was knee deep. If I wanted to die at this point, I would have to kneel down and try to keep myself upright. 

A couple minutes into this, I realized that if I stayed out here, I would get frostbite. I didn't have what it took to maintain the effort to immerse myself in the water. It would have easier if I was floating, but I couldn't rely on my body to keep itself submerged. I knew there was a chance I'd wake up tomorrow alive, but frostbitten. I began to think of everything I have to live for, and I said to myself, "I can't die out here." I panicked, because I didn't know if I could make it. 

At that point I rushed back to the shore. I could not feel my fingers. I tried to put my socks on, but I didn't have the dexterity to do it. It took me a few minutes and lots of tripping and falling in the mud, but I eventually got it. 

Once I got my gloves on, I was able to get the blood circulation in my hands again, and I walked home. 

This experience has taught me that deep down I'm not really sure if I want to die. Part of me wishes I succeeded, but I can never really know.
