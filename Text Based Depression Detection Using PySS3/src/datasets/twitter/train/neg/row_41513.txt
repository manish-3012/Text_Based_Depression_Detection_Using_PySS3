Sister may be considering suicide...Hey Suicide Watch,

I'm 15 years old and my sister is 17. She's openly told us she's felt left out from her friends doing activities that she cannot participate in due to our family values. She and our mother get into heated arguments almost every other day. She has said she wants to kill herself but I can't tell how serious she is and our parents just ignore it out of denial that she could even think of doing something like that. I am extremely worried.

Please help me I have absolutely no idea what to do.
