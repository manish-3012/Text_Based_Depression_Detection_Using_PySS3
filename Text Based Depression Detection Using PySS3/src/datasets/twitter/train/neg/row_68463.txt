I cannot go on. it's over.i can't deal with this emotional pain and burden that constantly torments me.


i (17/M) am thinking about killing myself. It's not the first time, it's almost weekly.


Im done with trying. Im done with living. I ruin everything, i have nobody. Been bullied my entire life, i stress too much, my life is utter trash, i want this endless pain to end.


I've become numb to the point that i can't even cry anymore. I don't care about the people i leave behind. Hopefully i'll be remembered for the few good things i've done. It's over.



Im going to injest anything and everything in my bathroom locker. Hopefully i end up poisoned. Im so sorry, please forgive me. It's not worth it.
