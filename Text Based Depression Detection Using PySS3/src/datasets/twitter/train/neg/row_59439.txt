Holidays are hardthanksgiving is in two days and I canâ€™t feel more like shit. Iâ€™m at home from school since my mental health issues were making it too hard to continue college at the moment. Iâ€™m working through some hard shit. But the holidays always make me feel like absolute shit. They make me feel like whatâ€™s the point? Itâ€™s just me and my mom, my dad died 11 years ago, he was my best friend. My mom and I clash on everything we literally have never seen or approached a problem the same way which is very frustrating when you deal with the feelings that I deal with. My childhood home is a nightmare. Iâ€™m an only child and I feel like Iâ€™m living in a house where Iâ€™m dead. Let me clarify this because it might sound weird but thereâ€™s pictures of me on any surface that you can put a picture. Due to the trauma I experienced as a child with my father and going to the hospital every day for years, I donâ€™t remember anything for years of my life. I have literally no memories from the ages of 6-12. We donâ€™t live close to any family and have basically estranged most of the family at this point. I just really hate my life and the things I was put through up until I left for college. To top it all off every night at home I sleep in the bed that I was raped in (by a boyfriend at the time). All of my past shit really Just is choking the fuck out of me all the time and I really have never felt okay. I just want all the pain to stop it hurts me so bad all the time. Iâ€™m in pain all of the time. It makes me hate myself and hate who I have become and Iâ€™m no better than the pain because I succumb to it whenever it calls my name. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore I just want to sleep all of the time.
