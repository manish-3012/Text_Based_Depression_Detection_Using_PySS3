Reality just isn't meant for me(Sorry, English isn't my native language)

I'm a 19 year old student with no dreams and no will to even try to work and succeed. Going to school every morning seems as pointless as it is terrifying. Just the idea of being stuck in a stupid routine of going to a default school and get a diploma to then work at a default 9 to 5 job to survive is so depressing to me. I'm probably just a selfish millenial who thinks he's owed everything and doesn't want to work for it. The worst part is that I have a beautiful loving girlfriend, an amazing small group of childhood close friands and parents who support me both financially and emotionally. All of them know about my depression and anxiety too. Yet I can't help it, the future is so fucking scary and seems so dull no matter what I do. I think I'm just not right for this society, the perspective of spending my whole life working is terrifying considering how much I'm stressed out about every single day of school or work. 
Right now I'm on holiday and it is amazing, but the thought of going back to school in september is unbearable and I think I'd rather die than suffer through a year of school again.
Fuck it seems ridiculous when I put it like that but I'd just rather die. 
I think my girlfriend is the only thing holding me back but in september she's leaving to study in Canada for 5 months (We are french) and I just dont think I'll be able to handle it.

The text is way too long and this might be the wrong subreddit but whatever
