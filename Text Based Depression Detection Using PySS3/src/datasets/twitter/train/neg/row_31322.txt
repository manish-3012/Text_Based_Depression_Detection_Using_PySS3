I can't quite handle anything anymoreI sigh as I realize another day has come and my life hasn't ended yet. There's so much pain and hurt inside of me and I'm in tears because I don't know what I did to deserve this life. My mom always chooses my abusive stepdad over me and that hurts a lot more than I'm willing to admit. I've lost all my friends and I'm working a job I hate. I don't have the courage to quit because I have bills, but I just can't do it. I haven't been sleeping since my drug addicted stepdad almost killed me last month. I can't do anything about this life and everything hurts so bad. There's this emptiness I can't seem to fill and I can't get rid of it. I don't have anything keeping me here and nothing to look forward to. I think maybe it's time for my pathetic life to end. I've lost everything and I've never had anything.
