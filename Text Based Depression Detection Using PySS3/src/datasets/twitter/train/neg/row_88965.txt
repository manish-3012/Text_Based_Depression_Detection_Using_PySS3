A plan that worksI am in my late 30's with nothing to show for it.
I have lost or given up through foolishness the beautiful things in my life. 
I just destroyed the new life I spent a year putting together in a new city after throwing away the best real relationship I ever had.  
Now homeless 
No job
I am sleeping / typing this in a storage shed in cold weather. 
I have few friends left and am ashamed of myself on front of them. 
I'm a so-called high functioning autistic
The fuck is that?  Do I appear to function at anything? 
I am tired of not being able to make connections that last. I'm tired of fearing going to work because people think I am odd. 
I'm just tired.  Life has lost its fun. 

I have a good and painless plan

sorry boys and girls. Figure out your own. I'm not going to have my last act be to contribute to your death.  My choice, my plan,  my responsibility.  As it is I am going to fuck up the few people left that love me. 

But I have a plan and the more I think about it the better I feel,  the happier I get.  This can end.  No after life.  Just worm food.

 I wish I could do it without damaging anyone but what's one more fuckup.  I'm going to do my best to explain it to them. They will survive. 

I'm not sure how this ends for me.  Maybe tomorrow I get up and don't feel like closing shop. But if I do, I am prepared. And I think this time is going to be different.  It won't hurt, I'll feel calm,  there's no doubt I'll die. I've built it into The Plan.  So I think the time is right.  Just a few more days to prepare and then adios muchachos. May 15th is looking good. I hope it's a warm night. 

No need to talk me down fellas. 
 Just wanted to be heard out somewhere.

Edit: Can you believe we can upvote and downvote these things?  Got far too fascinated by down voting myself.  Good times!
