Consequences of LifeAgain, by not kms before now, I face the music of running low on money (started to kms by at least 2017).  Gonna be hellish from here on in.  Is it FINALLY registering in my head how serious this is ?!?!?!  My posts are likely coming to an end.  I have lived this long.  Consequences cannot be pushed back any further.  Trying to keep fear at bay.  Take care all.
