it has been 3 monthsabout 3 months ago, summer vacation started

my parents take me on a super expensive vacation to europe because why not

all the time they berate me for my grades, which aren't good at all
then i come back

and oh yeah i have lots of AP work (3 AP subjects) and 30 hours of ACT tutoring every week in addition to ACT practice work every day

i go on social media and see everyone else having fun, going to concerts, smoking and drinking to their heart's content

and here i am, in my house, alone with my thoughts, trying to work

i haven't felt happiness for 3 months. every day is an obstacle. no one wants to be around me. every night i sneak out of the house to the side of the highway and stare at the cars going by, thinking about what would happen if i walked at them. but i'm always wracked with guilt and walk back home.

i'm a pretty awful person who i'm pretty sure everyone talks about as a total weirdo, so i don't know why i even bother

i went to public school all my life, until high school.

in private school, it's even more vicious because the kids here have been together all their lives and you're just an outsider looking in. i don't have friends. everyone is richer, smarter, more attractive, etc.

i'm ugly, lazy, and unintelligent. i don't contribute anything to anyone's life. and i never get what i want.

i feel selfish and entitled. and i fucking can't take it
