Friends finally letting goOne of the reasons I haven't killed myself is my friend group but as of this year they've started to make plans and do things without me and grow up and move into apartments. They've also stopped talking to me as much or including me in plans.

For some people it would make them sad but for me Im glad. I want the people around me to move on before I'm gone so that way it won't be that big of a deal.

I just need them to text me the "This isn't working out" text and I can check them off. Only folks left are family and Idk how to get them to let me go.
