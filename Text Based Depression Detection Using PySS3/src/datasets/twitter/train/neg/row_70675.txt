Can't continueHey, I don't know why I'm writing this, I think it's going to help me, even if it's not inmy mother language and can't write what I feel like.

I don't really know how to describe it but I can't continue, I have no idea what's the source of this I just know I don't feel like being alive anymore.
I'm really stupid, there is people who is concerned about me however I don't open to them, I try to act like nothing happens to me.
I hate myself so much and this affects my daily life, I've been trying to continue my career but I can't, it's just to damn hard to focus if I just keep thinking about killing myself,and this leads to failure and I feel worse and worse on top of it I can't get a job and I feel like the worst person on earth, useless.
