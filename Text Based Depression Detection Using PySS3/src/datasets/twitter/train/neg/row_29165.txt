My animals are my life... Now i have to give them awayI dont know what to do anymore. My animals are everything that I have in life.

 I live with my dad and stepmom and their family. I know they all hate me and have shoved me down into their basement for it. I have raised many rats and currently have 8 in my room, along with a cat, who is my best friend and baby girl. My cat is the reason I am alive - she walked in on me during my first attempt and brushed against me as I was about to do it. She has been here for me and I love her so, so much.

My stepmom is looking to adopt a dog. A stupid, prey driven, high energy dog. I am too stressed to handle a dog, a cat, and 8 rats in my tiny basement and the tiny home I live in.

Im now being forced to get rid of some of my rats. Theyre my best friends so obviously I dont want to do that. Its terrible when you have to get rid of your children to satisfy someone else's needs. I fucking hate living here but I cant move because I dont have a job.

Reading this back before I am posting this, I realize how stupid and worthless I sound. I know i will attempt again if my babies are gone. Theyre my reason to live and I cant imagine life without them. My life is devoted to being with them.

To my rat babies, I love you with all of my heart. Ill see you over the rainbow bridge.
