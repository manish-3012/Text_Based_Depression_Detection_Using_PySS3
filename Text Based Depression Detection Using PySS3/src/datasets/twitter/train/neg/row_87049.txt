Giving myself a week.Hi reddit. I'm just another random loser on the internet bitching about how sad his life is. I've decided to give myself a week. If it doesn't work out for me, I'm done. I'm tired of living like a loser and tired of being ugly. I just need to set a deadline and finally do it. I'm thankful for everything in my life but sadly I don't think I'm worthy of living it. So a week it is. After that I'm gone.
