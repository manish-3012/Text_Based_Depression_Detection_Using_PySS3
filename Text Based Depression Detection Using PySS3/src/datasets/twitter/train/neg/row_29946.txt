I'm tired of fighting to stay aliveIf you look at my post history. You will find my life history fighting with lyme disease and fighting to get my body healed. 

My entire 20s was a fight to get better. It started with hip pain. Then heart issues. I have been to over 20 doctors and none of them could tell me what was going on. The close i came to is lyme disease but after seeing 2 lyme disease specialist and after going years of antibiotic treatment i didnt get better. Two of my rheumatologist couldn't find my issue. So here i am. With a hip pain that i soon wont be able to walk and heart palpitations that get worse every-time. Eventually i will have a heart attack and die. So why keep living? Why keep living if eventually it ends up in the same outcome. Living is not the rational thing to continue doing. 

I'm tired. I'm just tired of fighting to stay alive.
