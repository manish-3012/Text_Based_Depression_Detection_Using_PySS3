I'm killing myself on WednesdayI used to use reddit but haven't for months. I made this new account today though to post this. 

Today was my final straw. My final effort. I reached out one more time to a couple hotlines and organizations desperate for help. The crisis hotline was useless and the woman who I was talking to didnt care. I reached out again to the buddy project and their founder for help. They both blocked me on twitter. 

I'm severely lonely, severely depressed, severely anxious, and severely suicidal. I'm killing myself on Wednesday. I have no one. Over the past 2 and a half years I've reached out to over 100 people for help. This includes therapists, doctors, family members, teachers, and "friends". No one cared. Not one. I'm so hopeless. I can't do this anymore. 

I need friends. That's all I need but no one will be my friend. I've tried everything else. I just need friends. But I'm so worthless and repulsive I'll never make them and I don't blame anyone. 

Good bye. Wednesday is my final day.
