I cannot handle thisI dont know what the fuck is wrong with me. I have two exams tomorrow starting at nine, it is almost midnight and i have barely looked at anything, at all.

I wanted to dedicate my weekend to studying and i ended up with the stomach flu or some shit, literally sitting nauseous and miserable for three days. i cannot afford to fail and i cannot seem to care

i have to get this fucking degree and i cannot do a thing. i do not know where the fuck to turn or how to change myself. fuck. what the hell is wrong with me
