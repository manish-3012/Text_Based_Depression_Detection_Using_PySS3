I just need to rant.I remember having a happy childhood until my dad molested me. At first, he was just "teaching me how to shower." Then, he was "teaching me how to be a wife." When I was about 10-years-old, I learned that food was a nice way to escape. I gained a lot of weight quickly. Eventually my parents took firm control of my food intake. My dad would make me stand naked on a scale in front of a mirror and ask me why I wanted to look like this. I developed a serious eating disorder.

Throughout school I was bullied for my appearance. I am an ugly person. Eventually, I left for college and everything changed. I made friends. I had a social life. Everything started to make sense. But it quickly fell apart. My college was being funded by my parents who randomly decided they didn't want to support me anymore. I couldn't get FAFSA without their tax information, and I couldn't get a private student loan without a cosigner. I had to drop out because I owed thousands of dollars I didn't have.

Long story short, I was a waitress for a while and that led me to heroin and now my life is fucked. I have absolutely no family to contact. I destroyed every single relationship with my friends by being an absolute piece of shit. I am completely alone because of my actions. I think if I were to kill myself right now, it would take a week before anyone found me. I think about that a lot. I don't have any social media accounts, no friends or family I talk to regularly, I just... I don't interact with anyone.

I genuinely wish I was dead. I hate every horrible memory I have. I hate how I have pushed everyone away. I hate how terribly alone I am. I just want to die.
