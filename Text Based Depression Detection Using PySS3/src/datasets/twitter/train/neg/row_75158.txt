Iâ€™m just looking for someone like me who knows how this feels. Help?Iâ€™m done trying. Itâ€™s sad, but Iâ€™m done fighting with myself over this eating disorder. If I canâ€™t be the way I want to be there isnâ€™t any point in â€˜beingâ€™ at all. My parents thought they were helping me get over it but itâ€™s only gotten worse for me mentally because now I canâ€™t control myself. Itâ€™s only been 1 month since this so called â€œrecovery processâ€ and Iâ€™ve gained 9 pounds. Iâ€™m a disgusting, worthless pig. I guess why Iâ€™m putting this up here is because Iâ€™m hoping there is somebody else like me in a similar situation that I can talk to.. I took 20 tablets of Advil and Benadryl a few minutes ago after doing research on the side effects of what an overdose is and what it can do to you and I havenâ€™t taken enough for it too kill me but Iâ€™m seriously considering adding onto that number to guarantee some significant damage to myself.
