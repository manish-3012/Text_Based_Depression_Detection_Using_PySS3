I really hope it works. Iâ€™m scared it wonâ€™tIâ€™ve ordered some items that are supposedly toxic if swallowed and empty capsules to put them in so I donâ€™t taste them. Iâ€™ve been toying with the idea of calling the emergency number for the police or the non emergency before I do it so if it works my body doesnâ€™t lie in an empty apartment for weeks . I donâ€™t know if I will. I have a CPN and that is all Iâ€™m offered under nhs even though Iâ€™ve asked for crisis management with home team or hospital. I give up. The items are coming tomorrow. I wonder what will happen. Iâ€™ve written out care guides for my pets and numbers for people to tell when I die. Iâ€™ve got 500 quid in an envelope too so if my Family need cash for transporting furniture or pet care or food etc itâ€™s available. I need to complete my letter with the passwords to things they might need. Iâ€™m sad but I feel Iâ€™m treating this very practically
