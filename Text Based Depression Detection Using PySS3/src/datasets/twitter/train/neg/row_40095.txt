I know how, but not whenMy life, has fallen to shit. 
I have an abusive step-mother who controls more of my life than my father. She took my father and sister, and moved thousands of miles away from me, just so he could live by her mommy. 
My best fried. I'm in love with him, but nothing can be done there... He lives my other friend... The other friend hates him because of ME. 
Nothing brings joy to my day anymore. Not playing my saxophone. Not listening to my favorite bands. Not even the giggle of an innocent, 3 year old girl can bring a smile to my face anymore. 
This is just a very small insight of my list of reasons of self hatred. 
So, I've decided;
My best choice, is death. 
It will relieve the world of one more awful soul. It will leave more oxygen for the people who will actually do things with their lives. This is just.. The best option for me. 
I've struggled with depression for years. Going to therapy. Taking meds everyday. Nothing works. 
I'm hopeless. 
I'll pop pills.. Many pills. Then while that's taking effect, I'll slash, and gash  at my wrist. I can't fail. 
I'll have written all my close friends their own specific note, so they know how much they mean to me. 
Then I'll truly be free. 
I'll have completed, what seems to be, my only escape. 

Thanks for reading &lt;3
