I can't stop thinking about how I could hang myself.I've been in a mental hospital for suicidal thoughts, and I was so traumatized that I refuse to have anything to do with them.

I'd rather die than be subjected to it again.

I can't tell anyone how I truly feel because they'll lock me up.

I'm going to end it soon.
