Childhood abuse making me suicidal again..I was molested by two family members growing up along with extensive physical and mental abuse... I was homeschooled for highschool (online school, my parents didn't do shit) and after I moved away and went to college I was raped... My entire life my family projected me as some kind of object they could use.. I was only in online school to care for my little brother while my mom worked... After the first time I was molested and confided in my older male family member that I wished I never would have told anyone, and that I'd never tell anyone if something like that happened to me again, he molested me and tried to rape me a few years later... I feel like I trapped myself with that one. My mom found out about that last year, and still put the Blame on me. I was 15. I have tried my best to move on and forgive and forget.. But today someone said something to me that triggered all the thoughts. Memories, regret, fear and pain... I want to hurt myself so badly..  I used to cut and burn.. I have tried to kill myself before... Everything in life is already so fucked up right now I really just feel like leaping from a building... I have a kid, so I'm trying not to be selfish or overreact... But I have no one to talk to. God please help me...
