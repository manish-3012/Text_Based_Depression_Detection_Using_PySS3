Maybe a stupid questionIs it possible I'm not actually suicide but am just toying with suicidal thoughts as a form of self pity? Sort of licking the wounds. Like, I think if I were to go, I'd chose opiate overdose. Seems most peaceful. But at the back of it all I don't really want to die. I'm just sick of my life and don't see it getting better. Are my suicidal thoughts genuine? Should I be concerned. It doesn't feel much like I should yet. It's hard to judge though. I'm in therapy. Trying to work through a lot of stuff. But the lonliness is unbearable. I hate my life. Am also sick of trying to fix it. Putting in loads of effort and getting nowhere. Sometimes it feels like suicide is just destiny
