Tried AgainTried to bring myself happiness by making art. Had a stressful exam today and I tried to end with making a drawing. I didnâ€™t work out and I feel worse than I did before. I fucking hate my life so much. No matter what I do, I end the day wanting to hang myself. I canâ€™t even commit suicide in this house. There is nothing here for me. The people around me only remind me of hanging myself. I wish there was somewhere to escape to but thereâ€™s nothing. I am trapped. I just wanted to vent. I donâ€™t even think Iâ€™m looking for anything at this point. I just want to let go.
