why am i to do(rant)i had, or probably still have a girlfriend. I dont know, I havent seen her for quite a while and I don't love her anymore. I have a friend. Sometimes, cause we both suffer from depression, we create our own suicide stories, but that's just hyperventilating, I wouldn't ever let her do that if I had even a smallest chance of stopping her. 

not sure bout myself though. i feel like i have no future. all i live for(in terms of "career" or something like that) is music. im studying a middle school(technically it's a high school but that's just the way the scholarship in my country works)in a technical field, but that's just I didn't think I'd live to this day. I hate everyday of it, yet im somehow able to be kinda..happy or something like that. But even when im happy, when im sad, in states of euphoria or anything..there's always that little "voice" 'I might kill myself tonight.' I'm not even scared of it anymore, in fact, I can't imagine a life without depression or suicidal thoughts. I play guitar, keyboard, sing..or at least try to..it helps me with dealing with all these 'problems'. Like I have any. I used to have some, mother was in jail(or prison? idk what the "better" one) and in rehab few years ago. That may be one of the reasons why i am a little different.

i probably wanted to say more but i dont know where i have ended. And sorry, it's just a mess of words, i just needed to get it out. 

Thanks..and keep on keeping on
