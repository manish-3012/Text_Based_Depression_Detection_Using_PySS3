I dont wont to be afraid anymore (f, 14)I have paranoia and anxiety along with depression. I live every day in fear. I just cant do this anymore. I hate myself so much and I'm always afraid. I feel like I'm being watched. People are taking pictures of me from behind. There is not one moment where I'm not afraid or sad. I've posted on this sub many times but I just cant do it anymore.
