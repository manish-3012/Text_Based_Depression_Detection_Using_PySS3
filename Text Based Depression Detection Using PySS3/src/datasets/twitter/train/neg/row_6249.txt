Killing myself after I post thisHey everyone. I made a throwaway so if I do survive I donâ€™t have to live with the shame of seeing this in my post history. I had no one to say goodbye to so Iâ€™m saying goodbye to a bunch of strangers. Like a weirdo.
Iâ€™m 16, and I know people might think I still have time to turn my life around, Iâ€™ve heard it all by now. Therapy, pills, friends, psych wards, whatever the fuck you name, Iâ€™ve tried it. Itâ€™s all bullshit. Life is bullshit. I have been abused at home since I was 3 years old by an alcoholic mother, who is now using my little brother as a second chance at â€œraising someone who isnâ€™t a worthless eyesoreâ€. I canâ€™t bear to look at her putting all her hope of raising someone whoâ€™s not gonna waste away in a filthy room for weeks while not speaking and staring at a wall into such a young child. People think itâ€™s jealousy, itâ€™s not. I know sheâ€™s going to crush all his hopes and dreams when he grows up, and I canâ€™t bear to wait to see it happen like it did to me.
I used to have dreams once. I wanted to be an artist. Cliche as fuck, but it was my dream and I was set on it. Everyone hadnâ€™t my back except for the one person who I needed the most. She pushed me aside for cocaine and vodka. She burned all my art when I was 8 and beat me until I said I wanted to be a lawyer or doctor, forgot which one. I had 5 broken ribs and she had dislocated most of my right half in the process of throwing me around like a rag doll ( I still have issues with joints dislocating to this day). My nose broke and she almost blinded me with glass from a bottle, so yeah, that dream was crushed. At age 9, I was made to cook and clean for myself. She didnâ€™t lift a finger to help me while I scalded my whole lower half with a pot of boiling water, instead laughing at me and blaming me in the ER after the neighbors called the police due to my screaming and crying. I still have scars from that which I get bullied for. I never had a single friend in school, I was the quiet, poor kid who always smelled weird and cried all day. 
At age 12, I fell in with the wrong crowd and Iâ€™m still addicted to cigarettes, which is tame compared to other shit I did back then. I was raped by 6 people in the space of an hour, and since then I have not had a period (no Iâ€™m not pregnant). I gave up on school and I just sit there blankly all day or just donâ€™t show up, for which my mother beats me, and even my therapist gave up on me and cancels every appointment we have last minute.
Now Iâ€™m sitting on my bed after taking around 6 bottles of sleeping pills (I stocked up, yay), waiting for them to kick in and typing this. No one is going to miss me. Not a single person. I didnâ€™t leave a note. Thereâ€™s no point since my mother will throw it away when she finds me. Hopefully hell doesnâ€™t exist since Iâ€™m definitely gonna end up there if it does. 
I had a good run. Thanks for reading everyone.
