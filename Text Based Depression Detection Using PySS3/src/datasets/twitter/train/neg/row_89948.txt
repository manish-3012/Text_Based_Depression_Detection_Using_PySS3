How do I live?23 asian male. I'm unemployed, have no employable skills, have 1k in the bank, and have aspergers. And I don't think any of my family or friends respect me. I've spent most of my life socially isolated because of extreme social anxiety. But after having a panic attack on weed last year, I've felt numb and depersonalized. My emotions are starting to come back and I think theres a chance I might kill myself. Please tell me there is hope in my situation.
