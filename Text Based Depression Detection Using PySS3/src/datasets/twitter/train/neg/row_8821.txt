I need help for one of my best friends.I have a very close friend who has helped me throughout the years to cope with cutting problems and just overall wellness. She has the same problems, but they keep getting worse. I've tried helping her, she talks to me whenever she has the urge, and I stay up all night to try to comfort her. Her mom knows she's suicidal and refuses to take her to a therapist or get any kind of help whatsoever, she has no other family members that will take her seriously either. I don't live around her so I can't really be there 24/7, and I'm worried that I'm not gonna be able to respond quick enough and one day she'll snap and go through with it. I love her and she's helped me so much with that I've had to deal with and I don't want to let her do this to herself, but I don't know what to do. How can I get her help? It's obvious just talking isn't gonna do the trick. 

TL;DR: Very suicidal friend, don't know what to do.
