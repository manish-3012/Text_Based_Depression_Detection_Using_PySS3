relationships suck assi just want to talk to someone. idc what about anymore, i just hate thinking about my ex, i try to think about other things, but she just...she made me believe that i loved her. and i really fuckin did! but she decided it would be a good idea to fucking lie to me the entire time we were in the relationship, she lied to me telling me she loved me for 6 FUCKING MONTHS! who the fuck does that?! iâ€™m not a bad guy, this was my first relationship, and boy was a shitty one to be my first. sorry, guess i just needed to rant.
