It seems I've lost my battle.I recently made a post explaining my inner struggle between wanting to live and wanting to die. I've tried so hard to work against the suicidal part of myself, but it goes right through my defences. No matter how much I think about wanting to live or wanting to do things. The suicidal part just presses on.

Now I'm at the point where I can't honestly say that the suicidal part is the "wrong part" or the "enemy". I've come to terms with it. Dying is not scary anymore. Life is not valuable anymore.

It's like it's against my will, but in so much control that I can't fight it. The things I want in life, is just a dream, its not a certainty. What is certain is that I'm all out of strength. I'm exhausted. And nothing gives me new strength, I've tried and I've been waiting for something to lift me up.

I know what the suicidal part plans. Christmas eve is the deadline. I dont know how, or if it happens earlier. But I know that that is the will of the suicidal part of me. The other side, the "real me", still dont want to die, but at the same time cant be bothered with the suicidal part, not anymore.

But I am posting this, so the "real me" aint all lost just yet I suppose. Cause if I dont post now, maybe the suicidal part just takes over all of me and then I wouldnt post at all. How the hell do you beat this deep dark suicidal depression?
