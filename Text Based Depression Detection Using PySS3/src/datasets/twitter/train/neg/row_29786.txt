I want to keep myself from commiting suicideAnd I feel like cutting deeper than before might help with that. But I can't really do it. It's too exhausting with the knife I was using before, but now that I tried switching to razor blades ... I can't do it. Self-preservation stops me from hurting myself like that. But I really, really need to. I want to hurt myself, want the permanent damage done to me. Want to do it once, because I know after doing it once I can do it easier from then on.

I already prepared everything in case I can't do it, I got all the pills and the alcohol there for a nice overdose.

Any tips to overcome this really frustrating and basically fucking irrational fear?
