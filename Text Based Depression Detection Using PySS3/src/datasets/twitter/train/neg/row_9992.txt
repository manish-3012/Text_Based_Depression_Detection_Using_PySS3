PayPal balance suspended from a scam, havenâ€™t eaten in a while, things going bad.I ran a business, it doesnâ€™t matter which, I was scammed by a big client of mine and won the cases but they kept reopening them till my balance was frozen. I donâ€™t want to write much as I never thought this would happen to me and it just feels surreal. I havenâ€™t eaten in a while, I canâ€™t cover the negative balance of -200Â£ or so and have 40Â£ cash left. I try to reason with PayPal but they take a week to do anything every time. Iâ€™m thinking I could try work for food, I donâ€™t know, everything has been going against me and I just donâ€™t want to live anymore. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll kill my self but Iâ€™m having the thoughts run through my mind.
