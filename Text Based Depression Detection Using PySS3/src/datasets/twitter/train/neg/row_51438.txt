Who's being selfish?I've been fighting chronic suicidal ideation all my life. One of the most difficult interactions I have is when someone tells me that I cannot ever kill myself, for the simple reason that it is the selfish way out. My understanding is that they believe that suicide is selfish choice because it releases me of pain, while inflicting it on others.   *But what about their choice*?  

Let's assume for a moment that suicide *is* a selfish choice, because you're choosing to prevent your own pain while inflicting it on someone else. That is to say, I don't want to suffer my life, so you must suffer my death. 

Now, what happens when someone says "you can't kill yourself, it would hurt me."  Isn't that the exact same thing, to say that you must suffer your life to prevent me from suffering your death. 

Is one more or less selfish than the other? 

Do they cancel each other out? 

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
