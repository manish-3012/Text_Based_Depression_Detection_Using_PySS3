Confessions because I can't go onI'm sitting alone in a bathroom in the dark on the floor and just bawling

I have childhood guilt (sexual exploring when I was a kid) with a sibling, I was groomed online from an early age and uploaded explicit pictures online and sold nudes when I was 13-14.
I got beaten up when I was 14 in the suburbs and im now traumatised.
I lost my virginity when I was 14 to someone I don't know and have had sex with more people than I wanted to. 
I got blackmailed and pressured in to taking sexual videos for a hacker when I was 14.
My family is dysfunctional, I'm not well off, I have no future, my body is ruined from being overweight, I can't control food, my mother is an alcoholic, this world wants me dead.
I have nothing good in this life and at the moment there's nothing stopping me from slitting my wrists
I'm dirty
And ruined and I want to die I don't want this anymore
