Thought I was transgender but deciding not to transition even though I still have dysphoriaI was on testosterone I miss boys crushing on me and kissing me at parties and liking me. Some dudes off tinder like me but I miss the days when I was approached at parties and when I was crushed on and liked. I miss my fucking ex who broke up with me over me being transgender even though I've come off hormones and come to the conclusion I'm not. My voice isn't masculine it stayed femme, but my face is a lot more masculine. I still want a hysterectomy and the main reason I even ever went on hormones was to stop periods. I guess I could try birth control theres so many side effects I just dont wanna go through it. I hate that the world is this way that women were made so harshly and to be bleeding messes and men forced into toxic masculinity and barred off from social events (only girls get let into parties at my school I got let in though even on testosterone) im just sad and sick and tired and theres no real option for me. I've thought of wearing makeup again to be attractive but idk everyone sorta reminds me being a masculine sort of guy type. I'm just sick of everything :(
