Iâ€™m ready to end my life and it feels greatI think 17 years is good enough for me. Why continue living when i know that homophobes and religion whackjobs are just gonna make things horrible my whole life. 

I dont even like the â€œgay communityâ€. Luckily itâ€™s really easy to buy a gun in the country i live. 

My family and friends will get over it eventually. I just cost them extra expense anyways. 

Goodbye to everyone on October 25th
