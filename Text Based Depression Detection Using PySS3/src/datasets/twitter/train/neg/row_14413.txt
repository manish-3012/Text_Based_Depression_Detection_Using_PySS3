I am 20 years old male but never had a relationshipYou can't say its no big deal but for me it is. I never had a gf in my whole life. For others it is a normal part of life. Whenever I see a girl I feel suicidal because I know I will die alone and I am 20 yo witout relationships I missed so many beauty in life.
