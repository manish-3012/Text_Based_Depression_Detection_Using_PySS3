I feel so relaxed when I hurt myself.I feel relaxed and sleepy when I cut myself. All the pain goes away. I slowly fall asleep afterwards and its the most relaxing thing. I cry when or after I do it which makes me more tired. I bet death is far more relaxing. It would be so great if I could have a slow and painless death. The thought of dying makes me really happy. When I'm awake I feel worthless, but when I hurt myself I feel like I'm actually accomplishing something.  I've been kind of worried though because all I can think of is death. I have a family that I think loves me, but I find it very hard to be happy. I don't know what to do.
