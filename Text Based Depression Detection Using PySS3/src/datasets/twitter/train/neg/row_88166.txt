UnsureHi. Uh, I've never done this before and I'm kinda unsure on what to put down. I'm a 19 year old female. I've had depression for about 10 years or so and I've tried to commit suicide about 6 or so times. I live in a house with some friends. I guess this is where I should open up with things right? For about the last year or so I've been thinking about suicide almost daily. And I admit there are days I can conquer it but I just don't see why that much anymore. I firmly believe that the people I love would be happier without me. I know for a fact they care, I just can't get it through my head. I have a boyfriend and all I can ever think about when I look at him is "How much happier will he be when I'm gone? How much am I holding him back? Why am I being so selfish and keeping him when he probably would be happier with someone else?" ect. And while I can fight off depression and suicidal thoughts, I just want to give in. I want them to be happy. I'm tired of fighting and trying to act like shit didn't happen in my life. I know life is supposed to have loss in it, but some things that I have run into I think are just ridiculous. I'm scared and sad every night when I go to bed because I know I'm alone. I know in the darkness there my depression will come to be and try to persuade me to commit suicide. I can't really block it out anymore. All of my housemates know I'm suicidal, but I can't really have a talk like this with any of them. It adds so much stress on their lives and I'm really not worth it. A lot of the things that are making me hold on and the same reasons I want to die. Every night for the last week or so I've been holding back from just grabbing one of the knives and ending it then and there. I just...I just feel so useless and unloved and unwanted. Even though I know its not true, it is drilled into my head. I guess I don't know where to go from here. Hell I don't even know if any of you can help or what I'm even expecting from this.
