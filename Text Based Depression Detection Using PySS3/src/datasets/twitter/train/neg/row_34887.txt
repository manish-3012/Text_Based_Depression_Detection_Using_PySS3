HelpIâ€™m gonna have to do it. I have to go to work tomorrow night. I canâ€™t do it. I wonâ€™t go. Itâ€™s destroying me. Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m having panic attacks for the entire time Iâ€™m working. Thatâ€™s 8 hours multiple times a week. Itâ€™s rapidly destroying me. My chest hurts everyday. I need help ASAP. I canâ€™t work. Iâ€™m not able to. I canâ€™t. I literally canâ€™t. I need more help. The meds donâ€™t work like the used to. Iâ€™ve been through hell. I need actual help. But I wonâ€™t get it. Iâ€™ll have to keep going to work and ruin my heath until I kill myself. Iâ€™ve been going manic again. Just like I used to when I was in school. I couldnâ€™t handle it. Too many people. I will have to do it by tomorrow night. I really donâ€™t wanna die. But the pain wonâ€™t stop. :(   Can anyone hear me?? I canâ€™t do this anymore. I have to quit work. Someone guide me through this. Fuck. If I end up dead Iâ€™m sorry. I wanted to become more than this. But nothing is enjoyable anymore. Iâ€™m pretty sure I have brain damage from the constant panic attacks and stress. Iâ€™m nothing now. I donâ€™t feel like me. What can I do at this point. I canâ€™t work. How will I make money. If I donâ€™t find a solution but tomorrow night then Iâ€™m gone.
