Bullshit's daily note.Left earlier from a reunion with friends because was not felling so into it. My friends might think Im an asshole and they are probably right. I just can't stand certain people and feel repulsed by them. It's been quite a while I've been feeling like I don't belong in this world and the last couple of days have been architecting my suicide. I don't say this to incentive any kind of support on this idea.. I just feel completely lost and without hope. As an autistic and bad looking guy I don't feel like I'll ever connect deeply to people. Does anyone else here feel different from people? How do you guys handle that?

Ps.: I don't fell intellectually superior to anyone. I just can't stand the fact the I have to be more friendly to people than people have to be with me because of my hideous looking.
