I joke about suicide all the time, but I actually want to do it.For the past little while I always make little jokes here and there about how I'm just going to end it all.  I know it makes people uncomfortable, and they do a little half-chuckle where they think I'm just playing around but the subject matter still bothers them.

Thing is I'm not actually joking.  I've wanted to die for a while and literally the only reason I haven't done it is the thought of leaving my GF and parents with the aftermath horrifies me.

I just don't know how much I have left in me.  I think if I did do it I'd rather find a way to do it in a secluded area where I just disappear one day without a word to anyone.  I don't want to be remembered or mourned, I just want to be forgotten about.
