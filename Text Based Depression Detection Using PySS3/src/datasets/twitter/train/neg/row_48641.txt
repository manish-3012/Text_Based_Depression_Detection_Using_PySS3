Suicidal from my mistakesGuilt-based suicidal thoughts are the hardest to deal with me. Because no amount of trying can make the past right. Even if Iâ€™m magically cured of my mental illness &amp; cease those mistakes &amp; inadequacies immediately, I feel Iâ€™ve already done an unforgivable amount of damage. I can hardly take care of myself, much less give all that is necessary &amp; deserved to those relying on me. I want to be better. I just wish the past would be gone or that I could fix the results of my biggest failures.
