I'm not going to survive thisIf this is how life is now I don't want to live it. I've been reduced to a consciousness in a box participating in an economy that's going to fail anyway. I started typing out another post about everything I've struggled with to stay alive so far and then deleted it. Cause it doesn't matter. None of it mattered. All the work I did building the life I wanted for myself swept away. I don't have a family I can be with and despite 10 years of looking I've never had a partner. Not going to find one if this is "the new normal" any how. I'm done. I want to be done with all of this so badly. The game is rigged. I quit.
