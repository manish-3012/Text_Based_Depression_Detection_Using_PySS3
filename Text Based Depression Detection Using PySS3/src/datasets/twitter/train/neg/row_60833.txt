I imagine walking in front of a carI realised that thought have been taking up way too much time lately.
 Like, I don't think I would do it on purpose but whenever I see it in movies or in shows it just looks like a relief (think every anime ever as a good example).

One missstep and BAM, truck to the face. And NO ONE would get mad, they would just go with the "clumsy"-explanation. 
 As I said, I wouldn't do it but just the idea is such a neat one.

And I do have the friends, the shrink the job and a pretty neat life. 
 I'm just really compelling to me to just "accidentally" forget to look up from my phone while crossing a busy street.


 How do others stop themselves? Do you think about this as Well?
