might kill myself, might notNothing I can do seems to be able to help me out of the situation I'm in. I have posted in both r/raisedbynarcissists and r/legaladvice and though both have given me great advice I can't go through with any of it. My mother is emotionally abusive and might be mentally unstable. I can't handle living with her anymore but I can't call CPS in fear she will get worse and maybe even physically abuse me. I can't talk to a school counselor because I can't gather the courage to find out who to ask for help. I can't take any step further because I fear that I will be given the horrible news that what I'm going through legally isn't enough to get me with my father. My father doesn't seem to care about it anymore, he rarely texts me and I haven't seen him in a month. It has been months since I started this need to leave this house and it's only gotten worse. I'm self harming, I'm drinking, and I'm suicidal. The only thing keeping me here is three friends that are hundreds of miles away that I have known for over 5 years. The only reason I'm not self harming is because one of them asked me to promise them I wouldn't do it anymore. I don't know how long I'll be able to last without cutting myself. I can't survive here until I'm an adult. I'm stuck and I'm too much of a pansy to get the courage to ask for help. I don't care about living that much anymore. The only thing keeping me from leaving is my friends and the fear that I will wake up but my body will be completely crippled by a suicide attempt.
I just want to go into a coma for a few years until I'm an adult. I can't stand this anymore.
