How to die painlessly?I've been thinking of suicide for a long time but I was too scared of actually doing it because of the physical pain involved. 

In 2017, i cut my own wrists but i couldn't carry on with it and pathetically enough when the skin started bleeding, I couldn't go on anymore. 

3 years later, all my problems are still there and have only worsened. I keep messing up my relationships (friendships and family) because of my depression and even though my closest friends initially showed support, they said they couldn't deal with me anymore. I lost my closest friend due to this just 2 months ago. My parents aren't in good terms and they fail to understand what I'm going through and to tell them I'm actually suicidal would make them extremely mad. 

Once I had a panic attack in front of them and my dad said if I didn't calm down immediately, he would commit suicide and I would be held responsible for his death. He was drunk during this and he is an alcoholic and occasionally fights with my mom to the point that the police had to be called upon last year 2 days before Christmas due to a fight where he tried to strangle my mom. 

Anyway I can't deal with all this anymore. I'm looking for a painless way of dying because the pain is the only thing preventing me from carrying out with my plans. But if there are really no ways of doing it without physical pain, I will try hanging myself and cutting my wrists again. Anyhow I've already made up my mind, I'll be doing it before the end of the year. Until then, I just want to find a painless way out of it.
