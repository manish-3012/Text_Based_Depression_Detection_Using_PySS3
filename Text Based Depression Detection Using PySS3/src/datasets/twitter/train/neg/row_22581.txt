Goodbye letters.I might start writing letters for everybody that I still care about soon. I have a special notebook and my favorite pen ready to go. I feel bad that I might leave behind those who still care about me but honestly I'm tired. I'm not as strong as anybody thinks I am or wants me to be. There's only one opinion that mattered and that person wants nothing to do with me anymore. I'm seeing my therapist soon and telling her that I believe I should go on medication. That'll be my final try at turning my life around for the better. But if the meds don't work then I think that's it for me and I want to have all my final goodbyes in order. Thanks for reading. I like to get things off my chest.
