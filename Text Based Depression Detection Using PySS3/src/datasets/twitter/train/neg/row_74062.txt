I'm all alone and I can't take it anymore.I've been posting a lot here lately because I don't really have an outlet for this type of stuff. I haven't been hugged in months, haven't had my hand held in years, and I am unable to make and meet a friend/partner that's worth a damn even before the pandemic.

I just want someone to make me feel less alone or I'll join those living amongst the stars. I don't want to face this confusing world all alone anymore.
