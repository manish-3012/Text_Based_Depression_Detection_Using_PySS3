Probably gonna swallow the pills soonI don't really know what to say. I feel like I should go to the hospital but I don't feel like I should unless I actually hurt myself. It's silly you know? People go to suicide wards for attempts, not for saying they're suicidal. But this is not the point. 


I feel like I have no reason to live. I want to see what death is like. I feel so bad these days that I can't even look forward to the things I used to. I'm transgender and face harassment constantly. My fiancÃ© doesn't approve of me being polysexual because I figured out that I was in the middle of the relationship, he is insisting on keeping the relationship monogamous. I used to tell myself that if I ever felt like death was the only option that I would run away and enjoy myself by camping forever. I don't even see a purpose to that now either. I'm only a few days from graduating high school and I don't even care. I am supposed to move to asheville with my fiancÃ© and attend college. I was so excited and now I just feel trapped and like there isn't even a purpose any more.


 I think I'm gonna take all of my meds (lamictal, Zoloft, and seroquil) and see if that works. I think while I fall asleep forever that I will listen to the unicorns "who will cut our hair when we're gone?" Album. I don't know why I'm posting here. I don't know what else to do. I can't tell anyone else.
