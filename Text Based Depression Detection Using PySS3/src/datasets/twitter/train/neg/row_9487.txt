I just want to erase my emotions and end it allI hate my emotions and my self I just want to sleep and never wake up, Iâ€™m useless I got no purpose In my life im already failing school and I probably wonâ€™t get a degree in college cause I canâ€™t pay attention, and my brother is better then me he got great friends he not toxic like me and he more care about then me, he gots more interesting stories to tell us about how good at a lot of stuff, and I donâ€™t got anything to tell because Iâ€™m sure my parents would not understand what I know. And Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m going to live in the streets cause Iâ€™m probably going to fail ever driving test and I am bad at counting money, while brother is going to have a better life then me, and I suppress my emotions cause I know if I tell my parents how I feel rather they say that Iâ€™m being ungrateful or that Iâ€™m just sad or there just going to forget it like it normal , so I donâ€™t cry and I fake my emotions in public.cause that the only good thing I am good at
