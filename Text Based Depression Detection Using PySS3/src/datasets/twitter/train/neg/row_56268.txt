Why can't I make myself get help?TL;DR: I'm starting to make plans to kill myself and I know I should get professional help, so what's stopping me?

I've struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 9 or 10, but it just keeps getting worse. Objectively my life is great, so any time I try to talk to my friends about it I'm just so ashamed. I should be able to make this stop. 

I'm a very high achieving kind of person, so it's hard to relate to a lot of the posts around here. I just feel so empty. But I'm trying. I want to say I'm doing what I love, but at this point I've been faced with anhedonia for so long that I honestly could not tell you what I enjoy. Any time I manage to talk about it the advice is "Get a hobby or just go do something fun" but how can I get a new hobby if I have no interest in or enjoyment from the ones I have now?

I've always been that friend on the periphery. I theoretically have a lot of friends, but I honestly don't think any of them would really care if I was gone. I've been suicidal for a while (off and on since I was 10, but it's been bad lately) so I started actively pushing these people away (leaving group chats, lashing out, stuff like that) and no one has even said anything. I have an awful relationship with my family, so that's not a factor, and I'm an atheist, so all this talk about how God has plans for me just makes me feel worse about myself.

I've been to counseling a few times and I've tried 3-4 different antidepressants but after a while of nothing working I just stop going to appointments and can't make myself make new ones. 

I don't know that I want to die, but I sure as hell don't want to live, not like this. I started researching suicide methods this week.
