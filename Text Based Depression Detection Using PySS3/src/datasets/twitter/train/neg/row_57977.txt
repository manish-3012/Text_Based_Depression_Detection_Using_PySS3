I honestly should be hospitalized but not for what you think.. well yes but no.I should be hospitalized and have restraints or at least be talking to someone for hours for a while. The reason is I'm on the brink of disaster. I'm so close to committing suicide, and do I have the resources? No, sadly. I wish I did. I really wish I could die tonight and make people feel what I feel. The other reason I should be hospitalized is that I could murder someone in my family or at least attempt at any time too. The hospital wouldn't really help I guess.. but maybe assisted suicide would be possible or they could make me sleep or 3 days. Aw fuck, it all it's whatever my mental health doesn't matter as long as I'm not dead at least that's what I have been validated on over and over. That I don't matter, that I only matter if I give, do something for someone else well fuck it then. KILL ME THEN. I wish so much that my parents had someone else it would have been 100% better. It should have been better if it was honestly just my younger brother. I'm not fixable, able to be helped, and when people try too I just am so stubborn and protect the thing that hurts me maybe cause it's all I know. Maybe all I know is pain, darkness, depression maybe that's it.  


GOD KILL ME PLEASE.

FUCK EVERYTHING!

PLEASE...

Whatever... 

It doesn't matter... 

maybe I should start taking credit and do it myself or kill someone but killing them wouldn't fix it so myself is the only option but the question is which option to take?

  
Hm...

Ps. at this point you may be saying he's psycho, he's insane, or something along those lines. All I have to say to that is maybe and if I truly am.. People and the world brought me there.
