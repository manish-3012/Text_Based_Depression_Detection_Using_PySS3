please read,, can someone help? preferably someone who was in my position please!so not so long ago i tried to overdose for the first time, i was fed up with life and felt like i couldnâ€™t go on. i took around 25 paracetamol, 4 lexepro and some of my fathers vertigo prescribed medication. i was hospitalised for nearly a week as i also needed to see a psychiatrist at some point. ever since i havenâ€™t had much of an appetite and iâ€™m not drinking so much. anyone in my situation have the same effect after? i also cannot take anymore tablets which is understandable. i heard the paracetamol levels were still high in my bloods even after being having done nearly 2 bags on the iv. so i may have had possibly liver damage, i was hazy at the time so didnâ€™t really hear much and just dozed off unintentionally. so considering the large intake of tablets (as iâ€™m still a minor) and possible liver damage, does this explain my loss of appetite and loss of thirst?
