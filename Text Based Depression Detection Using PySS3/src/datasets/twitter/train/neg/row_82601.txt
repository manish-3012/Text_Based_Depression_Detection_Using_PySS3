I can't stop thinking about killing myself.I've had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I've mostly managed to keep them under control.

In the past week they've been too strong. Every time I notice something I could use to kill myself I feel the urge to do it. I have to consciously argue with myself over not doing it.

I'm exhausted, I'm angry, I'm sad. I want to tell someone but I'm afraid of their reaction and I'm tired of having to depend on others for my own mental health. Everyone I know is so much better at living than me and I just want the pain to stop.
