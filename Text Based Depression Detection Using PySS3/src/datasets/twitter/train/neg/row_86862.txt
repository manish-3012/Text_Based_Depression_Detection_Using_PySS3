Told fiancee I would like if the world endedHe did not react well, he asked if I was suicidal and I asked what if I was? He said never say anything like that to his family or they will think I'm not good or worthy of him. Past relationships have taught me not to share these thoughts and feelings, but I thought after 5 years I could start using him more as a support during my more extreme depressive episodes. I asked him if I felt this way a lot if he would want to be with me and he said it's hard enough helping people at work that he didn't think so. He later apologized and said that maybe he didn't react the way he should've, but I don't want to be a burden to him...
