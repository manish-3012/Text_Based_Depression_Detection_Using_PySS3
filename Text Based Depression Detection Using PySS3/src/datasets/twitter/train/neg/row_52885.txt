Iâ€™m seriously considering ending it. But itâ€™s not me Iâ€™m scared for.....I, like most of you suffer from intense anxiety and depression..... 
The silver lining in my life was the relationship with my partner of 7 years. She kept me level and sane through a lot of it.
But, today she decided she canâ€™t do it anymore and has left me. 
I have a network of friends and family but, I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m fucking exhausted, Iâ€™m nearly 30, stressed and now alone. Everything I think about her my heart just about explodes out of my body.
I think I could easily kill myself, but i worry about the people I leave behind.
I feel like a weak piece of shit but, Iâ€™m fucking exhausted. What do i do. Please tell me if you get what Iâ€™m saying.
