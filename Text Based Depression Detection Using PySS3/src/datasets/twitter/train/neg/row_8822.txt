I made a sub for all of us.This is our new second home, https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatchCommunity?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Suicidewatch community. 
I live and love this sub. I come on here everysingle day to support and love, and to know I don't face this alone and even when I'm completely alone, I can come on here at any time and feel completely surrounded. But I still lack friends and family around me that understand. 
It's hard as hell finding connections and friends these days, especially when were hinderd and attacked constantly by darkness. Well this sub is made for and only for the people of SuicideWatch , and for all of us to come together for support, activities, social, and friendships and connections. This is a new sub and if you're interested, please join and get this started just how this beautiful sub started.
