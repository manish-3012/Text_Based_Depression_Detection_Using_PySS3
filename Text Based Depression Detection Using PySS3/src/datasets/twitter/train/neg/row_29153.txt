Am I really going to help my chronically depressed and suicidal friend if I give them weed? Is seeing a psychologist really going to help?My friend is severely depressed, has anxiety and panic attacks. Often thinks about suicide, talks about plans but hasn't actioned or attempted. I don't have weed but do know a seller, and it's also illegal in my country.

I've suggested many times to see a psychologist which *M* says yes but says no when *M* feel slightly better. *M* also drinks to ease anxiety or to deal with how *M*  feels on some nights, frequency depends on how they're feeling that week. Could be 1-2 a week or once every 2 weeks (which I guess is fine, except for the fact that they're using it to cope).

*M* says it makes them feel more relaxed and just changes their thought temporarily. *M*  has asked (begged and pleaded) me on many occasions for this guy's  contact and every time I've said no because I feel extremely  uncomfortable about it. It's always caused issues. Personally I feel  like it's not a good way to cope, and that it's a way for *M* to put this problem to aside everything goes bad again.

Today *M*  just had a severe anxiety/panic attack on something very little, and  later asked me again. I said no, but in the end, I was willing to  compromise if *M* would just book a  psychologist and I would give the contact number. I was told I was a  useless person. I don't know what's best for *M* because I'm not them, I'm selfish and mild uncomfortable feeling and slight inconvenience trumps how *M* is feeling, I'm just saying no because I enjoy feeling like I am above *M* and love the drama.

**Am I really going to help** ***M*** **by helping them get weed?** Is seeing a psychologist really going to help? My friend insists that  it's a load of crap that no-one can change how you think. I have never  tried weed before nor have I ever been chronically depressed and live with anxiety. I am trying to do what I think is best but I'm at a  complete lost. I don't know what to do
