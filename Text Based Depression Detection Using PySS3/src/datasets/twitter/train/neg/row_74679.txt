i think iâ€™ve finally reached the endmy life has been going downhill since October,  i was hospitalized because of an ex who hurt me so bad mentally and physically my liver and kidneys were failing. My mom doesnâ€™t care she wonâ€™t get me any kind of help, she told me she doesnâ€™t want to deal with it anymore. My new boyfriend might be moving countries and just after i thought i found someone normal he might be moving away. He told me he wants to break up sooner than later incase he does move but i donâ€™t think i can handle it at this point. Iâ€™ve lost all my friends and iâ€™m failing all my classes in school my mom told me i should just drop out at this point. No one cares and if i do talk about anything no one takes me serious. I just want to die already i have zero strength left in me i hope i just never wake up again
