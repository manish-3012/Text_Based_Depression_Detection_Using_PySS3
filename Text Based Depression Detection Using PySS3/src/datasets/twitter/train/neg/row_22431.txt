Today I found out I was moving back.Iâ€™m 16, and moved across the U.S. cuz of my dads job. I was absolutely devastated to leave my home town. I was so sad and angry leading up to the move. After I moved I began to get many friends but I began to love the connection I had with my family. After a while I got a girlfriend and sheâ€™s still my girlfriend now. But later in my school year I began to feel really lonely as school came to an end and summer started, because my girlfriend would be visiting her grandmother in England and I would visiting my hometown LA again to see friends and family. It turns out as a couple of days pass of me being in LA, my parents tell me I have to move here. A year before the move, my parents really encouraged me to go to a different school than my friends and so I did it for them, and my first year in high school was a joke. It was awful, and thatâ€™s when I started resenting my parents. The move just made it worse. And then the fact that theyâ€™re making me move back because it didnâ€™t work out, and in return making me break up with my girlfriend who Iâ€™ve been dating for 8 months????!!! My mom and I talked about it last night, and it made me feel a lot better. But now I can barely sleep. I can barely do anything without getting sad, and I feel so guilty for telling this to my mom last night but I said, â€œI wanna kill myself so badly!â€ And itâ€™s not anything new. Iâ€™ve had that a handful of times recently and starting 3 years ago. But the most hurtful part about it is that Iâ€™ll be leaving a girl who truly listens to me and really cares about me. Iâ€™ve just constantly had to reset on everything. After summer Iâ€™ll be in junior year moving into my THIRD high school Iâ€™ve attended. I just canâ€™t sleep anymore, I have so much anxiety and depression that like I canâ€™t even close my eyes without feeling like my body is being threatened in every way.
