In a dark placeI'm in a real dark place right now. I just want the pain to stop, the feeling of hopelessness to go away. I feel like my world is falling apart and I can't stop it. Yesterday I got into a huge fight with my husband, it was partially my fault but was escalated because he suffers from borderline personality disorder. I took the kids and left. We talked it out and I'm home now but there is still tension. Today, my oldest was acting up and bullying his brothers. I punished him with a spanking and sent him to his room. He looked at me with such venom and told me he hated me. He later came and gave me a hug and said he was sorry but my heart still hurts. I feel like I'm failing my marriage and my children. My best isn't good enough. I have depression and anxiety and I'm trying to cope. I stopped taking my pills because they made my brain feel foggy. I'm sorry I'm rambling. I'm sitting here in bed with a bottle of pills and I just want to go to sleep.
