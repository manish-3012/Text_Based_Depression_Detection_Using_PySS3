Im tired of the lies to myself and to every one elseI am a closeted gay man in Texas. I am so scared about people finding out i am gay that i will do any thing to show i am a regular straight man. I was in the Army for 4 years hiding who i was so I turned to alcohol for help. I have been out  of the army now for a year now and im so tired, tired of drinking my self to sleep, tired of the dreams, tired of not being able to be who i realy am. I wish i could come out to my freinds and family that im gay but i would lose all of them and i couldnt live with out them. Its not worth living any more.
