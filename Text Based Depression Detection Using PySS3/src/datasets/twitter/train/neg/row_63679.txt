Death changes people.I've been posting here a lot recently, telling everyone how I don't care about anyone or anything and I've been spewing out negative shit. I'm still suicidal and I consider that a possibility but I'm feeling different since I came back from my parents today. I'm not even sure if it belongs here, but I want to talk.

My sibling works at a company and she's pretty successful. However, her coworker and mentor whom she was close with recently passed away from cancer. Ever since then, she's become different - she's more emotional, she cried how her coworker didn't even say goodbye and how she didn't notice earlier stages of cancer. She was a wreck, to say the least.

And I realized then. Fuck. If she was that emotional over her coworker (sorry for being egocentric there), how would she react if I killed myself? It's strange - we've always argued throughout our childhood and didn't have the best relationship when we were younger, so having these feelings was unusual.

But still, if death of a close one can fuck a person so much... damn. Like I said, I'm not saying I've given up on the idea of suicide - but still, for the first time recently I actually realized that  I cared, even if a little, about someone else's feelings.
