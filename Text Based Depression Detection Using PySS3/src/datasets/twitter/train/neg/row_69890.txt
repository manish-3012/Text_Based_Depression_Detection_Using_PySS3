Nothing worksI unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide in 2010. Over the past 2 months, I have been pulled into a deep, dark hell. My girlfriend recently left me because of this, because I was a shell of the person I was. I don't know who I am anymore, the medication may be making it worse. I just can't take it anymore. This isn't about her, this is about the constant bad decisions and self sabotaging/torture I do to myself. I just don't see the point anymore, there's nothing TO be happy about. I have no friends, and my family is too wrapped up in themselves. I have no one to turn to, I am in therapy but once a week only does so much. I just want my old self back, but I don't think I can.
