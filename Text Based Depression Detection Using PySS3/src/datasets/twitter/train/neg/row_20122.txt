Can someone please offer a chat service for suicidal people? I'm not coping at all.I'm in Australia and the lifeline chat doesn't work,I can't get the button to show up.I'm suicidal,I've been thinking about it everyday non stop.I just need help,

I came off a psyche med I was on for two weeks,I didn't taper properly and ended up with brain damage. I suddenly have no reaction to food it's like looking at a rock I can't sense it's taste or anything,or get any reaction to most things I think it's called anhedonia.But I cant feel what things evoke.This has devestated me completely because I was a really passionate person interested in books,ballet,every beautiful thing I had so many interests now they don't affect me.

I became very suicidal about it,but decided to go on,to continue living.But then Saturday I had some caffeine something I never ever do,I haven't had it for three years and I stopped being able to have deep sleep (I have serious sleeping issues).

as soon as I had I knew it had done something terrible,because three years ago I was having deep sleep (rare for me) I had a coffee and suddenly my deep sleep stopped and didn't come back for years.Well the same thing happened Saturday and now when I wake it's like I was half awake all night,i can't get deep sleep and desperately need real rest.This has destroyed me as I feel without restoring deep sleep my brain won't heal and so I feel no hope at all now.I can't see any way out.

My mental state will decline with this kind of no real sleep.

Can anyone offer me any hope,advice or anything?
