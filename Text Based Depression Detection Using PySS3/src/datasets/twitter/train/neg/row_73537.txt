I didn't ask to be adopted, so why are my parents making me feel guilty about it?I was adopted into a family with a narcissistic mother who is emotionally and verbally abusive. She always tells me that I should be grateful that she adopted me, like it's something that I have to pay back. I didn't ask to be psychically and emotionally abused. I didn't ask to be told that I was worthless to the point where I've internalized these feelings and want to end myself. Why is my mom doing this? Is it just because of the narcissism?
