Academical pressure is pushing my mind into suicidal thoughtsI'm in my early 20s.

A career is depending on my performance on the next exams.
I've failed them partially, perhaps because I was naive and unlucky in some way. 
I have one try on those I've already failed or I'll be kicked out of uni.

I'm very scared. A lot of people, my family especially, are watching me closely. They don't trust me in doing enough for the exams. 
I feel stupid and dumb, even though I already attended a higher level of high school and graduated with good grades. 

I'm falling apart. I have thoughts of suicide everyday because I fear to fail. I feel like I would be nothing if I can't even manage this. Why live, if you think of yourself as a disgusting, disposable failure? An utter disappointment? 

I haven't told anyone, not even my s.o., even though he's a sweetheart and cares very much about me. But he knows so little about worries like this that I feel like he wouldn't understand. 

So thank you for listening. I needed this.
