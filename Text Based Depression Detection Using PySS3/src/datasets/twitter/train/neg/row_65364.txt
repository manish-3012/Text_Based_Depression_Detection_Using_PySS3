I need to believe that things will get better. Iâ€™m desperate for encouragementI suffer from ptsd, severe anxiety, ocd, and chronic migraine. I have so many weird and deeply uncomfortable symptoms all the time that I can hardly function. Every day I think about suicide. The pathetic part is, I have no idea how Iâ€™d do it. I donâ€™t know how to use a gun and Iâ€™m too much of a coward to take a bunch of pills or slit my wrists. The only way I can think of would be to drown myself or suffocate myself or hang myself. My life feels like Iâ€™m living in hell. Iâ€™m so tired of feeling uncomfortable. It makes me sad to think about dying because Iâ€™m only 25 and there is so much I wanna do. But I canâ€™t do anything when I feel like this. Iâ€™d say only 1/7 days are good. And â€œgoodâ€ is a stretch. I have the most loving family and friends. Iâ€™m in therapy and on meds and have amazing doctors all across the board. But Iâ€™m not better. What kind of life is there for me if I canâ€™t be healthy?
