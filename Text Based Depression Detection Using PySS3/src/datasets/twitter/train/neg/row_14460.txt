I have trouble to move on after the 2 times i unconsciously tried to kill myself. Is there someone that is ready to listen to me!!The last times i tried to be a doctor here. I tell you why. I tried to lesson my guilt for having two times brought myself into danger due to my mental illness. I am no longer suicidical and totally fine today but the memories which were gone for a long time returned. They hold me back from moving on. I need help!!! I wish i can turn time back and make it undone ohhhhh gooddd. 

During the 2 times my mind was not in it's right place. It feels like divine intervention by some high power like God saved me. But yeah i just need one person i can tell my story. One who experienced similar and who really cares and understands. Maybe it can help me move on.
