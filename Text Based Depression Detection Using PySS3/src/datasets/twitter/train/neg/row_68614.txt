High School student worried about disappointing my parentsI know this seems really petty but I really don't know what to do. I'm in the IB program at my high school. It's July 5th and my parents will get my report card tomorrow. Now this is really hard because I had promised my parents I would do better after the first semester, where my marks were really disappointing. I know it's my fault for not putting in the effort but I think I also have ADHD, I can barely focus in school or at home, I really don't want to tell my parents that. I really don't know if I want to live through this disappointment, and I honestly feel bad for my parents. They pretty much assumed I was able to go to university (I got into IB afterall) and now that's in jeopardy. My Father told me that if I'm not as successful as him (he makes like 100k a year) I'm a disappointment to him. It's also worsened because my parents had just planned a vacation starting July 7th to congratulate me on finishing my first year of high school.

I fucking dug myself into a hole now by doing nothing but play video games for the past week since I figured that's the last enjoyment I'm going to get.

How do you guys cope with not being able to meet expectations?

Please help me
