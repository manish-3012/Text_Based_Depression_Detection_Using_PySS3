I dont want to kill myself ever for sure nowI used to consider suicide and be really depressed from time to times but today I was watching the news about a 15 year old kid suicided in my country because of bullying and then my 80 year old grandpa comments

"What a fucking retarded idiotic piece of shit must this kid have been to go and suicide , fucking idiot pussy"

Immidietly I got really embarrassed because I thought that this guy could be me someday and I feel to ashamed to even think about it anymore , not a positive experience but it made me completely forget about suicide so that works I guess

I don't even know why I tell you this I guess my life is so miserable I have nothing better to do
