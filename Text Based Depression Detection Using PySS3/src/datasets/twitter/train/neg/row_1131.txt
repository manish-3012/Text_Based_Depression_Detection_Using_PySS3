Finally decidedIâ€™ve finally decided that I am going to ctb. Im 15.  I never intended to live past 24 and I finally think Iâ€™m ready. I recently decided how Iâ€™m going to go. Once I move back with my mom and say my goodbyes Iâ€™m going to do it. People always tell me life gets better but when does it get better? Iâ€™m tired of hearing the same phrases over and over again. Iâ€™m just a burden on everyone. I attempted a few times back in 2019 but clearly none of them have worked. Iâ€™m sort of scared because I donâ€™t have any emotions towards this. Iâ€™m not happy or sad or mad that Iâ€™m finally ok with dying. But anyways Iâ€™m sharing my story because I feel like I want to tell someone but if I actually told anyone theyâ€™d stop me.... if that makes sense ?
