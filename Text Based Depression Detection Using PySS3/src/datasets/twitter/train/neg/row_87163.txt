25, tired, canâ€™t go on anymore.Iâ€™m really tired, each day is the same struggle. 
I have nothing, no qualifications. Only worked a warehouse job 3 years ago and got burnt out after working there for 2.5 years. 
Live with parents still they are now getting old and I feel so bad I canâ€™t help them with at least bills .. Iâ€™m tired of this shit. 

Im constantly having upper back pain and have red rashes which look like dots on my lower legs, constantly worrying itâ€™s some type of cancer. I feel weak and battered and Iâ€™m only 25, canâ€™t even really take care of myself anymore. 

I have the social skills of a kid, got no friends. Just thinking about the future makes me want to just end it now rather than later. 

Iâ€™ve ordered a rope which should arrive soon, Iâ€™m going to the forest close by and the nature will be a nice place to go. 

Iâ€™m tired and have given up, I canâ€™t take this no longer, Iâ€™m too weak and wasnâ€™t made for this place.
