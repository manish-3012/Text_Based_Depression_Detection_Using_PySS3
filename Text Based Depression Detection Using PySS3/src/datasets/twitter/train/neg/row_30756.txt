Long time lurker, first time posting.Not really sure what to say, just need to share. It hurts so fucking badly. Feels like being born with a 50lb weight on your head. I constantly feel like an imposition on others, constantly apologizing just for existing. I lash out at people who make the mistake of getting close and loving me, and it happens without thought. I sabotage relationships, but only in hindsight realize what was going on. Maybe it's because subconsciously, I want those close to me to back off so I can end it without hurting them. I truly feel like I don't deserve love, or life. Even this call for help seems self seeking and obscene. Sometimes I just sit and stare at the wall, ugly crying. It feels like having your chest set on fire. Like you're listening to static on a TV, and somebody is slowly turning up the volume. Just unbearable noise that you can't ignore. Plug your ears if you want, but it's not going away.

Been to a lot of dark places, but for the first time, it's not scary anymore. Don't want to whine, just feel like reaching out is probably the right move? Anyway, thanks for reading.
