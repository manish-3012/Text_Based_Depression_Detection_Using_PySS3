"Think about the reasons you have to live."What are you supposed to do when you realize you have none? Like sure, I still have my mom and sister who would miss me. But that isnt a reason to *live*, all that is to me is a reason to not *die*, and tbh, not a good enough one anymore. Sure, I could keep breathing as I am now just for them, but do they give me the motivation I need to try again for(seemingly) the millionth time to get better? Sorry, but no. Not trying to make a few people sad isnt a reason to wanna keep struggling like this for the rest of my natural life. 

Writing this cause I decided fuck it, why not check the SW resources sister-subreddit to see if there's anything I may have missed. After going through 4-5 of the resource articles on there, all that has done is made me realize that I really do have no reason to wanna live.
