Im poor, soon to be homeless and im so tired of nothing going rightI think the biggest kick in the teeth is being told it is because I am lazy. I work as much as any job has allowed me. Begged for hours. I already have one eviction, caused by health issues which could have been prevented if the shitty doctor didn't misdiagnosed me. I live in a shitty apt with no ac in Texas. Neighboring tenant brought bed bugs and what a joy that had been, oh and the landlord refuses to call pest control so I've wasted money on sprays and shit that didn't even work. Yet another thing I can't afford. I don't need luxury, but it sucks not knowing if i will have enough money for necessities or if I can pay my bills. Everything always goes wrong. If it's 99% guaranteed to work I'll be that 1% it doesn't fucking work for. If there is a God he hates me. I looklike shit. My face is comparable to pizza. Haven't had my haircut in months (I'm female but my split ends are awful to the point of my hair just coming out in the shower ) I guess it doesn't matter even if I could afford skincare and such because I'd still be fucking ugly. I don't remember the last time I felt genuine happiness minus when I drink and forget. My only cope is sleep alcohol and video games. Can't afford therapy, can't afford to live so I may as well just die.
