I'm pissed I can't kill myselfI'm so irritated right now because if I could just kill myself, I'd be fine. But because of some circumstances involving my life and loved ones, killing myself would lead to financial ruin and even worse effects for my family. I'm so god damn angry because I can't do what's best for me without hurting others. I am sick and tired of feeling how I do, pushing my loved ones away, hurting them and etc. All I want to do is fucking be dead already. I fantasize about it all the time and it feels so fucking good but I can't bring myself to do it when I am still depended on. I hate it. I hate being depended on, I hate being me, I hate feeling how I do. I just want to fucking die.
