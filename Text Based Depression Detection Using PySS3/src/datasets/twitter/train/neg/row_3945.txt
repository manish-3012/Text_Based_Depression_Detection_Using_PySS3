my existence is pathetic in every wayI just have no reason to hope things will ever get better.. right now, i'm abroad in seoul, which is quickly becoming a nightmare from a dream scenario because i, a black american, stick out soooo much here and no one, even in places designed to make friends, will talk to me. 

1. i have no real friends, just people who come to me for emotional support or whatever.

2.i have no actual job prospects, thanks to  college irregularities, and idk what i even want to do anymore.. 

3. I lost the only hobby i've ever really loved, ballroom, and i'll never be able to do it again because i have panic attacks just thinking about competing against my ex-partner/girlfriend 

4. Speaking of, i feel like I'll never get over my ex, no matter how hard i try, and that no one will ever really love me.. my family sure doesn't and hell no one else does.. furthermore, my ugly black ass is too unappealing for to even find meaningless shit that would atleast let me know SOMEONE finds me attractive in anyway

At this point i'm just pathetic, and i really feel like i should kill myself before 2020 because it feels like things will only get worse.
