I'm tired.I've been couch surfing and living out of my car for 2 months now. I can't afford to rent anything in my area, even on full time employment. I think I'm going to lose my job soon as well. My car is on it's last legs. I can't afford my medical bills any more. I'm very tired of living like this, and I don't see how I'm going to get out of this. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm at work right now trying not to sob in front of customers. My chest is so heavy. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm only 21. I don't understand why this is happening to me.
