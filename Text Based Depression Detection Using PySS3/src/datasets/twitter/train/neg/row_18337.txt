I Can't Keep Going Like This.My life as I know it is essentially ruined. I feel like I've hit rock bottom a week ago, and at this point I'm only digging deeper and deeper. I am sick and tired of living in absolute isolation. I am sick and tired of not being able to see my friends or family in person. I am absolutely terrified that I am going to be forced to live the rest of my life without ever seeing my friends or family ever again, and that's not a life I want to be apart of. I can't keep going like this, but I have no idea what else to do.
