I know I won't do it but the idea keeps looping in my my mind.Not sure what I'm looking for, but I hate when people spin their problem and somehow make it my fault. The tiniest things upset me now. I haven't had sex in forever. My job blows and my psychiatrist won't change my drugs. The negatives are really starting to out weight positives.  

At first it was just random thoughts of I don't want to be here. Then it changed to thought of getting killed in some kind of accident. Tonight though was the first time I thought of doing it myself though. Again not sure if this even counts for this section but the thought keeps racing in my mind.

I'm 90% sure I won't do it and contacted my psychiatrist but I could use some vague advice or kind word right now. Hell even just another person going through the same shit. I'm so tired. ðŸ˜´
