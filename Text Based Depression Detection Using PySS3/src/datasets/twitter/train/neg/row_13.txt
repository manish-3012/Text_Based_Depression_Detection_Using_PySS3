I am ending my life today, goodbye everyone.I am 36 almost 37, I am on disability for PTSD and Rheumatoid Arthritis. I am 400 lbs and sick of living. I am tired of being single and rejected and made to feel as if I was some kind of monster. I am tired of not having anyone to connect with, to connect too, to have a companionship with. I am tired of being alone and single in this world, all because of my weight. 

This loneliness has taken too much of me, it has swallowed me up from the inside out. It has consumed me. I see nothing but darkness everywhere I look. I see nothing but hate towards me everywhere I look. I have absolutely no one in my life. and this loneliness reminds me of it every day. 

I am done with this world and ending my life today so goodbye everyone, by the time anyone reads this I will be dead.
