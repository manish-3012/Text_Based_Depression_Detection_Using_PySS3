the Thrill of Living is GoneI'm at the point where it seems all my life is trekking through the boring and monotonous. Every now and again i'll get blindsided by something horrible. I don't look foreword to anything anymore;days just seem to blend into a blur of time. I realize I'm depressed the lack of emotion I feel makes that clear to me. I also realize that it's all in my head and I should be strong enough to fight it;But I'm not. What's the point of living a life without joy/happiness/ect? I work two jobs *just to get out of the house:just to get as far away from myself as I can* and go to the gym in hopes that some one could find me attractive enough to give me a chance again. But that's not going to happen. even at 160lbs i'm still just a ball of disgusting lose skin. driving home today i fantasized about driving my car off a highway bridge. now I've spent an hour looking at my pistol trying to find one reason to just not end it. I guess the reason I haven't yet  is because a small part of me believes it can get better. but that part of me gets smaller by the day. Every day I wonder if it will be the day I can't rationalize it anymore. I don't know why I'm posting this,maybe just to talk with people that understand and hopefully get some advice.
