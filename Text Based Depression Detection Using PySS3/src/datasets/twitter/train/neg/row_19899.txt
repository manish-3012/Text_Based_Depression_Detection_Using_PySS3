I'll spend my birthday all alone for the first (and last) timeSo until now I've never been alone on my birthday but I'll be in a few days. My mom and my gf are pretty good friends and they decided to go to an event of their dog breed club which happens to be on my birthday and quite some distance away.

So I'll be all alone in the apartment of me and my gf on this day and I hope this will finally give me the energy to end it all. Most of the time I'm too numb and without energy to finally try and commit suicide and I also had worries that people might not get over my death but now I know that even dogs are more important than me so there is that.
