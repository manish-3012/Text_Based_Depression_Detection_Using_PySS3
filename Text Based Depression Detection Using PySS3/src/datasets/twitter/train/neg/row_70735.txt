I don't even know why I'm posting thisI tried to kill myself a few months ago. The only person that knew was my ex-girlfriend but i pushed her away. I'm completely alone, have constant, awful fucking anxiety and but I thought if I was alone I could focus on myself and getting better. Now all I do sit at home thinking about how I just made it worse. I truly want to die and I dont think I will be around for much longer. 
I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest as I have no one real to talk to.
I think I'm going to do it soon, I just dont know how.
I hate myself so much
