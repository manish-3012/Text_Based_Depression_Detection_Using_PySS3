Need to talkI have been struggling with depression for a long time.  Every time life starts to feel good it is taken away for no reason at all.  The older I get the more exhausted I become and the more frequent the thoughts of ending the pain.  Just hoping to talk, try and cheer up.  I have a wonderful girlfriend, I am partially estranged from my family, and I can always reach out to my Veteran Brothers, but I feel like I am getting to be a burden to them all or they are tired of me.  Just feeling lonely and want to find someone, anyone just to talk to.
