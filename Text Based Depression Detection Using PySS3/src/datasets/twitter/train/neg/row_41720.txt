Happiness and I are not compatible and that is okay.In the course of the last few years I have been on the losing side of a long battle with myself. I believe that all prevention-based efforts have been exhausted for myself and am very calm in my thinking. I am not a happy person and one of the biggest struggles I have found in life is a reason to be happy. I recognized many reason to be happy but none bring that feeling of warmth in your chest when you are happy. This makes me even sadder because I see the many joys of life and cannot mentally grasp them. I have had many of these joys in my own life and still can not comprehend them. That is it. All of the excuses and pain a person faces I will not spew because those are not the root causes of my actions. I am not envious of others. I am not seeking something I do not already have, I am just recognizing I cannot rationalize happiness and somehow that makes my actions better.
