Going Insane. Need to Talk to someone. Help, Please.Reddit, I posted this 10 days ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gpos9/crosspost_from_askreddit_depressed_or_suicidal_or/

I was doing much better over the weekend after, and having a 3 day weekend really helped.

But the thought of going into work again tomorrow is fucking destroying me. I don't know what to do. I just puked a shit ton and DONT WANT to go to work. I can't face my co-workers right now don't know what the fuck to do.

I think I'm having some kind of panic attack right now fuccccckkk.

I got high 2 days ago and basically went into a mental loop of how fucking shitty my life is right now. I don't want to go into work. Right now I just feel like killing myself. Please help I don't know what to do.
