I think Iâ€™m gonna do itThe only reason I havenâ€™t done it already is because I donâ€™t have any rope. Iâ€™m planning on going to a hardware store to buy some while my dadâ€™s not home. I feel so bad that heâ€™ll have to come home to me no longer alive.

Iâ€™ve written my note. I hope that I can get the job done before the end of the week. Thisâ€™ll probably be my last post here.
