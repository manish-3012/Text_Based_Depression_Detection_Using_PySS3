What's the point of living if i have to constantly fight with my mind?For all my life i felt like my mind was my worst enemy. I look back at my life and i realize that i always had a wrong idea of reality and who i am, which always kept me from making the right choices. I always had a negative mentality which followed me my whole life. I think about all the things that i could have done and how different my life could have been if my mind just didn't turn against me.  I'm 21 now and my mental state has reached it's lowest point. I suffer from OCD, intrusive thoughts and delusions. i'm not gonna go into details because i'm really ashamed of what goes inside my head, but basically i can't do anything right because there's always some little thought that crawls into my head and ruins everything. Even when i get my shit figured out something ends up taking over my mind and i go back to where i started, or worse.  I can never keep anything going. I'm taking medication now and still it's getting really hard to go on with my life. Since my life has been an endless loop of this, suicide is something that often crosses my mind, even thought i don't think i would be capable of doing it. I'm wondering if any of you can relate to this.
