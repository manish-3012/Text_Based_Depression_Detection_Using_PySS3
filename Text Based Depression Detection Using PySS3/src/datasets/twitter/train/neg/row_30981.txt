Should i just go die or something like that?I dont See a purpose in living. I am lazy af.
I only lay in bed, sometimes watch an anime while laying in bed and only leave when i have to go to the toilet or to get some food.
I dont want a job, friends, Hobbies, or anything at all. I just Lie in bed and sleep. I cant even get myself to Shower anymore.

I dont enjoy life nor do i really hate it. I just want to lay in bed but it isnt worth to get a job imo.
