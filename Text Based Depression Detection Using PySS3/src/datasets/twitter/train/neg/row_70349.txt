Tried to kill myself and failed.Last night, I tried to kill myself. I had been planning to do so for awhile, and finally built up to courage to take the plunge. My method of choice was oxycodone. My mom had a whole bunch from a shoulder surgery that she didn't take, some were 5mg and a few were 10mg.

I haven't taken any oxycodone other than when I had my wisdom teeth out 15 years ago, so my tolerance was literally zero. I didn't count how many I took, but based on how many were left vs. how many I had when I started, I believe that I consumed about 65mg in a single dose. I'm not a big guy, about 165lbs or so. I know that people take way more than that throughout a day's doseage, but that's after having built up a solid tolerance, and admittedly I hadn't done much research on how much should've been enough to kill me. But I remembered seeing somewhere that 40mg can be lethal for someone with no tolerance, so I thought it would've been enough since I'm not a very big guy and I didnt really eat anything that day. What I hoped/expected would happen was that I would pass out unconscious and stop breathing. Boy, was I wrong.

I simply laid down on my bed, kept my eyes closed and waited to die. I kept thinking about my dogs that I missed so much, and trying to relax and let sleep take me away. But it didn't work out like that. I felt the dizziness kick in, went through periods of profuse sweating all over my body. My whole body became quite itchy. My breathing became very laboured. My heart was pounding uncontrollably. After longer than I expected, I opened my eyes to look at the clock. I couldn't see what time it was, and the blurred light appeared to be bouncing up and down. The slightest movement resulted in the world swirling slowly around me like swinging a cloth underwater. I didn't try to stand, but I know that if I did I would've fallen straight to the floor. I just closed my eyes again and laid there and waited. I'd like to point out that despite all of the physical effects I was feeling, my mind was unaltered throughout this entire process.

It turns out I laid there for at least 5 or 6 hours straight, sweating, shaking, dizzy, itchy, taking long deep breaths. It was absolute hell. The whole reason I'm posting this here, is because of one very important part of all of this:

**As soon as I started feeling *really fucked up*, I started feeling like I didn't want to die anymore.** You've probably heard that happens before, and I guess it's true. As soon as I realized "holy shit, I took the pills, this is for real. I've really done it" I started having 2nd thoughts, and debated picking up the phone and trying to call 911. I didn't, but it made the experience even more gruelling.

So all of those hours later, I guess I ended up finally falling asleep, and I woke up feeling like tremendous shit. I **did not** vomit at any point during the experience, which was one thing I was worried about in terms of failing. But I am still dizzy, my legs are wobbly, and I've only briefly left my bed all day. I haven't really eaten much except a couple granola bars, some water, and a cup of coffee.

If any of you are thinking about taking pills to end your life, it's not a peaceful pleasant experience. It's an absolute nightmare. I'm still depressed, and I still feel deep down like I want my life to end. **But I don't think I'm ever gonna have the guts to try again.**

I just wanted to share my experience, in case somebody might see it and think twice.
