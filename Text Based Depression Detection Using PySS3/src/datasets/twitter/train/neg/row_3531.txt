Please help me dieI cannot bear the agony of isolation anymore but I can no longer face the world. I spend almost all my time alone. I volunteered for years but can't connect with anyone and I can't take the heartbreak anymore. I can no longer stand to read books or watch movies. All I do is research ways to die but I can't find a way. I want to appeal to some higher power but no one can give me the right to die. I keep having panic attacks and I'm afraid I'm going to lose it and do something stupid so I have to keep myself sedated. 

I am in agony. 

Please help me die.
