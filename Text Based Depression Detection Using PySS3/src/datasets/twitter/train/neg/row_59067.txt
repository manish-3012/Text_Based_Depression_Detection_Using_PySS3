You're not aloneA nice young man, a good friend, and fun personality; my friend took his own life last night, but what he did not realize is how important his life truly was. He was loved by many and his life touched all who knew him. When he left, it left an empty space in the hearts of many. When people try to put the world into perspective, they think of themselves as very small in a big world, but this is not the case. One persons life touches another, and this helps shape the other person into who they are, and that person, in turn, touches the lives of others and so on. One person is not so minuscule in the grand scheme of things. On the contrary, the life of one person is far reaching in an emotional way. One person affects the world. One person makes it a better place. Though you may think that the world has no place for you, the world is actually shaped around you. In fact, you are the world. You are the center of the universe. You are a star whose light reaches far beyond comprehension and warms everything around it. Don't give up, the world needs you, more than you know. Life is precious and there is room for everyone. So don't go, stick around and shine your light for all to see because you are a human being and you are loved.
