Finally gonna do itFound out I was autistic which was horrible my hole life my only meaning was other people and turns out I have a disability that's impaires my ability to communicate with them, which oh since I'm a girl is only gonna get worse. My realtionships have been going downhill for a while and finally realized why my fcuking autism. That paired with the fact if your high functioning you lack a sense of self which I always though I would regain at some point but geuss not becuse it's a life long condition ðŸ˜‚ so gonna tell my therapist I'm gonna kill myself just to give her the heads up and then bounce. Also this post may soukd a bit to casual for the subject matter but idk since deciding I was gonna kill myself I've felt happy and found it all rather funny and humorous
