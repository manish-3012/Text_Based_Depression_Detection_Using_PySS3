In my early thirties, managers tell me I have no skills, risk of being sent back to country I hate, I want it all to end right now after a good whiskey. Why do I have to persevere?Bachelors degree in Japanese, skills in programming, experience in teaching, IT support, and web design. Working part time as a waiter in Japan. In my early thirties, over twelve years of anxiety, worries, scared of relationships, no interest in anything, only thing that stops me from ending it is how devastated my family would be.

Friends no relatives at the same age have relationships, kids and jobs. I work part time to be able to afford a single room over an hour away from my restaurant.

Stopped a friend a few days ago from cutting her wrists, lots of blood. Stayed positive and optimistic for her, can't find these feelings for myself.

No meaning of my life, no interest or skill I want to pursue. What's the meaning? Go back to a job where I once again will get berated for fucking forgetting to fill a customer's tea cup or go back to a country with no job prospects?

When does ne draw the line for enough is enough?

Feeling a jump from a high building would end it quickly. Seeing the sky one last time as I fall and then nothing seems like a sweet release.
How do happy people enjoy their lives?
