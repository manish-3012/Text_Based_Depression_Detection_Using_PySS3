Felt sad, might delete laterTLDR version is pretty much that I would love to just die lol On a serious note tho, I wouldn'd say that my shit here is worth to read, it's just me trying to get some relief through typing it all down, uploading it to reddit and to probably delete it 5min later if possible.

I haven't been on this sub for quite some time, even before I wasn't really to active but I came by quite some times. Either to read some of the stuff that people say and try to relate or to just try and answere in a meaningfull way. This sounds nicer than it acctualy is since I only ever use reddit when I am at work. I barely take a look at it when I leave. While I love reddit it only really functions as a waste of time to not think about stuff while I am at work. It's not just reddit, I just play games all day long in my free time. I'm not sure anymore if I even enjoy playing, or if it only is a method of distracting myself. To get to the point before I bore myself with this too, I am in a quite shitty situation, while I hate my job because I just sit in front of a pc all day long, with a social interaction of a max of 5min, I also can't stand it at home (Yeah quite the young one, 20 to be exact). Either I leave my job but won't get enough money to get a place myself, or I stay where I work currently and manage to acctualy move into another place. While this maybe sounds easy to handle for a lot of people out there it certainly is not. I mean at least for me. Both options are shit and either way I don't have any motivation at all to do anything usefull or meaningfull. What is this feeling about not wanting to exist anymore, while not wanting to acctualy die. What the fuck is it that keeps me here.

That's about that, managed to calm down because of the shit I wrote down

See ya at the next breakdown, babai
