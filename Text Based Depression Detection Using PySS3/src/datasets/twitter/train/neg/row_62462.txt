My life in one paragraph.I want to die but I don't have the guts to I can't even take a blood test without screaming my head off! I'm afraid of pain and during I'm afraid that if I die what will I leave behind a group of people that are sad or a group of people that don't notice I have left the world? Questions enter my mind saying does someone care about me? If I die what will happen? Will the pain ever stop physically and emotionally? Does anyone else relate?
