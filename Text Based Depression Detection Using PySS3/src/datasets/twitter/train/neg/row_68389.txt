I'm Going To Do It Today Somehow I've Had Enough Today Was The Last Drop In The GlassFirst of all I don't want to live in this disgusting world everywhere there is corruption, violence, disgusting acts and thoughts. Life is unfair. They say "you don't work hard enough, "luck doesn't exist". F that bullsh*t. It's fake. Nobody cares about empathy, emotions or what someone is going through. I've done no wrong in this life and life gives me this. It's unfair. No matter how "hard" I work nothing changes. I just have more money.
 
The girl I like doesn't want to talk to me anymore even though I didn't do or say anything bad. It's because I am a useless person that nobody wants or likes. She was one of the reasons I had hope, but now it's clear people don't care about me. If I died today none of my "friends" would notice or care. Only my family would be at my funeral. 

I'm sick and tired of living like this in this disgusting world. Kids who were born into wealth deals with none of these. They live a good life. They're rich, they can do whatever they want. I'm sure if I was a rich dude she would be the one asking me out. I'm sick of money even though I have it. I'm not rich don't get me wrong. I have money, but why? I have nobody I can share it with. I'm thinking about going out and blowing it all out of my car.
