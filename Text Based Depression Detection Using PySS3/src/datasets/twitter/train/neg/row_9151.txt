I don't know what to type here but here we go13 year old male, (little backstory, I've been suicidal and depressed for a year or so now, but I was doing better up until today) all the people I thought were my friends just fucking left me. In the middle of the city.
We were going to hang out for a few hours but all of a sudden they just left.
I tried texting them on multiple social medias and there phone numbers but they haven't texted back yet.
Don't know what to do know
