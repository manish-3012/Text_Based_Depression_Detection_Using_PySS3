I donâ€™t want to be mediocre, so Iâ€™ll rather be nothingI was raised with the stupid delusions that you can be anything you put your mind into. That I could be an artist or scientist or archeologist or some shit, when I couldnâ€™t even learn to read an analog clock.

 Now that itâ€™s become apparent that I really canâ€™t even do basic jobs, that Iâ€™ll be stuck in the bottom rung doing shit jobs for rest of my life, itâ€™s obvious that the best course of action is to die.

Iâ€™ve already done everything I wanted to do in life, and everything I could, and now all thatâ€™s left is 50 or 60 years of repeating shit I donâ€™t want to do, while waiting for death.

Why the fuck should I wait? Why not just skip into the end? Why get dragged from day to day to day to day and slowly wait for my body to wither, when I could just cut my losses and end it now?

I donâ€™t want to play anymore, I want to quit.
