Can suicidal intention ever be rational?I am sorry if this is a weird post but I am autistic and what's kept me from killing myself all my life has been eventually reaching a logical conclusion that it wasn't the right choice. 

Now I find myself at a point where I do think it would be the right choice. I have come to believe my brain is just not working the way it's supposed to, my physical health has been crippled by chronic illnesses, and I won't find peace with myself no matter what I do with my life. 
Last week I felt rationally that depression was impacting my thoughts, because I realised they were more negative that they should be. This week I'm past that, and I think I'm just going to have to figure out how to go and that'll be it. 

Part of me thinks this is crazy talk. Part of me thinks it's the only way forward, because I can't be fixed and I don't want to live the rest of my life as I do now. 

I know this sub is dedicated to talking people out of suicide. So I guess I'm trying to change my mind. But could I be objectively right that I'm just not meant to live? Some people aren't, it's just how it is. Maybe I'm one of them. 

Thank you for reading.
