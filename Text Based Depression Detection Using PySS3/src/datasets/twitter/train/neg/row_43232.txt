why do we livewhat's the point? and why is it important life continue? the universe will go on without me or anyone else.

For what logical reason is living so important?

I'd prefer to be a rock the doesn't experience emotion.

How is living better than not living? There's so much more suffering for the living, or rather living things that feel emotions.

Is there a pill I can take to take away my emotions? I don't care if I'm happy, but I definitely care about not being sad.
