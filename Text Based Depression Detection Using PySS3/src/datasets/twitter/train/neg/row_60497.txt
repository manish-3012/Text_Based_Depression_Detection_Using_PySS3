Self-harming nearly everyday nowJust done it again. A few cuts the length of my index finger on my left arm. I just wish I had the courage to make a cut deep enough to actually kill me and not the scratches I constantly make. 

I really hate my fucking life. I hate my family. I hate my friends. My hair, my looks, everything. 

Just so sick of everyone giving me shit. That's all my ''friends'' ever seem to do. None of them care. They've even said so. Well fuck them. I'd say they'd regret it when I'm gone but I know for certain they won't. No one will. 

I feel like one more week on this Earth will be enough for me. Just enough time to complete Far Cry 5 and then it's goodnight Nathan. But probably not because I'm too much of a fucking coward to do it! I'm scared I'm gonna be stuck here for a long time with shitty people who I fucking hate!
