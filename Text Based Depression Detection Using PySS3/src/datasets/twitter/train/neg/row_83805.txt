Do we HAVE to stay alive because others are terminally ill?Outside of Reddit I donâ€™t like talking about my feelings. 
Iâ€™m tired of being told I should be grateful for my health because others arenâ€™t so lucky and that Iâ€™m basically a waste of life. 
Sometimes I do feel guilty about it, if I could Iâ€™d give my life to someone.
