Approaching peaceI feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm so aggressively sad so often, and nothing ever makes it better. I have nobody to talk to. Nobody listens. Nobody has time.

And you know what? That's fine. I'm actually pretty okay with that, because people have their own lives and their own problems, and it makes me feel a little better about my decision to take myself out of the world. It's not a spite thing.

But as calm as I am about the decision I've made, I'm growing increasingly agitated in other areas. I'm desperate to act out and demand help. It's like the will to live and desire to die are fighting to see which will prevail. 

Either way, I'm seeing a doctor in four days. I'm going to ask for sleeping pills and I'm going to stockpile them. By the new year, I should have enough to do what I need.
