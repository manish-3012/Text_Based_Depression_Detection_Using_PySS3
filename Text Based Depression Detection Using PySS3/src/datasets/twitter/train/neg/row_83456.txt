There is no reason for me to exist anymore. It's been a long road, but I think this is finally the end.I don't remember what it's like to be happy anymore. I've tried to fight. 4 years of misery. My life has been nothing but downhill. I'm so angry and sad all the time. The last few days all I can think of is suicide. What us the fucking point? I've been fighting for so long. So long. And I'm so alone. No one knows what it's like to be alone. All your life. I'm so fucking angry that I was forced to exist. All I have to do is down a bottle of pills, fall asleep one last time, and then there won't be any pain. No torment. No more questioning everything. No more being unloved by every girl I cherish. No more remembering the bullying. No more tedious days of nothingness, just trying to move from one day to the next. No more feeling useless, broken, empty, mean, dishonest, two-faced. NO. MORE. can someone here honestly tell me that isn't the right plan for me? Why should I have to endure agony for years on end?
