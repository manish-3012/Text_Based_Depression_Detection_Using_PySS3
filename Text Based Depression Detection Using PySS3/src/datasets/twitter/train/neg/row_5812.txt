Any reason not to?Nobody will read this one either.

I'm worthless and invisible, and nothing ever improves, it only gets worse.

My psych skipped my appointment last week. I called for an hour to get in touch with the office, until a receptionist answered and hung up on me.

I posted in the mental health sub and my post got removed without even being acknowledged by a bot.

I tried 3 crisis lines and there wasn't anyone available to talk to at any of them.

I guess that "worthless and invisible" = confirmed, so, any reason not to?
