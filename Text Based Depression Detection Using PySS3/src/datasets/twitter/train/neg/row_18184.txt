What has life come to?...Got the kind of pain a man canâ€™t drink away 
And the kind doctors donâ€™t see 
My life sucks .... to know itâ€™s gonna be like this forever. To complex for another to understand unless you can walk through my shoes.. We all got our own form of complicated one day or another if not now youâ€™ll have yours ...
