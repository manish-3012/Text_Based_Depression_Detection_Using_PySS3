I'm exhausted.I'm sick and tired of life. It's worn me out and beaten me down. I barely have the energy to get out of bed anymore. Every day I feel like a walking corpse, and I force myself to walk on anyways. 

Today, i didn't show up to work. There's no point anymore. There's not really much of a point to anything. I can't do it anymore. I no longer have the energy to keep living. I'm not sure this even makes me feel anything. I miss when life was simple. I miss my ex. I miss my mom. And I miss my brothers the most. I miss them all so much and they all hate me. I'm sorry everyone. I honestly am. I know suicide is the most selfish thing I could do. I know I'm going to hell for it. I know I'll be even more hated for being such a fucking coward. But I can't do it anymore. I tried and I lost.
