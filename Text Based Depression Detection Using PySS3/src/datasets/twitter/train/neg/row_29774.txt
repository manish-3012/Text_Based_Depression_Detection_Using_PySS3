I donâ€™t know what to do.Like the title says, I donâ€™t know what to do. These two past months have been hell for me. I finally met my boyfriend who I started dating online 2 years ago, two month ago but he went back home two weeks after. I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll see him again, because he lives a whole continent away from me. I knew it was gonna be hard, but I didnâ€™t know how much. We talk everyday, but that seems to just make it harder now. We mostly just fight now. That has me pretty damn depressed. Another thing that has me depressed is that I happen to be transgender. I donâ€™t have the most supportive family, they donâ€™t even acknowledge it. They act like if I never came out to them. I have no way to star a transition. Iâ€™m supposed to start uni again this September, but I canâ€™t see myself going back. I left it two years ago, because I didnâ€™t feel comfortable presenting a fake me to everyone, and because I didnâ€™t like the way anyone treated me. Now Iâ€™m supposed to go back? I canâ€™t do it. I never even saw a future for myself when I was small, but I never quite knew why I always felt like I wasnâ€™t going to make it past my 22 birthday, but it makes sense now. I want to kill myself every night, but I know my boyfriend would do it after I donâ€™t reply for days because he knows why I wouldnâ€™t reply to him. Just the thought of causing him pain kills me. I know I wouldnâ€™t know at that point, but thinking about it now is terrible. I donâ€™t care about my family. They know Iâ€™m depressed too and why, but they ignore it. I even want to write them a note partially blaming them because I just want love and acceptance from them, but I get a little of the first and none of the second. 

I just donâ€™t know what to do. I want to kill myself, but I know my boyfriendâ€™s death would be completely my fault. He would do it. Iâ€™m certain of it because he basically has no one now but me. Iâ€™m mad at him right now and itâ€™s not fair but I canâ€™t help it. 

I just really donâ€™t know what to do.
