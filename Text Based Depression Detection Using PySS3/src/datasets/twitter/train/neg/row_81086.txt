I can barley function anymore and I know itâ€™s only a matter of time before I go through with it.I almost hung myself today. I had the rope around my neck and i tied it to a tree in my backyard. I clearly didnâ€™t go through with it. I thought about how it might be painful and it might take a while. I just want a quick and painless death. Iâ€™m 16 &amp; a junior in high school. I donâ€™t know how it got to be so bad. I canâ€™t stop crying. I feel like everything is ruined for me. I havenâ€™t been to any of my classes in two weeks not to mention the fact that I failed sophomore year last year, and I havenâ€™t been taking care of myself. Iâ€™ve been cutting again and drinking is starting to become a problem. I canâ€™t sleep or eat or even bother to shower. I give up. People have told me â€œ Youâ€™re so selfish, think about how your family would feel if you killed yourselfâ€. I always think about how it would affect the people around me but in all honesty, I donâ€™t care anymore. Iâ€™ve tried so hard but the constant pain and thoughts never go away. Iâ€™ve felt this way since i was 9 but it just kept getting worse. Everyone tells me to wait it out and that things will get better, but after years of trying to fix myself and be happy, I canâ€™t take it anymore.
