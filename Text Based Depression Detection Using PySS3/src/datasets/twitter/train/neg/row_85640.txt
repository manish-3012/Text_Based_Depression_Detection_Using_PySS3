iâ€™m growing into a person i never want to be.my depression is getting worse, my anxiety has added a new symptom, paranoia, and iâ€™m questioning every relationship i have like friends or family and bf. i technically rely on weed to give me a pick up but sometimes i get days without weed and i get extremely suicidal and sad if so. i feel really stuck with life, i believe all my friends are repulsed by my sadness. i just wish i had someone to talk to. someone that knows how to console people, i definitely need a therapist. iâ€™m always there for my friends when they need me, and thatâ€™s because i wish for the same. but it seems too hard for them. no one answers my text. i can cry in front of my bf and he manages to make it personal, lash out, then blame it on his last relationship and iâ€™m over here saying sorry for..idk. iâ€™m extremely empathetic. but now itâ€™s hurting to care. iâ€™m getting more upset with how i am treated by people, in a way that makes me want to be petty. and iâ€™m not petty, yet recently i get more of those thoughts. it simply doesnâ€™t feel like me. now when they talk about their issues i just want to give them little to no advice, i want them hurt like me. and thatâ€™s just my thoughts, i donâ€™t actually want this. i just hate how i feel and hope something good comes soon and itâ€™s not temporary. no one knows what to do with me. and iâ€™m sure you wonâ€™t know what to say.
ps: if you read this, thank you so much, i hope it wasnâ€™t a huge waste of time.
