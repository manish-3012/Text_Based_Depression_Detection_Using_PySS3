Live to suffer. Canâ€™t dieYou know I can say with 100% certainty when my life ended and that started with my school, I went to a charter school from middle school- high school that destroyed my all dreams (name calling saying youâ€™d never make it etc... and redirection to STEM) with added anal from my mom to prepare you for college and enter the job force only now I never feel happy even with therapy I canâ€™t enjoy the things I used to love anymore. I have ptsd when I try to do them.

Idk what to do with my life now and Iâ€™m in college doing exactly what I spent 13 years having drilled in my head to do.... chronic depression is a bitch and I donâ€™t remember ever waking up thinking todayâ€™s a great day to be alive. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m in college.  

I just feel dejected I donâ€™t want to do anything but be a kid again but I canâ€™t I have to remind myself Iâ€™m 20 everyday because I stopped counting after 14. Hard to go to therapy again and have goals when you donâ€™t see yourself alive 1 week from now, so Iâ€™m just on the  internet reflecting on my life and what I could have done and whatâ€™s wrong with me.

The road of hell are paved with good intentions  in this case suffering which is all mine.

Anyways college starts soon and I needed to get that off my head before I start again with the mindless learning for a degree I could give 2 shits about. 

 Iâ€™ve been suicidal my whole life I doubt thatâ€™s going to change fear of death is a roadblock Iâ€™m trying to get around for 12 years. I guess Iâ€™ve realized that life is sadistic and Iâ€™m just going to keep existing in a world I donâ€™t belong in anymore essentially suffering forever in this life). 

Thatâ€™s it thank you for reading my ted talk.
