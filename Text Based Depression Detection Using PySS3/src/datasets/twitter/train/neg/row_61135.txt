Survived a suicide attempt, but not sure if I am glad I did.On September 20th, 2015 I tried to end my life. It was calm, researched but after I took all the medication I reached out and asked for help. After realizing the ambulance was being called I took more medication because I was scared I was going to pull through. Now two months later I am still here but am basically living day to day. I try to plan for the future but nothing ever works out. I start things but they never happen or see to reach the finishing point. I'm worried I don't have what it takes to make it to see any future goals be accomplished. I've been getting help. I've spent over a week in a hospital ward sleeping next to a paranoid schizophrenic. I am only 23 years old. I'm told I have the wisdom of a 50 year old but look like I am 17. I know myself very well but can't help the thoughts of hating that person. I don't have any self worth even though I'm told I have accomplished much for my age, that I am beautiful, intelligent, kind etc. But I don't believe any of it. I'm to the point in my life where I don't care what happens to me. That it would be great if someone would hit me head on, or I contracted an incurable disease so that I would have an explanation for not wanting to be alive. But I have none of those reasons. I don't know what to do anymore. I've been told I need to practice 'mindfulness' and relaxation techniques but to me that seems silly. Im watching everyone around me go on living their lives and to me it all seems pointless, like everything is passing me by like I'm already not around. What is the difference if I am not here then.
