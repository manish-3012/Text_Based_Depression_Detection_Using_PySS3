I hate my home life.Iâ€™m constantly terrified of my dad and he always makes me feel so depressed and alone. I love my mom but sheâ€™s too emotionally distant and unavailable to be there for me, but I donâ€™t blame her for it. It hurts coming home every day and knowing I wonâ€™t ever have a good relationship with my parents. I feel so alone and Iâ€™m so tired of it all.
