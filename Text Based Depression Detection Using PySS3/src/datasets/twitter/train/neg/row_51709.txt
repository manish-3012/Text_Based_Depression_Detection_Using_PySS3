short drop with belt isn't workingSucks, i thought i had found a relatively painless method to go, but i've sat under the belt a handful of times and only once did i feel like i was getting dizzy and about to start thrashing. honestly it scared me and i sat up, but i regret it because i can't find the stupid carotid arteries again. 

Why go though? Long story short i self diagnosed myself with NPD. I'm not haughty but everything else about lacking empathy, being manipulative and seeking attention has described all the mistakes I've made over the course of my life. I'm honestly a pretty bad person and it sucks because i feel like i have a good heart that is poisoned by a wicked mind - one that was already good at that shit before I even knew how to spell the words in this post. I've done the whole therapy spiel and it's not for me. I don't think i can be helped. by anyone other than God, which is why i'm just going to go back to him. There's no place for people like me on this planet and I'm tired of watching people I care about (or at least try to) leave me and putting my dreams on hold because i'm too insecure to believe in myself. 

I'll be remembered as a coward unfortunately, but at least I wont be remembered as one for long.
