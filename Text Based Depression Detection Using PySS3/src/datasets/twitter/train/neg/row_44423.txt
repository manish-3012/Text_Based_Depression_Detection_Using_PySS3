I WISH I WAS DEAD.I want to die, I wish I was dead. I can't cope with life.

I am transgender (non-binary) and I can't cope.

I had issues coming to terms with it.

I have been to support groups, I am seeing a therapist but still I can't cope.

I also have binge eating disorder. I cant stop eating.

I hate myself I hate my life.

I wish I was dead. I don't want to live anymore, life is too hard.

I dunno what to do.
