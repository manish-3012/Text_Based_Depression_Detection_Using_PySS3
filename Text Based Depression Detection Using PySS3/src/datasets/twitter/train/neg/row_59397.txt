How I amI was once in my English class and suddenly felt light headed and felt like I was going to pass out. I didnâ€™t and went home with that in my head. I looked back on how this happened and I was sad and shocked to see I felt like this because of me. I was putting a lot of unnecessary pressure on Myself to be a good student and the breaking point is when I almost had a anger attack for not knowing what to do. Iâ€™m now bettter but the thoughts for suicide donâ€™t go away. They are now rare but not gone. How should I deal with this?
