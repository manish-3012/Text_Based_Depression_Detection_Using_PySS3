I hate myself.I hate myself in any possible way. I was depressed/cut myself/was suicidal 2 years ago, parents didn't care. Managed to get out with help of friends etc, now its back stronger than before, i'm thinking all day since weeks about suicide, have social anxiety, no friends. I have one person on Discord i can talk to but i'm too scared to tell more than i'm feeling depressed... as said, social anxiety. Wish I could talk to that person every minute, it makes me feel good. Im probably alredy annoying that person. I hate myself for being me, I hate how my life goes, I hate how I handle stuff like talking to others. But I know i'm too much of a pussy to kill myself, so my biggest wish is that someone will come and kill me.
