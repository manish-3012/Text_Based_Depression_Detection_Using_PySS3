Do I have depression? Suicidal thoughts?I go through phases. I can be happy, other times I feel so worthless/helpless and lonely.
Sometimes I have no motivation
Suicide crosses my mind everyday. Sometimes a lot. I hate my life, Iâ€™m even considering buying a rope and creating a noose or buying a helium tank. If I one time canâ€™t take it. 

In 6 months from now, if my business goes pear shaped I think I am going to commit suicide. I have nothing left. I will be a loser failure and have to fight hard to get a crap regular job. Itâ€™s so hard to get onto the property ladder. Everyone is doing so much better then me. I canâ€™t be regular I have to succeed.
