Give me one reason, Reddit.dearest reddit. as sad as it may be, you are the only one i can talk to. my life has been nothing, but a clusterfuck of misery. i am 16 years old, male. i am convinced i will die alone. 

to start things off, my absolute best friend of 10 years has stabbed me in the back. we have been friends since grade 1, but he moved 2 years ago. we've been talking online and such, but he took apart our friendship, in a way so stupid and selfish i do not want to say it.

i've had one true friend that is a girl. her and i talked every day, and helped each other with everything. i did not fall in love with her, but i did appreciate every single day she had spent with me. one day, she just literally removed me from her life. she deleted me on aim, she blocked my number. she deleted me off facebook, and took me out of her life. i've known her for 2 years, but she cut me out of her life 6 months ago.

i have no dad. when i was only 10 years old, he just left. he has a new girlfriend, and i hate both their guts.

lastly, my [ex] girlfriend. her and i were together for 18 months, in a long distance relationship. we've literally spent the past year and a half talking to each other every day. we'd plan silly things like what kind of house we would live in, and all these other things. she meant a lot more to me then words can describe. we broke up one week ago. yesterday, she requested that we completely forget about each other, and forget this ever happened.

what is wrong with me, reddit? everyone that i meet, kicks me  out of their life. life isn't fair. you can't just walk into someone's life, have them care about you, have them love you, appreciate you, respect and trust you, then leave.

give me one good reason to live reddit.

or i will kill myself.
