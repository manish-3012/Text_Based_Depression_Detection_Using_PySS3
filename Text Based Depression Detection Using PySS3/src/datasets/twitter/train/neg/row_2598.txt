I don't even know what to tell my 20M friend anymore. All his reasons for wanting to end his life are valid and I have no idea how to dissuade him from killing himself anymore.My buddy and I are both 20. At age 8, my buddy was diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome. He turned out to have a very bad case and struggled throughout school. He eventually had brain surgery at age 12 to get probes in his brain and a battery pack put into his chest area. This ended up being unsuccessful, and he had to go into surgery again 2 years later to deactivate/remove the probes. He dropped out of high school in 10th grade because it was unbearable. He has awful physical and verbal tics. He will swing his arms, hit things, hit himself, yell, cuss, say nigger at the worst possible moment, etc.

He has been living with his parents his whole life and currently has no future prospects. He sits at home all day and smokes weed and plays video games. He's relatively privileged, he uses his college fund to buy fun things because he doesn't have anything else to put money towards. He has a Vive, ps4, nice PC, all that stuff, but he's still heavily depressed. 

About a year ago, he still talked about suicide a lot but promised his parent's he'd wait until he was 25 to see if the tourettes were gone or if anything has improved. Now I'm not sure he'll follow through with that promise. He hardly ever wants to hang out anymore. We used to hang out/smoke/ride our bikes every other night and now he only wants to hang once a week and when he does he's really sad and talks about getting the balls to kill himself.

His life is honestly so awful and I don't know what to say to him anymore. He asks me for reasons to live and I can't think of any.

Does anybody have any ideas of how I could possibly comfort my friend. I don't want him to take his own life. He means so much to me. His parents are family friends and would be destroyed.
