I'm giving myself about 2 months to plan. And, I don't think I'll leave any notes. Nobody will read them anyway.I feel dead already. I feel hated, I know my parents hate me for a fact, I can't go by what I want to at school (Emery and using they/them pronouns) because apparently I need legal documents from my parents *which isn't going to happen*, my mom thinks I'm fine even though I keep begging so we can go to therapy, I had to grow up and act like I was 20 at age 6 and I never got to be a kid. Not to mention my sister who are younger than me keep teasing me about my suicidal tendencies, my dad and mom abuses me, I was raped when I was 7 by a 16 year old,I can never do anything because I have to babysit for around 35 hours a week and I don't get paid. Not even like $5. According to my dad it's because it's "not really babysitting". He's funny,really fuckin' funny.

My dad's always drunk and high, my mom is always high and takes so many pills. My grandma has bipolar disorder and uses that as an exuse to hate me and my family. I've lost everything I care about. My friends, things I worked hard at, all of it. Gone.

My anxiety is crippling, same as my depression. And I have two plans. 1: Slit my wrists and hope it works. And 2: If I can go on until December, when we all go to Kansas City, I'll jump off the World War memorial center.

That's what I have. 



Somebody please *help*.
