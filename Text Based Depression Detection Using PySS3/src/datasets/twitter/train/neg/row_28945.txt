There hope for a fuck up like me?Throw-away, here. Suicide is heavy on my mind tonight. Something I've thought about a very long time. My current life situation is guiding me closer and closer to really doing it. In 2011 I was arrested and tried for possession of child pornography. I was far from innocent. I spent 3 months in jail and spent a year in sex offender treatment. Passed a polygraph. No pornography was a condition of my probation and treatment and after I passed, I started to smoke pot an viewing pornography again. But not child pornography. Never going back there. Anyway I'm currently in a secondary treatment program that's less intense and mostly just for support purposes and due to a recent policy change, I now have to take another polygraph. I've been breaking rules but I feel health y. I only smoke about every other weekend and only view soft core porn now. I feel completely justified, and haven't relapsed. But it's not how they'll see it. On top of that, I lost my job which I had before I went to court. It's incredibly difficult for an S.O. to find work. I'm I'm lonely and I'm NOT repeating treatment. I made so much progress that they will just throw out the window. And then there's the bipolar, which just compounds everything, it seems. I don't know what I expect fro m worrying this, but they're out is.

I hear all the time how good people think people like me should be castrated, tortured and buried in a shallow grave. I've literally never touched a child.
