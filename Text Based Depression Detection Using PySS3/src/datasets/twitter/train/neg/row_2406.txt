Terrified I'll die after Christmas, but I don't want to (xpost from /r/offmychest)A few of the commenters on /r/offmychest when I posted this there directed me to here. All help is welcome. 

I'm at a loss of what to do. I just am very tired of failing after trying so hard all the time. People say if you fall off the horse, just get back on, but at what point do you realize that maybe you're not made for riding horses. I'm just not good at dealing with people. I can't deal with women anymore. I've continually failed, and been rejected. I've tried to change seemingly everything. Worked out, and gotten in shape. I have a good job that makes good money. I try to be supportive while still being my own person. I used to have confidence but a string of unfaithful partners destroyed that. I just don't know what to do. I have loyal friends and good parents, but I no one ever loves me (in a romantic sense). I don't want to die, but I've just lost motivation to keep going. I've always tried to look at the bright side, but I don't see a way out. I started cutting again. I promised I'd never to that again, but I failed at that too. I do feel bad about the pain I will cause my family &amp;amp; friends, but I've lost all hope. After Christmas, I'm calling it quits. Thank you Reddit for helping me hang on a little longer than I would have otherwise. I don't want it to end this way! I'm so tired of being alone, but I can't feel alone if I'm dead. 

TL;DR I've given up hope. I'd welcome any and all help.
