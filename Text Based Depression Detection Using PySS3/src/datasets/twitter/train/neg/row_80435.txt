Iâ€™m unsure if I should take myself to the hospital tonight or notIâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts yesterday since my last therapy appointment. My therapist pissed me off so much and made me so upset. It made me realize that there is no purpose for me here on this earth, along with comments and messages Iâ€™ve gotten from people on Reddit saying that I am the problem and that I should kill my self. I donâ€™t have anyone to message and my parents will just blow me off if I call them. They have their own problems.

Oh well. If I donâ€™t post again, Iâ€™m either dead or in the hospital. Goodbye.
