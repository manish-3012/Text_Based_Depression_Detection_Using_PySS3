Can't handle the debt and stress any longerI'm at my end and I don't know what to do because people can't help me and I can't afford legal help who could help me and this is more than just unplayable debt, where my interest is so high I can't ever pay it back but it's also a huge limitation on my dreams and progress so I can't sort it and I have no hope and I don't know what to do. I need to vent somewhere. My continuous bouts of depression won't ever leave.
