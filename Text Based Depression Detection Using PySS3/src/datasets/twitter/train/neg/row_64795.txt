I've suddenly felt really down?like from nowhere I really want die. But I'm scared because it's a sin to kill yourself in Islam but I really want to die. I feel really lost and unmotivated, and I can't stand living more. I really want to die. And I feel so ungrateful because I have a nice family and pretty decent grades, good friends and a nice pet rabbit. Why am I sad? I want to be happy but it's so hard.
