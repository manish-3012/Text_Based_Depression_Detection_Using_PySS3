Tired 24/7I canâ€™t function properly, Iâ€™m tired/sleepy all the time, donâ€™t have energy to do simple things. And people around me think iâ€™m just a lazy peace of shit. 

I just moved away from my hometown, so the only person around me atm is my girlfriend, and I feel like Iâ€™m annoying her all the time. I donâ€™t have any friends here... I though life would be better when I moved. 

But Iâ€™m honestly ready to end my life, Donâ€™t have the energy to wake up anymore.. I think Iâ€™ll do it before this year ends.
