I lost my 12-year-old brother to an idiot with a gun.I lost my younger brother back in 2004. We played a stupid game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, of which he won, and I felt it was only right not to be a bully since it was Christmas Day. He climbed into the passenger seat and I climbed into the driverâ€™s seat to control the radio until our father finished talking to the other adults. Gun fire erupted and the car was suddenly under fire. I remember looking at him as he clutched his chest; him voicing the words â€œOh, Godâ€ as he began bleeding from the mouth; the fear that filled my heart as my 14-year-old mind was trying to process what I had just witnessed. The rest I prefer not to remember, because it is something that still makes me cry to this very day, 14+ years later. 

I wish I was a bully that day. I wish I forced him to sit in the other seat like I usually did. He was such a great kid. I looked up to him as a role model despite him being 2 years younger than me. I just know he would have lived such a great life, a life that pales my life in comparison. I think about the amazing chance at life I received that day, but all I ever think next is my life is shit in comparison to what he wouldâ€™ve done with his life. I just miss him so effing much. I think about ending it all the time, but every single time I have my piece and Iâ€™m about to put it against my skull, I picture him looking at me. Life is shit. 

I have an amazing job as an engineer, I date beautiful women and I have a great family. I just fake my personality on a daily basis. Nobody knows that Iâ€™m never happy and havenâ€™t been since childhood. Nobody knows about the scars that cover my body, because theyâ€™re easily hidden with clothing. Nobody knows about the piece I keep in my nightstand. Nobody knows I fake my laughs, my smiles, my everything, because I want people to think Iâ€™m normal like them. I want people to say â€œPolicyTrust killed himself?!? He was always so happy and such a nice person. I canâ€™t believe it.â€ Because that will be better than people saying â€œPolicyTrust killed himself? Itâ€™s about time. He was always such an expressionless, moody, unhappy person.â€ 

Anyways, have a good time, guys. I know this account is new to Reddit, but only because I lost my info for my other account. See ya on the other side; gotta setup my livestream for my best video ever. Peace!
