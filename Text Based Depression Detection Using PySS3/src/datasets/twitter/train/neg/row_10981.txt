Should I open up about my suicidal thoughts to my school? Advice please.I need some advice. Iâ€™ve not been to school for a couple of weeks, because I feel terrible. Iâ€™ve been sick, got a bad infection for which Iâ€™m currently using medication, but right now my mental health is my biggest issue. I feel worthless and like killing myself and itâ€™s making me not wanna leave my room anymore. School is worried about me being absent so much that they called my dad today and asked if they could visit me tomorrow. I donâ€™t mind them visiting me, but Iâ€™m kinda nervous for the talk weâ€™re gonna have. They know that my mental health is crap, but they donâ€™t know that it is this bad. Neither does my psychologist. Iâ€™ve only told my dad about my suicidal thoughts last year, but he hasnâ€™t told school or anyone else. Should I tell my school about it? The 2 people visiting are trusted people at school, so I know it would be safe in their hands, but I donâ€™t know if I should do it honestly. What do you guys think?
