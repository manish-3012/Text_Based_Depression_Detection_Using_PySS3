I don't even know why I don't even knowI'm not sure why but the thought of giving up and letting go of life is seeming overwhelmingly better every day. I know it's probably the worst idea, that maybe my head isn't where it should be and I'm romanticizing the idea of being free of it all but I just can't shake the feeling. I know it's unhealthy, I know that life is gonna be filled with highs and lows and you just have to wait out the lows but I just can't shake this feeling of disgust in who I am and paranoia that everyone thinks the same as me and is avoiding me. I have no reason to think this, or maybe I'm oblivious and have every reason to think this, but it's all culminating in this grand idea that the world is better off without me, as if my one life is significant enough to make a difference being here or not being here. I realize it seems like I'm rambling, this is my first ever Reddit post so maybe I'm breaking some community rules but I'm probably just gonna post a couple comments and see if I feel better afterwards, feel free to ignore all this. The point I was trying to iterate was that I've got all these feelings about wanting to give up, and even though I know I shouldn't, I know life isn't that bad, I don't know why I have them, just that I can't shake them.
