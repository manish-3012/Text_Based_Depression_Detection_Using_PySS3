Ik I'll succeed that's why I'm still aliveI've tried it before i know what combination of pills to take i know how to die. i just don't know what comes after. no one knows how close i am to the edge or they just don't care. i just turned 20 but ik that if I make it to 21 I won't make it much further because I'll finally be able to buy a handgun. a year ago my life was awesome but she was all that held ut together now shes the reason im falling apart the reason i sh she knows that i told her she doesn't care she has a new bf she says she loves i don't care about anything anymore but im too afraid of the unknown to actually do what I wish I could. its been a month but Time doesn't mean anything when you get by on a daily basis. last night was tough right now im okay but thats just because im tired. I wish I could just fuckin do it i wish I could die i wish I could get so drunk I'd just do it. I don't want to live. I'm not alive anymore just because my heart beats doesn't mean you're alive. I don't want "help" I just wish I had friends or someone who actually cares not a bitch who left me because I acted gay or whatever. but tbh I think dating a femboy would be amazing because most of them seem so much sweeter and loving than any girl I've ever met. I gave everything I had to make you happy. I regret it all I just wish I could kill myself instead of hate myself for being myself.
