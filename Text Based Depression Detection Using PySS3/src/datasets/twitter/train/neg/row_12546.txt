I donâ€™t want to live anymoreI feel like a child, my parents treat me like Iâ€™m 10. Iâ€™m 17 years old and they never let me go out with friends. Iâ€™m tired of this and then they wonder why Iâ€™m so depressed. I just want to have a life and have fun and not stay locked in my room all weekend because of them. 

I cut myself again today after being clean for three months. I feel like a failure. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I hope I go to sleep and donâ€™t wake up. It feels like no matter how hard I work I will never be good enough. I donâ€™t think anyone can love me. Iâ€™m a mess. I donâ€™t even deserve a life. Theyâ€™re so many better people out there who die so early and have such great talents and potential but are taken too soon and then Iâ€™m here all pathetic. I just donâ€™t get it. My life seems pointless, I have nothing to offer anyone. 

Iâ€™m sorry for writing a lot but this is the only place I can write how I feel. I donâ€™t even know the point of all this anymore.
