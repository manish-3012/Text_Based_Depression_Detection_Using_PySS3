Constantly ready to jumpIâ€™m 32, married almost nine years to someone Iâ€™ve been with since the 8th grade. We have two children (f16,m10). My wife fucking hates everything about me. I have disorders such as anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, severe OCD, depression, agoraphobia, and suicidal ideation. The list goes on, really. She has issues from childhood trauma as well but is so much different than I am. Iâ€™m open, empathetic, optimistic, understanding, and forgiving. Iâ€™m currently in school in hopes to become a child psychologist. My wife already has a career as a successful CPA. Sheâ€™s incredibly attractive, extremely smart, and has her moments of being loving. Typically though, she treats me like shit. Iâ€™m never good enough. I always fail. She tells me Iâ€™m fat (Iâ€™m not), Iâ€™m ugly (I believe it), Iâ€™m a little bitch because Iâ€™m openly emotional, and again, the list goes on. Iâ€™m insecure enough as it is, but sheâ€™s always putting me down. Iâ€™m always in trouble. Iâ€™m always getting insulted. Weâ€™re in marriage counseling and it seems like sheâ€™s manipulating our psychologist to think sheâ€™s not verbally and emotionally abusive. 
I think about suicide everyday. I donâ€™t think if I can actually do it, but I definitely feel like I want to. The only reason I donâ€™t is because kids need me. Especially my daughter who was recently diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, and depression. 
The problem is, Iâ€™m thinking about it more and more each day. My wife asked me for a divorce a couple hours ago, and all I want to do is drive down the road and jump off the fucking bridge. So here I am, a psych major, venting to the Internet. I donâ€™t know what to fucking do.
