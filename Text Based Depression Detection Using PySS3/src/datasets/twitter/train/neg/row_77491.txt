I don't even know anymore.Everyone thinks I'm a funny, happy and smart guy and even when I tell people who are really close to me I'm depressed they don't believe me. I've lost all motivation in my life and I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm on a cliff that's crumbling and soon in going to come crashing down.  I just don't know if I can carry on anymore.
