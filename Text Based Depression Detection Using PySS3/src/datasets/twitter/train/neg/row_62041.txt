Resisting UrgesAround 10 days ago I was going through one of the worst "things" I've ever went through. I was sick with influenza a, and felt completely drained and numb. During this I developed this serious urge to just go to the kitchen and stab myself aggressively until I bled out, I had imagined everyone's reactions in my head, how they felt and even my funeral and in my head nobody even showed up or cared. They would be disappointed, laughing at me and would forget about me instantly

I didn't do it because both my mum and my grandma were home, I couldn't bring myself to do it otherwise they'd find out instantly and I don't want to hurt my friend even though she most likely wouldn't care. I wanted no chance of survival. I tried to contact my friend that I'm really close with, but she didn't respond. I took this as a sign that she didn't care and that just made the urge worse.

I tried to distract myself from the thoughts by watching youtube and it worked, until I crashed. I woke up completely numb and haven't told anyone else about this yet and I don't think I'll be able to. I still get small urges to cut myself when I see knives and similar things, but I never go through with it.

I've gotten better and haven't felt that bad in a bit, but I still feel suicidal most of the time
