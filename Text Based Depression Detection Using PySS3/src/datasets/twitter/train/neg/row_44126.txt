My best friend just tried to kill himselfHe is in the hospital now. Tried to OD. Right now, I'm just eating ice cream and cookies so I feel pan in my stomach instead of my chest. Everyone else in the house is playing a board game. They're coping. But I just... I want to, but I cant. I almost felt jealous when he was siezing on the floor, I think. Or a "why am I not the one dead, why you?" Im nit really sure, I was trying to keep him awake and direct the response of the housemates to get him help. I dont really know. I'm not even mad at him, I'm just so confused about how I feel, and need to vent. I'm glad hes okay, but wish he didnt have this. I wish this was a battle no one had to deal with. Sorry for taking too much time, and thanks for reading.
