Bitter grumpI've gave up. Life sucks. I lost in genetic lottery 30 years ago. Maybe according to the theory of energy balance I have to suffer, so someone else can be happy...Right, I feel so much better. I think we all should be proud of ourselves lol. Our lives sucks, so others can have great childhoods, loving parents and normal self esteem.
