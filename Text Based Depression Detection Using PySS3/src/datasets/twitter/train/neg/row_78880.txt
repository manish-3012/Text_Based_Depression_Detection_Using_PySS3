I'm going to be miserable for the rest of my life, so I might as well spare myself any prolonged pain.I'm never going to get better. I've had severe issues since I was a child. I think about death constantly. I obsess over it, I spend most of my free time looking gore sites, scouring for pictures of suicide victims. I go weeks without bathing, days without eating. I live in filth. I wash my hands until they're raw and cracked and bleeding, I wash them in bleach. I'm always miserable, always uncomfortable. There is no relief. 6 different therapists, 9 different pills. No relief. I'm not going to a fucking Christian therapist no matter how much my family tries to force me. Jesus isn't the fucking answer, he's fucking dead just like I'm going to be. All my therapists just stare blankly at me, their eyes blurring over and mouths gaping open like deep sea fish attracted to a dimly glimmering light. They don't know what the fuck they're doing. There are no more professionals left to help me, I live in a miserable tiny town 4 hours from civilization. I don't even have fleeting moments of joy anymore. Just pain. I just want to fucking die.
