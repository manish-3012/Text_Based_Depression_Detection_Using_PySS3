I feel like i shouldn't even be supposed to be aliveSince April 2018 my life has been absolutely miserable. 

In January 2018 my depression got to the point where i couldn't even wake up for work in the morning. This lead to the cancellation of my apprenticeship as a mechanic in April of 2018.

Because of this i still haven't found a job and am deeply in debt. This made my mental health drop daily for over a year now. The only things keeping me alive were my hobbies, riding a motorcycle and gaming. 

Today i had a motorcycle accident with my brother's bike. He absolutely loved it and i totaled it. Luckily i don't have to pay a fine, but because his insurance company will bill the shit out of me, this still tore a huge hole into my financial situation.

I don't know how to keep going. I've come to a dead end. I can't sleep because i'm constantly crying. I want the suffering to end. I wish i would have died right there and then in the accident. I feel like i don't deserve to be alive. 

I can't go to get professional help because my health insurance would bill me for that and i can't afford it.

Can somebody please help me?
