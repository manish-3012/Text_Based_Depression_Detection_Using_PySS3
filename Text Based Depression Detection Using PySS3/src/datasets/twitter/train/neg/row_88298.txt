Not too long ago I almost jumped..I found my belt, hung it up and tried to hang myself but my belt didnâ€™t fit so I left the house, walked to the closest bridge and while I was
standing at the top of the bridge in the dead of the night, my headphones in zoned out, standing on top of the train bridge I screamed throwing stones cursing at God, I stood there, prepared to leap and I threw up, I vomited multiple times kicking me out of my adrenaline filled rage, I walked back home and one knew I was gone, went to the bathroom, cut my hair/ self harmed in a mental breakdown so bad I had to shave it, then went to bed. 

I hate my life.
