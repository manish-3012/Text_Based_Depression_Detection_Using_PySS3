could my excessive drug use alone be classed as self harm?I'm 20 and drink daily, and take coke at least every 2 days almost always alone if its not a weekend. I can't help it cos its the only thing that makes me want to live.

Realise this isn't a drug problem, but I'm at a breaking point, wether from self abuse or accidental od.
