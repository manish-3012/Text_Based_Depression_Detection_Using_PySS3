Happy Fatherâ€™s DayIâ€™m still alive because Iâ€™m a dad. And thatâ€™s it.
Life is actually pretty good 9/10 times but that 1/10 is enough for me to walk into the sea and keep walking. 
Iâ€™ve had depression and anxiety since I was 18, Iâ€™m medicated and like I said fine usually. Iâ€™ve tried suicide once and used to self harm a lot in my early twentyâ€™s (Iâ€™m 31 next week) usually with a serrated knife or burns with a zippo. Yesterday me and my partner had a little argument, nothing big. Today is farthest day, my parter, my girl (2) and my stepson (7) came up stairs to me with a coffee and cards for Fatherâ€™s Day. But my parter wasnâ€™t speaking to me. I hugged and cuddled my kids and then spoke to my partner, she said sheâ€™s still in a mood, I said could we not today? Just let bygones be bygones. Well it didnâ€™t, we argued and I could feel myself getting so fucking angry, I flipped our table and punched the wall etc. Iâ€™ve never done this before. I went to the bedroom and now here we are. I really think if I wasnâ€™t a dad Iâ€™d drop the radio in the bath with me in it. But I canâ€™t put my children though that.
Sorry this is so long, once I started it just poured out. Any advice or kind words are sure to go a long way. Thank you, God bless.
