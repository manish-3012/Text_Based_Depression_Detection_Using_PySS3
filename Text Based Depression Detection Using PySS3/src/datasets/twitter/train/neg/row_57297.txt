I should've died on 1-27-20 or 1-30-20. but I didn't.I should've died on either one of those days but here I am. I am still alive and I don't want to be. I don't want to be alive anymore. I am sick of living, sick of having to do anything, sick of everything and being myself and having to deal with everything life throws at me. I cannot get a fucking break. I have had it.  

I am a mistake. I shouldn't of been born, and I will do this world and the human race a good thing when I finally kill myself.
