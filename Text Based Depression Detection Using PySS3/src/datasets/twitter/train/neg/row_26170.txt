Not sure what to doSo after reading a lot of the posts on this thread and hearing other peoples' stories it makes me feel dumb because here I am living what I think to be a normal life, I go to college and have a couple close friends and family that cares about me but yet I still have these feelings of emptiness/uselessness. Some days are hard to get through because I've always hated school but I'm forcing myself to go in hopes that I'll do something with my life but as each day goes by I'm losing more and more motivation to finish but as I think about the alternative which would be to work a shitty job with little pay it makes me wonder if I should just end it all(no attempts made but I did have a plan and date in the past). I tell myself its because I'm lazy and I can fix that but the same loop of thoughts always reoccurs, all I want is to be happy in life but in this world even thats too much to ask for. The only reason I'm still here is for my family and how I don't want to put them through that but even those feelings are starting to fade away. It feels like everyone has these high hopes for me and I don't want to disappoint them, I've wanted to get help but they make it so hard, I just don't know what to do anymore I tell myself love will save me and give me a purpose but its a stretch. I'd like to hear your thoughts and experiences
