Concerned about my cousin?he's early 20s and im still in high school. when he was in high school and i was in elementary/middle school, he always used to tease me and was that relative that lived with you but was so annoying. he always bragged about how he was in the top of class at his top private school and my dad would always say to me that i should try to be like him and study like him and etc and it always bothered me. then my uncle (cousin's dad in case u didnt know lol) lost his job and this resulted in their family unable to afford university for him and his younger brother just a yr younger (younger brother is attending good university in native foreign country). the rest of their family moved in with us because they couldnt support themselves. fast forward, im in high school and cousin is like 24 idk, im much taller, bigger, confident, athletic than the person who used to piss me off when i was little (im still small myself lol but my cousin is just actually really small) , but currently he's living alone in a small apartment being paid by his parents who are trying to build and grow an amazon business but its taking a long time for it to catch and money is moving slow for everyone so no one could really help one another either. my cousin started smoking cigarettes, caught me smoking pot twice and then felt that he was even more justified to smoke cigarettes, hes barely and hes starting to become overweight. i dont think he's mentally capable of finding and maintaining a significant other right now if he could barely care for himself. i want to help him but its so awkward because we both know a little too much about each other's issues and our past doesnt make it any better. 

just wanted to get this off my chest
