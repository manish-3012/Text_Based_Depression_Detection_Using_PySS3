Right nowI just cut myself.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had a pill, right now, I'd fucking take it.

&amp;#x200B;

Slicing my wrists isn't an option anymore, it's not going to work

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I had some way to end it, right now, right this second. I just want it to be over. I want my life to end tonight.

&amp;#x200B;

HAHAHA It's almost like some sick joke. I can't even fucking post this until three minutes from now because "I'm doing that too much." What do you even fucking say. Man. Fuck. Nights like this are just so categorically why I don't keep guns in the house, because I'd be just fucking gone by right now.

My grandma Killed herself. She lived most of her life in depression, shit out my piece of garbage dad, underwent a lot of trauma, and drank a bottle of bills. God damn I admire that woman. I don't know her but I'm named after her husband, who I also never met. I'm offspring of her depressive son. I wish I had her courage, to take the hurt of life and fucking end it. I cut as deep as I could and here I am. Complaing. Noone fucking cares, none of you. Fuck I wish I was dead.
