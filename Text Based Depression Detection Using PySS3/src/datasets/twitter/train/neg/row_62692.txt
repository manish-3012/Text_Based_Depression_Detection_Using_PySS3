Social anxiety is destroying my lifeI canâ€™t fucking understand what to do as a career because everything I do is meaningless. Iâ€™ve been homeless and Iâ€™m about to be again. I have no family and I havenâ€™t wanted to be alive for the last 12 years. Iâ€™m really at the end of my rope I canâ€™t handle this anymore money is ruining everyoneâ€™s life
