Friend has said he has recurring thoughts, but is afraid of being placed somewhere against his will by his therapist.So my friend has divulged he is in a state where he constantly thinks about it.  He's withdrawing from Benzo's at the moment.  But he wont tell his therapist the thoughts because then he knows he'll be placed in a hospital on suicide watch  or something.  How can I explain to him he should feel safe about discussing this with his therapist?
