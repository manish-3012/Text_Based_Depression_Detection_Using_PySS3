just wanna say goodbyemade this account earlier tonight because i was looking to find other people as suicidal as me.

iâ€™m pretty sure iâ€™m crazy, no matter how hard i try to feel something i canâ€™t anymore, i never thought i would make it to my 18th birthday but i did recently. it didnâ€™t feel nearly as satisfying as i thought it would and honestly it just feels really pointless. 

iâ€™ve been suicidal since i was 11. for the past 6 1/2 years my closest friend was the reason i stayed alive, that i wouldnâ€™t even want to hurt him to that extent because in all honesty i would do anything in this world to make sure he was okay and well. but ever since one of the first girls i was seriously committed to commit suicide earlier this year we stopped talking because i isolated myself and he didnâ€™t know how to talk to me about it/ didnâ€™t want to upset me at the wrong time. but itâ€™s turned into us barely talking and i no longer feel like a priority in his life and i feel really empty

iâ€™ve only been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and my old therapist (i ghosted him after her suicide) mentioned to me that i have intrusive thoughts and signs of bpd but not enough to be actually diagnosed. 

iâ€™ve never really wanted to be alive since i was little, i wanted to cut my stomach off with scissors since the age of 10, now iâ€™m almost at my body goal and thatâ€™s all iâ€™m really waiting for to do it because i refuse to die fat lol, also iâ€™m waiting for another â€œtraumatic enoughâ€ incident to happen or for my sister to tell me to kill myself again like she did when i was 12 so my dad doesnâ€™t blame it on him, iâ€™m his only actual child i know it would break him but itâ€™s become harder and harder to function in my own mind and iâ€™m miserable whenever iâ€™m not being distracted

iâ€™ll most likely do it in January after i get to visit all of my friends for the last time, do it as an overdose as my last attempts went, itâ€™s the most peaceful way to go in my opinion the past few times i just fell into a deep sleep and woke up with someone holding me over a toilet but iâ€™ll make sure to do it right this time
