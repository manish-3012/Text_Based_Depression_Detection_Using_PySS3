I genuinely donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be happy.Iâ€™ve always seen my life ending with suicide. 

For a little bit of background, I was diagnosed with depression when I was 8. That was the year my parents divorced â€” until then, I had one alcoholic (but otherwise okay) parent and one drug addicted, abusive parent. A lot of things that I wonâ€™t go into detail about regarding my parents happened before that point and after that point.

Iâ€™ve always struggled to connect with people. I felt vulnerable as a child, so I reacted with anger when my peers tried to befriend me. They learned not to try. I switched to home school by middle school at which point I hardly ever went outside. My social skills deteriorated even more. I made good online friends, but they ultimately turned on me because I was â€œtoo annoyingâ€. Really, I was just a lonely kid who had never been listened to before, so I guess I talked too much when we would voice chat. After that, I lost my ability to connect with people completely. It was already hard, but since this happened 8-ish years ago, I havenâ€™t been able to maintain any relationships. I donâ€™t even talk to my biological siblings anymore. I had three close friends, but I stopped talking to two of them over time and the other stopped talking to me. I donâ€™t know why. Iâ€™m a distant friend, but I still try to be good to people. I got help for my anger a long time ago. These days, Iâ€™m just awkward, I guess.

To get to the point, I donâ€™t have any friends. I was a smart kid, but my academic potential declined very suddenly when I was in high school. I tried a lot of things to help it, but nothing worked. My grades plummeted and I didnâ€™t get into any colleges I was aiming for. I was ostracized by my work colleagues for reporting sexual harassment. Most of my family stopped talking to me because of my history of being unstable. Honestly, I donâ€™t blame them. 

I crave normality. I want to be happy. I want good things, I aim for good things, I work hard. Admittedly, Iâ€™ve become pessimistic, but I still have this foolish hope that things will become better. Iâ€™ve been holding on like this for twelve years, writing suicide letters and coming in and out of hospitals like theyâ€™re hotels. Iâ€™ve watched myself wither away, Iâ€™ve watched the life soak back in just to leave again. Iâ€™ve also been dealing with a mentally ill mother. Iâ€™ve always had to be the parental figure for her, but most of the time it feels like Iâ€™m the only one who even cares about keeping our family afloat and our house clean. To be honest, my sense of obligation to her is the only reason I am still alive. 

I know Iâ€™m over-sharing. I know this is too long for anyone to really want to read. I guess that says a lot about me â€” I canâ€™t get to the point. I ramble. I share information that hardly matters, if it matters at all. I canâ€™t communicate well. I donâ€™t have any friends. I donâ€™t have a promising future. I feel lonely all the time. The only time when I feel like Iâ€™m okay is when Iâ€™m in a manic episode. 

What Iâ€™m getting at is Iâ€™m planning on killing myself. My birthdayâ€™s coming up soon, but I donâ€™t want to live another year like this. Iâ€™m sick of my only motivation to live being the dumb hope that itâ€™s going to get better. Maybe it does for some people. But I donâ€™t see it ever getting better for me. Itâ€™s not that I want to die, really, but living with this this heaviness in my heart isnâ€™t fulfilling in any way. Iâ€™m tired of struggling.
