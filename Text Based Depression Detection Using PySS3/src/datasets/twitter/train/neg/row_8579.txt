Wrote this when I began drifting toward madness againLittle info about myself. I have no friends to speak of and it is by choice. It has been seven months since I last hung out with my social circle. I never go out except for school and work. I spend my time reading and browsing the internet. On the latter I met my love. We talked for months before she came over for a visit. It was amazing and we continue to talk every night for hours. She has held off my departure for months now. I am a schizophrenic who has stopped taking his meds and going to his therapy sessions. I am becoming worse. Before I completely lose control over who I am  a choice was made by me to take my own life. The following text is my last statement and I must say that I have enjoyed 19 wonderful years of life.

I just drifted away. Once my eyes shut I moved on. I was at peace and no pain was felt. Mom after everything I want you to know that you were the best and no matter what I love you. The same goes for the rest of my family even if we were thousand miles a part. For my only true love I cant imagine words to comfort you at this time. Be happy and live on like I never could. My last thoughts were of you. Past,present, and future events played through my head. The only regret I carried to my death was not loving you longer. Dont try to understand my actions, ignore the voices in your head telling you that you could have done something. Truth be told I was lost a long time ago. Living just became another reason I felt hate towards myself. Love others and seek knowledge. In my short existence those were the only truths I felt man needed to justify his own purpose in life. All you touchÂ andÂ all you see. Is all your life will ever be. Im thankful for being alive and experiencing the human condition. It lasted just the right amount of time. Love, H
