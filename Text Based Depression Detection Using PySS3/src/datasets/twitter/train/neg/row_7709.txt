Well I failed again. Iâ€™m back feeling the same wayAn overwhelming sense of dread, loneliness, self hatred and suicidal thoughts. In middle school I tried to hang myself twice, in high school I found my dads gun, loaded it and put it to my head. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d make it past high school, then I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d make it past college. Here I am 13 years and a few suicide attempts later, and nothingâ€™s changed. This is all Iâ€™ve known for as long as I can remember, I guess itâ€™s just normal for me. It doesnâ€™t fucking go away. The only reasonable solution to me is to just shoot myself already. The pain will end, the feelings of worthlessness will end, the sadness will end, this life that I didnâ€™t ask for will finally end. Everything I do is wrong. Everything I say is wrong, every choice Iâ€™ve made has been the wrong one. No more disappointing anyone, no more letting anyone down, everythingâ€™s my fault so I might as well solve the problem. The only thing Iâ€™m good for is fucking everything up anyways. Im fucking worthless. Thatâ€™s why I fucking burn myself so much. I know my place in this world. I dread the person I am, Iâ€™ve never hated anyone more than I hate myself. Every single night my gun looks more and more tempting, itâ€™s the only thing that can save me at this point. Iâ€™m a burden to everyone. Itâ€™s kind of comforting knowing it can all end with just a little squeeze of the trigger. It makes me kind of happy in a way, truly happy. I donâ€™t understand how people can be happy, I donâ€™t know how people can be normal. I didnâ€™t even want much out of life, just a simple, normal life. Everything seems so far out of my reach, I feel too broken to be able to accomplish anything. I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. I canâ€™t take much more of these thoughts or these feelings. I canâ€™t take much more failure and disappointment. The only thing that really stops me at the end of the day is knowing if I do fail, Iâ€™ll be a vegetable, then Iâ€™ll be even more of a burden to everyone.
