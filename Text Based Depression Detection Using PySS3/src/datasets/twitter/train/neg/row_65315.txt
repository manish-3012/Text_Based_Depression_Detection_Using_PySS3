Today was supposed to be itWell I was supposed to do it today. I wish I had the energy and the 100% desire to go through. Iâ€™ve been back and forth on it all week, mostly forth, Iâ€™ve found so much comfort knowing itâ€™ll be over soon. Why does it have to be Motherâ€™s Day weekend ugh, I shouldâ€™ve done it last weekend
