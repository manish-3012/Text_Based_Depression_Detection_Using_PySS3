Tired of Failure in CollegeI got a C in an important college class that might affect my future in grad school and I've gotten another C already in an important college class. I know I can try and take it over again, but it's going to be hard. I don't even know if it's going to be worth it for the career. I don't even know if any of this is worth it. Like I'm so done. I feel like I'm walking through life and I'm not even sure why. 

I don't even know if I want to do this and I want to give up. All my life, people have been telling me that you're so smart, you're going to be great, but then college came and all my "intellect" has fallen out of the window.  I don't care. I don't care about my future. I don't care until the grade shows up an I'm wow I suck. I'm tired. I'm tired and I want this to be over, but I can't because I'm pretty sure someone will be sad if I die. 

I wish I tried harder so I didn't feel this way. I wish I knew what the future will hold because I'm scared of it. I'm scared of what's ahead because I don't know it and then the other thing is easy. Well, not easy, but it's simpler than trying. I just hate that I did this to myself. I'm tired. I'm really fucking tired. I can't believe that this is who I am - a failure - when I could've stopped this. I hate myself and I want someone to tell me that everything is going to be okay, but I won't believe it. I want to change. I don't know. I don't want to wait, but I both don't and do want to end things. At least it'll be final.
