Will I be reborn if I kill myself?My mother wants this vision for me that she sees fit. I have a vision I see fit. Iâ€™m sure the universe or God has something else in store.. I realize Iâ€™m not in control arenâ€™t I? No matter what I do, I wonâ€™t be able to have a girl friend. Some shit always happens, either they lose interest, have their own issues, or my mom just rejects any girl Iâ€™m into. 

She said I have to stop calling her controlling because sheâ€™s always been lenient. Then why canâ€™t I see her?? Iâ€™m sick of being guilt tripped. 

I dream of different ways I could do this, overdose, jump off my building, drown.. or lastly just starve myself to death .. 

goodbye.
