why do i fuck everything good upim a fucking disgrace, all my friends, all my relationships. All fucked up beyond repair.  


  
I have no friends, no one that likes me, i have no one. Im all alone.  


And its all my fault, its all my fucking fault.  


I constantly think about suicide, but today is the first time i seriously want it to happen, i seriously want to do it, i just want to escape from who i am.
