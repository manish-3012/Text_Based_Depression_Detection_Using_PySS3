The last week of my lifeI can feel the noose tightening around my neck. My business will fail soon. My house will be foreclosed on by someone. The IRS will notice I owe them money I won't ever have. I can't face the mounting problems. I'm paralyzed by depression and I know I won't ever enjoy anything about life again. Better to end it and stop being a burden, I'll also leave my mom and business partner 50k from my life insurance at least. I can't wait for it to be over but I have to because my mom booked a mini vacation for this coming weekend and I don't want to ruin it for her.... One last trip and then I'm done..
