There hasnâ€™t been a day where I havenâ€™t thought of suicide...There hasnâ€™t been a day where I donâ€™t think about wanting to kill myself, or hurt myself in some way. Itâ€™s so hard to not just pick up an knife and ya know. Idk. Nothing is as it was, life doesnâ€™t want me to be happy, and thatâ€™s even if life cares. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m supposed to do anymore. I just feel so fucking bad. No ones going to read this and if they do no one is going to care.
