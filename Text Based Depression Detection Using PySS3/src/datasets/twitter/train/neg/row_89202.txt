A summary of my mind and where it will go...I donâ€™t post things like this online, but I need to let the world know what Iâ€™m feeling
I feel so worthless. I lied about going to classes, I lied about my well being and I lied about my drug use. 
I ruined myself, drug and alcohol is all is my only way of coping. Someone that Iâ€™ve almost felt love for only looks at me in contempt. I can never be with her... Iâ€™m a fucking mess, my friends donâ€™t want me around. My mental state is a topic they talk about behind my back I know it is. Iâ€™m getting evicted because Iâ€™ve had violent episodes. I use drugs because they made me feel happy. Even only for a few hours. It was better to drift away in an ecstasy of happiness for a night than let these voices take ahold. Iâ€™ve tried commuting suicide already. Drug overdose seemed like the best option, to fade into a haze then into nothing appealed to me. I took a mix of opioids and ecstasy thinking I could feel happiness once more before it all goes dark. My choices brought me there but death didnâ€™t choose me. Unfortunately I survived, after convulsing for 2 hours someone found me and made me throw up. They shouldâ€™ve left me. I wasnâ€™t the same in a mental and physical sense. I felt so pathetic I canâ€™t even tell my family what Iâ€™m going through. Itâ€™s not like they donâ€™t care for me but I canâ€™t overcome the shame it would entail if I asked them for help. Itâ€™s sad because they think Iâ€™m going to college and that I have a bright future ahead of me. That couldnâ€™t be further from the truth. I often think of other ways to kill myself; run into oncoming traffic, shoot myself, suffocation. But I wanted to go peacefully. Rn sitting on this ledge looking at the ground. It doesnâ€™t look too bad I guess? Iâ€™m sure the impact would be enough... maybe not? I donâ€™t know how to ask for help so I just went here to vent, because my whole life Iâ€™ve been told to â€œMan up and deal with itâ€. Well look where that ended up. Iâ€™m a drug addicted suicidal kid who canâ€™t seem to find a meaningful connection with anyone. Good bye. Thank you for listening...
