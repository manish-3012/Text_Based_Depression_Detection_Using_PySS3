Is anyone else scared of being held against their will?I feel that I have to be very careful how I speak to my pysch and doctor about my depression and suicidal thoughts. I get scared that if I say too much, then they'll have me admitted to a hospital or psych ward against my will. The thing is, I want help, but I still want to be in complete control of my life, and it seems I cannot have both.
