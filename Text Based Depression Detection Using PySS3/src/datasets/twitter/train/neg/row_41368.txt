Dying terrifies me, but I can't see any way outHey guys, I hoped I'd never have to post here, but I'm desperate right now.

I've had episodes of depression for years now, but these last four months have wrecked me. I'm in Medschool and I started my internship last year. I should've completed in feb, but I took a break at home for over a month because my folks had a lot of stuff going on and needed me there. My college is an absolute piece of shit. It's responsible for nearly all of my issues. I've struggled with my weight and I had gotten to a good place before college but after I joined everything went to hell and people around me bodyshame me like crazy, especially my family.

I've been able to tolerate it in the past, even laugh at it, but when I got back to my room after being at home for a month, I just didn't want to go out again. I didn't want to see those ingrates I work with or that shitty hospital. I've been lying to everyone for the last four months and I don't have any love for anything anymore.

I have friends and my little brother to talk to, but it doesnâ€™t help anymore. I know it'll wreck them but I can't take it anymore. Even if I finish internship my family's still going to be a bunch of asshats and I'll still be alone in my shitty little town. I don't want to do it but I don't know how I'm going to go on. I wish I could go to therapy but I can't afford it. I can't see any way out other than ending it.
