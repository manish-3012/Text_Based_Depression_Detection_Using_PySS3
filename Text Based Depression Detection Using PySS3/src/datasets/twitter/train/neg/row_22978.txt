Living SuicidalI post this here as I know a lot of you would have felt or would be feeling the same. I am suicidal a lot of the time, but not "act on it" suicidal. I think about it, I google it, I make half arsed plans I know I won't carry through. I realise there are levels of suicidal. I have attempted suicide. I have been "paralysed by pain of having to live and screaming in agony" suicidal. I have been "why doesn't everyone around me want to die too" suicidal. But with help I am slowly improving.

First of all, I'd like to say to anyone reading this, if you are dealing with any level of suicidal thoughts, they are all hard. They all suck, and just because your not actively trying to take your life, or your not bed-ridden, or it seems like it's worse for others, it doesn't make your struggles less important. You are deserving of help and support. Your problems are real. Accept all the help you can get.

I'm currently "I can stay alive because I know there are people who would be devastated if I died" suicidal. This means that life must go on, and I have to keep moving. My question to anyone who can answer me is, how do I do this? Im a medical student, so I need to study, but so often I go back to the thought "I don't want to be here, I don't want to be alive, how am I meant to do anything with that life?" I understand this is a vague question, I just really hope someone understands what I mean.

Thank you and I hope your all doing ok
