I'm lost...My parents and brothers and sisters treat me like garbage. Ever since I was 8 years ol I have had suicidal thoughts and attempts. My thoughts went away for awhile and now with them treating me like trash they are coming back. I want my family too see that I am a good person and I want them too accept me. I just don't know what too do. I'm at my wits end
