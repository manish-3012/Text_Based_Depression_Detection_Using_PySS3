I bought the pills, lying next to them now. I haven't opened it yet because I am scared it will give me organ damage and pain instead of just letting me drift off to eternal rest. 

I bought benadryl to stop the vomiting and two bottles of aspirin. 24 tablets each, 325 mg. 

I don't know what to do. I want to die but I want it to be painless. I don't want to take any more pain.
