I'm scared.I've been having suicidal thoughts for about two and a half years now. It started out where I would just think about it occasionally, whenever my grades weren't to my satisfaction. Then I started thinking about it more often, and developed other habits, such as skipping meals or scratching myself with a key when I wasn't happy with myself. I would wonder if I would make it through college. 
Now, it's gotten worse, and I think about it more often, I've scratched myself a lot more, and I've spent hours thinking about the ideal way to kill myself. I've halfheartedly tried once, and come very close to trying another time. Now, for the past four nights or so, it's gotten really bad again, and I choked myself, just to see what it would feel like if I tried strangling myself. I'm back to thinking that I'm not going to survive college, and I'm so scared.
