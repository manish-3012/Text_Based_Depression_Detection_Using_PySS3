TIFU Suicide watch editionSunday, which seems so long ago, I took a handful of pills and tearfully went to sleep in the hope that I could finally get some peaceful sleep that I felt I truly needed. A small part of me also hoped that I wouldn't wake up because I had let everyone down, including myself. 

My boss found me because I'm staying with them and had missed the beginning of my shift and I lead a group of 25 people  who were waiting on me. 

Cue firemen, ambulance, lots of shouting, and a trip to the hospital. 

I'm ok now and I was able to talk myself out of the traditional 72 hour hold because I do have an amazing support system of friends and already existing docs. Oh, and maybe the fact that I'm uninsured and the county facility didn't have beds helped too. 

But I'm frustrated and angry that I'm back to step one. I don't have a job anymore. A job that I loved but was honestly too stressful for me to handle. My friends are either treating me with kiddie gloves because they're afraid I'll break again or are unaware of what's going on so they think I'm just ignoring them. I feel aimless. So so aimless. When all I wanted was a nap to reset myself and cope with the pressure I was facing. It was such a stupid mistake that I made and the repercussions were so great. 

I just feel stuck. Not suicidal thankfully but just so stuck.
