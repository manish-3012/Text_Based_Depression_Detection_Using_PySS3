Numb and unlovedHey all. I guess I just wanted to vent a bit? 

I'm in the process of a divorce, and it has really been fucking with my head. Like to the point I've lost my job over it. So here I am, sitting alone in my STBXH apartment and I just want to die.
I've been alone for this past week and it has killed me. It has sucked knowing that he is out there having a grand old time without a care in the world about me. So, I fucked up and I've ended up having sex a couple times with different guys and I still feel just as numb and empty as before...
I guess I just don't know if life is worth living anymore.
