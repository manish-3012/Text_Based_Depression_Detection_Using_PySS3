I'm one bad day away from pulling the trigger.Recently my grandfather died who I loved very much. He was the first person that I was close to that died. Not only that, but I was in the hospital after his accident and saw hope given and taken away. I saw him as they pumped him full of drugs and as he struggled to breathe before he just stopped breathing. (he bad a stroke and my grandma said he wanted quality of life and he should go now so he's not in pain) Even for years before this I've been depressed, but after this it's gotten much worse. For the first time I started cutting myself, and I've developed some social anxiety, witch doesn't help. I feel like I am always disappointing everyone, and that I'm a failure and a poor excuse for a human and that I'm just a worthless pile of garbage. People are always tellings me to shut up whenever I talk about something I'm passionate about. People always tell me I have nothing to add to society. Any confidence I had before is gone and I'm just always sad. Today was my birthday, but I shared it with my twin sister (we turned 14) my younger brother was rude to me all day and when I got a curved monitor, I was kinda excited, then he basically shoved me out of the way to set it up and took the tv I was using for a monitor and was making me feel like he doesn't care about me. He just wants my stuff. Everyone just makes me feel unloved, uncared about, and unappreciated. Im just in so much pain all the time and I just want to die. I guess I came here to find some support. To find maybe the only good people in the world. I just want the pain to stop.
