This life is not worth livingI am 22years old male.I just sit in front of my computer all the day,sometimes playing games(lol,wow),searching random useless things on internet or browsing reddit and facebook just to escape reality.4 years ago I started the college(computer science) but I hate it.My mother almost forced me to apply for this college.This is my second attempt to pass the second year of this college but I never study and I just go to exams and fail them because I dont care about nothing.I could apply for other college but I feel like I dont like anything.
My life is a mess:I stay all the day on my laptop wasting my life and trying to escape the reality,I sleep at random hours,sometimes I eat only once or twice a day because I dont really feel hungry,I feel weak,sick,I have no friends now and I hate my family.
My mother is divorced since before I was born.She never cared about me and in addition to that I was born with slightly deformed head because of calcium deficiency when I was in her womb.The deformity is not big and it's at the back of the head and at forehead.To be honest,maybe 1 out of 20 ppl would notice the deformity.On top of that,I have my right leg malleola enlarged because I had a small fracture that I neglected and callus formed there and sometimes I have pain.Doctors said that now it's too late to repair that.I am short(around 170cm),with uneven head and this leg problem and I feel like an abomination.I feel like that even with all the money on this earth,I would never be the person that I want to be:a normal person,healthy and happy.Nothing will make me happy.My self esteem is below the sea floor and all I do is spending all my time on computer,masturbating(I did a nofap session of 6 months or more but didnt help) and in depression.I have suicidal throughts since I was a kid and I feel like 2018 will be my last year.I plan to kill myself in the following month but I still have a very small hope and if anyone want to talk with me about this  I am open for talking.
