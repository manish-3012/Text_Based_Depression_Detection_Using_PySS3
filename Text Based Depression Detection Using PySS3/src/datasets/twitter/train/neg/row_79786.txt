Canâ€™t manage and really irritated by the incessant â€œthereâ€™s still hopeâ€ nonsense you find when looking for a solution.My latest attempt to sort my shit out came to an abrupt and painful end yesterday.

I donâ€™t want to live but all I can find information wise is â€œsuicide isnâ€™t the answerâ€ and that disgusting â€œthink of the people youâ€™ll leave behind and how it will hurt themâ€ bullshit. As if you should shuffle on in misery so that other people donâ€™t have to mourn for a while. My entire life is mourning.

The problem with all of this is that I want to find a sure fire way to die successfully in peace without much chance of being interrupted and living in worse shape than I am now. And I wouldnâ€™t want to cause trauma to somebody going about their business (e.g. train driver, pedestrians etc).

I know this isnâ€™t a place for advice on methods but I find the aforementioned attitudes towards suicide to be totally misplaced and it forces people to have to do some utterly brutal things to themselves in order to escape their demons.
