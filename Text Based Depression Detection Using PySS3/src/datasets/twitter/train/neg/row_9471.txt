Could really use someone to talk to right nowI'd lost my old account and that was fine with me because I hadn't needed to come back to this board for a good while, but I'm back.

I'm kind of bawling right now and am not 100% control of myself so I apologise if I accidentally break the rules or trigger someone. 

I just purged. Today is the third day in the row. After five fucking years. I hate this so much. I hate it so fucking much. 
I was preparing toast and just stood there with a butterknife, clutching onto it with so much force that it broke my skin. It was the only thing I could do to stop me from sticking it into the toaster. I threw the knife across the kitchen, unplugged the toaster and ran to my room. I'm so desperate and scared and I know I did the right thing by removing myself from the room, but I'm so angry that those thoughts even crossed my mind again. 

I'm so angry that I feel this way. I hate the feeling of sadness. I don't even need to be sad and my heart will just feel heavy. I need a level head because taking my usual steps to calm myself and talk myself down aren't working right now. I'm in tears and sobbing and I just don't know what to do at this point. I don't want to call the police because I know, I just fucking know that I'll be hunkydory in 2 hours. Like nothing even happened. So then you can say "well it's silly to kill yourself over something you know will pass" but having to wait for these feelings to pass and even having them in the first place are absolute hell. 

I've never self harmed, but I can feel my methods of keeping myself sane are becoming less and less effective. That, and I've never had anxiety, depression, and eating disorders overlap like this. It's not even a steady decline in mental health anymore, it's just a full blown nose dive. 

I don't know what I want
