Finally seeking help, it's about time...I've seen a doctor about my depression in the past, but I've always lied when they ask if I've had suicidal thoughts. I've set up an appointment for myself on Feb. 2nd and this time, I'm gonna let it all out. It's been 11 years too long, trying to deal with this.

I went to the ER after nearly collapsing during a one hour long anxiety attack. I was unable to speak, but could think clearly. Every time I tried to talk, the words wouldn't make sense. I had no use of my hands or feet, and could barely walk.

I was eod'd before, and it terrifies me to tell the doctor that I have suicidal thoughts and past attempts. I don't want to go back to the mental health center.

I don't think I would actually commit suicide, but the want is there, and it is strong at times. Nothing feels good anymore. I'm not happy, or mad, or even sad anymore. Everything is bland and pale in this world.

I feel like I don't belong here, even on days to where I feel ok. I'm just not meant for this world. I've grown to accept that nothing gets better, and I'm ok with that.

I just want to feel alive again, because the old me died at 15. I've been a walking corpse for 11 years, and nobody wants to try to understand me. They all say the typical things, like "It's a phase.", "Get over it.", "Be a man.", or my favorite, "Just stop."

I just hope that something good comes out of this appointment. I'm always fighting myself. I can't take this anymore.
