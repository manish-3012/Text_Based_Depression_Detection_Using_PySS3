Sometimes I'm happy.. on other times I belive I will never be happy again.Days pass.. I have friends that are amazing, I truely love them like they're my family.. but why is the urge to end the pain so strong? I can be happy in a moment and in five seconds I'm not. I don't understand why and I don't know how to fight that. I'm just not strong enough and I don't want to put this kind of burden on my beloved friends.  

I'm in therapy since my mom died two years ago and I feel like nothing is getting better afterall. I always have these downs, where suddenly everything around me goes dark and bad and I feel the need to escape. I never had serious drug issues, but I feel like drinking to succumb the pain more and more, cause when I'm sober long enough these downs come back and I'm just.. scared.  

The only thing keeping me alive are my friends after all, and the fact that I know, that I'm gonna hurt them if I kill myself. I just don't know how long this keeps me from the last solution...
