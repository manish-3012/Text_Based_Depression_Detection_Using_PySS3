Iâ€™m tired and scaredIâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts for many years now, it comes and goes and it isnâ€™t usually so terrible. Iâ€™m in college and honestly? Iâ€™m failing everything. My grades are terrible and Iâ€™m either going into probation or straight up getting suspended. My relationship with my family has gone to shit because I rarely go home now, some of my family members died recently and I havenâ€™t had the time to come back and support them, Iâ€™m not on speaking terms with any of them now. I just want to go home. The only positive thing in life are my friends, but I feel so disconnected from them and I canâ€™t really talk to anyone about this. I feel suffocated and I canâ€™t really express this part of me to anyone else, I feel like my whole life is just falling apart.

I have never felt such an intense desire to die before, maybe itâ€™s because of my anxiety or just my situation in general, but I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. If my life is going to be over, I might as well just end it here, right? I donâ€™t know, I just canâ€™t imagine myself recovering from this situation and making my life better.
