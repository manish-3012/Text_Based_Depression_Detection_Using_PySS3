I hurt so badly. I just want to dye.I have been dating the same guy for a year and a half which is quite an accomplishment at the age of 16. Yesterday he broke up with me over text message after not texting me for a day and a half. We were so close and I love him so much. He later came over and we talked about it. That didn't make it hurt any less. I love him so much and I need him. I have been throwing up. It's been like a constant panic attack. I don't really get close to many people because of a complicated past with abuse and such and I let him in and I trusted him and he stabbed me straight in the back. I want to kill myself. I hurt so badly. My mom has some pills in her bathroom I could just take. I'm going to be home alone later. But then again. I'm scared. And I want a chance with him again.
