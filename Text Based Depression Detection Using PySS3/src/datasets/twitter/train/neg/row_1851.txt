I think this may be the only way.Ten years ago I did something terrible and got away with it. I recently realized how bad it was and have spent the last week drowning in shame and guilt. No one knows what I did, and that hurts me even more. I have friends and family who love me and this just makes it worse. I dread the future. Every aspect of it and I don't think I deserve either forgiveness or love. I'm scared as well. I used to think that I was a good person, but it's dawning on me that I've been a fraud my entire life (I'll be 26 next week) and I honestly don't see any other path towards peace. I don't know if this is selfish... it likely is... but it's the only option I see.
