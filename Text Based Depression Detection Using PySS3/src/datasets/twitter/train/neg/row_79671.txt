 A year, now I'm here for others.A year ago, I attempted suicide. It was all medicine I had and alcohol. There were several reasons, Iâ€™ve been all my life depressed and suicidal, ideas how to kill myself have been with me since Iâ€™ve been 13. But at that day in June, everything literally came together. I was supporting a punk, suicidal guy, he attempted suicide (again!), and my own problems, all together.   Being a failure was too much for me and I just wanted to sleep, forever.
But now Iâ€™m here, Iâ€™d say that moment was wakeup call, things have changed. Now, Iâ€™m here to help others.  Iâ€™m far-far away from USA, living at another continent, 18year old girl. When you need someone to talk to then Iâ€™m there for you, no matter of time-zones, msn and skype â€“ Iâ€™ve got them.
