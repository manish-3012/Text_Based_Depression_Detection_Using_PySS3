No logic in livingI dont know how to put this off because english is not my first language. But I'm just thinking that the most logic option for me would be to simply die. I mean, when I think about where I am now, what I study, where can I work, what can my life be in a few years (and a few more important things) , even in a optimistic way it isn't that good. In a realistic way, it would be a little miserable. And I do not see why live if I have more struggles than joy. It's nice that some people works they way out, but I don't know how and I'm not sure if I want. It's just more simple and logic just end it (wish I have a g**)
