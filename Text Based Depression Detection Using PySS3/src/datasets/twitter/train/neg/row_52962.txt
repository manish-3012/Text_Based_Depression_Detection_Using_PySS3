Life or deathIâ€™m either not really feeling anything or feel everything at once. Iâ€™ll have a â€œgoodâ€ day and just canâ€™t trust this feeling because I know itâ€™s going away again. Sometimes I sit with a friend and zone out, imagining how I could jump off the roof behind them. Someday I feel as though life could really get better, other days I just sleep because itâ€™s the closest Iâ€™ll get to actual death without leaving people hurt.
