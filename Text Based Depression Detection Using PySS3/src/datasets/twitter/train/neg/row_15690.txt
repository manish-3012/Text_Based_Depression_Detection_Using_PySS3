Lost my fiancÃ©. Feeling terribleI did something stupid a long time ago. I didnâ€™t cheat on her, but I broke our trust in a fashion. We worked through it then she broke up with me quite a while after. Pretty out of nowhere. We were SO happy together. Sheâ€™s an amazing woman and we had an amazing relationship. 

This was about two months ago and I am feeling more and more lost daily. I havenâ€™t been in contact with her or seen her since. I want her back so bad, but I know if weâ€™re gonna get back together that it has to be on her to reach out.

I feel terrible daily and contemplate what it would be like to end it. Part of me feels like this whole thing is my fault and that I ruined a great thing. The other part knows that she shouldnâ€™t have just up and left. That this isnâ€™t me and the root issue is her cold feet. I am scared of the future.
