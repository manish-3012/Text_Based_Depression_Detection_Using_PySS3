I think I'm cursedAbout 8 months ago, me and my best friend were having a conversation in PE (gym class for Americans) and he said that maybe I'm trans because I did something in a past life. 

Personally, I don't believe in any religion but I thought that it was interesting. Like what if you did something in a past life and so the punishment fits accordingly in your next one? Sorry, I'm probably making someone paranoid... 

Anyway, I have several mental disorders but I'm from a pretty good background. I know mental illness doesn't discriminate although it doesn't help that my mom always tells me "be happy you're not (insert less fortunate person here)". I've told her it makes me more upset but she always forgets. 

Just a vent thing, you can comment whatever, I needed to get my thoughts down somewhere. If this is the wrong subreddit, please link one where I can share my thoughts better.
