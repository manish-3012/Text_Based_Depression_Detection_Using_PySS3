I have no idea why I'm posting here again..It never helps. I've pretty much said all I need to say. I just feel lost. I just want to be Fucking happy again. Not stable. Not normal. Happy. I'm not entirely sure when I lost whatever sanity I started life with but I want it back. I'm tired of every song I write being depressing. I'm tired of being reclusive and sad. Depression, ADHD, Borderline, Avoidant, Paranoid and fuck knows what else. Every Fucking quirk I have is a personality or mental disorder. I'm sure of it. Nothing helps anymore. I've lost everything I've ever cared about. I can't even think anymore. I just want this to be over. I just want help.
