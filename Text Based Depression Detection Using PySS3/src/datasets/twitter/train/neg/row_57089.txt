Haven't even failed yet but I know I willI'm so damn exhausted and I just wish I had someone to talk to. I've dealt with depression my whole life. It's constantly weighing me down and I'm not seeing a counselor or on medication. When I took medication I didn't feel like it worked at all.

I've made it pretty far, despite everything. In about a week, I'm supposed to be doing an interview for a nursing program. Only about 50% of people interviewed will make it in. I have absolutely no major volunteer or work experience, so if they ask me that, I know I'll be fucked. And they almost certainly will. I want to be a nurse more than anything but it just won't happen. I'm at a loss. I have no idea what to do with my life if I don't get in. I'm so nervous that I can't even concentrate in class anymore and I cry every night. I just want to end everything so I won't have to suffer the shame of not getting into the program. My whole life has built up to this, and of course I'm already set up for failure. I can barely get out of bed in the morning. I know I won't get in. And if I don't, what's the point in going on?
