I feel so alone, so worthless, so stupid, and so lazy. I don't want to live, but I'm not hurt badly enough to deserve death. I can't seem to win.I just want it all to end. I don't want to keep going or get better. I can't make anything stop. 

I'm so silly and childish. If I just tried harder i could get better maybe.

I just want to die. i'm sorry for being so terrible and not caring. I 'm a terrible person who doesn't deserve the release of death. I'm sorry.

i don't deserve anything. it's my fault for being this way. 

i desreve to have to do anything i don't want to.
