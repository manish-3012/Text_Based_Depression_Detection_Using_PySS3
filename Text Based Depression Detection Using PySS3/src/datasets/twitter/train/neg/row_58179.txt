I don't when, I don't how, but I do know I'm committedI'm done doing things in this world. I'm done going out and being with people. I don't even want to see my own brother, and I generally think people suck ass.

I will never work again, and I think most people just shuffle shit around anyway (fuck your stupid work ethic, jock!).

That's all. I don't care if nobody reads this, and I won't be checking back at all. Fuck all y'all, for real.
