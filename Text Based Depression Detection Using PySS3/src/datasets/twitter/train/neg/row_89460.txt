Itâ€™s time for me to leave this sub for good.Title says it all, but no worries. Iâ€™m okay friends.

I never posted much in here but I related a lot. Iâ€™ve been really working hard on seeing the better ends of life and I think I finally found them.

It never seems like itâ€™ll get better but I do promise it does. Itâ€™ll get worse again, but life is random and somehow itâ€™ll always look up.

I feel good lately. Today I took some big steps.

I went grocery shopping. I cleaned my room. I held my cats and talked to my friends.

I hung out. I did small exercise.
 

I took a long shower.

It felt great. I left all my sad subs. Depression, suicide, rape, abuse.

Hopefully I never feel the need to rejoin.

I love you all. Please feel free to reach out if you need to.

Iâ€™ll always be a friend.
