I'm planning on killing myself by the end of AugustI've been struggling with depression and suicide since I'm twelve, I'm almost 19 now and I don't think I can take it anymore. 

I feel a deep disconnect with everyone in my life and my dreams have become faded and meaningless. People keep leaving my life like I'm not worth anything and the worst part is, I don't blame them. I just don't think I deserve anything. I know I'm privileged. I have a home and parents who try to help me which I know is rare, but I feel just like I'm a burden to them. It's like every 3 to 6 months they have to deal with my breakdowns. It's not fair. I don't understand why life or god or whatever gave them me as child, the worst person ever. 

I feel insane. I keep trying to call for help through any form of art I can create but I just feel like I'm going mad. I can't stop waking up in pain, I can't stop not wanting to wake up, I can't stop hurting myself, I can't stop being a burden. I'm speaking another language that no one understands, that no one wants to understand. It's fair. I don't want to go to the hospital again, they'll just make things worst. 

I'm stuck. If I don't do it know, it will be probably during my next breakdown. And if I don't do it at all, I'll just suffer for the rest of my life. I'll end up in a ditch somewhere. Better to do it know before I meet new people. If I had done it when I was 12 at least I wouldn't disappoint as many people that I will disappoint now. It was mistake to wait, I won't wait any longer.
