Extremely unfit for this societySo i know i will never be happy. It's because i will hate my job. Socializing drains me, routine destroys me and novelty terriefies me. My ADHD won't allow me to be productive on my own, my anxiety paralyzes me any time it matters. I'm not pretty enough to do porn. I've hated every job i had, i've failed every time i tried school. I'm not suited to live. And people are shocked when i say i want to die.
