I donâ€™t want to be here anymoreI feel like iâ€™m just dragging myself along through each day. I have nothing to look forward to anymore. I have no happiness anymore. I have no motivation to do anything and iâ€™m failing almost all my classes so I feel so fucking pathetic and useless. I basically have no friends left too. At this point iâ€™m tired of trying, Iâ€™m tired of hearing â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€ because it hasnâ€™t and i donâ€™t see any way that it will. I donâ€™t even know what i want to do in the future because i feel like iâ€™m not good at anything. I honestly donâ€™t even see myself having a future at all. People always tell me to just find a hobby or to find something thatâ€™ll distract me from feeling this way, but that doesnâ€™t work at all anymore. Nothing i do makes me happy anymore, nothing brings me joy. I feel so fucking alone every single day. I feel like iâ€™ll never matter to anyone, no one will ever care about me or love me. Iâ€™m about ready to just give up and end it, i donâ€™t care anymore. I just want to be happy again, i donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore, i donâ€™t want to be stuck here anymore.
