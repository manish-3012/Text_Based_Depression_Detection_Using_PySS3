My GPA (2.53 after 3 semesters) is too low for gradschool and all I want to do is to put a nice warm bullet into my skull 

Got recently got banned from [r/ausguns](https://www.reddit.com/r/ausguns/) for saying I want to commit suicide in an Australian shooting range but whatever, I am going to do it anyway like a man, either that or sell all my belongings and book a one way ticket to Hong Kong (got some family members there so might as well try to help them against the oppression there).

Just failed my calculus 2 final, (covering laplace, vector calculus, and complex calculus) and just feeling hopeless (my university requires students to pass the final to pass the course). My 2.53 on a scale of 4 GPA (4.429 on a scale of 7) after 3 semesters of study means I will never get to grad school. I am Australian so grad school is an nonnegotiable necessity for me to work in the industry I want to which happens to be space systems as I need an EB-2 visa (which requires a postgraduate degree) to get into the US as a US person. Well, it's either that or making a space related startup from scratch which is even harder than grad school. 

Now my life has no meaning whatsoever and I'm just sitting here listening to some depressing music.

To make things worse, I was once considered pretty bright in elementary and high school (graduated 91.45 percentile from high school). I worked all my life to try to reach this goal but now it's just gone to shit in two hours. Guessing I really did fail the 10 year challenge.

TL;DR: All my entire life's work and dreams gone in a matter of two hours.
