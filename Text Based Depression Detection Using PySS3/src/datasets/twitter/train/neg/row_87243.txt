I hate myselfI hate everything about myself. I always ruin a good thing and then loathe in self pity when things go bad. I ruined one of the best things in my life and I even made my best friend hate me because of my actions. Instead of actually listening to him I just pushed him away. I took everything for granted and now I'm alone because I was stupid. I'm a ugly person, inside and out. Everything about is bad and I don't want to do this anymore.
