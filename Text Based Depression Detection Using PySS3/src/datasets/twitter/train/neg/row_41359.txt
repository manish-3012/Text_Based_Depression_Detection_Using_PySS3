I canâ€™t cope. Might as well just do itEvery day is a constant battle. I stay in bed for 2 hours each morning, thinking why I should get out of bed. The only reason I do is so that I donâ€™t piss/shit myself. I then have breakfast, stay in my room, lunch, stay in room, dinner, stay in room and go bed. Thatâ€™s the life Iâ€™ve been living for over a year now. Iâ€™ve had therapy, Iâ€™m on antidepressants and nothing seems to be working. Iâ€™m currently waiting for more therapy but I donâ€™t know how to cope anymore. One day I feel like Iâ€™m gonna burst and do something stupid.

I thought about ways I could harm and kill myself; I have scissors in my room so I could cut myself, I could try and OD on my antidepressants, I could buy a rope and hang myself, I could stab myself or cut my throat, I could go to my nearest shopping centre and jump off the highest level. The amount of the detail Iâ€™ve gone into for each possibility is terrifying. Iâ€™m so scared that if I tell anyone this, Iâ€™m gonna have leave home. 

I know itâ€™s stupid, I know itâ€™s dumb and I know itâ€™s a cop out. I just donâ€™t know what to do with myself anymore and how to cope with day to day. Everything I use to love, I hate now. Too many anxieties limit myself on what I can do. Iâ€™m just an empty ship sailing the ocean, with no life in me
