Getting away will be my only chanceAs soon as I'm 18 I need to get away from my parents or I can't let my self get to 19. I had a job for a month but quit because I needed more time to do something i need to gradute and my mom told me every time she took me that having to drive me for my job was ruining her weekends. I can't bare to think about living around that excuse of a mother for even a second longer than I have to but I don't know how to get the money or get to college without her doing the FAFSA. I dont even have a drivers licence let alone a car. I feel so behind other 17 year olds and like a mistake.
