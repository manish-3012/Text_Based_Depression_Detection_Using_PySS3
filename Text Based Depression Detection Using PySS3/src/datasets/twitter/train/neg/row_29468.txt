Today is the dayI've bought some rope, and I am going to go to a nearby forest to hang myself. It should be a hidden place, so not many people will find my body. I apologize to the person or people who do.

I am a horrible person. I am selfish. I have too much anxiety all the time, and I want it to stop. I have a therapy appointment today, but I don't think it'll do much good. I don't want to be involuntarily committed to a hospital.
