It doesnâ€™t get better.I had a few weeks where I THOUGHT my suicidal thoughts were subsiding.. but unfortunately I was wrong because now Iâ€™m full blown just as suicidal as Iâ€™ve ever been. I hate it so much I donâ€™t understand why some of us had to be suicidal! Makes me so goddamn upset, this thread has a massive amount of subscribers and itâ€™s sickening, itâ€™s down right not fair that so many of us have to struggle I feel for every single person that feels this way. Itâ€™s just not right. Hopefully death will be exactly what we think it will be. 
TOTAL PEACE. Something none of us have ever felt on this god forsaken place.
