My friend was taken to the hospital for threatening to kill himself today. He's estranged from his family. How can my friends and I be informed of his status if we are not a family members?I am worried about him being released from the hospital alone. When he was taken in he had no ID, no phone, etc. His girlfriend gave her contact number to the police, but other than that we are completely in the dark. He does not have a relationship with any of his family. 

Does anyone know what my friends and I can do to find out information like his status, and when/if he'll be released?

Some additional info: He's been abusing alcohol heavily for that past few months. So he may need additional medical treatment for alcohol abuse.
