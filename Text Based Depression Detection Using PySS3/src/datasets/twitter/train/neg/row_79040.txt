I drove to the lakeI picked the place of death and I know how I want to die. 
I sat there while it was raining outside my car speaking to my dad and crying. 
I have no one. No one gives a shit about me and I think that's why I'm such a people pleaser...because I need some kind of "affection".
I have bipolar disorder and I'm off medication. 
I'm the lowest I've ever been and I have no support.
Just "it's too bad" "work through it"
I asked to come home but I cant. That's fine. I'm poison and I will ruin their happy family

I'm going to die at the end of this month. Its decided. 
I'm going to do it. 

Because it's never going to get better. I will be in pain for the rest of my life. 

Speaking to my step mom, I am speaking to the very root of all of my hurt. 

And she's looking at me like I am a fuck up.

I sat there and realized how selfish I am.
How could I just bother them like this? Come to their house and ruin their happiness?

I destroy everything around me. 

So that's that. I'm going to do it. 

I asked for birthday and Christmas lists because I wont be here. I'm going to buy everything and then leave. 

Theres relief right now but mostly I'm numb.  

It's nice to know theres an exit.
