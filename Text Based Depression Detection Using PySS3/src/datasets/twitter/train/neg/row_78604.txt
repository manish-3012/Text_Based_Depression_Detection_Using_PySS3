How was you day today?For me it was pure shit, I was born in Bulgaria and while being here day by day I learned how corrupted and retarded people can be, I wanted to be sure that there is hope, that people who have actual jobs try to work like they should and not make someone else's life a piece of shit forever, so this is how it went down

Today I was in school and learned that most teachers say that I don't go to their class and if I do I do bad shit around just because "they don't like me" and apparently they CAN do this since I don't really have any video/audio proof that they are wrong since they get our phones away while in class checking if there's something on like camera recorder on and other stuff, so they decided to say that I don't go to school anymore. they always hated me but since this is my last year here they decide to get me out and screw me up and the principal is currently deciding if he should make me homeschooled which guarantees I won't make it with good grades at all and really I SHOULD since I'm actually the only one doing homework and writing in class, and I SHOULD find a job that pays us enough to pay all the debt we are in since our current income ~400 $ only because the boss lies he doesn't have more money yet I see how rich he is, but that's the only place I can work, but the problem really is that the idiots in school really want to screw my life over and the only proof I have is this text right here, changing school isn't really possible right now because it's my last grade and I think the principal also is on the big plan since I said I want to get out like 1-2 months ago and he still works over the documents. Anyways , the reason they hate me might be because the first month of our school this year I had some problems with sleeping, feeling way to stressful for no reason resulting in me not being able to sleep whenever I should, they knew my condition was bad but they are way to stupid to actually get what's wrong with me. or we could say the reason is that "they just don't like how I look", at least that's what they say. so now I'm fucked, I will have bad grades and I might not even make it through resulting in me being with no school since they want it that way (won't be 12th grade again believe me I know these guys) and I won't be good enough for ANY college, resulting me being on a shitty job or even homeless, with no job. So my plan is I'll see how bad my life can get and if I don't get a heart attack or anything I might search for some pretty nice, and simple ways to kill myself.

So how was your day today?

It might be hard to understand the fuckery I wrote the fist time you read it, but currently that stress with the sleeping problems is probably coming back, I'm not an optimist but the good thing is that NOW I KNOW why I'm stressed out 24/7, it's because THE WHOLE FUCKING SCHOOL WANTS ME TO FAIL SO I WONT EVEN HAVE THE SHITTY LIFE I HAVE ATM

PS: about the month with the sleeping problem - I also remember my heart hurting, that's because of the stress so I guess the heart attack-kind of thing is more possible?...idk
