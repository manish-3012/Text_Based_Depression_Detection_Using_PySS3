Help Me To Help AnotherI checked up on my ex's twitter after about ten years apart. Not the first time I've done this, but the most worrisome. She didn't mention suicide but I've never seen her like this. She has a lifelong history of severe PTSD from childhood abuse. She was maybe 26 when we broke up and I never noticed anything too concerning except some panic attacks and a psychotic screaming episode involving flaying a large knife through the air in my vague direction. She had taken Wellbutrin for depression but she never seemed paranoid aside from a few episodes and I only recently started noticing some of her tweets getting very obsessive about extreme conspiracy, tweeting for hours on end and live streaming, frequently switching dialects and accents and referring to herself in the third person, conducting journalistically styled interviews with herself.  It's probably just boredom or something, but we are middle aged now and it's a bit concerning since I've never heard her so gloomy and negative, never at all dissociative, but now so very much so. I may have missed the possibility that she has some kind of severe personality disorder. I never noticed any dissociative behavior before and she just appears very lonely and desperate about the state of the world. 

Anyhow, I don't know if there's anything I can do to help her. I'm reluctant to contact her directly and I'm worried sending anyone of our mutual friends might trigger her or somehow screw things up. We have one good friend I know never hurt her, but she probably doesn't even remember him. Is it a bad idea to request someone a welfare check? I'm worried to even alert her that she'll guess who did it. One of her more recent relationships ended in a mysterious death, which was probably just a suicide, but still is worrisome. I just feel so bad and I feel like I could help, but it would strain my marriage, so I don't know if there's anything I can do at all.
