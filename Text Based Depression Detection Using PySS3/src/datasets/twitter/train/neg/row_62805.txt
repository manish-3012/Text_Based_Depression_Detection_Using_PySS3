NothingWhat really do I have to live for? I don't have anyone I could call a real friend, no one wants me romantically, I'm stupid and worthless. The only reason o stay alive is because of my parents, they seem to be the only ones who really care about me ( I'm aware that I'm privileged in that regard) but I have no future, so why do I keep going?
