I dint know whyI really don't know why I'm doing this. Writing this post, yeah, I've thought about it before but actually doing it... I dunno. Well, I'm thinking of killing myself. Nothing new really, it's been a semi-constant thing since I was about 11 or 12. I've tried a few times. Hanging myself, pills, razor, more pills, even tried jumping once. But nothings worked, most of the time one of my friends found me or texted.or called and I felt obligated to answer and hang out with him. My life isn't horrible in the least, i have a decent paying job (granted, it sucks), and I have people who care about me. I just can't be happy, I guess.

Yeah, I have moments where life is good, and I'm happy, but overall I just feel miserable. It's like I can't do anything right, and I just bring everyone down. I've stopped talking to my family because I don't want to burden them with my baggage and most of my friends for the same reason. The one friend that I talk to almost everyday has his own problems which I try to help with but I still can't bring myself to tell him everything that's going on. 

He knows a lot about what's going on with me but not all of it, just because I can't bring myself to tell him. He knows about 2 of the attempts and a reason or two why but I can't tell him everything. 

I don't know if it's depression, bipolar or something else that makes me feel this way, like I don't belong in this world and whatnot, but I can't keep going on. I guess the main reason I've kept on this long is because of the promises I made to people: yeah, I can do that; yeah, I can get that done; etc. But those promises and tasks have run out. They were what kept me alive, something to keep me going. Now there's nothing. And I don't want to make more. 

I guess this is it.
