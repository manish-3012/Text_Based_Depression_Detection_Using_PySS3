Need helpMy girlfriend broke up with me the other day, we were about to be 4 years in February. She's been talking to this other guy and hung out with him. She admitted to liking him and he makes her feel special. I'm 18 years old and been having thoughts of suicide because it's not about him &amp; her it's the fact that I actually loved this girl. I started dating her in 8th grade and I'm about to graduate high school in a few months. I need help on what to do with life right now. I have no motivation, she says we will eventually get back together but that's most likely when things don't work out with the new guy. Help
