cannot do thisi am drunk enough to actually be honest about this I've been depressed as fuck for years ever since. a major major concussion and I've always just been going Day by day to make sure I dint hurt anyone else with my own pain but I think I'm finally ready to go I've been gradually taking everything I can find in my room and the only thing I regret is the pain that I'm going to inflict on my family and friends. i love you all please dont go down the same road as me
