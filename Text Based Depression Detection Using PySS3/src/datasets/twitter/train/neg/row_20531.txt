I keep getting intermittent thoughts about suicide, and each time they come back they feel stronger.Recently my life has been a mix of positives and negatives. 

I was accepted to transfer into a relatively prestigious university for my desired major. That was good, but for some reason I felt no satisfaction, despite having worked hard for it. 

My girlfriend and I of 14 months recently broke up. Itâ€™s been 4 months now, but I really miss her. We didnâ€™t have a bad breakup either, it was just the fact that we were attending different universities across the entire country (sheâ€™s a year younger than me so she wasnâ€™t in uni yet). I canâ€™t stop thinking of her, she really was the perfect girlfriend. 

Right now I work a job that I absolutely hate. Itâ€™s 40 hours a week and pays decent but itâ€™s dangerous and physically taxing. I want to quit but my parents threaten to kick me out of the house if I do. I donâ€™t have anywhere else to go. 

Idk maybe the general ambiance of the world doesnâ€™t help. 

I have long held the belief that life is primarily suffering and it is broken up with intermittent moments of happiness, not the inverse. That kinda led me to the belief that in some scenarios suicide can certainly be rational and lack moral culpability. 

That leads me to the thought process that if I have no one who cares about me and I decide to suicide, itâ€™s not wrong and may even be objectively correct. 

That thought process coupled with my own negative emotions have caused me to grow increasingly suicidal :(

Sorry for the rant. 

Anyone have tips in general or specifically how to move on from my girlfriend?
