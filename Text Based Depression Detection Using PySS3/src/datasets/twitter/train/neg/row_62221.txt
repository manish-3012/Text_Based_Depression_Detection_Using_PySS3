I need advice.Hey everyone.

All my life I have been the guy who made people laugh, and smile, and in a way I love doing that. But the thing is, I can't deal with my own problems and thoughts. I've been wanting to die for the past three years, and I've only just turned 16. I feel like a pathetic idiot, who's only a pain in the ass, for everyone he meets.

I have been having a rough couple of weeks, and I need to know why I shouldn't just kill myself.... Even though I wouldn't have the fucking balls to do it.

thanks
