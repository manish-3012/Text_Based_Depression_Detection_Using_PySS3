Please someone talk to meEvery day for the past 5 months has been worse than the next. I hate myself so much I canâ€™t take much more. The girl I love wouldnâ€™t marry me, and now sheâ€™s marrying someone else. Iâ€™m trans and thought she was my forever love. Things I used to like bring no happiness anymore. I feel used and empty of everything except negativity and regret. Iâ€™ve had depression my whole life, but my body physically hurts. My face hurts from frowning. I never knew I could hurt this much.
