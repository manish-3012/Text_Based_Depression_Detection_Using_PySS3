I don't have a reason to live. But my suicide would be the final straw that would ruin my family.I am 25 years old male and contemplating suicide. Didn't finish college, never had a long term job, never had a girlfriend, virgin, bad health. My dad is severely depressed. It would be the end of him if I killed myself. My mom would probably kill herself as well. I have a grandma and a younger brother who need to be taken care of. What's the point of going on? Why should I prolong the suffering? The only thing I have going for me is my high IQ ( official Mensa test - 144 ). But maybe it's a curse.
