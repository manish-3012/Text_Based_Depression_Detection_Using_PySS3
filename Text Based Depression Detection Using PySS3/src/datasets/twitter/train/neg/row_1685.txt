I can't get it out of my headI don't feel like I definitely want to die but I'm getting a bit too close for comfort I think. I've made a pro and con list. Six pros for one con.b I've been googling different ways to do it,how painful they are,their success rate,how easy they are to achieve.
I just feel like it'd be just easy and peaceful and I wouldn't have to think about this anymore. But I know this feeling comes and goes in stages. A little while of this and a little while of feeling normal,but the little whiles of this are stretching out longer and longer. And I'm lying to everyone and when I try to be honest  it's about how they feel or noone can handle it or I should just take pills and get over it. I don't really want to die I don't think but I just want to stop thinking this way.
