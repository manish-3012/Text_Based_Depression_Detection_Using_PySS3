Hey, does someone have time to talk to me for a while? I'm in a bad place.I don't feel like typing the whole story out here. My girlfriend, who I've stayed with through some pretty awful times, just broke up with me over the phone for no real reason. I just don't think she even realizes how poorly she handled this breakup thing, and how badly it hurt me.
