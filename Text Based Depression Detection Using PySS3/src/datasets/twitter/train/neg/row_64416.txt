Doesnâ€™t it make more sense to kill myself now than witness the apocalypse ?Throwaway, I donâ€™t want family and friends finding this. 
Yeah the world is completely screwed. Iâ€™ve just gotten out of a 5 month long panic attack where I was convinced I convinced I had a disease of some sort, turns out it was all my anxiety physically hurting me. Well one the biggest triggers for that, aside form the pandemic, was the Aussie fires. Iâ€™ve always been scared of climate change but I used to pull myself through by believing we had time and that eventually, world leaders would see it doesnâ€™t make sense to ignore it anymore. After the reaction towards the fires my faith in a future completely shattered. You _cannot_ convince me weâ€™re not in the endgame anymore. People, like my family and friends, are gonna die slow and horrible deaths, wondering why Godâ€™s abandoned them while world leaders go hide in their bunkers and get a few more years in their belt. 
So the Aussie fires and the pandemic and other shit in my country literally broke. I physically couldnâ€™t get out of bed some days because Iâ€™d see nothing but everyone I love dying in painful ways. 
I dunno how I got out of it, but I donâ€™t _want_ to go through that again. Iâ€™m seeing the symptoms again, the tremors, the spikes of fear, the running thoughts.
Itâ€™d be better to just off myself now than have my nightmare come true. Cause itâ€™s gonna come true and I canâ€™t stand being the only one believing it. 
Unless you can prove to me thereâ€™s a future, whatâ€™s the point in staying ? Lifeâ€™s gonna get worse.
