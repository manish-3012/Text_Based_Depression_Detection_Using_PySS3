People don't like meHas anyone else experienced something like this?  People not liking you for no reason and even when you don't talk people still find a reason to pick fights with you? It's hard because if you just lay down and take it they'll just keep doing it more and more and it getting worse every time. It hurts man, online it's easier to make friends so it probably has something to do with the way I look or my voice or something. Parents,friends don't like me but online people do like talking to me for some reason. I'm kinda just glad there are people that want to even talk to me but it gets lonely sometimes you know
