Itâ€™s never gonna get betterEvery year I wait for it â€œto get betterâ€ and Iâ€™m only 16 and life still isnâ€™t getting better itâ€™s like each year the universe is like fuck you and it just keeps getting worse Iâ€™m at my lowest. Thereâ€™s no getting better . Thereâ€™s actually nothing to live for. Whatâ€™s the point of breathing. I wish I had the guts to kill myself.
