I have to kill myself or go to a hospital right away.I cant take it.  It's been hanging over me like a dark cloud for years. It got me involuntarily held for a week once before.  The desire to escape. 

It's in me now. It on me. It's all that's left. I know its selfish. I know people think it's insane and childish. Idgaf. 

One of two things is about to happen today. I'm going to walk in yue woods with a rope,  or find a hospital to check into. 

I dont want to be helped though I just want to end it
