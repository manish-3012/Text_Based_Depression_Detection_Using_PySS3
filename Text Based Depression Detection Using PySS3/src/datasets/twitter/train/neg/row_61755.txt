Is this all there really is to life?How can i entertain myself when life is so empty and meaningless? I feel like i am not doing nothing and i am worthless, Nothing can get me to feel something except alcohol and cigarettes so what is really the point? Do we even have free will? Like yes we think and all that but to live we need to do things we do not want so is it really living? We need to adapt but is it worth is to adapt? Is it worth it to do things you don't want so u can just live? If u have free will and u want to live happy why is that not possible? How can u be happy when u do things that make ur mood go down? I don't really know what to do with my life. Random thoughts
