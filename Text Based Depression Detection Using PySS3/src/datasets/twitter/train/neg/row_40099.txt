Is part of becoming an adult losing authentic excitement for living and for the future?I crave having a zest for life and being actually excited for the future. The last time that I did I was 12 years old. I am now 27.

I haven't felt true love with being alive and experiencing things, or pure excitement for the future, in over 15 years.

Is this normal? 

Everyday I try so hard. I am the friend that people love being around because I'm so upbeat and excited. And being this way does make me happy because I make others happy. But I am fucking dead on the inside.

My 2 cats are why I haven't killed myself. My family too, but to a lesser extent because I could write them a note. I would rather endure this pain than to ever even imagine my babies wondering what happened to me.

Please, I need to know that others feel the same way?

I'm in so much pain every single day. And sometimes the good days do make me want to stay. But fuck... i can't do this for the rest of my life.

I love you all and thank you for reading this far
