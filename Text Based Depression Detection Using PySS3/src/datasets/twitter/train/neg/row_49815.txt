Divorces and school and also being a kidAhh. The divorce life, see my dad every other weekend. See my mom on school days. It's too much. Everybody hates me because i'm fat, and I accept it now. The internet portrays me as this horrible person. My parents check my phone, can't say much. Sorry. I'm just feeling like crap. I'm only 10, wondering if anybody else felt like this.
