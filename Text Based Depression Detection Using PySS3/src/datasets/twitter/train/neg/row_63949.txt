Planning to die todayI'm just so overwhelmed that I can't cope any more. 

I'm pregnant and the father is walking out on us. Says he'll be moved out by the end of the week. Leaving me here with his mother, unable to pay the bills. Over nothing. Because he's stressed and he blames me. Because I was concerned about his drinking. Because I have an attitude and I don't even know what that means. 

But really because he's drinking. It makes him a man I don't even know. 

He says I don't really love him I just think I do. Well I feel like I'm the one who isn't loved. If I ever meant anything to him then how can he just abandon me? I'm not perfect or anywhere close but I have loved him with all of my being, always. I have put him first and I have never kept anything from him that was within my power to give. 

I don't understand how my feelings for him could ever be in question. Or not be enough. I don't understand why I cry until my eyes hurt and he's just fine. Fuck he acts like he's moved on and looking for a replacement. 

He won't even be hurt when I'm gone. His mom will be more upset than he will. His brother is more likely to be honestly sad. 

To him I'll just be something to dwell on when he's drinking. Something to tell the next girl, pretend like he's really opening up and letting her in. But really it will mean nothing. 

I don't even know if I should bother leaving a note. I truly don't want to make him feel guilty or bad. I just want to not hurt. But I couldn't write a note that would convince him I love him, or that it was anything other than his fault. And it is his fault I guess. I just don't want that to be what he feels about it. 

I have a few hours before he goes to work and leaves me free to get to the gun. I guess I can think about note vs no note.
