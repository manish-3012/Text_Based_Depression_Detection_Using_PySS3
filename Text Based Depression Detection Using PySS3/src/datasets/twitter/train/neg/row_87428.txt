I want commit suicide but don't want to tell anyone IRLI feel like a failure and I hate everything about myself. I'm stupid, ugly (2/10 face), autistic, have no social skills, anger issues, confused and can't relate to anyone. Kids at school call me ugly everyday and remind me how incompetent I am. I think even my teachers hate me. No matter what I say people always make fun of me and then when I stand up for myself they play the victim. I get that (most likely) everyone hates me for being ugly and stupid and that's okay I guess. I have almost no friends. I mostly don't talk to people unless I have to. Sometimes I get stuck when I speak irl and my speech gets blocky. I feel worthless. I'm physically healthy (5'9" 160lbs M17) and other kids think I'm strong but those are the only positive traits I have.  I have the ugliest face in school and everything else about me makes me wanna kill myself 100 times over. I've never attempted because of possibly getting a life altering injury/illness or having someone confront/find me. I want a permanent method. I just want my death to be quick and painless and alone. I really don't want to talk to anyone irl about this because I think people would just treat me worse. If anyone found out irl I'd probably just suicide out of rage/fear or do anything to convince them otherwise. Are there any good online resources and help without anyone irl finding out? I think I would just feel worse if I talked to someone irl. 

Sorry if my post doesn't make sense.
