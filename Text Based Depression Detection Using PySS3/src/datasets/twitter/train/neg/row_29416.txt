Looking for someone to talk to -- I've gotten so much worse within the last 6 monthsJust as the title suggests... but I'm really tired of talking to young people (teens) about this, I'm just looking for solid advice because I've noticed I've thought about suicide probably everyday the last few months. Anyone mind texting?
