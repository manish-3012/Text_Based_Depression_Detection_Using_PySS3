Suicide tonightIâ€™m considering a large od of benzodiazepines tonight after binging on alcohol all day. Things are not going to get better because I donâ€™t seem to want to get better. I wasnâ€™t in a good place to begin with but I knew it was a bad idea to binge(food), purge, drink, and then cut, and yet I made all those decisions. Iâ€™m just hurting everyone I know at this point. I need to rip the band aid off. I was supposed to have an assessment for day hospital tomorrow but they called and delayed a week. I had a little hope that they might have been able to help but that feeling has left. Iâ€™m going to eat this pizza I just cooked, finish watching Russian doll, and then Iâ€™m going to do it.
