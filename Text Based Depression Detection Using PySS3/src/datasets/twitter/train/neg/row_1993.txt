Tired of One Sided conversations and Feeling UnmotivatedThis will probably be a Mess but anyways. 
I've tried reaching out and making friends For a couple months and it always goes 
"How's your day bin?"
"Pretty good" 
And that's it, Genuinely don't know what's wrong with me, I think people find me uninteresting which is not surprising. 
I'm Boring, My Boyfriend only talks about himself and when I tried reaching out he said "You'll be fine, sorry I'm not good at helping"
I try making Lgbt+ friends since I'm a Bisexual Guy, but still I can't find anyone who will have a genuine conversation instead of 
"Yeah I'm doing good"  What's wrong with me? I have no real life friends either I lost them when my parents put me in Homeschool.
I'm having triggering thoughts Lately, With Politics and being inside A Trump supporting Family I've come to the conclusion that I'm not Making it passed 18, Or making any friends. 
I also have issues with telling my entire life story in the first 5 minutes lol.
