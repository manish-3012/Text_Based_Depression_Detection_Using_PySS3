doing it makes sense nowIâ€™ve been depressed for like 18 months but always pretty firmly in the mindset â€œI can keep going cause things might get better.â€ I can still keep going. I can probably keep going forever. I just donâ€™t want to anymore. Iâ€™m never going to be normal. Iâ€™m always going to be a fucking reclusive incel loser. It doesnâ€™t matter how much money I make or how much weight I can lift. Iâ€™m still so fucking weird and weak at my core, Iâ€™m going to be alone forever. I donâ€™t have it in me to learn how to talk to people. Iâ€™m almost 26. The time for that has passed.

Even though I can keep going it doesnâ€™t make sense to do so, because I know things arenâ€™t going to get better.
