YeahI don't consider myself depressed or suicidal but there are times when I just know how worthless and fucked up I am and that I deserve to die. I usually get through it with minimal self harm but I know that some day in the future I'm gonna fuck up bad and hate myself for it and kill myself. And that the world will be better off for it. That's pretty much it.
