I hate the one liners and phrases people say to encourage me not to end my life. Stuff like "Death isn't the answer" doesn't do any good for anyone. It's so monotone and low effort, it makes me even more suicidal.Conversations with people about this topic are absolutely dreadful. They say the same things to me that don't do anything productive. My favorite one is "Do you have any interests or hobbies?" And I would answer with *insert hobby here* and then what the other person would say is "Just use that as your reason to live, and consume yourself in your work." And then end of conversation.

I hate these types of conversations, I don't hate the person who asks them but It really doesn't do anything productive for me. What I've noticed in some people is that they never want to know who you are or where you're from. They just want to stop you from killing yourself so that they can feel good about themself, without helping at all. I'm not talking about all people, a lot of people help, but a lot of people don't.

I just want to die so I don't have to be here anymore. I'm the one that's a plague to the world. I am good for nothing and have nothing that I am even close to being skilled at, I'm a below average person in every category, I don't have any intention of progressing in my life, all I do for people is ruin their day and leave them with negative emotions. I have never had friends in my life, my mother prefers drugs over me, even my father cared so less of me that he left before I was even born. 

All I ever do now is continue on my sad, sad, existence, filled with masturbation, sleeping, playing video games, eating, rinse and repeat, I don't have the energy to do anything else.
