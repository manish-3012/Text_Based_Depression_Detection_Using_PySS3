I don't know why I'm here anymore.I'm 21 and I've been a colossal failure. I know there's the sentiment of "You're young, it'll get better!", etc, but I'm stuck in a rut and I have no foreseeable way of getting out of it. I live with my mom. I'm single, unemployed, a college dropout, and I don't even have a car or a license to get me to a job. I don't know where my life is going. I don't have any friends or anyone I'm close to anymore. I'm just existing, and I'm tired of it.

I'm seeing a therapist and honestly, I feel like it isn't helping. I feel like it's a waste of everyone's time to keep going. Killing myself is looking more and more tempting every day, because every day is more proof that I'm not needed.
