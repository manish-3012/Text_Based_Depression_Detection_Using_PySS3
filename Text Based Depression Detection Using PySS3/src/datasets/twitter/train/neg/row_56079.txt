I don't know what to do anymore.I have a serious case of depression and my parents send me to a clinic where I spend about one month there. Now I don't have any agressive in me but I need someone on my side 24/7 and have no privacy at all, I tried to go out and do things but it keeps getting more and more depressing. Tried to talk to a lot of people and no one gives a shit, do anything about it or want to hang out with me. I started seeing this girl and we were about to start a relationship, yesterday she moved out to the other side of the world so..
I really don't know what to do anymore.
