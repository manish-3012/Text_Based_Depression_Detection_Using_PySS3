Post TV show depression(Please don't make fun of me for this im begging you) I am here because my favorite cartoon show "My Little Pony: friendship is magic" ended a few months ago and I haven't been myself ever since. I've been depressed for the last few months instead of continuing on with my life (like I have been before the depression started) and accepting the fact that show ended (and no, im not one of those bronies to ask people they should watch the show). Its hard to accept that fact after I've been watching for 7 years now. I don't know what to do or what should I do?
