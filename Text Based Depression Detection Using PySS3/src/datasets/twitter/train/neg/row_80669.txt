A close internet friend of mine is talking about suicide and I dont know what to do.I have a friend who is only 15 and that ive known since January of 2014 who is talking about suicide. Hes talked about it before but now its gotten very serious, he was put in a mental hospital for a few days but lied to get out. He also is unwilling to do anything to get help and wont talk to anyone about it because he doesn't want to go back to the hospital. His mother has a degenerative disease that makes her unable to do many basic things and his father is always working or getting mad at him. I'm not sure if theres any physical abuse but his father gets angry at his grades and recently smashed his technology with a golf club after he broke his hand (I think in a rage). He doesnt care about others opinions on him commiting suicide and says that he wants it. I really dont know what to do and hes saying hes going to see how the month goes before he decides.
