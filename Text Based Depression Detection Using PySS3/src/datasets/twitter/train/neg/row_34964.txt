Today I finally admitted I want toI'm a 20 year old guy, who finally admitted to myself today that I want to end it. It hurts me so much to think of what my my mom and sister would have to go through, how my dog would be left without me, but I'm worthless. I can't get a job because I have pinched nerves in both arms that are taking forever to heal, meanwhile my mom is housing me but full of debt because of the bills she missed while recovering because my dad got drunk and broke her arm, I can't have a girlfriend because I developed allergies that if we even kissed I could have a reaction, I have almost no friends, and family members are starting to think I'm just like my deadbeat dad because I can't do much for now. My older cousin has been like an older brother to me my whole life, but I just don't feel like he cares about me anymore. My piece of shit of a father regularly texts me to see how I'm doing, and asks for favors. My other cousin who I have always thought of as a little brother has gone through a lot and is going down a dark path, and I love him so much I don't wanna see it get worse. I'm alone, and worthless. And because I've finally admitted what I want to do, I know I need help.
