i feel fucking brokenim only 15 and i feel like shit. I don't want to kill myself but can not wait for the day i pass away and leave everyone and everything behind. i feel like i have no real friends and the ones i am friends with talk shit about me behind my back or don't like me back as much as i like them. I feel disgusting about my looks and my personality and just want to break down and cry. I legit can not deal with this anymore and hate myself for feeling this way. I have no self confidence around people and feel anxiety in almost every situation im in. I don't want to speak to anyone about this because i feel that i cant trust anyone enough to tell them.. not having anyone to go to really fucking hurts and the friends i do have if i told them they would joke and laugh and not take me seriously.. I just need advice on what to do to make myself feel better again.
