One last post for the night: A STRANGE (and stupid) QUESTION:Sigh, Firstly I want to thank EVERYONE here for helping me out. I am still here because of you guys. I can't guarantee tomorrow, but for now I am still alive and here. I am also as sick as a dog with a freaking terrible head cold (can we say shitty immune system thanks to Anorexia?) but here.

I have a stupid question. You hear the term "mentally ill" thrown about quite a bit these days, but when I hear that term, I think of schizophrenia, psychosis...the bad things.

I know y'all aren't doctors, and I am not looking for a definitive MEDICAL diagnosis or anything (I will get that next week when I go to my appointment I am sure--finally a concrete name or names for all of this) but ...

Am I mentally ill? What the FUCK is wrong with me? 

Blah. I already have a dx (officially from a while ago) of Anorexia Nervosa, and I know that because I am on Disability and it is on there. Otherwise, I have no idea what is wrong with me. 

Meh. I was just wondering what your opinions are. That's all.

U__U I hate this feeling. I need sleep. Not happening though.
Damn insomnia.
