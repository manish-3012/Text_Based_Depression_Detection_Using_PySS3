I'm sick of this shitI'm 13 and cause of that no one takes me seriously. My mom is abusive, i was misdiagnosed with aspergers and for the past 6 years ive been manipulated into believing i have it, until recently i just discovered it was likely  misdiagnosed, you see, society likes to label people just for having a few problems, ive been treated like a retard for the past 6 years. I plan on getting undiagnosed. My mom always dehumanizes me, as she believes i have it and sees me as nothing more than a retard. She spreads lies to people, yells at me for not doing things she never even asked me to do in the first place. She doesn't buy enough food, if i report her, no one will take me seriously. Today was my first day of online school, fuck the education system, were doing shit kindergartens can do, we don't need half the shit we learn. My mom comes into my room every five fucking seconds to scream at me. Im typing this, i just left the fucking zoom call, i dont care anymore, i have no friends, ive just given up, theres no escape from this shithole. My only escape from reality is shows, but i have nothing to watch things on besides youtube, so thats fucking great. Fuck society, fuck school, fuck covid, fuck my shitty life. I want to die so bad. Every second im with my mom she yells at me, she comes into my room to check on me and my work, she screams at me, just an endless fucking cycle, i hate it here. And before you say "how do you know you dont have it" its cause ive realized none of the autistic traits fit me, i dont have any autistic traits, just manipulated into believing i have something i dont, as back then i was more vulnerable and believed what people said
