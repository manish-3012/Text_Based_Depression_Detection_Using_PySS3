I don't think I'm suicidal, but I wouldn't mind being dead.So basically starting over the summer life came up and kicked me in the head. I graduated high school and started college, got into an argument with the best friend, plus about a million other things, got really depressed and grades started slipping. 
All of this put a huge strain on my relationship with my girlfriend, who is the only one who knows I was depressed, though she had no idea just how bad it was.

I've been working at feeling better and it's paid off, me and the friend buried the hatchet, I've gotten a lot closer with my girlfriend, I'm set to do a lot better in school next semester.

So I finally get my life in order after months, yet I still constantly think of suicide. I don't think I even seriously consider it, but anytime I have a thought or something happens that I don't like, even the slightest thing. I think that I'll just kill myself. Of course thinking like this day after day certainly doesn't help me being depressed.

So today some stuff happened that I didn't like. I spent about 2 hours thinking about suicide, and now here I am back to feeling just as bad as when I was in the worst of being depressed.


I'm sure my girlfriend would give me support if I talked with her, but I don't want her to worry, nor put any more stress on our relationship.

Constantly having these thoughts really sucks when the thing you want most is to just move on. I can think just back to the beginning of this year and remember how happy I was. I'm just not sure what to do.
