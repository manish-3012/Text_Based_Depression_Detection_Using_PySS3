Not sure what to do...about 2 and a half weeks ago, I feel in love with this guy. He tried to help me talk about things I haven't been able to talk about before (getting raped, deaths in family and friends, etc). Last night we had a huge blowout fight, and he's instructed me to never talk to him again. He's blocked and deleted me on facebook, and I really feel like I am going to go through with my plans. I have no one to talk to, all my friends are out of town this weekend. My roommate knows nothing about this.
