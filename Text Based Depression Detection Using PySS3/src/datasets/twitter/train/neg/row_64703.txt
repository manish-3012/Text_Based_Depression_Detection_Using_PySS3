Should I wait until after finals17F. Bad life at a breaking point you've read it all before.
I'm fully prepared to do this.
I'm not prepared for it not working.
I'm afraid that if it doesn't, ill wake up in a hospital to even more stress.
Does it make more sense to do it now or after finals? I don't want to wake up and be bothered with failing all my 1st semester classes, god forbid I wake up. I don't want to wake up to anything.
I don't know where else to ask this.
I know its a weird question.
I know it makes it seem like I'm looking for a reason out. I'm not.
I just need some opinions. I'm buying supplies and cleaning up my things either way.
Thanks.
