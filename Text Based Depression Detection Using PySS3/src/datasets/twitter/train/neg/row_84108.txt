nothing else fills.I feel alone and out of control. My decision making abilities are impaired and I'm not sure what to do with myself. I have no one to talk to. Ever. About anything. I feel like I'm drowning. I've wanted to die since the first grade but I've been too damn scared to do anything about it. I don't want to wake up tomorrow. I don't want to remember anything. I want to quit.
