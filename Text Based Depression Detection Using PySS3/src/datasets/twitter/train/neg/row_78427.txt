Watching life slowly rip apartLockdown hitting the second time in a month, going to a psychology test and walking out feeling like you are the joke of the world, being suspected of smoking cigarettes, tried to quit, made it for like 8 months, now smoking these ciggs to numb away the pain on the balcony, looking at my childhood and realising I was never normal, learning to live with this depression, looking at myself in the mirror and laughing at my stupidity, being the joke of the generation, knowing that you are fucking useless about everything, looking at others who seem to have life figured out, not telling anyone about this shit, looking back at the mistakes I made, guessing what my life will be, but hey let's hope the dog I will hopefully get will help me with all this shit.
