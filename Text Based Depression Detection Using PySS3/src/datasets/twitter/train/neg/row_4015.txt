Few days away from my birthday &amp; feel like done with lifeI'm 22 soon 23, sophomore, the oldest kid in my college. I'm an intelligent, socially-adaptable, good looking man before mental illness fucked everything i can possibly imagined. I got fucked pretty bad, have to consume this pos antidepressant everyday. Today i just failed in one of a long list college organization interview. I failed everytime because my mental health botched all my power &amp; functionality. You want to be succesful in this or that? Try harder &amp; don't give up! Nope, if you're on this mental health situation, life will be harsh, punishing, BECAUSE of your own health regardless of your talents or qualities. I have a pretty gf my classmates are jealous, but i can't even function like normal dude. It's an unfun, unrewarding, boring life &amp; feel like i should've become something in my twenties instead of give a damn about my health everytime.
