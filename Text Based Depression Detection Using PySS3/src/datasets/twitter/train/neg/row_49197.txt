Goodbye, I guessI need help. I wanna kill myself, I'm gonna do it probably after school, if not then just as much pain as possible. 

I can't keep up, anxiety, full bus is really a problem for me, but I have no other option to get to school. I wanna cry, scream, whatever, I'm emotionless. The fuck is wrong? I should be happy problem free child, but I think expectations are too high.

Who am I to complain? Fucking child, others have bigger problems, then why am I bitching about it? I never asked to be a girl, I don't feel comfortable in my body, not too old enough to own a knife or gun. Yet my brother's friend got Swiss army knife, sooo... 

Fucking enough. Shit has been tough. I won't be a failure anymore. Just +1 on suicide lists. 

Bye, loved you all
