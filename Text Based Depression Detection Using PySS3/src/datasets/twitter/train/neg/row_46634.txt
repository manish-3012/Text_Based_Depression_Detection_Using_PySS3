HS senior stressed out to this extentI honestly feel like a failure. UC applications are due tomorrow, and I submitted yesterday. But I messed up on listing my extracurriculars by saying the word "I" in every sentence before actually saying the activity. My grades don't do much for me either. The thing is, I applied to a bunch of colleges, and I feel like absolute crap. Like being compared to others in pools of applicants, feeling dumb and unintelligent, and feeling like I'm going nowhere fast. I just feel like dying; I cry at least nine times a week because I feel like a disservice to my parents and those around me. I just want to end it. Sometimes I picture my own obituary and wonder about the reactions of other people around me. When it gets really bad, I think about self harm--but when I do it, it's not on a large scale, just enough for me to feel something. I feel numbed. At the same time, this whole process of college is taking a toll on my self-esteem that might drive me to suicide, and I can't opt out given the 4k or more my parents have already spent trying to help me succeed even though I'm pretty sure I'll fail.
