Hanging by a threadWhy go on. Tonight I jokingly asked my husband to call me his queen and instead he told me I look â€œtiredâ€. He then accidentally sent me a text that was obviously meant for someone else where he talked shit about me and completely lied about what had just happened. Iâ€™ve lost four pregnancies, no children, divorced once, and two months ago, my cat of 8 years passed of an unexpected illness. He was the only reason I was staying around. My career is going no where. Thereâ€™s no unfinished business. Iâ€™m just done.
