Boyfriend says he wants to kill himselfHeâ€™s always been a bit of a dark person. Iâ€™m also like that. I didnâ€™t chose to be alive and sometimes I hate it too. But today he told me directly he was done with life, that he didnâ€™t want to do this anymore. He lost his job recently due to covid, so he has no goals now.
What can I do?
