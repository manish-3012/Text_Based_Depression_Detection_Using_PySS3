I'm gonna end my life by inert gas asphyxiationI can't take it anymore. I really can't. I hate my life, I hate what I've become. It revolves around a person who doesn't even bother to start a conversation around me. It hurts so much. She won't even listen to me when I try to make amends. I still love her, and I don't know why. I'll be ordering a helium gas tank, and an oxygen mask within the next few days. I should be dead by Sunday. I hope my death will be painless. I have no purpose in life nor reason to live. I have been on the last draw for a while. It's about time I die. Goodbye, Reddit. It's been fun.
