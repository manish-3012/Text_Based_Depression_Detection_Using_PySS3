I honestly donâ€™t know what to do with myself anymoreIâ€™m 15 but I feel like my life is already over. I just want to fall asleep forever. My gpa went from average to completely nonexistent, I constantly push everyone away and struggle taking care of myself. Iâ€™m so exhausted. I try to tell my parent that but then he gets upset with me and says itâ€™s because of the phone. Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself for years now. I canâ€™t get therapy, my parent doesnâ€™t believe in it and frankly I donâ€™t blame him. There was a point in my life where I was on so much medication because of a doctor that I ended up in the hospital. After getting out of an abusive household I donâ€™t know how to function. All I think about is trying to kill myself. I end up forcing my emotions so much that Iâ€™m the end people try to stay away from me because Iâ€™m â€œfakeâ€. I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I donâ€™t want to be alive. I want to kill myself so badly. Iâ€™ve tried to get help in the past but no one actually cared.
