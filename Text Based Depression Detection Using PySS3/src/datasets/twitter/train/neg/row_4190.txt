I see no real reason to go onI've only lived 15 years and in those 15 years theres only heartbreak and troubles. The majority of my family have suffered from depression and terrible anxiety as I have. They usually turned to street drugs, like meth, heroin and weed. Which I know weed isn't too bad but still; anything like those are not the solution. My emotions range from incredibly happy to miserable. I'm failing school because of my lack of motive and my constant nihilism. I hate to play victim or blame my troubles on outside forces. I feel as if lifes only going to get worst and I should just end it. (I failed french and I have to drop it v.v.) I have a stream of absents from school as well thats most likely going to lead to my family going to court. And if it does the day before court I'll or the day we get the letter calling for attendance. I plan on shooting myself.
