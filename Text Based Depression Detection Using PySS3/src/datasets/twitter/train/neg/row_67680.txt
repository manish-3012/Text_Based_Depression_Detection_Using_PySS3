To those that will read this...My heart aches deeply, and I can feel it in my throat

Though it aches in silence,
And around it stands a wall

Who I am, and who I was, arent the same, but arent at all

Those that I share my existence with will only ever know the surface

They love, but dont truly know

Where it was, or when it was, that my heart did let go

The world tells us all that we have so much to prosper

But the world is not with us. Each is for their own.

So here I sit, in the dark, in the quiet. No lights, no sounds, but the creatures who reside inside it.

Empty is the room like empty is the heart, and what is the soul without the heart?

Looking to the world I ask these questions, but without a doubt, it begs the question.
