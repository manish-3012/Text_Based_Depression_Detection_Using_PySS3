Divine Comedy vs.Tragic Irony (Suicide Note)As I consider the methods by which I can end my life, I can't help but think about how your father ended his. My plan is similar but much less grisly; it is also ironic.

When I was optimistic about my future, I took meticulous care of my car. For example, if its check engine light came on, I would either immediately repair it myself or, in cases that required extensive labor, have it repaired by a mechanic.

Having failed to launch a career since I was in college, I no longer repair my car when that light comes on. As a matter of fact, my check engine light has been on for two years now, because its exhaust system is no longer efficient. That is, it is no longer efficiently reducing the amount of carbon monoxide the engine is producing.

Whereas your father violently took his own life in the family van, I'm too much of a coward to end mine that way. Instead, I plan on using the carbon monoxide my car is producing to slowly, painlessly asphyxiate myself.

To make the act easier to carry out, I'll probably park somewhere quiet, drink a case of my favorite beer, and then just get on with it.

Here's the tragic irony: Had my life turned out better, I could have afforded a new car or would have simply fixed it myself. Now, however, it is poised to be the death of me.

Don't worry. I don't have a spot picked out yet, but I'm working on it.
