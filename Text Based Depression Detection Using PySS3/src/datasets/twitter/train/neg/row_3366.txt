I wonâ€™t survive the weekend. Iâ€™m killing myself tonight.I feel so at peace now that Iâ€™ve committed to ending my life tonight. Iâ€™ve been in so much pain for so long and now I wonâ€™t have to face it every day. I wonâ€™t have to wake up each morning as this huge disappointment to myself and others. I wonâ€™t have to face my abuser day in and day out. Yeah, part of this is hugely selfish, but I hope that everybody who knows me can see how badly I need the pain to stop. 

If anybody out there knows who I am, know that is isnâ€™t in any way your fault. Thereâ€™s nothing you could have done to prevent this from happening. I believe that Iâ€™ve been depressed my whole life and the weight of it for the past 28 years has been exhausting. I hope you all will be happy to know that Iâ€™m at peace now. Iâ€™m still so sorry.
