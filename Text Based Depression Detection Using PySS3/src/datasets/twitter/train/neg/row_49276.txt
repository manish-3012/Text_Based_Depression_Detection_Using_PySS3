I'm really slipping, and I just... I need help.After months upon months of joblessness and depression, I'm afraid that my fiance is going to leave me. I haven't told him about how bad I've been because I don't want to stress him, and for some reason I haven't even been able to tell me friends how close I've come to killing myself in the last few months. I'm feeling like the current moment is... I need to talk to someone. I can't get a hold of anyone right now.

I don't see a way out of this. I've never felt worse in my life than I have over these past few months. I've been turned down for retail and everything. I have no sense of self-worth anymore.

Please talk to me.
