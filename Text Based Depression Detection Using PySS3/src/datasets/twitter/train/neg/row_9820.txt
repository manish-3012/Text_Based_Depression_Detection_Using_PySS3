Is anyone up for a chat?Im not in the verge of suicide but im pretty depressed in these few weeks. It seems like everything went downhill. I was the top 1 of the class last year. Now, im just in the 9th place. It was pretty upsetting. I really did my best this year but it seems like the teachers hate me and purposely giving me low grades. I have never had low grades before its degrading. I know its not the end of the world. But i really did my best with my tests and projects i just dont get why my grades are still low. I think i just need someone to talk to...
