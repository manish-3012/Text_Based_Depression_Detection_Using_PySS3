"but"im stressed. i feel like a monster who only hurts and burdens people, especially my family. i feel so fucking ugly and i hate knowing someone will always be more attractive than me and that my boyfriend will always find someone hotter even if he does love me. he tells me im the prettiest girl in the world to him but how can i compare to actresses, models, etc? im sure hes lying and just too nice. im afraid my life will never get better. i feel so alone, and like no one truly likes me or cares about me. every time i eat im kicking myself or imagining how clean and pure i would feel if i threw it back up. i want to not feel like this anymore.

but i dont know what will happen to me after i die

but im afraid it will hurt

but i dont want to make my family, my friends, and my boyfriend sad

but i dont want to feel like a quitter

but i have things i want to do

but i just dont know

edit: forgot to add a couple self pitying details that i wanted to vent out of my system
