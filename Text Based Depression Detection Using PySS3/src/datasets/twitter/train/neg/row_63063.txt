I don't know what to do anymoreI recently got on antidepressants and they seem to be helping my depression. However, I still can't shake the idea of suicide. Even if I am happy, I feel like I'd be better off dead. I have a boyfriend and a family who love me very much and Id feel guilty to just disappear and kill myself without them knowing but I genuinely can't shake the idea. I don't know why. The antidepressants have helped but I thought these thoughts would go away but I'm convinced I'd be better off dead (for everyone, in the long run.) It's so shitty to feel like this. Everytime I make a mistake the feeling is just amplified. I feel so bad telling the people I love because I know they'll just worry and it comes off like I'm a pity case, even though I hurt them through my mistakes, even if they're small. I hope I don't wake up tomorrow. I know it's an unreasonable wish, but I'm so tired of this. I wish there was a way to do it without hurting the people I love. I wish I didn't come off as selfish. I'm all out of tears :( I'm just so tired
