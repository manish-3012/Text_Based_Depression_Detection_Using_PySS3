I'm back, unfortunately...I wish I didn't have children or that I didn't care about them.  This would be so much easier.  :(

Just did an extended celebration of my 30th anniversary and still riding from that high.  Now my wife and I had a massive fight (no physical) over a misunderstanding and I feel like shit.  It's never good enough to have a misunderstanding and talk about about it.  It always has to be a stupid fight that escalates and then I start saying stupid shit like telling her to not come back when she escalates it by starting to pack stuff to leave.  In that moment I actually mean it because then I'd have enough impetus to just end myself and never have to deal with it again.  I'm not trying to make her sound like a horrible person...  she's one of the most beautiful people I've ever had the privilege to know and 99.9% of the time I can't believe how blessed I am to have her in my life.

I just can't deal with it anymore...  I've spent the majority of my life depressed and on the edge of suicide and I just want it to be over.  I know it would hurt her and that she'd find a way to continue on without me.  It would totally fuck up my children, though.  :(

I'm old, tired, and defeated and I just never want to feel this bad ever again.  It doesn't matter that it gets better; it just hurts too fucking much and I know it will never change.

It's not a temporary problem and I so much want a permanent solution. :(
