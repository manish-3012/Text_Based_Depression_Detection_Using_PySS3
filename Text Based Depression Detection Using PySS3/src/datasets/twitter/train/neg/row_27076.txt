I don't want to do this anymoreI (m25)found out on Friday my ex (f23) cheated on me with my best friend(m25). He had been the Guy I was working through the breakup with and the whole time he was seeing her behind my back. I just want them to feel the kind of pain and betrayal that I am feeling. I tried talking with another friend today and just cant stop crying. I've never felt more worthless. I've been wanting to kill myself for the last 12 months and this just feels like the time to do it. I've had my job fallout lost my place and stuck on a mattress at my alcoholic fathers house.
