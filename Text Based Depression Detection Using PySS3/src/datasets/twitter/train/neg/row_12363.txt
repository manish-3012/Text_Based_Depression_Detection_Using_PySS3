Everything was okay just two months agoEnglish is not my first language, i'm sorry if this is hard to read.

Just two months ago i was the happiest i've ever been. I thought i found someone who understood me, who knew exactly what made me happy and when i was depressed. I didn't see her in a romantic way, she was more of an older sister to me than anything.

Things were okay, even if i was a little annoying i knew she still loved me and cared about me, but my fucking idiotic brain had to fuck up everything. 

I started to think that she hated me, that she didn't care about me at all, that she only helped me out of pityness, so i started to ask her if it was true, if all of these insecurities had some truth to them. I just wanted to improve myself and be a better person. 

She of course told me that none of those insecurities were true, but at this point i just couldn't believe her at all. She hated me, it was a fact to me.

And now, 2 months later, that she does actually hate me i just don't know what to do. I just want to kill myself just for her, i feel that it's the only way she could feel better. I just want her to know how sorry i am for being such a shitty friend. I seriously don't care about my life at all, i never did. Suicidal thoughts don't scare me at all and i could easily grab my dad's gun and just pull the trigger. I don't care if things get better or if i meet someone else in the future, i already know i'm a terrible person, what's the point.
