I don't know what I should doI want to text one of my friends that I'm feeling suicidal but I don't know how they would react. I am currently having doubts about my religion which I don't really want to talk about. My step dad sometimes acts like an absolute piece of shit but other times he's really nice. My mum wouldn't really understand what I'm talking about and I don't want to talk about my problems to my dad. I feel like my best option is to talk to my friends but I don't know what's going to happen when I tell them.

I need some advice. This is a cry for help.

I think the only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my doggo and my friends. My dog wouldn't understand what happened to me and my friends would be so upset. I don't fucking know what to do. I have no idea. I don't want any of those shitty suicide advice quotes. I want something that applies to me. I don't care if it's selfish it's the only thing I have right now. Please give me advice.
