Always thereI attempted suicide when I was younger and failed miserably, the problem is now that I'm try to "get better" but every time things get really hard my mind always goes back to that feeling of trying to kill myself. If I'm being honest with myself, it all the time not even when times get hard that those thoughts pop up again. Is this there for anyone else? Do your suicidal thought never leave you alone? I can't kill myself right now because I made a promise not to try for another 20 years, so its really one of those things. Is there a way to deal with this?
