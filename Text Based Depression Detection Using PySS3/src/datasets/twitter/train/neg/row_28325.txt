I'm not why I'm doing this because it's pointlessI created new account just to post here. I'm not sure why. Most likely I'll never respond to anyone. I guess I just needed to talk. No, not talk. Attention. Just anything. So, I might tell my sad story here and read some of the responses - if anyone writes anything, that is. And for a bit I'll feel like someone gives a shit. Then I'll close my browser and go back to sleep.
  
  It's just words. No words can help me. I don't think anything can.
