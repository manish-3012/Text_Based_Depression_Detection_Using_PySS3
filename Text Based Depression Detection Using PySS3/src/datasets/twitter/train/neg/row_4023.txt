I've been thinking about suicide for the last couple months...And honestly, it's keeping me from doing anything productive. Having the option of committing suicide is kind of a weird coping mechanism for me, but as a result, I have a final tomorrow I haven't studied for and all I can think of is "It's okay, if it's really that bad I can just kill myself." 

How can I get this idea out of my head once and for all, so I can actually find the motivation to do something that will further my life? I do want to live, but I can't stop myself from thinking of these ideas when I'm sad or when I get that I-haven't-studied-at-all-for-my-final-yet hopeless feeling inside. 

A guy at my school jumped off one of the dormitory buildings just a few days ago, presumably because of finals stress, and it makes me even more unable to focus. I just want to be able to DO SOMETHING. Because for the past semester I have been in that weird limbo where I have no motivation to do anything because I feel like my life may end soon, yet for the most part, I don't want my life to end. Agh!
