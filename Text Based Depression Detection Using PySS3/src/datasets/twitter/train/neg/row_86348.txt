I don't know what to do anymoreMy mom passed away nine years ago and since then I've suffered with severe anxiety and depression. I've been in and out of therapy/counselling the entire time to try and come to terms with it but I'm at breaking point and I don't know what to do. I'm so lonely, I don't have any friends that I can hang out with and I haven't been in a relationship for 4 years. I struggled with being bullied at university, so I locked myself in my room. I didn't talk to people for over five days and was constantly inside my own head.

It's sounds sad and weird, but I spend my time creating my own friends and relationships in my head to help me get through it all. I haven't had any friends for the past 4 years and when I do try to make some, I'm constantly conflicted because I struggle to get close to people. I hate moaning, whining and feeling sorry for myself but I'm at the point now where I want to just kill myself. I try and think it'll all get better but it never does. I'm never happy, my positive outlook is now constantly negative. No matter how hard I've tried losing weight, getting a better job, being more trusting and talkative, I just end up being the one who lands flat on their face. 

I spent the day contemplating who would get what of my belongings. I considered writing a will as well. All of these thoughts are normal now and I feel like I'm that far gone that no one can help me. 

Thank you for reading until the end.
