Iâ€™m not supposed to be hereI donâ€™t have a place here. This isnâ€™t a delusion, like some people have told me. I really donâ€™t belong here.

I am constantly tempted to drift off, you know? Like,  daydream. Whateverâ€™s happening is less interesting than the stuff I make up, you know.

I want to daydream, or get drunk or high or just be out of my mind in general. I hate it here. And Iâ€™m going to be homeless soon, unless a fucking miracle happens. 

I really am just ashamed and Iâ€™m a burden on my friends/family. People are too nice to say it, but there really is no use for me.
