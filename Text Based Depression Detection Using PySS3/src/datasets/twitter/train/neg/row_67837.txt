Something that stops meWhenever I am feeling suicidal, I think to myself, "If I'm really going to do something this crazy, I might as well go to \_insert place I've always wanted to go to\_."

It's like, if I'm even considering ending my life, why not also consider changing it in other, extreme ways? Let me go get a tattoo...let me be an apprentice sushi chef...let me act in a movie. It becomes less about whether or not I think it is possible and more about the fact that I'm just going try. 

But its important to remember the difference between carelessness and living. When I am feeling suicidal, I might feel reckless and ready to anything because "nothing matters." But keep in mind that...life does matter. Go get that tattoo, certification, and experience not because it makes no difference, but because it makes all the difference.
