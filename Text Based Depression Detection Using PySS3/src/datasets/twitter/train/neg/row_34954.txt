I don't know what to do.To tell a bit about myself. I am 20 years old and male. I finished school 2 years ago. Worked for one year part-time and then got a place as a trainee which I quit after a year because it was a hellhole. I enrolled at university and am currently studying maths and physics so I can become a teacher. Now the "problem" part. I got late admission and missed the orientation week. Then I got sick and was in bed with feaver for 2 weeks. Which made me unable to go to uni. Because now every time I want to go to lessons I get really sick in my stomach and I have thrown up 2 times already. I am too pathetic to even attend classes. I dunno what to do anymore. I am also overweight and nothing I tried doing helped me lose weight that much. So basically I am a lonely worthless fat lazy idiot who can't even do smth as simple as show up to classes. Currently I leave for uni every morning because I still live at home and usually sit at the central station contemplating whether or not today is the day I will kill myself. Dunno why I even post here, thanks for reading I guess. I have to leave now. In about an hour I will be at the central station. I am not really sure if I want to die but I sure as hell don't want to live anymore.
