WorthlessI'm pretty much done with life.I wake up in the morning knowing there's not a single person in the world that cares about me.I don't really have friends.Some "friends" that I do have doesn't really care for me.I just exist for the sake of existing.Nothing will change if a worthless,lifeless guy like me dies.People barely even know me I'll just die and at least it'll save me the pain of waking up every morning knowing nothing's gonna change.I will remain the lifeless,friendless,unloved,worthless POS
Just posting it here to see actually what people say,even though I don't think it'll change anything but still just wanted bro try
