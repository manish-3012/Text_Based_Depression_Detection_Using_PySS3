I went to a gun store todayIâ€™ve been thinking about buying a gun on and off since I turned 21. I always just assumed I wouldnâ€™t pass a background check because Iâ€™ve been in a psych ward before (voluntarily), but apparently thatâ€™s not the case. The only hurdle I found out about is that I need a Florida license to buy a gun in Florida, which I donâ€™t have cause I moved there from New Jersey. I honestly donâ€™t know that I would kill myself if I had a gun. I guess I figured I would buy the gun first and take it from there. I suppose I just want the option. Iâ€™ve had suicidal ideation for as long as I can remember, but actually walking into the store made it feel more real. Now, when I think about it, it feels a little less like a fantasy and a little more like something I could conceivably do. That scares me, but maybe itâ€™s a good thing that Iâ€™m scared? I donâ€™t really know anymore. I chose to leave college for the second time this semester, and have been living with my parents for the last 2 months. Theyâ€™ve been pushing me to get a job so that I can pay them rent, which is understandable. The problem is every time I start to look for jobs I get so overwhelmed and anxious and depressed that I come face to face with how fucked up I am. Then my mind just goes back to buying a gun. Iâ€™m not posting this to scare people; I guess I just want sympathy or advice.
