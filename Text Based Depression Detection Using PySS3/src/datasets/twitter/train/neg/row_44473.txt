I will never be stable or ok. I am a weak, stupid moron and am going to lose everything. I hate life and who I am and want to end it allI am an awful person. I find life unenjoyable and tiring. My dog is dying. I got a new good job two weeks ago. Already, I forgot to charge a customer for a 400$ item, I broke a $2000 item and now I am having car problems and will be 3 or 4 fucking hours late because this guy cant fix it. Now hes taking 4 times longer and double the cost that i was quoted. Im leaving my coworker to work alone and im probably going to get fired. I feel bad all the time, nothing gets better. Ive tried it all, meds have ruined my brain and the whole world is corrupt and doesnt give a shit. Im exhausted, theres no hope, i cant do this and need to die. I have a bunch of firearms and want to end my life, but I might do a hanging instead. I dont feel sane, im never ok, i dont feel human. Theres no hope, im broken and need to end.
