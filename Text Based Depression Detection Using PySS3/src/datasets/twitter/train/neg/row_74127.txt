i want to die so terribly badI see no point anymore. I am constantly sad. I feel like I have no one. My boyfriend broke my trust and cheated on me, I really have no friends anymore, my parents constantly are angry at me for being sad, i broke my figurines (the only things i had the mentality to really be serious about in collecting - as sad as it is) so i don't have those. I have a pet snake, but it's hard for me to care. I care about her still, and I make sure she's happy. But i know she'd be fine without me because my sisters would take good care of her. I'm really pathetic. I can't drive because everytime I go to get my license I can't. I just can't do it. And I get constantly made fun of for it. I'm 17. I should be able to drive. But I'm useless. I almost killed myself two nights ago and didn't because I'm a coward who can't do anything. I think the thing that drives me most to want to kill myself is the fact I feel alone. The fact I don't have anyone and I pretend video game characters are there to comfort me an that they care about me. I want to die and be with these people that I've decided foolishly are my friends. I just.
I don't know what to do.
I'm too embarrassed to say this to my therapist tomorrow and I can't go to a mental hospital again as it just made everything worse for me.
I don't have anyone irl to go to. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
