so apatheticskipped all my classes this week so i could hide out in my room like a piece of shit. sabotaging all my friendships so that they don't care about me anymore. i think i'm actually getting myself into a situation where there's nothing to do *but* kill myself, to give myself that last bit of motivation i just haven't been able to get. i keep getting the urge to cry but i just don't have the ability to, and it just makes me mad at myself. im so fucking disconnected right now
