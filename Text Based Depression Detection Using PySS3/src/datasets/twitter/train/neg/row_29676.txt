idk man even being drunk isn't great anymorehey 
im just in the end of the BIG party that i've been waiting for like the past two boring months 
there is like almost all my friends 
and i dont feel anything 
it was a shitty party even though everyone liked it 
it's always a shitty party 
i'm just here for getting drunk, wasting myself a little bit then come back to my already failed life (at 16 xd)
but this isn't working since some months
i dont know 
nothing brings me joy 
i have friends close to me like all the time, and half the time i don't have love for them 
i hate myself 
but 
i did so much efforts, i worked so much since like 7 years of depression 
i did not try suicide since the 31/12/17 
and i know the next try will be the last
and i don't know how long i can handle all of this

i don't even want to feel better 
idk how to say this
but i just want to be dead, there is 0 interest in staying alive you know
i dont know what to say more, there is nothing interesting im not proud of anything, i would trade my life with anyone that hasn't a depression

hey sry for bad english
