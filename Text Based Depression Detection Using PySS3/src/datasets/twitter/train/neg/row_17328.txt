How can I get real caring help?What kind of help can I get?

I'm already on meds. 

I already have a psychologist and a psychiatrist.

What more can I do?

I feel like it's still not enough.

Since my psychologist said she was thinking about leaving me, I've never felt worse in my entire life. I want to kill myself and I feel like it's really close to happen. 

What can I do? I feel like this all happened just because of what my psychologist said. I can't live like this. What help can I get? I won't fucking live like this.. 

I got so many questions right now and no one to listen to them. It is overwhelming and I don't know what more I can do to show people that this situation is unbearable. 

I'm also having a few dangerous thoughts about hurting people if my psychologist really ends up leaving me, but what can I do to deal with it better?

This is really urgent, I'm about to cut myself again after a year (and on fucking summer, how will I hide the fucking scars..) 

What can it really help? (except suicide.. and I already know all the dbt skills and they are not working...)
