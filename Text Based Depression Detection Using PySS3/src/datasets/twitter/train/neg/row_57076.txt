I'm scaredI'm terrified at the thought of suicide yet I wish nothing more than to cease to exist. It's like something keeps strangling me up to the point of death then releases it's grip. It's torture, I don't want to feel this anymore, I wish there was an easier way to get rid of this feeling and have the courage to end it all. All I want is closer.
