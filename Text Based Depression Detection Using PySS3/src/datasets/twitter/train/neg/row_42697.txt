What do you do when your only support is the person who makes you want to kill yourself?If I stay with my SO I will end up killing myself, he doesn't seem to care about me or treat me well, he does things to intentionally hurt me or just blatantly disregards my feelings, sometimes he is nice but only when he is not the reason why I'm upset. If the cause of my pain is something that he has done, he feels no guilt.

If I leave him, I will kill myself from loneliness/lack of support/regret.

What the hell do I do? I can't live like this. I'm not okay and I don't think I ever will be. I am not strong.
