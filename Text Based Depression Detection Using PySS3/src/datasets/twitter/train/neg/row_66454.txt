I went on vacation to do some soul searching and see if I actually wanted to kill myselfAnd I think Iâ€™m gonna buy a gun when I get home.  Happiness is not obtainable for me anymore.  There is nothing I have to look forward to.  All the happy parts of my life are over.

Iâ€™m gonna blow my brains out in front of my ex-girlfriend.
