It's not really interesting.   There's nothing here I garuntee you haven't already seen so, sorry for that.

I thought I was getting better, I've been dealing with this for years and I've kept it hidden fooling everyone, and for the last few months, I've even fooled myself.

And then it hit me again.

I haven't cut myself in months, I needed to tonight, it had been so long. I just couldn't take it anymore.

I just can't deal with this shit anymore, why am I here? My family doesn't want my here, I got no gf, failing in school because of a job I hate, hell I don't wanna be here.

Just I've become a failure, just imagining everything I thought I could be as a kid, I've failed not just everyone around me, I've failed myself.
I can't even kill myself properly, I've tried 3 times and failed every single time.

I don't know what I'm asking for, I don't really want help, idk, I just want a way out, an escape from an this because honestly, I can't handle it anymore
