I'm done with this world.Seriously considering doing the deed. I feel so alone, nothing has been going right for me, at all. My family just hates me. I'll never be considered good enough at anything. I get called bitter and mean alot, but it's only because I have really bad anxiety and depression so I get really nervous and lash out at people when I feel endangered. I don't know what to do at this point. I really need help.
