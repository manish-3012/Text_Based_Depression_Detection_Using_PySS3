I've managed to push everyone away and now I'm all aloneI've recently separated from the military (no deployment) and I've been struggling with the transition back to a normal life. I've been finding it physically difficult to even speak to people. It's not that I don't want to socialize, I know what I want to say in my head but when I try to speak, I can't produce a word. I had to eventually explain through text to my closest friends why I'm so distant and quiet hopingÂ they'd still stay in my lifeÂ cause I know I'm pushing them away. They tell me, "I understand man I'm here if you need anything", yet when I need then the most, no response, 12 hours... 2 days... 1 week, obviously they're only there when they're free and feel like dealing with it, when they eventually replied I can't even bother to respond. I get it, it's a shitty spot to put people in when they don't go through it themselves, everyday so black and white, dull and uneventful. I broke and ended up reaching out to a hotline the other day to talk to someone but it brought on more questions. I never really had a plan before I talked to the hotline, the person asked that question a lot, I started to dwell on that question.Â 

I now have a plan and a date in mind, not in the immediate future but a date nonetheless. I don't know what my problem is, my life isn't even that difficult compared to other people's stories. I've lost any sort of motivation, everything just pisses me off, I can't even find pleasure in my hobbies anymore. The person on the hotline said it sounds like I lost the will to live. I can't even seek help from the VA since I've never deployed, they see non-combat veterans as low risk and should have no mental issues. Half of me knows something is wrong and is screaming for help, the other half gave up and just wants to push that date up.Â
