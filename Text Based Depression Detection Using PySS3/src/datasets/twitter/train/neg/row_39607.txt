A coworker asked me what itâ€™s like to be 21 and I canâ€™t stop thinking about where I expected to be in my life, compared to where I actually am.Itâ€™s been 10 years since my struggles with depression and self harm began, on and off. Iâ€™m in a real low patch right now. In the past year, I recovered from anorexia, got deported from a country where I was living my best life and surrounded by positive people, declared bankruptcy, was homeless, and then I lost my Nannan a month ago out of the blue. She was my best friend. I have high functioning aspergers, something that I would never mention until now as it never presented as an issue for me. Right now itâ€™s intensified so much, I feel like Iâ€™m 5 years old again and I canâ€™t do the things I want to due to sensory overload and the anxiety- add depression on top of this and Iâ€™m pretty much bed bound. I work 6 days a week just to get me out the house, and then I drive home purposely getting stuck in traffic so I get home later and donâ€™t feel so bad about going straight to bed. 

I always assumed I would have my shit together by now, that my issues just came with puberty and wouldnâ€™t exist. 21 is a landmark age and I think Iâ€™d set this as a goal post. All the things I wanted in life and always aspired to are out the window. I wanted to go to university, but Iâ€™ve dropped out of my A-Levels six times. I always wanted to marry young and have children. Iâ€™m gay, single and after spending time with my 1 year old nephew (who I love so much) I feel intense depression, scared that I love him so much and nervous about his future. Heâ€™s so much better than this world and heâ€™s so much better than me. 

I have an appointment with my GP on Tuesday and heâ€™ll hopefully put me back on anti-depressants. I live in the UK, so the mental health care route if youâ€™re broke like me is medication, a leaflet on breathing exercises and an 18 month+ waiting list for therapy, if youâ€™re lucky enough to get referred in the first place. The last time I spoke to my GP, I told him about my suicidal thoughts and that I was going to hurt myself. He told me they couldnâ€™t do anything until I tried to kill myself and then maybe theyâ€™d bump me up to a higher priority. 

Iâ€™ve waited 5 weeks for this appointment and Iâ€™ve been counting down the days, telling myself just get through this until the 19th November and then things will perk up. Today is the lowest Iâ€™ve ever felt. I hope Iâ€™m going to make it through this weekend and then the medication can give me some clarity. Iâ€™m looking forward to it like itâ€™s some miracle cure yet I know itâ€™s not and Iâ€™m setting myself up for failure. 

The person I would always turn to in these times would be my Nannan. She was my sole support system- I donâ€™t have any friends and Iâ€™m distant from my parents. She would tell me â€˜our Georgia, if you fell off the roof of the city hall you would fall straight into a fur coatâ€™. Something so daft that really did have a miracle cure. 

I miss her so incredibly much, and going through this rut without her supporting me I donâ€™t think I will come out of the other side.
