dad would be sadEverythingâ€™s so overwhelmingly out of my control and now itâ€™s looking like uni will be online for my final year it means ANOTHER year living at home which honestly I cannot do.

I really REALLY want to end it, like so bad Iâ€™m at such a low point but my dad lives in a different country and heâ€™d be heart broken and all on his own so :/
