My time is coming soonI didn't think I'd make it this long, because I never wanted to. I still don't want to. For years I've planned the dress I'd be buried in rather than the one I'd wear at my wedding. I divide up my money by who it's going to when I die, not what vacations I'm planning with my friends. I don't buy new things because it will just be clutter for whoever has to rehome my belongings.   
I know exactly how I'd do it. I'm just waiting for my significant other to realize I'm a lost cause, so he will drift away from me and fall out of love so I won't have to worry about hurting him, if he really even cares about me that much. I should've done it years ago before we met. Now I have to wait in agony even longer, as if I haven't suffered enough already.
