Iâ€™ve tried to improve my life so many times and it goes well for a bit but after a while itâ€™s like back to square one, and Iâ€™m stuck in a rut again.Iâ€™m 22 and Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myseld for as long as I can remember, almost half my life. I feel like Iâ€™ve tried all the major things, talking to people, self improvement but I make the same mistakes each time and Iâ€™m still trying to fix problems from year ago. 

I feel like I canâ€™t get anything write, my mistakes and problems will always follow me, I canâ€™t get any peace of mind. Life is a constant struggle. Iâ€™ve tried to be but I canâ€™t, I donâ€™t have any plan for my life, Iâ€™m not motivational I donâ€™t have the strength, the only happiness I can acquire is so forced and used only as a way to escape my existence.

I think itâ€™s about time I put an end to it, itâ€™s draining and exhausting. Itâ€™s just misery.
