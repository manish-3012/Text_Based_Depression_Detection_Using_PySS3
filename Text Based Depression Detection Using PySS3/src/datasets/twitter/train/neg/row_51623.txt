I don't have a reason to live. I'm just waiting to work up the conviction to go through with it.Maybe the reason so many high schoolers kill themselves is that we're finally developing a sense of personhood but aren't offered any kind of agency over our lives. The latter point is heightened for me since I'm transgender. I have no control over any aspect of my life - from my outside life to my body to my mental health - and it will kill me.

I'm actually almost out of high school. I'm eighteen, and was looking forward to living as a man full-time in college. Actually, I had my hopes pinned on that light at the end. But it turns out I'm going to have to commute to school, meaning I'll spend another year living as a girl with my horrible transphobic parents. I have no way to move out. I have no options. For (at LEAST) 365 more days my life is going to remain entirely out of my hands. It's not that I don't want to live that way, it's that I can't.

At this point I'm just working myself up to going through with it. I can't stay here. Everything hurts. I can't do it.
