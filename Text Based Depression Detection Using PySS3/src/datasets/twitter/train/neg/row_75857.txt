I donâ€™t know.The only thing I know is that I want to die. Iâ€™m just a coward .. afraid of dying itself. I wish there was an easy way to leave this planet.

My life just feels completely empty, everyday is the same. Thereâ€™s no succes and I donâ€™t have any goals. I donâ€™t know what I want to accomplish with this life. Itâ€™s just hard when youâ€™re different or donâ€™t seem to fit in.

Iâ€™m having a life I donâ€™t like, a job I donâ€™t enjoy. - and yes, I tried many before but I just canâ€™t find something Iâ€™m comfortable with. - Iâ€™m having social anxiety for as long as I canâ€™t remember .. even as a child, Iâ€™m insecure about my looks and my personality, Iâ€™m an introvert which Iâ€™m aware isnâ€™t helping at all, Iâ€™m depressed for years with ups and downs, am highly sensitive and find it hard to bond with people. I missed out on so many things in life. Some on purpose because I thought I would soon commit suicide. I donâ€™t know how I survived for so many years. I feel like Iâ€™m doing things automatically. Itâ€™s almost been 10 years since I have these extreme feelings. Iâ€™ve seen therapists, not anymore. Still take medication, though sometimes skip them because I hate myself too much.

I feel completely miserable and just want to go ;(
If thereâ€™s a God I wonder why he let me suffer this way.
Sorry, this was something personal, but I have no one to share this with in person because they will not understand. So Iâ€™m sorry if you took the time to read this shitty post but thanks anyways I guess ..
