I thought I was making progress...So I'm 95% sure I am no longer in a relationship with my SO of 3 years. It's wasn't a hard moment at the time but as the conversation was ending, I began thinking on it more and it got worse. I couldn't stop crying and I became even more upset at myself. I want to kill myself but I also don't want to be that ex who killed herself because of a breakup.

I lost all the joy of the slight progress I was making to being at least ok and not depressed anymore. I was also made to feel awful about not being in a better state of mind with only myself and him to help me. I couldn't possibly afford to seek professional help or even get recreational drugs...

Edit: being vague as my ex is on reddit and I picked an possibly obvious username...
