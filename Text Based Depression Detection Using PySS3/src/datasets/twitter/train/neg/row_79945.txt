I am so aloneI think I've had enough. I've been battling suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I don't know if I can keep going. I don't think I can. It's so heavy. I grew up in abuse, I've been raped repeatedly, ostracised and completely abandoned and I'm so completely overwhelmed. I do not want to be here any more. This probably doesn't even make sense. Sorry. Scoll past. It doesn't even matter. I'm just talking to nobody because hey who else am I gonna say this to. I have no one. I've always had no one. I've spent my life just wanting to be wanted and I can't do it any more.
