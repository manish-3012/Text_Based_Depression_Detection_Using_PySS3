Putting how I feel into words.Iâ€™m constantly tired. Itâ€™s exhausting just trying to force myself to care about life. Iâ€™ve felt numb for so long. I canâ€™t remember the last time I felt happy. Iâ€™ve stopped making myself food, I just go hungry until my body forces me to eat then I have whatever takes the least effort. Iâ€™ve stopped my hygiene routines other than a hot shower. My room is a mess. I canâ€™t focus on school or anything that matters. Iâ€™m constantly in a state of despair. I think about killing myself every day. I have sex with strangers because itâ€™s the only form of human connection I have. I donâ€™t even want the sex, I just want to be held. Nobody else wants to be around me and I donâ€™t blame them. The days keep rolling by but Iâ€™m stuck in time. I canâ€™t sleep at night, it just feels like one terrible day that wonâ€™t end. I feel so guilty for failing but I canâ€™t break out of the cycle. I lie in bed and when I blink another hour goes by.
