Unloved and I don't know how to love. I give upI have been alone for more than 5 months now. I was addicted to my previous girlfriend. We were always texting and we were rarely apart even though we are both in high school. She made me feel alive . Since she left I have lost all sex drive , and romance drive. I don't find woman attractive anymore because I am so scared of getting hurt. I've been in pain for so long and I'm so lonely that tonight I just want to take my scalpel and trace my vein on my arm and end it. I have no one. My friends tell me I'm a so called hot guy and I get stares a lot but that's it. I feel so empty. Like no one will ever make me feel special and loved ever again. I'm scared and alone and I don't know where else to go so I'm just typing this out on reddit because I don't want to tell my friends I'm suicidal and make them worry. And I just watched a video about love and I feel awful and I just want to die so badly . I want to die . I want to die.

I'm sorry this is so long , I normally don't write this much. Thanks for reading .
