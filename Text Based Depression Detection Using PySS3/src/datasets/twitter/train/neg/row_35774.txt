Being evicted, living on one meal a dayI canâ€™t do this anymore, I just got fired. Just got denied food stamps, I canâ€™t live off one meal a day from the food pantry. Iâ€™m about to be homeless right before Christmas, failed out of college due to bipolar disorder not being properly medicated now I canâ€™t even get my meds. 

My parents disowned me for stealing from them and I hadnâ€™t talked to them for almost a year then i called them today and told them my situation and my dad just hung up.

I have no income, hardly any food, no car, and nobody to talk to.
