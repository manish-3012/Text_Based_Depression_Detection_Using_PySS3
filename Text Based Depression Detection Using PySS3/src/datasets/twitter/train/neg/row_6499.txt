Killing myself tomorrowAll right, dear visitors of this thread, here is the thing: I'm killing myself tomorrow. Not 100&amp;#37; sure I'll manage to do it, since turns out it's actually quite hard to pull off, but I feel that now I'm finally, finally ready.

The reason is simple: there are too much bad stuff in this life for me, and no universal laws like "karma" which might keep good people free from that bad stuff.

When I was younger, I had lots of plans of what I'd like to bring into this world - like, awesome point-and-click adventure games like Monkey Island/Thimbleweed Park, or great goofy comedies like Scary Movie or A Haunted House (this one I really recommend btw) - so, sorry it didn't happened.

Yeah, so...I think I'll go to sleep now - if someone wants to say something - please, you're welcome! Though I already spent *years* trying to find something that would give me reasons to go on, and didn't succeed - so, I don't think there is a point in trying to write something like this...

Thank you very much for your attention, and sorry again for robbing you guys of some good video games, comedies, and whatever else.

Thanks again.
