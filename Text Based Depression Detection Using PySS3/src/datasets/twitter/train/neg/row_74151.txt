Just looking for how to do itI came to Reddit looking for a sub that would help me figure out the best way to die without damaging my organs so it can be donated (I have two routes, just wanted to discuss witch one is better). But I see this community doesn't exists.

Seeing this sub and it's posts made me think if I really want to do it. I have been thinking about it for some time now and almost did it last year. What's really stopping me is thinking about my family and my bf and feeling guilty about how they would feel. But at the same time I don't wanna keep this up only for the sake of others.

My life isn't going anywhere. I can't accomplish anything. I know each person life is lived differently and there is no pattern to follow, but I don't wanna life for nothing. And thinking that my death could bring goodness (by donating my organs) I feel like I would finally accomplish something.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Don't know if I gonna read any comments. I guess I just wanted to vent. Ok. Bye
