Is it time?Been reading some posts on a variety of suicide instances and never thought I would be at crossroads again. 

Did attempt suicide with pills when I was in my late teens struggling with the pressures of college and not doing well.

Been to see a clinical psychologist a few years back and that helped, only reason I did was because I started to get dark thoughts and stopped short of going to 'search' for ways to end it. The coping tools helped at the time though as It does from time to time the urge or thought always is in the back of my mind and in the last few months has been increasing.

I have a really good friend who knows about most of this except for the most recent thoughts,  and I know I'm not a burden but I keep feeling like I am even though my friend who is really patient and kind tells me I'm not. 

At work I am lucky to have good managers and colleagues who if I ever needed any help would not hesitate to help, though with the first bunch of lockdowns and having already taken time off to deal with this just doesn't sit right having to take time off when numerous deadlines are approaching. 

Perhaps on one level I just needed to say this without people knowing me or judging me, though easier said than done.

I guess I've just been tired for a long time and it's sad that I feel suicide is the only way out. 

I don't deny people who love me will be sad and devastated however I can't help how I feel.

Hoping just by typing this out it will help just to say all that and figure out the next steps.....
