My boss is giving me two weeks to be better or he will let me go.Today i was depressed and was dreading working with a co-worker there because we dont liie each other. And i make to many mistakes and cost people momey. I never thought i was that bad. And my boss is a family member and its technically a family owned business. So tomorrow i will have anxiety and probably mess up and blow it and get fired. Ive been depressed for weeks and just ready to kill myself.
