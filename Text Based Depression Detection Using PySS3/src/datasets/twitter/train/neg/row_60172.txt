Tomorrow I'm going to kill myself, and I'm going to video call my Ex while I do it.I needed her, and she dumped me. I spent all of my soul into her, and her reasoning is that she can't handle being my "rock". I've never needed anyone more than I need her, and she can't deal with the stress of a relationship. It's not even that she stopped loving me, she just couldn't deal with it. She said as much.

I told her that I'm suicidal, she must have thought it was a bluff as she told the police I was simply using it to threaten her. It's been 5 months, I'm on antidepressants and it isn't getting better.

I'm calling her tomorrow morning, I'm tying a noose around my neck, and while she pleads with me not to do it? I'll jump and I hope she hears me squirm, or my neck snap.

My name is Kai, her name is Sam. This will be my last post.
