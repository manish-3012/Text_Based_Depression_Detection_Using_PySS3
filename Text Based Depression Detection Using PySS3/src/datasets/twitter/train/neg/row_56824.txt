Need an escapeI canâ€™t stand this life anymore. I donâ€™t hate life, I just hate the one I was given. Being at home makes me want to tear my hair out (which is already falling out - at 17) but I donâ€™t want to leave either because I feel like people are always judging me outside, they can see how ugly and disgusting I am. Iâ€™m being forced to recover from a nearly lifelong eating disorder and itâ€™s so painful, being forced to eat six times a day by your parents, when you want nothing more than a meal a day. Itâ€™s humiliating. I have no autonomy. This life isnâ€™t mine. Iâ€™d rather starve myself to death, but now I donâ€™t even have that liberty. Everythingâ€™s been taken away from me. I canâ€™t even go to the bathroom without my parents watching me. They have to come to school everyday and watch me eat my meals. I have to hear everyone talk about dieting and exercise while I have to put on weight. I want to run away, but I donâ€™t know where to go. I want to kill myself, but Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll fail and ruin my already miserable life even more. I want to be a kid again, back when I had hopes and dreams and used to love and laugh. I feel so fucking empty. I have no love or compassion for anyone. I live inside my own head and I feel myself dissociating more from reality everyday. Itâ€™s too much.
