I have no idea.I have no idea.

I have no idea. Iâ€™m not sure as to what might happen with me in the future. Iâ€™m a student, struggling to get better concentration power to focus completely on my studies. I donâ€™t come from a wealthy family. I come from a family where we get everything we need, but not anything we want. Anything I ask my parents for ( which is considered a demand ), just remains a request. If I want something materialistic, it basically means Iâ€™m never getting it. I donâ€™t blame my parents. Theyâ€™re wonderful. I just hate the fact that they sacrifice so many of their wants for me. I hate the fact that I cause problems at home just because I want something new. I have no idea. Is there any hope in my life? Will I be able to move out of the financial constraint and live a better life in my future? Right now, it all seems like itâ€™s just a road that leads to a valley to me, not sure why. Iâ€™ve come to a point where I donâ€™t even fear what awaits me...
