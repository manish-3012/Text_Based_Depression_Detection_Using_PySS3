Hate myselfIâ€™m not sure why I ended up writing this, but here it goes. I ruined my life. Iâ€™ve lived so many places and met so many people, I used to enjoy life. Somewhere along the way I started to ache. I guess I just couldnâ€™t take leaving every time, saying goodbye to everyone I met every few years. I went to college and I just broke. I stoped caring about myself. I was so tired and done with everything, I wished I wasnâ€™t here anymore. I started hating all my weaknesses. I had never been able to see my strengths, and still canâ€™t to this day, so my failures and shortcomings were all I could think about. I ended up leaving college halfway through a semester and went back home in shame. My parents think Iâ€™m just lazy even though I built up the courage to tell them how I was feeling. We ended up moving almost as soon as I got back. I got a job, but my parents werenâ€™t satisfied, said I was being lazy just working at McDonaldâ€™s even though no one else wanted me since I failed college. Moved with my grandfather to get a better job, still havenâ€™t found one. Havenâ€™t seen a friend except for a few days for almost 2 years now (the time since I left college.) I am still so tired and donâ€™t know what to do. The worst part of it all is I know the whole reason Iâ€™m in this mess is because I couldnâ€™t bring myself to keep going to classes. I was blessed and I threw it all away.
