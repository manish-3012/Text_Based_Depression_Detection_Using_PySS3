I've hit that point again where I'm fixated on killing myself.Because I feel completely fucking alone in my pain. 

Last night was heart-wrenching, I irrationally made myself relive painful past occurrences. I was experiencing intense chest ache and other uncomfortable bodily sensations associated with these painful emotions. 

Nowadays, I don't commonly experience an actual, intense urge to die or kill myself, and from past experience, I know that it's a fleeting feeling of powerlessness, even though it feels so terribly overbearing in the moment. 

The thing is that I could sleep off my pain, but I can't fucking fall asleep. And I could do something productive but ADHD makes it so goddamn difficult. Though I will resume working on what I was doing before if this feeling becomes less debilitating. 

Life currently feels like walking through thickets of thorn completely unequipped with no one around to lend a hand. 

And it's easier to convince myself that I don't matter and that I'm a terrible, vile piece of shit who should never cause any inconvenience to anyone again. 

And I know that I'm at my lowest when I'm thinking of possibilities and hypothetical situations which either involve me dead or in a hospital.

Edit: hah my only remaining close friend who just got back from overseas just texted me saying that she's recovered from her sickness and asked to hang out next week. For some reason, this made me want to kill myself even more. Maybe I'm just a selfish asshole? This would be the first time in 2-3 or so months that I'd be going out with another person for a prolonged period of time.
