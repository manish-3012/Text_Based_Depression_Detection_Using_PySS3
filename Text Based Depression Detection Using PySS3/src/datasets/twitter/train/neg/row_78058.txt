Covered everything. Time for relief.I know this is a sub to prevent suicide.
I admire what you guys do. It's great to believe that someone cares.

I've been depressed for 10 years. I just can't continue. I have everything anyone 
normal person could ever want. I consider myself very lucky. But it doesn't bring me joy or happiness. Everyday I suffer. 

I'm on anti depressants and have tried talking to a therapist. I actually went today knowing that this is my final weekend. To be honest tomorrow will hopefully be the last time I ever wake up.

I've made a video, left all my financial info, passwords, contact info, ect. I've written about half of my notes and plan on cleaning the house and making everything as easy as possible.

I'm not angry, I'm not even sad. I feel relief knowing that it will be over. 

I plan on cooking myself my favourite meal and maybe having a beer and watching a movie.

I guess I'm posting here to just vent to somebody. I don't want help. Just someone to hear and understand my final thoughts.

There's only one person who could save me. And I can't go to her. I dont want to make her feel trapped and responsible. Its not fair to her. I love her to much.

She was my only joy and love and reason I ever found to live. The only person to make me want a future.

I've dated plenty. She's special. But I messed up.

Is that why I'm ending things? No.

She was just the only light in this endless darkness.

My candle is about to go out.
