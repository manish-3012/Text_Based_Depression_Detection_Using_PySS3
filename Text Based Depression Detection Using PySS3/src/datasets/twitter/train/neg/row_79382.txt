Going through a tough time.Since I left the military, it feels like everything is falling apart. Can't get a job that I actually want to do (even with an honorable discharge), just found out that my wife cheated on me, and now all I want to do is end the bullshit. I just really dont want to keep fucking living like everything is fine. I dont have a plan to kill myself or anything, I just think about it constantly now, every time a semi truck passes me I wonder about just a little tug on the steering wheel might put me out of my fucking misery. If I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I'll be completely okay with that. If I seek help, I'll lose my clearance and I'll never be able to get the job that I want. I feel trapped.
