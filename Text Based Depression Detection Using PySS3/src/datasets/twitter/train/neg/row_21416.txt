Feeling alone, trapped, and like a failure...It's weird to think that the only time I'm opening up about my issues is anonymously on Reddit. I've struggled for so long with feelings of self-loathing, but that outlook mixed with my depression and anxiety make me feel so incredibly isolated and desperate. I don't know what to do.

I was supposed to be a great student. I was going to go to grad school and get a Ph.D. There was never any doubt. But I have to face the truth: my issues, out of my control or not, have affected my life so much that my dreams are almost out of reach. I isolate myself from my loved ones, I have panic attacks and severe bouts of suicidal thoughts, but I don't want to tell anyone. They'll know I'm inches away from failing and I'm not in control. 


I've always struggled with avoidance issues. I don't tell my friends my problems, I don't communicate with professors or advisors or counselors, I just sink deeper into isolation as thoughts of self-hatred and regret consume me. I can't dig myself out, and I'm worried I've already made irreparable damage. The voice in my head telling me the only solution is to kill myself is so strong. But I don't want to tell anyone; they'll know, and they'll be disappointed in me. Thousands of dollars wasted, *years* wasted, and for what? For me to realize I'm a terrible person with no hope of succeeding in society?


I feel like a child sometimes, incapable of success, of communicating, of being in control. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. I know my suicide would cause so much pain, and it's one of the only things holding me back, but the urge to die is so strong, and I'm so tired.
