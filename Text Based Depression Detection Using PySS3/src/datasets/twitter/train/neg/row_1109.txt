life has been reaching a breaking point for mei don't know, man. i'm starting to feel pretty out of it. losing it. getting crazier and crazier. doing anything to numb down the thoughts. the future seems dark and hopeless. i don't want to live another 20 years like this, then 20 more, then 20 more... death seems like a much more viable option.
