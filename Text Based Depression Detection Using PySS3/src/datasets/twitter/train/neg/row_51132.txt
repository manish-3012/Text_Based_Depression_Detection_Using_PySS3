Im gonna die alone anyways..Let me just mark out my problems.

1. I feel like dying everyday i live.
2. I will never be loved no matter how hard i try in relationships

3. I will always have insensitive people telling me to man up and that i don't know the harshness of life.
4. People will tell me to live for myself, when i don't have much to live for.

5. I finally think death is my only way out because all they'll do is load me up with drugs and constantly tell me that its better for me to live than hurt other. Who said i give a fuck about anyone. Im in pain 24/7. Why should i care about hurting anyone.

If someone tells me im worth living for myself or any other bullshit. Dont tell me. I'm only getting a job so that way i can finally kill myself. By Christmas I'll be gone.
