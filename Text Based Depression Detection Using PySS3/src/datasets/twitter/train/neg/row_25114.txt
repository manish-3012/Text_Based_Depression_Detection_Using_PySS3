Just ventingSo I attempted suicide a few months ago. Prior to that I wanted to fulfill life experiences so I racked up a ton of credit card debt on international travel, skydiving, fancy restaurants, ect because I didn't intend to pay it off. Afterwards, I was in the hospital for 2 weeks, and even more money on therapy, neurologist, all that stuff. I've had a 95k job for the past 5 years so my rent is suuper expensive too. I got short term disability through my job for 2 months starting when I was in the hospital. My short term disability ended but I still have no energy and no motivation whatsoever to get my work done. So I ended up quitting.

So now I have no job and a ton of bills. I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or anything because it's pretty obvious, "just stop spending so much", but I just wanted to vent and maybe see if anyone has experienced anything similar before. The suicidal thoughts had been quite a bit better while I was on disability, but with all this debt, it's coming back with a vengeance.
