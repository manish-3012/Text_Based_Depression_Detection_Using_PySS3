Just get it over withLife isn't anything for me. I am incapable of self love and am a glutinous ugly sloth. I am going to hang myself with a cable in my closet and all I want is peace all I want is peace. If I die I will be at peace. My little brother is perfect. He is a genius and moved out at 18 to the beautiful country. While his older sister (me) is a fat, lazy, ugly and cold and callous soab. I will never be like my brother, I will never get my shit together, I will never do finish school find a job or be happy, I will always be juvenile in all my ways and I'm sick of it so goodbye cruel world an drew cruel people, I'm out.
