i want to, but i canâ€™t.i had friend who was named amanda, i knew her in middle school. she killed herself in my sophomore year of high school. in 6 days, it will be the 3 year anniversary. she had an awful home life, and itâ€™s because of her iâ€™m pursuing a career in such a heavy field.

but i donâ€™t know if iâ€™m cut out for it.

iâ€™m empathetic to the point where it hurts me. i feel what the other person is feeling. i cry reading everyoneâ€™s posts, and although i do want to die and have tried, only a few things/people are keeping me here. 

i have a two kitties who i love to the ends of the earth. i canâ€™t leave them, theyâ€™re my babies. the thought of leaving them is making me cry as i type this. 

my partner has told me that iâ€™m his reason for holding on, too. i canâ€™t betray him like that. i love him so, so much. heâ€™s already helped me with EDs and my cutting, so if i die, that would have been for nothing. i canâ€™t do that.

my little sister. sheâ€™s autistic, and i donâ€™t trust the kids at her school to be as nice to her. she sees the good in everything. what would she think if her big sister never came home from her second year of college? 

so all i can do is cry about things i have no control over. iâ€™m stuck.

i donâ€™t know what to do that can make these thoughts and feelings go away. i need to be there for the people that need me, whether or not iâ€™ve met them yet, but other than that, i feel so empty.
