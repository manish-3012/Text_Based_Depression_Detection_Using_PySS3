I want to kill myself every second of my lifeI used to be a good person, everyone's friend. My brothers taught me that it's ok to hate and hurt people and I've been a horrible person ever since. Everyone that I've talked to has either left me or made me feel like crap, everything gives me so much pain I can't handle it. Everyone is doing better than me, living my dream life. I'm stuck in a family that I hide from because they threaten to hurt me and I'm scared of them, I want to leave everyone. Every single day someone tells me that I need to change something about myself and that things I've wanted my entire life are worthless. I'm trans but I'm already very tall and my hands and feet are huge and that can't be changed ever, I'll never look presentable to anyone. I wonder every waking second if I should overdose and leave everything
