FreedomEverything Iâ€™ve ever done, Iâ€™ve tried to do it the best I could and tried to accept my limitations when I couldnâ€™t. But the road has reached its end. The world will continue turning, the sun will still rise and fall ushering in a new night for each day. Such is itâ€™s nature; such is lifeâ€™s nature. 
Chasing the dream, the transcendence of self, the feeling of limitless possibilities, the ephemeral notion of happiness. The pursuit of freedom of self and spirit, of these worldly confines to soar amongst the stars. Free. Like an eagle.
