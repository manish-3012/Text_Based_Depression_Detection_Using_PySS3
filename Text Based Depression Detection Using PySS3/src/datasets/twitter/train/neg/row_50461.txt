What's next?So, after a long time thinking about it, I've decided not to kill myself. There are just too many people who would be hurt by it. Too much I'd leave behind.

But I feel trapped now. I'm not really any happier. I have the same self-hate as before. I still can't see a future for myself. Despite choosing life, nothing has actually gotten any better.

What's more, I miss the freedom of knowing I had suicide as an option. The times I've made the decision to die have been so peaceful. So much fear and anxiety just disappears.

Now I'm terrified. I have to live. I'm not sure I'm ready to handle that responsibility.
