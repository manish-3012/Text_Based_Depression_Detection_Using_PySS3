Iâ€™m too scared to try againIâ€™m too afraid to make another attempt and fail. Itâ€™s the worst feeling Iâ€™ve ever experienced. I fall asleep to the thought of blasting my brains out every night. Thinking about applying for my gun license so I can just get it over with. I thought last time would really work. 

Iâ€™m so fucking useless
I canâ€™t even kill myself
How pathetic
