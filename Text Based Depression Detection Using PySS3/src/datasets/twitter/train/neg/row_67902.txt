Almost Everyday for 2 Years ive wanted to kms.Ive been wanting to commit about every single day now for like 2 years, I think one day it will happen. I'm only 16 but I feel like life has is too stressful. Every day for the past 2 and half years ive had thoughts to end it all. I fantasize about it. The idea brings me temporary peace. I dont understand why I need to be here. I didn't sign up? I did't consent to be here? So why do I have to keep on dragging out this "life".

Not a day goes by where I think about death. I need it. Want it. 2 Years now.

Everyone tells me: It will go away. Keep taking your medication and exercise.

But I don't want my "depression" to go away

I want to go away

I just want to be gone forever. How can I be cured from depression, if I want to die everyday.

Like bruh that's what I WANT

I dont want to live

I just want to die

Its really annoying.

If people cared about me. They would let me end it all. I want to end it all almost for 2 and half years straight.
