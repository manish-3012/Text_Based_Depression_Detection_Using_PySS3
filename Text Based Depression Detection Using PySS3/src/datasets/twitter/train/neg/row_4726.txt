its just not worth it anymoreShe never asks me whats wrong anymore. I guess it's cause she doesn't want to hear it, she knows that it's the same as always, she doesn't care, but I just want her to be there. She calls herself my best friend but I don't think she knows who I am. I don't know her.

My third run on antideppresants has been the worst month of my life, and it's still going, I'm so fucking depressed and I can't even bring myself to do anything. I don't even think I have the energy to kill mmyself. 

There is no point in living for me. I am transgender and completely un passing. No one believes me or wants to support me, my friends and parents couldn't give two shits, everyone's forgotten about the fact that I suffer every day of my life because they all think I'm better now. I'm so young and everyone says I have everything left in my life but I know that the timeline of myself ends here. I know that no one will care. They will be glad. I will be glad to.
