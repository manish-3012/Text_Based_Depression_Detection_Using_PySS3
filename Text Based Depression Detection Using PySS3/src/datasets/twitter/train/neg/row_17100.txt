I have a insufferable personalityNo body likes me. Iâ€™ve moved to a new city and have made no friends, Iâ€™m left out of everything and no body would notice or care if I died. Iâ€™m almost 30 and Iâ€™m alone. Iâ€™ve tried everything to make friends (live in a flat share, go to many sports clubs, started a new course and working). 

My personality is awful so I just donâ€™t see the point in continuing inflicting that on everyone around me. Iâ€™ve made a plan and wrote out my notes.
