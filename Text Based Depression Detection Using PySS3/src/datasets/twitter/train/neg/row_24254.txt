I wrote this thinking about a girl named snacks who probably doesn't care if I'm goneI'm going through the motions As I struggle through the hopelessness
I cash my dough into the endless ocean Of the coke filling
my nose until I force my soul into a place of nervous discon-
certing numbness mounting tension  fueling my perverse diversion.
Upon the time at which I crash into the earth,  a curse
I write into my verse and pursue further through my self recursion.
As I push another version to the entity of earning
I am struck with hurt and yearning for a passion that went swerving
off a curving path consumed by nervousness and  wrath that
hurdles past, it's burning fast,  these distant feelings break like glass,
The patterns match a broken past the days go past with nothing lasting,
echoes of a sense of passion, ripped in half by senseless madness,
the memories of things that make the motions turn so easily
those thoughts of peace they seem to be so lost out in this endless sea,
I send a beacon drifting filled with hopes and dreams and misplaced things
it passes into bleak and hazy crazy worries, nothing stirring,
vanishing it fills the air with nothing left but pure dispair.
