How do I get over leaving family behind?So I'm killing myself tonight. It'll be great because I hate life, but I can't enjoy thinking about it because I'm too worried about the pain I'll bring my family when I die. How do you comfort yourself about leaving people who care behind and focus on incoming peace of death?
