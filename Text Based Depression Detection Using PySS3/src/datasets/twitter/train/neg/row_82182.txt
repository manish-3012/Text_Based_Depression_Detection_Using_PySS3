It's like I can't feel good anymoreI quit my job yesterday. It was just a crappy part time job but quitting makes it feel more real. I've taken the first steps in my plan. I thought all I would feel is relief, but I'm still sad. Well, it makes sense since I am giving up any opportunity to live a better life. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have less than 2 months to go. I don't know why I'm waiting...  maybe to keep up my lies. Maybe to wait for warmer weather. Maybe for something to change my mind. Something to make me believe, *really* believe, I can get passed this. I don't know.

&amp;nbsp;

In the next few weeks I'm going to clear my things out, get my accounts settled, and just try to find some peace. I'll try to meditate and exercise everyday.
