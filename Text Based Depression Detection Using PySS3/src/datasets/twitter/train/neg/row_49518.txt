Unlived LifeMy youth is over and Iâ€™m in trouble. Every day I give up on myself, faced with the same exhausting battle, and I realize that Iâ€™m making my life harder. The more time wasted...I am just slowly killing myself and no one wants to be involved with that bs. Itâ€™s a worse way to go and I understood yesterday that I donâ€™t think I can kill myself. When it comes down to it...Iâ€™ll just be watching this morbid horrifying self destruction. I canâ€™t make the people care about me that I want to...Iâ€™ll just lose everything. Omg this is bad.
