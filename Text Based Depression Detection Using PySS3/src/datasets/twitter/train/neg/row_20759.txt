Good plan?Im 30 and at this point in my life im a complete failure. I've never had more than 1 friend in my life (now 0), shitty personality, extremely low self confidence, depressed, lonely, the list goes on. The ONLY reason I havent killed myself yet is because I dont want to give my parents pain. I have always envisioned killing myself but thought id wait till my parents pass away to do it but I dont think I can much longer. The biggest pain for me is the loneliness and low self worth. I figured I would tell my parents I would be moving out but really I'd just rent a hotel/motel and exit my life using the nitrogen/helium method. I feel tremendous guilt while writing this but I cant envision myself living a happy/normal life alone
