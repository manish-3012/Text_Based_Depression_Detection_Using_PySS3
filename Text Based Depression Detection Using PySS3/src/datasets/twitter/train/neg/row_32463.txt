I think my dog saved my life todayI know it seems like tumblr girl fiction, but hear me out. 

Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember. Before I knew what it was I had thoughts of it. I was in a psychiatrists office from a very early age. I was even sent to a â€œtherapeuticâ€ boarding school to help me figure some of it out. Last year I tried TMS and got that fun magnet on my brain every day for months. Antidepressants help until they donâ€™t and then it feels like thereâ€™s no point.. I got a puppy a few years ago, heâ€™s a shiba inu and I named him Jarvis. I love him more than anything else in the world and most nights the thought of him in an apartment alone with my corpse is enough to deter me- but I woke up this morning and everything seemed slightly off. It felt like everything in the world was slightly out of place by a fraction of an inch. When I sat down at my desk for work the sun came in through the window and onto my hand- and I felt in me that it was time for me to finally do it(I know that sounds fake or corny or whatever but I swear itâ€™s true). A few hours passed and things kept feeling worse and worse. I told my boss I would have to leave early for the day and closed my computer. I took him out on a walk, and came back inside and he immediately started to panic - completely abnormal. He looked around the room as if something was there and started jumping at the door as high as he could. I started writing my letter. He sat at my feet, shaking. I decided I was going to cut my wrists and bleed out in the tub. I stood up and walked to the bathroom, he ran in and sat down in front of the tub, shaking and looking around behind me as if something was there. I sat on the floor with him until I lost the willpower to go through with it. I ended up taking a bath just to relax, and heâ€™s still sitting next to me. Completely unlike his normal shiba nature.
