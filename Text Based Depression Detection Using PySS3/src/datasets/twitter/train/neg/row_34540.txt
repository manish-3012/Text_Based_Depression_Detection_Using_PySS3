Feeling suicidalI'm so tired of living. 

I'm tired of always feeling depressed, tired of feeling so alone and isolated. And today of all days, where most other people are happy, spending time with loved ones and family. 

I don't have anyone. I'm alone, and I always will be. I brought this upon myself. Maybe if I wasn't so goddamn crazy, maybe if I actually let people in instead of pushing away. 

I'm fucked in the head, I know it. Antidepressants don't work for, they just fuck with my stomach and make me feel worse. Therapy doesn't work either, no matter what I do I will never get better.

I really do think the best thing for me is to end my life. I'm a failure. I'm not good at anything, I can't hold onto meaningful relationships, never had a girlfriend, I don't have any confidence in myself. I'll never be a productive member of society. 

I don't know when, but I know that someday I'll kill myself.
