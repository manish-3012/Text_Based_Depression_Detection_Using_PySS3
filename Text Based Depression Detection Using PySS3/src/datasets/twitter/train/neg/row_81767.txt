Staying alive just feels like too much sometimesI hadn't logged onto this account since some pretty dark times.

I'd been making progress, getting a diagnosis (Bipolar II), having meds prescribed and getting relatively sober (now just the occasional drink, and cigarettes daily). I've made some new friends, had a serious relationship during which I was feeling pretty good about myself and rediscovered some of my old functionality (I can now sometimes concentrate enough to read and write properly). I'm even due to be returning back to university. The whole time I had some level of suicidal thoughts, but somehow managed not to act on them. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, I still frequently feel myself crumbling into an endless pit of despair, and when I do the feeling is unbearable. I truly don't understand how people manage to just stay alive while remaining sober. And because I'm trying to stay sober so desperately because it makes me a shadow of my former self, I basically don't understand how I can stay alive. This feeling is always there, and when I'm not able to distract myself from it, it takes over everything else.

To use a crass example it feels like a sort of libido, which builds up more and more unless it's addressed by masturbating or having sex. So, in this analogy, it feels like "addressing it" would be harming myself or killing myself. I've been trying not to do either, but the underlying drive towards self-destruction only gets stronger in the absence of anything that satisfies it.

I don't think I'll act on this in the very near future. I think I'm more likely to relapse with drugs or alcohol. But I can't see how I can continue on, because the despair is overpowering and happens way too often.
