i want to dieThe world is so cruel and I have nothing to live for I think about suicide every day and I have a plan I go over it in my head all the time, it's almost foolproof but I need a lot of time. I'm nonbinary and my identity is a fucking joke to my family and I have been trying to get through to them but they refuse to listen. I'm taking meds and going to therapy and I still want to die. so if anyone wants to give me some motivation to just fucking kill myself please do
