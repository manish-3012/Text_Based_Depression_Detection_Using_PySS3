TerrifiedI've been depressed most of my life. I'm tired of struggling. I spent last night in a homeless shelter. It was fucking awful. I can't do this anymore. I have nowhere to stay and I'm terrified. I don't want to be assaulted, or have what little I have stolen. I have nowhere to go. I just want to die. I'm too scared to even do that.
