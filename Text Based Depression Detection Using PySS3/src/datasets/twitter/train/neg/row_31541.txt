I hate myself and where I'm going.My life lacks direction. I feel like eventually I'll amount to nothing in my entire life. What's the point of living if you aren't going to make a difference in at least one person's life? I also hate this feeling of being alone. I have my family but they don't make up for the lack of a romantic individual in my life.

I just feel like a failure and like I'll always be a failure.  I don't know. What's the point?
