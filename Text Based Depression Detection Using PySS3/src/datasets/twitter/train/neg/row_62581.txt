I'm just exhausted at this pointI'm just so tired. I've attempted to take my life multiple times but in the end I fail and feel even worse for it. I tried last night too and I just... Fuck man I'm just tired. I want to get professional help but can't where I live. I know that if something doesn't change now I won't last. I'm so tired of feeling so alone all the time and breaking down and feeling numb. I'm tired of this cycle and if I don't get better I know I'll kill myself. 

Can anyone please site any sources or support groups or anything like that? I won't be able to pay cuz I'm a minor. 

I'm just so tired of this shit man. I want to get better. I want to be ok for once in my miserable fucking life.
