I really want to fucking die. Just can't do it. I don't deserve to live but i mostly do it just to not hurt any family or friends. I feel like a useless piece of shit, being the second choice of everyone. Please don't tell that life is worth living cause all of us know that's bullshit. I hope that an accident kills me instead of killing myself. Fuck everyone.
