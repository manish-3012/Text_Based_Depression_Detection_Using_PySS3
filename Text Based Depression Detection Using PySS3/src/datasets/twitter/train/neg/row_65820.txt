What is the point of living if you have no job, no girlfriend or no friends.21 and still living at home with no future. I have really bad social anxiety, ocd and depression and I am on three different medications and they are not helping. I came here last year and people say things get better but I only see things getting worse. 

I do not have any money to get my acne scarring treated and no money to get braces. How can I even get a job if I don't look presentable let alone have mental illness?

I have no hope. I just want things to go back to the way things were before I was born...nothingness. I can't take this no more.
