I don't think it's worth it. I've been feeling this way for a very long time.I cannot hold a job down because I take too many days off. My depression is so bad I feel physical pain from it. I've been to the doctor's many many times and there's nothing physically wrong with me, according to them. I cannot afford therapy. I'm a terrible person. I feel I am failing at everything. I've been suicidal since before I was a teenager, 10 years ago now. I have no one and I struggle a lot to make friends. No one can do anything to save me. What is the point?
