I feel nothingEverything sucks, i literally have no one to talk to, my said 'friends' are never there, only when they need something from me, of course.
My family treats me like trash and just really don't make me feel accepted, safe or comfortable at all, they all treat my brother really well but for some reason i'm the outcast out of them, even though i'm completely 'normal'?
I've had depression and have been self-harming for about 3 years now, my family and friends don't really know or care about it, last year i've met an internet person that made me feel really special for some time, but lately that person isn't really there for me and i just don't even know how to explain how i feel
Nothing makes sense, everything hurts, i'm a mess and i really wish i could end my life so people wouldn't waste their time with someone as useless as me.
I'm a typical talentless high-schooler that doesn't really have any friends or any hopes of fulfilling any dreams relating my future, i honestly can't even imagine someone as dumb and worthless as me HAVING a future, I want to end my life and lately i've been really hopeless
I don't know if this sounds like i'm overreacting or anything, i have nothing and no one, i stumbled upon this reddit community so i tought i'd post the my thoughts...
My birthday is 10 days away, i want to commit suicide on that day.
