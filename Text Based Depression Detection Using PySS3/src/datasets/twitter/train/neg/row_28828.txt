Christmas wishesMy wish this holiday is to die without hurting my mom or my friends and to be brave enough to kill myself. I want them to remember me as someone who didn't choose the easy way out, but the only way to end my pain. I want them to be glad I'm not in pain anymore. I want support to do what I feel will make me feel better, and for me death seems like it will be a huge relief.
