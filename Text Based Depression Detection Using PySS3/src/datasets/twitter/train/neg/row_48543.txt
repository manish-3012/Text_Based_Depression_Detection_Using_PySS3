How to stop suicidal thoughts? I recently lost my mother, and it was an excruciating passing for her. I love my mother very dearly, and even through I still have remaining family. I cannot imagine myself living without her. She was my world. I'm in so much pain. I was getting over a suicidal episode a few months ago with her help, she may have not known I was suicidal, but just her comfort relieved so much. Now that the realization of her being gone permanently settled in. All I can feel is such an agony. Today, I sat in the darkness of the night with a knife. Just twirling it around my fingers. I didn't care of the pain at that point. I was either going to send that thing sliding through my wrist or penetrating it into my stomach. I was crying out and even though I have a sister here with me. She told me to go to sleep. To her view, I was rambling about stupidities and probably didn't hear the part where I wanted to die. I'm in my room at 5 in the morning thinking of death. Please help, there's still a part of me that is still worrying about the pain my family will go through. My sisters already lost their mother and then losing their younger sister. I don't want to put them there but there's the other part of me who just wants to join my mom. Just wants to end everything. 

    What are things I can distract myself with? What are things I can do to prevent this?
