I don't really know what to do with myself anymoreHey guys. this is kind of hard for me to talk about. I don't have anyone to tell in real life because I'm too afraid of the negative emotions people have when they hear this stuff.

I've been apathetic toward life for years now. Some days I'm okay, and I think being alive isn't bad. But other days, I feel as though the weight of the world is on my soul.

I'm not at an immediate suicide risk. Because I'm too afraid to hurt anyone who cares about me. Too afraid to disappoint others. Because, from the outside my life isn't bad. I just started my PhD at 21, my chronic disease is in remission, and I just moved to a new place to start over. I actually just starting exercising and eating right about a month ago because I knew that it would help. It hasn't.

I still feel like life is this giant burden that I bear so I don't hurt those around me. It is really tiring living for the sake of others.

Lately, I've been having more thoughts about suicide. More about how, i'm going to die at some point, because I just can't do this forever. I don't know when, but I just keep thinking about how I'm eventually going to be fed up. I told myself in high-school, it would get better. I told myself in undergrad it would get better. I'm so tired of waiting for it to get better.

I don't know. I need help, but I can't get professional help till September because then my "student insurance" kicks in and the counselling services are available. And I'm mildly concerned about myself until then. I just need to talk to someone about it, but I don't really want to talk. 

I just want to feel like living isn't such a heavy burden.
