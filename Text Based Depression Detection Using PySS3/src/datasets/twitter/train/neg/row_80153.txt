I can't wait for it all to be overI never understood why people react to death as a terrible tragedy. I can't relate to that. I feel like death is going to be the end of all the suffering,so why are people afraid of it so much? Honestly for me it couldn't come a minute too soon. I have no friends or anyone close to me, so no one would basically miss me. Im still in school and dont hold a job atm, so me suddenly dissapearing wont be a burden for somebody else either. Im completely replacable. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I'm afraid I'm not going to be successful, and then I have to live in an even worse condition and try to play catch up. That would be twice as difficult as it is now.
