i hate everything and i hate myself moreseeing everything and anything no matter what it is is just a reminder that everyone else is doing better in life than i am

all of my friends are more successful 

theyre doing well in school

theyre good at art

theyre good at making music

theyre better at getting help

theyre okay

im nothing

im terrible at everything ive ever tried , im failing in school , im too scared to drive , i cant have a job , all while my family is pressuring me about it all

ive been like this for years waiting for at least something to change but im only getting worse

i fucking hate myself
