if you really cared, you would show iti have people in my life, i am at university, i have a future, but i still think about ending it. it comes and goes, but mostly it comes when the school stress makes me feel i cannot take it any longer. i just wish how easy it would be if i wasn't alive anymore. and how no one will care if i die. i just cannot see myself like 10 years in the future or having kids, because i always think i'm not gonna live that far. why is it that only after some commits suicide do people start "caring" about them? if they cared they would have shown it when the person was alive. i have no friends to talk about this with, only my boyfriend whom i love very much, but since he hasn't had these problems, he doesn't really understand and says things will get better and you'll get through this. but i don't believe him, since every time these feelings keep coming back. i have no friends left, only people in school who sometimes ask me for class notes, and i have choir people who i am always so cheery and positive with, but to them i also cannot talk about this with since it doesnt make sense for them to think i might actually have these kind of thoughts since i am always so cheery around them. i don't even know where i want to go with this post, i just think that everybody who says that "someone always cares" is lying because if they truly cared, they would show it.
