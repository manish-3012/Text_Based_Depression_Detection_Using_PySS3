Hey&amp;#x200B;

I somehow distanced myself from people i want to be close to, i want to go outside with them but the outside worlds scare me. The only time we went out i broke down and had to leave, ruining their already shitty day even more. They\`re the only 2 people who i can actually say i\`m friends with, they both have groups of friends and stuff but they\`re all i have yet i\`m ruining it. Seeing them online with their friends and stuff hurts me. I have nothing. I can\`t even leave my house for more than a few hours without breaking down. Part of me is jealous but another just thinks they want to avoid me and spend time with people they actually like. I hate this.

Probably going to kill myself on valentines day.

If they do see this i just want to say im sorry and i really like both of you. That\`s all.
