my friends the only reason iâ€™m alive right nowafter finding out my best friend has had suicidal thoughts before it really affected me in a way i didnâ€™t expect. iâ€™ve been friends with this person since i was 5 (iâ€™m 18 now) and they mean the world to me and i would do anything for them. hearing them say that everyone would be better off without them really really hurt and anytime i think about the possibility of them passing away i cry. the other night i had a panic attack thinking theyâ€™d done something even though i had no reason to be worried, i just â€œfeltâ€ like something had happened. bc of my mental illness though iâ€™m never convinced anyone actually cares about me and i canâ€™t imagine anyone caring about me as much as i care about my friend. sometimes theyâ€™re truly the only reason iâ€™m still around because iâ€™m scared if i kill myself it puts them at a much higher risk of killing themselves too. which is the last thing i want because they were made for this world and theyâ€™re here to make an positive impact on the people around them. but i hate them sometimes because theyâ€™re the reason i have to stay alive. i want to die so badly but i only stay alive just so i know theyâ€™ll be okay. i hate them for it. the pains too much sometimes but i canâ€™t leave them by themself.
