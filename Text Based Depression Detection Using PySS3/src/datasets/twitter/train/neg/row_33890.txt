Incapable of lifeHello everyone. I don't really know why I'm posting this, but what harm can it do. I'm in my early twenties, and I'm pretty certain that suicide is my best option at the moment.

I have some health issues that make it impossible to have any sort of social life. I have suffered from fecal incontinence since I was a teenager, and I'm just too exhausted to come up with any more excuses. Amazingly no one has called me on it yet, but every time someone talks just out of earshot I assume they are talking about how much I stink, because they most likely are. Nothing I've tried has helped this problem and I'm too numb to try anymore. 

The other issue is that I'm constantly bored, but this is probably depression. I used to be a well rounded person with hobbies and interests, now I just work and play video games all day, and I don't even enjoy them, the just distract me.

I see my freind once every couple of months, because I'm too worried about being embarassment to enjoy hanging out with them. I only go out when they guilt me into it, and never because I want to.

Thank you for reading my wall of text. Suicide seems like the most rational response to my problems, but I'm open to being wrong.
