I don't want to live through another day just to sufferI can't take it anymore. Every day I patiently await my boyfriend's next text pointing out how useless I am. How I'm such a bad person who can't do anything right. 

My only friend and therapist gently suggest that I break up with him if he's causing me this much pain. But the thing is, I was going to kill myself before I met him and I thought I'd stick around for the happiness I feel when he's nice to me. Even if it's just for 30 minutes a day, I figured it was better to experience that than to be permanently dead. 

But now, I can't take this torture anymore. The happiness I feel is fading because I'm so scared for the next day's dose of pain. I had nothing before I met him and I'm back to having almost nothing. So I just want to die. 

But the hardest part is getting over my fear of feeling 1% of regret as I feel myself dying. But it will be too late. That's what I'm scared of the most. The panic and regret I'll feel as I die.
