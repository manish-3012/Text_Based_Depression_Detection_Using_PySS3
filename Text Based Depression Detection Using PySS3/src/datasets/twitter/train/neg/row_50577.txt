I just don't know what I'm supposed to do   My first year of high school, my (then) girlfriend manipulated my mind and got me into bad things. She was fucking everybody she laid her eyes on and she started doing meth and later became a stripper. It was very traumatic for me because I cared about her and now she's nothing but a community whore. So, that fucked me up. I'm almost done with college now, and I still think about it a lot because it is burned into my brain at this point.

   After all of that happened, I feel like I'm a dramatically different person now. I feel like everything I see is just a picture; I'm not connected to any of it and it doesn't mean anything to me anymore. I'm completely disconnected from reality and I don't know what to do. I understand that suicide is not the best option, but I'm tired of being inside of my own head. I just can't live an entire life like this.

I have suicidal thoughts almost every day and I really just need someone that I can hug and care about, but after all of that happened, I feel like it'll never be that easy. I don't have any social media, I have literally 1 friend, I don't talk to anyone, and it's getting to me.

   I need release, but again, I just don't know what I'm supposed to do.
