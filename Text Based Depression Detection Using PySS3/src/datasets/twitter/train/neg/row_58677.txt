Can't help but feel like everything is going to go wrong. What's the point of living if everything is just going to go to shit.Why the fuck do I even try to go to school, advance my career or meet with anyone. Fucking no one I know cares about me, I never get invited out to do anything I've always gotta reach out and I just feel like I'm annoying people by doing that. Odds are I'm not gonna stay with any significant other for the rest of my life, I'm just gonna get dumped like every other fucking time in my life. I've got no clue what I want to do with my life, fucked up first year at uni twice now. Working a minimum wage job in an industry I love but I know I can't have a future with that. I just feel like I'm broken, like something wrong with me and I can't do anything right. There's little bits of my life where I feel happy but it just feels so pointless to push through all the numbness to have some small glimpses of happiness.
