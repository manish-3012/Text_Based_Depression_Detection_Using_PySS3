I fought i succeeded now Iâ€™m back to who I was 4 years agoIâ€™ve become a shut in I donâ€™t socialize with anyone anymore. Iâ€™m about to get my associates degree from only taking online classes and I feel like Iâ€™m going down the same path I took sophomore year when I was at the peak of my depression. Iâ€™ve been thinking of self harm again but decided to use a rubber band to flick at me when I feel this way Iâ€™m just unsure of the future and if I will make something of it or if Iâ€™m just destined to live a life of a shut in and work from home. Iâ€™m just wondering if this is a sort of relapse .
