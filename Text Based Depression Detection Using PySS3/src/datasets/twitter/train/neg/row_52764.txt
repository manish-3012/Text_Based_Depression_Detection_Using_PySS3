We would be better off this wayStill pregnant, still alive. 

Stressed about money. CEO found out my boss approved a car allowance for me. CEO thinks I am an idiot, treats me like the office botch and like shit after over 8 years. 

CEO flips his shit and says I can't have anything, despite using my car every day for errands for him and getting his lunch. I haven't had a raise since 2010.

I was supposed to get back pay of this allowance to the beginning of the year. I was planning on putting it in the pitiful savings account for the baby. We had to pay so much in taxes that almost all our savings are gone.

My husband's bosses won't respond to his requests for a raise. Despite the fact that they assigned him two other employees worth of jobs instead of replacing the quit employees. He is making half of what just one of those guys was making. Literally half.

We are going to have to sell the house We worked so hard to get, move away from my comfort zone. Lose the equity, because we can only afford to move into an area where the houses don't appreciate.

I don't want to quit my job, the bad pay is still better than a college dropout is going to get anywhere else. How can I support anyone on less.

I don't want to be a monster and abort this baby that we tried for. That we announced to family. 

I just want to kill myself. Then I won't know what people are saying about how only a monster would kill their unborn baby when they selfishly committed suicide. How disgusting I am, how I deserve to burn in hell.
