Not the man I thoughtEver realize you aren't the man you thought? I thought I was strong, principled even but can't manage to kill myself. I thought I was tough but I'm terrified of living and terrified of killing myself.

I want to be principled. I want to have integrity and be disciplined and be a man of my word. But I fail at it and am ashamed that I'm a spineless piece of shit who can't even blow his own brains out.
