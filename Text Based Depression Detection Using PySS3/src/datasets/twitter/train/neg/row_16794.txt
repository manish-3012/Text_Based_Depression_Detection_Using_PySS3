Fuck thisIâ€™m so tired of living, I really donâ€™t wanna hurt my boyfriend but thatâ€™s how it goes sometimes, unfortunately. I donâ€™t wanna hurt my family either but they mustâ€™ve seen it coming for years. This world is isolating. Cold. Ruthless. I didnâ€™t ask to be born, my lifeâ€™s not even particularly bad, but nothingâ€™s ever enough, is it? Iâ€™m never enough. People would be right if they say I still have a chance but I feel like life is already over, Iâ€™m almost 20 and Iâ€™m crying in my moms apartment, with the most social interaction I get coming from this site, which I hardly even like. I feel trapped but Iâ€™m also ashamed because I know Iâ€™m the one holding the key. Iâ€™m too pathetic to do anything so Iâ€™ll probably be back, I just realized I might be impulsive but Iâ€™m gonna go along with it. No fuck that, Iâ€™m justified in what Iâ€™m doing. Wish me luck
