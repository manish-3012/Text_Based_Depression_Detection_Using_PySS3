Friend attempted suicide. How do I act around him?A friend of mine attempted to suicide a few days ago. He is an interesting person and defenately stands out from the crowd.

I was shocked when I found out about it and I never could have imagined something like this. Now he is ok in a psychiatric clinic (I trust google translate for this one)  and gets the help he needs. His parents are extremely supportive and nobody knows for certain why he tried to do it.

Now here is why I am making this thread : I would feel guilty if I didn't try to talk to him. And I absolutely have no idea how to do that, when to do that and if I should do that. In my head there are 2 different scenarios : 

1. He would like to talk to someone about it but can't, as nobody wants to do that. He is bored af and he wouldnt mind chilling with someone.
2. He doesn't feel like doing it and would feel embarrased. It would be an awkard and forced conversation we both wished never started.

So here I am asking Reddit for help. If you have experienced something like or even if you didn't, please let me know in the comments how you did it. It would mean a lot to me, maybe even for him.

I can provide more information if needed.

Thank you
