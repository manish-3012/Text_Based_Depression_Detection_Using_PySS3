stupid kid saying stupid thingsI try helping everyone I can and I really do my best but... Iâ€™ve rarely received the same treatment. Iâ€™ve been hanging out and staying busy and being happy when I can but I still lie awake and think about why Iâ€™m even alive. My dreams have been torn from me, Iâ€™ve lost countless friends time and time again, I feel so isolated and lonely. I know Iâ€™m so hypocritical telling everyone not to do it and thereâ€™s help and you just need one good friend but I just canâ€™t stop these feelings. I have such a terrible urge to die.
