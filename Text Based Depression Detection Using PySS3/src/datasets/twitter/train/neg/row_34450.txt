How do I die?I want to die, but I can't seem to kill myself. 

For over a decade I've struggled with depression. I have fought to be here over and over again. I am exhausted. I am tired of climbing up a hill only to never get to reach it's peak before sliding back down. 

I am a terrible person and need to change for the better but do not have the motivation to do so. 

I broke up with my boyfriend of five years. I let a coworker move in with me. I let myself fall in love. I let myself get my heart broken. I let myself be used. I used others. I let the anger and hatred I have for myself bubble over into everything I have. I lost my best friends. I'm going to lose my job because everyone hates me there.

I am a loser. I'm 26 and I'm alone, broke, depressed and bitter. I can't drive. I have to rely on friends and family for everything. I cause more problems than I could ever hope to solve. I have never made a single person's life better from being in it. Not once. 

I have been suicidal on and off for years. So often that the thought is almost comforting at this point. But I have never wanted to die more than I do right now. And I'm a fuck-up when it comes to suicide, too. I can't commit. I don't have access to a gun and I'm too chicken-shit to take pills or to try hanging myself. If it doesn't work, what then? To have failed at life is too much, what would it feel like to have failed death too?

I want to die tonight. I haven't never known what I wanted more clearly than this. And yet I feel trapped by my own cowardice. I have always been the maker of my own nightmares. Why would I ever think this would be any different, right?

I don't know what to do at this point. How do I die?
