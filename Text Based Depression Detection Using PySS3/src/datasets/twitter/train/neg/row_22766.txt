Could use some help...So it's my birthday this weekend, and every year it's the same, I get so depressed looking at back on what I've done with the previous year, my life as a whole, and all of my peers.  I've lost my drive, the only reason I work is so that I can keep the things I do have, and then drink the rest of my money since it's about the only thing that makes me happy.  I am close with my family, I suppose, but I don't have any real connections with my peers.  I don't much like myself or feel I have anything to offer.  I just don't know, I feel helpless and lost.  I want to end it, but I don't think I can work up the nerve.  Maybe I just need help, or someone to talk to.  I don't really have anyone I feel comfortable opening up to, and I definitely can't afford any real help on my crappy wage.   Ugh.
