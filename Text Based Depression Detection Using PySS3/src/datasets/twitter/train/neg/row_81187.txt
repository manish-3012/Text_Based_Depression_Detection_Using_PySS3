My patience has gone, my task is done hereGreetings, the subject of my reluctant return to the energy field is centered around a concept of compassion and unity. Through the travel in this physical form, the best time had, was felt while receiving and giving love. It has become the one everlasting obsession to dominate meaning throughout this trial. 

Put simply, thine heart is healed and ready to be open to another yet again. Even still there is a potential love in the make on this day. Alas this is attempt 13billion, my standards are about the clouds. To find an individual that sparks an interest within me is difficult to say plainly. 

Therefore I will travel this current avenue until it's end, which seems close in hand. Except at the end of the day; if I don't find love this time. I am tired of being alone. Tired of getting to know one person after another to have it mean nothing. Tired of getting thine hopes up for nothing. Tired of who I am because clearly I am not liked. Tired of being a nice person to see the assholes of this world succeed.

If I don't find love this time, I am done. I will kill myself.
