[Serious] What would you prefer, to be blissfully unaware or be told that a close friend who hasn't talked to you for some months commitied suicide?Was planning to do the deed once the lockdown lifts in a couple of days. Was wondering what would they prefer. I haven't talked to them for about 3-4 months now. Should I talk to them once(with or without mentioning) or just let them be and believe that I just turned into a complete arsehole.
