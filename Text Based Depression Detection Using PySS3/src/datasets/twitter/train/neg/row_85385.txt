My mom found out I am suicidal and nothing has changed whatsoever.I donâ€™t think she cried... she just asked questions and then said sheâ€™d try to get my meds switched. She hasnâ€™t been more caring. It was like talking to a robot. 

Sheâ€™s by no means a terrible mother... but I just always assumed this would be a huge deal. I thought weâ€™d talk for hours and sheâ€™d try to help me. But nope, she just acted mechanical as always.
