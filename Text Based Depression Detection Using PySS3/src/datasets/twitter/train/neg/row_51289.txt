Suicidal thoughts about parkingI am having some trouble right now. I cannot stop thinking about parking spaces for 8-10 hours a day. I am a new driver but am struggling parking within the lines for perpendicular parking. However, I keep having thoughts that I will never be able to have children or that I might murder someone when parking.

Additionally ,since I haven't learned how to reverse park, I'm having thoughts that I will automotically not learn how to do it and just kill people. Thus, having any career or trying seems pointless if the world is all just going to end from a car accident.

Anyways, does this thinking seem rational? I am worried that I will never get a partner or have any life solely because of my parking abilities. The only way this could possibly be cured is by perfecting parking!!
