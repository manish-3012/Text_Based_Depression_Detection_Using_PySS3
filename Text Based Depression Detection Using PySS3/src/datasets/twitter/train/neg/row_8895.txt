A titleI am finished. I thought I had finally made a stable sane life. Got fired from my career of 5 years a few months ago because apparently Asset Protection is more about protecting the asses of your supervisors than the assets of the company. I was finally granted unemployment (rarely happens in my state because the employer is required to pay 100% of it if it's granted), missed an appointment after the city where I've lived for a year decided my truck, which I've always parked in the same spot and drive nearly every day, was abandoned. Couldn't pay to get it out. Spent my rent money on that. Finally getting interview calls, in the process of being evicted. This week has been ok. Last week, I slept twice. Had people banging on my doors and windows all times if day, had enough I could feel it in the walls. I'm done. Doesn't matter if I get an interview if 1: it's a good week and I smell like boiled asshole because I don't have anywhere to bathe or wash clothes, or 2: I'm hallucinating again and do something crazy and get arrested. I'm done. I've given this life as much as I have to give. I'm out. No energy left to try and make this body and mind do something I'm apparently just not fucking made for.
