My ex dreamed about me committing suicide. Just thinking about it breaks my heart even if it's all my fault.Before my ex left me, he tried his best to help me when I was extremely suicidal. He was so scared of losing me and even had dream about it. He dreamed the first one when I told him I tried to choke myself with my red cardigan. In his dream he and I were both adult and he visited my home. He found the door opened and came inside carefully and found out I hanged myself with my red cardigan. 

And several months passed and we had gone through so much and I felt worse and worse and I thought to kill myself this February. Around that time he dreamed about him visiting my grave when he became adult. He said on the grave, it's written that I died in February 2020. And there was no candle, no flower at all near my grave as if I am totally forgotten. 

Just thinking about it breaks my heart. I can imagine how painful he was when he dreamed losing me. I can imagine how scared he was. I cant even say sorry for this because he left me. I am so sorry for everything but however I regret, it doesnt change anything. It doesnt change the pain I am going through and it doesn't change how horrible I was to him. I cry over and over again but it doesn't lessen any pain. He never deserved this. It's all my fault. And I can't even compensate it.


Ps. Sorry for bad English. It's not my mother language.
