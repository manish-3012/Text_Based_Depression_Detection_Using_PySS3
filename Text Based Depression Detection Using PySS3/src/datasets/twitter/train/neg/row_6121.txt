Helpless. Hopeless. I donâ€™t even know anymoreI have people who love me. 
I donâ€™t love myself. 
They donâ€™t know the real me. 
I keep that hidden away. 

I have reasons to be happy. 
But Iâ€™m not. 
People say â€œit gets betterâ€
But itâ€™s not my life that makes me miserable. 
Itâ€™s me. 
And sometimes it does get a little better.  
But then it just gets fucking terrible again. 

I feel like instead of a heart, thereâ€™s a black hole in my chest that sucks up everything good and just leaves me with rot. 

I feel myself rotting from the inside out. 

It hurts. I hurt. I feel black rot consuming my insides. Consuming any light that used to be inside. Consuming any remaining sliver of love for myself. 

I should be happy. 
Thereâ€™s a prospect of a bright future ahead. 
I should be happy. 

But Iâ€™m not. 
I donâ€™t remember the last time I was happy. 
I was numb for a long time. 
A really long time. 

I hated being numb. 
I wish I could go back to being numb. 
Or I wish I could just not feel anything at all. Forever.
