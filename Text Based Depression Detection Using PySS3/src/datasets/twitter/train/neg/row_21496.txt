I tried to kill myself. It didnt work. Thought it was a sign. Now ive been laid off.Wednesday night I had a failed suicide attempt. It was my third of my life but was the first time I'd tried in years. I genuinely took it as a sign to get my shit together. Today I found out I'm being laid off from my job. I really don't think I have the emotional capacity to find a new one. I'll have to move back in with my emotionally abusive mother and since I'll lose my health insurance I won't be able to go to therapy anymore. Just wanted to rant a bit. Not sure if I'll try again to kill myself or if I'll just keep trudging unhappily through life. Had to get my thoughts out.
