I have absolutely no will to live any more. Not even my beloved dogs can keep me going...They are the world to me.. I love them so much, if I managed to get myself out of bed and take care of myself, it was for them. But even they can not keep me going any more. My selfishness has override my ability to see through all the suffering for them. Despite my conviction before that I could not let myself die because I need to be there for their sake, I have now planned my death. 

Earlier, I lay in bed crying, and they cuddled up next to me, they would not leave my side. They love me unconditionally and they shouldn't, I am a worthless piece of shit. They give me this outpouring of their love and still I am going to kill myself. 

I tried so hard to be strong. I tried to do whatever I could to feel better. Some times, things helped a little, but only for a while. I always fall back to feeling this way. The moment I feel I reached stability, my volatility comes out again. I wreck every friendship I have, everyone I become close to ends up hating me. It's me. There is something wrong with me... I don't even think I'm human. Rationally I know I am human, but something is missing in me. I don't know if my brain is damaged from all the head injuries, or maybe I was born without it, but I am not whole and I never will be. 

I am so exhausted of it all... I have no energy left to keep trying.. I don't even know why I bother to be posting this here because nothing anyone can say will change what I am. I'm exhausted and I give up trying
