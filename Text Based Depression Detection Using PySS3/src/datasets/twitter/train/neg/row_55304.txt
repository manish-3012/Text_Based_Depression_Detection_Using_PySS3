I'm one bad event away from throwing myself from my windowI am so tired of having a sad feeling deep inside of me all of the time. Even when I'm with friends laughing I'm still sad deep down. It's been this way for 9 years now and I've almost had enough.
2 weeks ago a relatively minor thing happened, but my brain has turned it into this massive thing that I can't stop thinking about. I can't work, I can't sleep, I can't eat.
Last night I dreamt that I jumped from my window. When I woke up I could move or make a sound.
Now I'm laying here next to my 16th story window at 1:30 AM debating with myself wether I should end it or not.
