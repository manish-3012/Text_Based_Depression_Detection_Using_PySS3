SundayI can't last another week, today proved that without a doubt. I don't blame anyone but myself for my problems, everyone has been kind and understanding but I don't see an end in sight, no amount of sympathy can fix what is so clearly broken. It's all been downhill since November. I'm sorry. I love this sub reddit and everyone on it but I can't see myself going any further. If I don't post an update by Sunday I'll be dead.

Goodbye, and thank you to everyone on here who takes the time out of their day to help others, I hope you all keep it up you're a beam of light in a dark place.
