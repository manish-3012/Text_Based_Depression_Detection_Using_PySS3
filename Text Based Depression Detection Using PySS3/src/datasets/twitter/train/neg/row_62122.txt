I don't want to live anymore. I am a failure of a human being.No friends, no memories. I only have recollections of failure. A loser who hasn't even kissed a girl. A pathetic virgin. Hell, I have never even held a girl's hand. I've joined the military but fucked that up. I'm weak. I couldn't even make it past bootcamp. I am pathetic. I am a giant waste of time.

I'm in community college. My grades sucked in high school.

I can't do a single fucking thing right. I've even almost killed someone while driving. I'm an idiot and downright worthless. 

I don't want to be alive anymore. What is there for me? I'm 19 and all I can do is drink myself to death. I have nothing to be proud of.  I'm a disgrace to my family. I only ruin their name.

I would be doing them a favor by killing myself. I want to die. I'm a giant piece of shit. I am worthless. I can't do this anymore.

At this point, I'd rather get hit by a bus. I am a toxic person. I don't belong in the lives of others.
