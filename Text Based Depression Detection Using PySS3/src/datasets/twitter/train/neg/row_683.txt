don't know what to do.everyday feels more melancholic than the last, so much free time to just sit here and contemplate - i don't know how much more i'll be able to handle. i can't just get up and end my life, i know it'll destroy the one person who cares about me, my mother. i just don't know what to do anymore, i'm stuck.
