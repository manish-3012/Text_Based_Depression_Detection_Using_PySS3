Lost energy to fight this hellI'm older now. Been in bed for last 48 hours straight. Before that saw dr and said celexa has bottomed out after 4 years. Wants to try Wellbutrin. I used to be able to at least get out of bed. Can't even do that. I have no fight left. I mean that. Maybe that's why people kill themselves in their 40s .. you could fight but no longer. I'm also agoraphobic and every day is hell. I'm thinking about saying goodbye. Not obviously but subtlety. I'm so so tired. I want to die now. No fanfare .
