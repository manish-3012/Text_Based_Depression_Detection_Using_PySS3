I don't want to die, but life is so exhausting.I'm exhausted emotionally and physically constantly and I know that the only way I'll be "rested" is on death. I doubt I'll ever do anything because the void is completely terryifing but each time I feel an ache in my soul my brain reminds me that the only way out is death.
