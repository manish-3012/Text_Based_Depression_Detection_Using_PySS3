People are selfish for advocating against suicide but not giving a shit about you while you're alive.I feel like it's selfish for others to not want you to commit suicide. It's selfish for people to force you to endure an agony they will never understand, day after day, because *they* want access to you whenever they want (but don't use it). They never text or call, they never want to hang out, they don't give a shit until you're dead or close to it. In my opinion that's a form of human cruelty - forcing someone to stay alive but not really caring about them while they're here. 

I don't understand why people do this. During the height of my depressive episode I actually resented my friends for expecting me to stay alive when they so clearly didn't give a shit that I was suffering so badly on my own. 

I feel like when people die others just want to leech off of the drama of it all and post about "how sad they are that you're gone" but they never expressed interest in connecting with you while you're alive. Wanting people to stay alive for your own benefit is selfish. And God, I am so tired of it all.
