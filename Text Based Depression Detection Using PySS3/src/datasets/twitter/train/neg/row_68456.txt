I keep thinking that I wouldnâ€™t mind if the lights went out..I donâ€™t want to bore anyone with the gritty details, but long story short I am losing my home, the woman I love and my way of life. Everything is falling apart and I feel like my reality has become a kind of torture. To make matters worse I also feel guilty for feeling borderline suicidal about these things because I know there are so many people out there who have it worse than me and are fighting harder than I am. Itâ€™s a bit of a nasty feedback loop.
