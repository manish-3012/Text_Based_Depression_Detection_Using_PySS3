Would almost dying curb suicidal thoughts?I wonder if I almost committed suicide, enough to feel the impact but not enough to die would at least somewhat curb the intensity of what Iâ€™m feeling? Like how when I look at SH images or just slightly self harm, it helps for some time. I just feel so fucking stupid for not doing it years ago before tying myself down.
