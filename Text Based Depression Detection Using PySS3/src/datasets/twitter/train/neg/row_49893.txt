Wishing I could see the future to know if it's all worth itLife feels so meaningless. I'm 18 and so uncertain of the path my life will take. Everything I do feels hopeless and I'm so sick of trying. I wish I could just get a glimpse into the future so I could know if sticking around is even worth it. Even if I "accomplished" things in my life, it all ends eventually so what is even the point in trying? Nothing anyone says comforts me. I know that no matter what I do I'm just marching towards the same inevitable conclusion. My whole life I've given up every time something has even shown signs of getting hard. I'm the most weak and pathetic person I know. It feels like the only way out is to keep giving up.
