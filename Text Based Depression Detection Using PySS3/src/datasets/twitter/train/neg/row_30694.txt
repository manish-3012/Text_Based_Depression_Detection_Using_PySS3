I just lost hope.I just posted about this but I got in an accident on Sunday and was charged with a DUI even though I wasnâ€™t driving the car. 

Before I got my car I was in such a dark place and felt like I was trapped. Having that car was such a breath of fresh air for me. Knowing I could go anywhere and see my friends and be independent was such a relief and I felt like I finally had a sense of purpose, if even for such a little thing. 

A lawyer basically just told me that I donâ€™t have a realistic shot at winning my case and Iâ€™ll likely be convicted and have, not only a criminal record, but I wonâ€™t be able to drive again for a very long time. 

I donâ€™t want to be in the place that I was before I got my car. I donâ€™t want to feel trapped again. I donâ€™t even want to be here anymore and I havenâ€™t even gone to the trial yet. 

Iâ€™m thinking I might just end it in the next few days... Maybe just not show up after work one night and wander onto the highway when I see a car coming. 

The worst part of this whole thing is that if Iâ€™d just said no, if Iâ€™d just gone home after work, if Iâ€™d just done x y z I would still be free.
