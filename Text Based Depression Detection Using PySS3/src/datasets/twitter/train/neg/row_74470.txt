I'm less then a nobody.Edit: title should be renamed to "I am worth less then nothing"

-I just hate everything!

-I can't stand a second anymore.

-I hate beeing me 

-I hate having this fucking awful family

-I hate beeing a coward

-I hate not be able to cut my veins because I am that much of a coward.

-I just want to make it stop

-I hate taking space that someone else could use

-I hate hating everything

-I hate beeing depressed

-I hate being alive

-I just want to end it all I just want to leave everything behind me.

That's all. 

I don't ask for a million or a big house!

I just want to quit everything

I want to save this space for someone who could use it.

And what I hate more then that is knowing that I can't do it. 

-I am just a failure.

-Mother natures most hated kid.

-The one nerdy kid in middle school that everyone picked at.

-The minor role in a B-movie

-The biggest mistake that my parents made

I am just not important.
