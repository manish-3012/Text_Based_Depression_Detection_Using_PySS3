I'm angry (rant)I'm in a research study on mental health, and I had a meeting with the counselor/therapist I've been assigned. Well anyway she asked if I had any suicidal actions this week and I told her I laid on my bed one day and held my knife to my throat because it felt relieving and comforting. 

After that she flipped out even though I said I had no intent to harm myself (I dont believe I did, but I already forgot what I was feeling on that day). She told me she'd have to call my parents cause I'm a minor and she's a mandatory reporter. The day after that I get a call from the hospital/insurance company my family uses and they're asking how my mood is, what happened that day, if I did my homework (giving my knives to my parents to be locked up). 

Then that afternoon I had a phone appointment with my psychiatrist and he brought it up too. Something like "So I read you have been feeling suicidal" 

I dont know why it pisses me off so much, but it does.

I regret talking to the counselor in the first place (she's not my normal therapist) and overall just have a bad impression of her now. I feel hurt that she went out and alerted everyone about nothing that big when I told her I was fine. I have another meeting with her in four days and I'm just not really looking forward to it because this weeks topic is my homicidal thoughts. 

I definitely need to watch what I say to her now because it made my parents so bat shit crazy on me. They're scared to leave me home alone, and try to tell me I need to "relax" and stop being so stressed. And I try to explain to them being stressed is what motivates me to get out of bed, it keeps my mind busy and off other thoughts. My dad even told me "You get triggered too easily. You just need to stop" Excuse me?

I'm frustrated beyond words that can explain, and my real counselor who I actually like is out on honeymoon leave for a few weeks. It will be hell until she gets back
