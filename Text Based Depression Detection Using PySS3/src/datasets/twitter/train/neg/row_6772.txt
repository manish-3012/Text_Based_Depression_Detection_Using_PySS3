Iâ€™m an idiot and tried to kill myself last nightI woke up this morning pissed off at myself mostly. I woke up to someone banging on my front door. The memories of last night didnâ€™t really register until I opened the door and saw my mom standing there. She said the cops were on their way. She tried to get me to show her my wrists but I wouldnâ€™t let her. The police came. Somehow I managed to get them to leave without them sending me to the hospital or an institution. 

They left and then my dad showed up. He almost started crying. He said â€œof all the scenarios that played through my head when I heard you attempted suicide, you being alive is the best possible outcome,â€ (or something like that). 

Iâ€™ve been struggling a lot over the last couple of weeks. I guess last night the weight of it all finally got to me. I did some serious damage to my thigh and my wrists. It hurts like hell today. 

I was drinking. Thatâ€™s ultimately the cause of this. I bought a bottle of wine for myself and after receiving my grades from this past semester and finding out I passed, I thought Iâ€™d celebrate. Except what ended up happening is I turned music on... and a series of sad songs that remind me of someone who died played back to back. I slipped into a state of mind I couldnâ€™t get myself out of. 

I called the suicide hotline but the conversation lasted maybe 5 seconds. Theyâ€™d hung up on me once before and I really have no faith in them. I thought Iâ€™d give them another shot, but no. So I came here. I posted.... a lot. There were so many wonderful people trying to help me but I just couldnâ€™t listen for some reason. I still put a couple gashes into myself anyways. 

Someone screenshot one of my posts and sent it to the police. I donâ€™t know who you are, if youâ€™re reading this or not, but this morning I *hated* you. I donâ€™t hate you now, I think what you did was commendable. You were legitimately worried that I might take my life. If I wasnâ€™t so shitfaced I might have been able to hold the razor better (sorry, dark suicide humor). 

Iâ€™m alive but I donâ€™t feel like I deserve to be. Im humiliated and knowing how scared my parents were is going to haunt me. I wish they didnâ€™t have to know what I did last night. Their lives would be better. 

My body hurts *really* fucking bad. 

I guess I just came here to say thanks for looking out for me even if I didnâ€™t want you to at the time.
