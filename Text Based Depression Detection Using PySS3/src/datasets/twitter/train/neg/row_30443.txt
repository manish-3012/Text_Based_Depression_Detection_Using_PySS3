I just told my boyfriend I've been thinking of killing myself. He said "I'm sorry" and left for workIf he doesn't care, who does?
I've been stopping myself out of guilt for my loved ones. If they won't look out for me, am I finally free to end my pain? 

**edit:** I know he loves me and he has been aware of my depression for two years, but I've never felt suicidal until now. It's really scary because it's all I think about anymore.  Sometimes I think he gets sick of consoling me when he knows my issue is chronic and it's just the way I am. To him I'm just feeling sad again, I'll cry and it will pass. 

But this is so much different. I've never 'cried wolf' on suicide before and I seriously think I need help this week or I won't make it through. These impulses are so strong and the one person I was hoping to reach out to is ...indifferent.  I tried to make it clear how serious this is, how it's different this time. And he walked out of my arms.

When I don't want to be alive, and would feel content with being dead forever (like always) it's the people around me keeping me here because losing me would be devastating on them. But I hate every second of it, I live miserably, I go to bed depressed, wake up anxious, have flashbacks at inconvenient times. At what point do I prioritize my pain above theirs? If everyone could just understand, and let me go, I would be so much happier. Fuck
