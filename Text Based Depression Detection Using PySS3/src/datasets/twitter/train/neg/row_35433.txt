I keep forgetting i'm not close to him anymore.I want to open up to him. I want to tell him i care about him. I don't want to think about how we have both changed, how we have grown apart. I know he doesn't care anymore. And i pretend that i don't care either. I push everyone away. I have nobody now. Nobody. My one close friend is starting to drift away too. They are probably done with all my shit. Neither of them could deal with me. I'm never good enough, i always hey left behind.. I just want a friend who cares as much as i care about them. But nobody ever stays.. It seems like i will always be alone.
