(throwaway) No point to living anymore.Fucking hate my life. failing every single one of my classes and my parents punish me by taking away my tech, which i need for school work, till i get my grades up. They just read everything i posted on my main acc. and yelled at me after finding out im atheist. Fucking dont know how to graph and my teacher isn't helping me at all. quarantine is making me depressed. and ya i taught myself not to show emotion at all and now i physically cant cry. Just feel like my time is coming to an end as all my old friends left me for the popular group and left me in the dust. The other day i texted on a  suicide hotline and it charged me money for each text i sent. Going to probably just jump infront of a bus soon if i dont feel better.
