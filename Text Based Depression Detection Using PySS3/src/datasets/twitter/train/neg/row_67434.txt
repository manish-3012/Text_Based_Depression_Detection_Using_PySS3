I Think About Killing Myself Before, During, and After WorkThe first time I had seriously attempted suicide was when I was working retail at Kmart. I had dreams about killing myself at work. I hated retail. I hated everything about it. I left that job and started working at a Tim Hortons and a bar. I was happier busting my butt at two jobs than working as a fucking cashier. 

Its several year later and my degree is basically pointless because of the virus. I applied to everywhere around me and the only place that would hire me is a dollar general. I'm fucking miserable. I think about killing myself constantly. I think about just falling backwards off a ladder and busting my head open. I think about jumping in front of a train before I get there.

No one else in my household is working and we need this money. But I'd rather fucking kill myself than go into work again. I'd rather fucking kill myself.
