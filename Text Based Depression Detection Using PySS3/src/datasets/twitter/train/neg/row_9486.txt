Who caresTaking care of my parents.  Mom with advanced Parkinson Disease.  Dad is blind.  Two older brothers.  No help.  Mom wants to visit FL where the oldest lives.  Middle will fly them down.  Oldest, who is a doctor, wonâ€™t fly them back up.  Insists on a medical transport company.  If they go, I will figure out a way for me to transport them back.

Itâ€™s been two years since Iâ€™ve been taking care of them.  Iâ€™ve asked for help but Iâ€™ve gotten none.  I havenâ€™t had one 24 hour cycle to myself.  I either want to blow my head off or slice my throat open.  Will go somewhere where nobody can find me &amp; I will rot.  My career is on hold.  Working two jobs.  Iâ€™m breaking apart.
