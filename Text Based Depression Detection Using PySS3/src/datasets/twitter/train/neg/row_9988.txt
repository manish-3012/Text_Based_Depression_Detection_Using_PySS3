Cruel, merciless world.I never thought my life would come crumbling down like this. Sure, I had a bad start in life but I thought I would find a way out of this mess and start fresh. But I can't do that as I am clearly too mentally challenged to do anything in life. 

I am 21 and come from a very poor family in a third world country. My parents are retarded and I don't know how they still survive in this society without being sent to some kind of asylum. I am very bitter and angry after having life throw so much shit on me. I can't remember the last time I was happy. I am unhappy with everything- my gender, height, looks, intelligence etc. I don't have a single person I can call a friend. People treat me like I am the dumbest person alive. I spend most of my time sitting alone in a small room playing games in my cheap ass laptop. 


Some of my problems could be solved if I was smart. But I honestly know that I am not. I think I might just really be on the lowest part of the autism spectrum(god I HATE that word). Can't do even basic stuff and function in society. Don't know how someone like me could get help. I am too socially unskilled to get a job so I have to depend on my poor father's income. Can't believe how cruel and merciless life can be. If you are not lucky, life can be hell. The longer I live, the bitter I become. Wish I could at least kill myself painlessly. But there is no painless way to go, is there?
