On October 1st im gonna end it.Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m so sick of having no confidence. Sick of having to pretend Iâ€™m alright. 16 years of this shit. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m so exhausted of just being here, having to deal with the never ending battle with myself. Im so tired of not having a partner to just hug them and cry. Tired of feeling that my friends don't want me around. Tired of depending on other people. I hate myself so much. I donâ€™t think I have the courage to end it. But I hope I do. See you all on the other side.
