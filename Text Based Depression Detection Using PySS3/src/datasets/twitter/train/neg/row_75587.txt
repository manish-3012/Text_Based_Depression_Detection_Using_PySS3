I wish I had the strength to end itI wish I had the courage to go ahead and just end my life. I used to be so happy and healthy and full of life, but the past 2 years of my life have been absolute hell. Every morning I wake up with extreme nausea because Iâ€™m so anxious. I cry daily because of how awful I feel all the time. My mind tells me constantly throughout the day how worthless and ugly and stupid I am. I canâ€™t escape my thoughts. I always think worst case scenario and I can never believe that I do a good job at anything. I have intrusive thoughts and annoying compulsions due to OCD like wearing a certain bracelet on my left wrist otherwise Iâ€™ll be fired. Iâ€™m exhausted just keeping up with half of the compulsions I have to just make it through the day. I find myself wishing I would get hit by a semi truck or that I would just die in my sleep. I have a fiancÃ© who is everything to me and he is my main reason that Iâ€™m even still here, and 3 cats who adore me, but even they canâ€™t help me through this, and I wouldnâ€™t expect them to. Everyone tells me it will get better. Maybe it will, but how far away from now? Years? I donâ€™t have much left in me. Iâ€™ve let myself go completely, I havenâ€™t seen a doctor or dentist or anything in years because Iâ€™m finding it hard to care about me anymore. I have a lingering fear that something is horribly wrong with me or that Iâ€™ll never be able to have kids because I havenâ€™t seen a doctor in so long Iâ€™ve probably had some illness or disease this whole time. I want my loved ones to be happy, but I see myself as a lost cause. I never went to college like I should have, I have a job that seems great on the surface but in reality this job was the start to my hell and it has destroyed me as a person. and now Iâ€™ve gained at least 60 plus pounds to the point where I donâ€™t even recognize myself in the mirror, all I see is a sad, disgusting, worthless person who shouldnâ€™t exist. I donâ€™t want to hurt like this anymore but I canâ€™t bring myself to just do it because it would be devastating for my family. Iâ€™m stuck doing this until my life is done running itâ€™s course. I wish I was stronger.
