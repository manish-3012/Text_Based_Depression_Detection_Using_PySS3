Bf of 3 years wants a break and it's my faultIm jealous of him. When he hangs out with other girls or gets DMs from his girl friends, I make small little jokes about how it bothers me. Obviously, it is how i really feel about them but i just act like its a joke. 

Anyways, my bf has helped me a lot. I spend 80% of my time with him, 20% of my time at school. I have a sick grandma who raised me that I try to take care of when I come home from seeing him. He has been there through her stroke, anytime my mom would abuse me, and any other time I just was stressed out and needed someone to vent to. We shared so many amazing memories together as well. We went and traveled to places together. His family is so so nice to me. They are nicer to me than my family has ever been to me.

And now he wants to take a break from me.

I just wish I knew how to stop my self destructive behaviors and save our relationship. I was just so young when we dated (17) and now im 21 and now HE is all that I know. People say to get into hobbies that I left behind but i'm just a grown woman now. I dont have anything that I am interested in. I failed my second class this semester. I just dont feel like my situation could ever come back up from this. I dont see myself without him.
