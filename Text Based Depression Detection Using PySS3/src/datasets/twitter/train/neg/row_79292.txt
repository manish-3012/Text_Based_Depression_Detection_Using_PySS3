In agony and finally ready to go.A few years ago I wanted to go, but collapsed in the forest before making it. I was found and my father was angry at me but supportive and my mother had a shock.

Today my wife opened up to me. She told me about a variety of fears and anxieties concerning our future, that ultimately are my fault. She said, that she is drained but wants counseling and save the marriage. 

I'm defeated and done with life. I thought I could become old, have kids and be happy. But that was an illusion. My parents are old, my wife can't continue to fight and I don't want to try anymore. I want to die to live in the light.
