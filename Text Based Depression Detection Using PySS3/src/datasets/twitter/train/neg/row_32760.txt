I can't think of one reason I wouldn't want to kill myself.I've got the point where I don't really see any reason to live anymore. I've lost everyone close to me, failed in college due to depression and have a debt I can't do anything about, my bank account is negative, my car is out of gas, I don't have a job, I don't do anything, and I don't talk to anyone.

My (ex) girlfriend litteraly just broke off with me through a text saying she couldn't deal with my depression. My whole plan for getting better involved her. Now I have nothing.

My step dad choked me he was so pissed at me so I got kicked out of his house. My actual dad couldn't deal with me anymore so they sent me to my brother, and my brother couldn't deal with me either so now I am back with the man who chocked me.

I don't have any friends anywhere to talk to. Everyone left me and doesn't even bother to respond if I attempt to reach out.

I have no money so I can't get a job because I live in the middle of nowhere and my car is literally out of gas.

I've been taking medication but it hasn't helped at all. It's just passed everyone even further away from me.

I have over 70k in student loans which I am supposed to be paying off. But I can't do that and even if I had a job it wouldn't be enough money to cover it.

I can't do anything. 

I am so fed up with this life. The only reason to live is so I don't make my parents sad. People call that selfish but why the fuck should I be made to go through this? 

I have no doubt that I am just an unineretsting, unattractive, and all around unlikable person. 

Might as well do the world a favor and just quit before the next shit storm comes and leaves me living in a cardboard box.
