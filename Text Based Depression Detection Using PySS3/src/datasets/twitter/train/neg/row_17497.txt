It's unrelenting, and I can't do it anymore.I've thought of suicide daily for about 14 years now.

I am grindingly poor. I have no future. I'm worthless. I will never get a decent job.

My partner doesn't seem to even like me anymore, let alone love me. My dog doesn't even seem to like me much.

I hate my major, and am too stupid for college. 

I don't remeber the last time I enjoyed anything.

I don't remember the last time I didn't want to kill myself. 

I'm not going to my parent's for the holidays, because I think if I do I'll take my dad's sawed-off and put it in my mouth. Last time I was there, it was like a physical compulsion that I barely resisted.

My self harm, which I was clean of for four years, is back worse than ever. No one knows I do it. My legs are slashed to pieces.

I've been medicated. I've been to therapy. Medication did not help. I lie to therapists, I do not trust them. I don't trust anyone.

I thought about checking into the hospital, the acute crises center, getting help. I can't afford it. I can't afford to not kill myself. I am worthless.
