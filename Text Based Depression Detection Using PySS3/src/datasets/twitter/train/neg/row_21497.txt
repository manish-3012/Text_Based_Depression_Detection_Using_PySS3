Do we even feel anymore?I feel like internet made us so numb that we miss so much of the life joy and lose it,we are becoming meaner,ignorant and bad because of it,I think the advantages are far too less for what its doing to us..not to mention that we are so divided we barely still care for each other,isntead of finding joy in life we find the hate and darkness.
