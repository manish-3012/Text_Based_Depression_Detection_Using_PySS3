Generic SW titleSpent four months over Christmas/New year in hospital because I was found on a bridge having taken an overdose with a bottle of wine. Now I'm sitting in my car on the same bridge and I feel in a lower place than ever. 

I'm now maxed on all my medication dosages apart from one, and I sort of feel okay for a bit and then drop to where I am now. The closest I've ever came to following through with ending it was probably on the London underground where I tried to pick up the courage to step out onto the track. I was so close the train rubbed my head and feet as it came into the station. After that it was probably being on a bridge and letting go and falling forward but freaking out at the last second.

 I'm diagnosed with BPD and type two bipolar. I'd say I'm on the middle of the scale in terms of how bad my life has been, I've met people who have had just horrendous lives who are in the same boat as me now as well as people who (I do feel bad saying this) have had easier lives. We all take things differently. 

I don't have any PRN because I overdosed on all of it yesterday (I've taken loads in the past. 16 packs of paracetamol was my most painful one. The antidote for that makes you feel worse than the actual overdose).

I'm just rambling now so I'll stop and wait for it to get a bit more dark and then move my car over the motorway and see how far I can get today.
