Whenever I think about my life...I come here and write about how I feel and how I'd rather be dead most of the time. Instead of planning out how I'd kill myself I come here and write about things, it helps me alot, to just talk and believe I'm heard even if I'm not, it helps. I'm afraid of killing myself, but I'm more afraid of life much of the time. For most of the last 3 years I've been feeling as though I'd rather be dead. I'm afraid of loneliness and failure. I just don't feel the feel the same hope and excitement for life that I once did. I'm just having a difficult time deciding whether I want to do this anymore.
