things are a little better than they were yesterdayi took some pills i definitely wasnâ€™t supposed to (not in any excess amount or anything, safely) 

but today iâ€™m feeling pretty okay. i mean the confidence has dropped a bit but i know how to get my confidence back. iâ€™m just glad iâ€™m feeling a little bit more excitedness even if it wasnâ€™t a completely safe or long run option.
