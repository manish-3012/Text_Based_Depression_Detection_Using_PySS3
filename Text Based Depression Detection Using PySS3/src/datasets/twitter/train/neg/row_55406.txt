Each time i get closerI just cut myself. I spilled beer on the bed and felt bad and that's why I cut. I hate myself. I hate my fucking worthless self.

I'm drinking. I'm going to take pills tonight. It will probably put me to sleep but I will not count the pills.

I put hydrogen peroxide on in the room with my boyfriend. He either didnt notice or didnt care. Either way I am assured no one will miss me.

edit: if someone would talk to me i would appreciate it. Nobody here in the real world cares

edit: nothing helped. my bf pretended to say sorry but he did not mean it. he id not sorry and does now care if he hurts me he will continue to hurt me. i am going to kill myself so that i will not be hurt again
