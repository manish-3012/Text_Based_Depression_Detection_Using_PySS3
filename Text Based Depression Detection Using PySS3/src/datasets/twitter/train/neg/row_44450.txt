I'm done.Fucking everyone treats me like shit. Parents cut my computer cord. Guitar broke and taken. Brother texts me about hating me. I'm 18 years old and get treated like a baby. Can never be left alone. Doors "must" be open in my house. Never have privacy. My girlfriend gets mad at me over the drop of a hate. It's not even a matter of "if" anymore, it's a matter of when I'm going to kill myself.
