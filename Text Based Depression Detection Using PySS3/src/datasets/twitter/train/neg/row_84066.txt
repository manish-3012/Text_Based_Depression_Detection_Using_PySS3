I think I want to hurt myself because it helps me focus and stay grounded (please ignore)I've only ever done it once, and it was more of an attention thing because I wanted someone to listen to me I think. But now I want to do it again, and I think it's because if I can bring myself back to reality then I can focus on what I need to get done while reminding myself what exactly I am. I don't want anyone I know to know about this, which is kind of ironic because I feel fine broadcasting my whining to hundreds of thousands of strangers.

Tl;dr: whiny rich white girl with no real problems wants some scars for no fuckin reason, move on
