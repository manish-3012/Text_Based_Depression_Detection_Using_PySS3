Making preparations is what's stopping me from doing itGod I want to die so badly, I can barely make any plans because its all I can think about for my future. I'm so fucking sick of all this shit, all the pain I'm in, I can't transition because there's only one gender clinic in my country and it hasn't even been open for ages, there's hundreds of people above me on the list and it's not moving. I can't afford anywhere near the amount of money it would cost to transition privately and I can't take living in this body for much longer. My problem is I seriously can't face doing all the preparations I'd want to make before I go, I need to sort through my stuff and get rid of the things I don't want anyone else finding, tidy up, write a will, etc and ironically I'm too depressed to do all that. I wish I could escape this hell.
