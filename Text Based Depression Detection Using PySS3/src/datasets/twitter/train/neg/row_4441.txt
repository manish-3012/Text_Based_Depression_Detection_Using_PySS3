I'm seriously think suicide is the only way to end this pain I experience everyday.I posted the other stuff and this is just something that happened that I need advice on.

Here's the TL;DR from that: Had a life filled with rough times from the get go, coped with it through friends via Skype, accused of plagiarism though I did not do it, had my coping mechanism taken away. Now I am stressed and feeling like shit, which only is getting worse exponentially.

**Update:** So last night, I snuck downstairs, onto my computer, to a) talk to my friends, as they helped me get by, and b) to call a depresson hotline. I talked with my friends, and that cheered me up a little. And then I talked on a depression hotline, to someone who helped convince me that it can't get any worse. This was about 1-3AM last night, where my dad was asleep. I went to sleep last night, feeling much better, and thinking that nothing could get worse.

Boy was I wrong.

My dad forced me awake at 6:15 this morning. He immediately, right off the bat, started yelling at me. He somehow knew that I talked with someone. I don't  know how, but he did. He assumed that it was one of my friends, and started yelling at me. He also threatened to hit me and to throw me out of the house. All for trying to deal with all my stress and not go insane.

I'm coming to believe that I can't get out of this pain without suicide. I can't trust my parents, who run the house like it's a jail, perhaps even worse.
