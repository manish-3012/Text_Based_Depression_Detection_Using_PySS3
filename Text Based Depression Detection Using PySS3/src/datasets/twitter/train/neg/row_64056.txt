Can't handle it anymore.. I hope this doesn't get buried in new posts.I'm teetering right on the edge. I have made some terrible, major mistakes in my life that I have to live with, but I can't. I have ruined people's lives with my stupidity and fear. I hate the person I am and I feel very lost and alone. The hole that I'm stuck in just gets bigger and bigger every day and I can't find a way out. Every time I think I hit bottom, something comes along to help me dig even further. I have a gun and am really contemplating on using it.. it's a thought I've been going back and fourth on for almost 6 months now. I don't know if this is a cry for help, or if I just want to tell somebody because I don't really have someone to talk about this with. I've tried to talk about it with family before, and I just got smothered with questions and them trying to force help. It just made everything worse. I want a reason to live, but I can't find one anymore. I know I'm just being selfish thinking this way.. but the people that this would affect have no idea what I'm feeling and going through right now.
