I'm losing control with my emotions :(I don't know what to do anymore I'm super depressed. I've always been the silent guy in school always being runned over or token advantage of because of my kindness to people. I never had friends to care for me :(. I would kill myself but my family would be hurt in the process. There was this one Girl a higher grade than me who felt empathy for me for being the outcast in school. She would always talk to me, and something I wanted for years a friendship that felt real not being used :). She would ask personal questions of why I was quiet she asked if I was bullied I answered her with a yes. She gave me that sad look of grieve I felted like someone actually cared about me :(. She told me a sad personal story of hers of being bullied. I felt a connection but time has passed now because my severe anxiety ruined my chance to be friends with her I felt like she was special to me I loved her I regret of not making a move. I want to be strong I'm so weak please help :( . I went to therapy it's not helping I'm on antidepressants. Everytime I look at a human and we make eye contact I feel so depressed I'm so lonely :(.
