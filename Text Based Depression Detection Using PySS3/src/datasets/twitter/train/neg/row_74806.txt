I think I'm going to give up...I'm constantly in pain. I cannot take care of myself. I see the stories of how people far worse off than me not getting help...so why should I try?

I'm a burden now more than I have ever been. It would be better for everyone if I died.

No more pain. No more mistakes. No more anything.

I just have to figure out how to do it.
