Time ran out for me to start a life..I am such a failure. I am so incredibly upset I let myself get to this point. I battled alcohol in my 20s. I know the signs, the steps, well versed in addictions.. And yet here I am at 33 and absolutely rock bottom again. Single and very very isolated. I have destroyed whatever relationships I have had through jealousy and infidelity. I absolute hate myself. I can't stop looking at porn every few days (and not nice porn for what it is..) I act like an an absolute douche on Tinder. I try to play it nice, but when the real profile gets no results, and being a cocky f** boy gets results, what the hell is a desperately lonely guy to do? I moved rural and have now officially killed any chance of real life dating. Everyone living here is married and kids. What is healthy sexuality any way? Is an open relationship healthy? Or is it destructive? I just can't take this anymore. I hate being alone. I hate myself. Yet nothing feels right. I can't stand the thought of being alone forever.... I'm just over it. Fuck this world. Fuck everyone. Let this be my last post scattered everywhere.. Let this be a warning to those younger... Some things in life are time sensitive. Putting off this issue for so long has created an insurmountable problem. I can't live like this forever, unfortunately I ran out of time to change..
