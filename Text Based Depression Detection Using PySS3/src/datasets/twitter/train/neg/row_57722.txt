You are all my reason to keep goingIn a world that Iâ€™ve felt has ignrored me, bullied me, abandoned me, I feel some comfort on here, with other people who are struggling through their own issues. 

Growing up before internet, battling anxiety was tough. No body knew what it was called or how to help, and I was always so alone in my demons of family life. I now feel terrified to be alone or to be alone in my pain. Especially when it felt like everyone else was having a fun childhood and a normal existence. 

I feel like you are all my mates in this world. You all help me feel less alone. I am grateful for you and Iâ€™m grateful for the internet. Once upon a time you had nowhere to chat with likeminded people and now we can all come on here and share our stories. X
