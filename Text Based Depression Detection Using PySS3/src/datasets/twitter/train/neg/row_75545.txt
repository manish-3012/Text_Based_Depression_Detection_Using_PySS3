Cant study because I think I wont be here long enough to benefitBasically the title.

I've been given a bunch of school work to do but I have no motivation to do it, mainly because of suicide. Issue is the work is starting to pile up lmao. I just dont understand why I should do the work if I'm not gonna be here.

Anyone get like this?
