I want the pain to stopI'm in so much emotional pain all the time psychosis is destroying me I'm so tired I think about suicide every day I don't have the guts to do it but I wish I did but then I start thinking about how much my funeral would cost my family so little things feel good I don't know what to do the demon and entities that watch over me are so judgmental they scream at me to kill myself I can't do things that make me happy because they don't like it when I'm happy I'm so lost I just don't know what to do they never leave me alone I'm never alone I'm always being watched I want the depression and paranoia to be over and I fear that the only way to make it stop is death I know all this sounds dramatic and stupid but I just feel terrible I'm thinking about suicide I just don't know what to do I just want to stab myself help
