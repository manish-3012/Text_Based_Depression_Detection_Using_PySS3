If I get help under my parent's insurance will my parents be notified?I've wanted to die since high school. I'm about to graduate college and move out on my own, and this will be my first opportunity to seek professional help without my parents finding out. However, I will still be under my parents' health insurance (USA).

If I attempt to get help and have the provider bill my parents' insurance will my parents be notified that I am seeking treatment or otherwise able to find out? Having them find out about my state of mind is a fate I consider worse than death.

Thanks.
