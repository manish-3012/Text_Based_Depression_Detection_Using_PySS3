Hello Dear Reddit People,         

Hello, my name is "John", I hope you don't mind but I'm just going to talk about my problems. For basically all of my life, my peers have called me stupid, or retarded. I used to be extremely religious and homophobic, this year I got a B- on my report card, and I feel like a total failure. I keep losing friends, I used to have so many friends, now I barely have any. My parents got divorced two years ago.

I have a really good memory so I remember everything people say to me, It's really annoying, it makes me really angry. I am always irritable, I used to see a psychologist, but that didn't help. I want to have a husband and children, but that seems like an impossible dream. Every day in school I got beat up. I just want to die. Thank you for your time

Sincerely, "john"
