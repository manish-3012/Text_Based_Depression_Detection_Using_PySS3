giving upI'm at a point where I don't care anymore. I'm in my twenties, and too broke to make it on my own. I can't live at home, because the situation is toxic. I have a job, but rent is greater than my paycheck. No license, no car. Commute to work by bus. I desperately want my own place; I want to be happy and safe. But no matter what, I'll never have it. I'm too stupid to get a "good" job, or one that pays a decent salary. I have a degree, but I'm not skilled; I'm not competent enough. I can't take this.
