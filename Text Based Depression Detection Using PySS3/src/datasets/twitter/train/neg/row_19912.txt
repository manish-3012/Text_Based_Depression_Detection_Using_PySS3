Holding the bottle. Suicide is not selfish.I feel that a lot of the negative connotation towards suicide is those left behind. But they don't understand the suffering. I have a family who loves me, but they don't know or understand how hard each day is for me. Rather, they think I need to snap out of this funk. But it isn't that. I've suffered from deprsesion for years. Unfortunately I recently lost my medical insurance so I can't even receive any help. And when I had insurance I did, and none of it helped. I'm alone, I can't get over a breakup from almost 2 years ago, I can't find any sort of happiness. I lost my job and the wealth I built up, I was successful and was earning a lot of money, had fancy cars, clothes, ect. Now I struggle to figure out where my next meal will come. I realize it is possible to recover from this illness but I think I am in too deep. I just wish there could be more awareness to the survivors that this is the best thing for us, that our suffering is over and we can finally find solace. I've had many failed attempts that I should have never survived based on meds I OD'd on and such. Hopefully tonight that wont be the case.
