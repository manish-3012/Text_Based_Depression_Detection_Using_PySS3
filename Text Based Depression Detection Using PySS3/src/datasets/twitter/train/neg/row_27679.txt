Please help me breathI am just done fighting... Can't bear the pain anymore...

Below is my situation

EMPTY 
EXHAUSTED 
LONELY 
FOGGY BRAIN 
NO PURPOSE  IN LIFE 
GLOOMY 
MELANCHOLIC PAIN 


Don't even have someone to hold tight and cry... 
Emotional support needed... Tried suicide 3 times but failed... 

Emotionally need someone... I NEEDED ACTUALLY SOMEONE SPECIFIC BUT DIDN'T MENTION DUE TO JUDGMENT OF PEOPLE WHO JUST MISUNDERSTANDS EVEN A SUICIDAL PERSON... ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ 

I AM GASPING LITERALLY... PLEASE HELP ME BREATH... ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ 

Been fighting alone since too long
