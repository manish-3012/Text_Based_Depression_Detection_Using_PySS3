Help...I just got told that I have anxiety but I donâ€™t believe I think that they are wrong. It just doesnâ€™t seem to line up with anything I mean what could anxiety be to do with anything how diode anxiety make me feel so physically and mentally weak. I donâ€™t know what to do and itâ€™s not like I told the doctor everything or that I told anyone the entire truth I just think if someone were to find out what I really think then it would be over. I just want to give up? I donâ€™t know why I even think of things like this? I donâ€™t know why I am like this? I just want someone in real life be here for me even if we donâ€™t talk if we are just in the same room I just want someone I can trust to be there for me. I have so many people around me but I still feel so alone and I still canâ€™t find someone I really truely trust. Even when I am around people I act like someone else that isnâ€™t even me just to please them, I donâ€™t why I do this? Please help.
