Does anyone else feel like they are worthless and have 0 talent in anythingToday I got the results for my final exam. 

Iâ€™m currently retaking all my classes from high school while most of my friends have already gone into a university. I was in a math class and put 100% of my effort in to it. I studied insanely hard for it to the point that it was unhealthy. I would wake up in the morning and the first thing I would do is grab my binder and start studying within 5 minutes of being awake. I didnâ€™t talk to friends or family and stayed locked up in my room. I cut down the time I was sleeping so that I would have more time to study. I gained weight and definitely hurt friendships with some friends. During the exam I stayed writing the test for 5 hours so that I could double and triple check my work.

After sacrificing all that do you know what I got? After losing so many hours, friends, and my fucking mind all I got was  a messily 69%. 69%. 69%. 6 fucking 9%.

Itâ€™s actually kind of funny though. Knowing that at 100% all I can achieve is 69%. Whatâ€™s more said is that math is probably the thing Iâ€™m best at. Iâ€™m horrible in other subjects and have zero talent in anything else like sports or art. This is such a cruel and sick world.
