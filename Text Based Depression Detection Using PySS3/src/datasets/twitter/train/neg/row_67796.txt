Why do people try to help?Iâ€™m tired of hearing, â€œWe would miss you, You are loved, it doesnâ€™t make your problems go away, What about your family.â€ People try to help by saying like one sentence to try to talk you out of it but strangers say it and it makes no sense. You know nothing about me. You havenâ€™t been there when my dad screams at me calling me a loser. My family doesnâ€™t care about me. And it would make my problems go away to just be done. Even if one person will â€œmiss meâ€ I donâ€™t want to live to make a single person lives slightly happier when mine is shit.
