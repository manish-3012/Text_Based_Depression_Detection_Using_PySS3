The end is coming...Iâ€™ve known this day was coming since I was 16. Iâ€™m 25 now. I tried to convince myself I was happy, but in the back of my head I always knew this day was inevitable. Iâ€™ve tried so hard. I took medication, I went to therapy, I talked to my mom, but nothing helped. I simply donâ€™t have the strength to fight anymore. Iâ€™ve been fighting for years and now Iâ€™m tired, I just want to rest. I just want to be at peace. The thought of ending it used to terrify me, but now it makes me feel calm. Like I have a way out, And I think itâ€™s time. Depression eats me alive every day. If the depression doesnâ€™t get me then My crippling anxiety surely will. I have friends, but the lonely, empty feeling that I feel every day is too much to bear. Itâ€™s exhausting. I just canâ€™t go on like this...I love you mom
