no one staysunconditional love doesnt exist. people lie. im sick of the "im always here for you" "there's nothing you can do to make me stop loving you" "you're my favorite person" "i'd wait a lifetime for you" bullshit. just fucking be real and fucking tell me "i'll love you until i start to learn the real you and realize you actually make me miserable because you're nothing but a burden"
