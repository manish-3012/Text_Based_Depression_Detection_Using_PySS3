I don't how to tell if my friend is okay or not. Help?My best friend tried to commit suicide last year. Since then she's been doing okay - still depressed, still cuts, still starves herself, but she promised me she wouldn't leave me here and I trusted her.

Last night, while I was asleep, she sent me this message on Facebook:

"813883, I know your asleep right now. But I want you to know I love you and you're my best friend. You mean the world to me and you're always there for me. So thank you."

She wasn't at school today and she won't respond to texts.

I'm freaking out here, Reddit. wat do?
