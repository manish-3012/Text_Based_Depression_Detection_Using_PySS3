i just watched that movie "my suicide" and now i'm throwing up from cryingthis is gonna sound so dumb but that whole movie made me realize i was supposed to die that day. i should've died. i was supposed to die. maybe i didn't take enough, maybe i knew i didn't take enough, maybe i only took the minimum amount to kill myself so that if i failed i had enough to try again with even more.

everything is slow this is the time of year things get really bad for me and this year is no exception, i'm tired, i should've died that day almost two years ago, and i should've tried to die all the times i wanted to between them and today. but i'm here and i'm fuckk angry about it and i'm going to do something about it soon
