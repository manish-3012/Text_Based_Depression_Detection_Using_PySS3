I tried for years, but I just can't anymore.You know, I feel like I persevered through a lot.  I grew up taking care of a severely ill mother while my father worked long hours to take care of medical bills.  We didn't even have the money as a family to keep me fed, and I can count on one hand the number of times I went clothes shopping.  My family was horribly narcissistic, and they wouldn't even let me take advantage of a full college scholarship because they needed me to do housekeeping for the family.  They were super bigoted, and would've disowned me if I came out as transgender, so I never actually came out to them, thus sacrificing my own happiness.  I also sacrificed my grades and a social life for them.  I moved out when I was 20, only to be shunned for being socially awkward.  I was cast aside by a long-term boyfriend for being transgender.  I suffer from bone structure issues in my legs that disallow me from walking properly, which makes it difficult to hold down a job.  This is why I struggled to keep employed in a town where retail is the chief field of employment, and am back living with my bigoted, terrible family, who make me feel like less of a person on a daily basis.  I just want to die.  I can't live with these awful goddamn people anymore, and I am too worthless enough to justify keeping myself alive anymore.  I have resolved myself to the fact that tomorrow night's the night.
