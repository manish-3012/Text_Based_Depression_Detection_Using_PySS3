My account was stolen by my ex and she told you guys i killed myself. Proof in my profileHi it's u/clyrek. My ex, Madison told everyone I killed myself because I broke up with her. How she got my account. I stupidly use the same password for everything but not this account and she knew the password to my Netflix and tried it on my reddit account and voila it worked. She went on here and acted like I was suicidal, which is fucked up because my great grandpa killed his self after he fought in the war. I can't get my account back because she reset the account password but I will try to get the account back.
u/bertrumthegod. I'm back on twitter. Sorry for the panic to the people that really believed I was dead.
