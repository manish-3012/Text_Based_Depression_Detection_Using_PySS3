T minus twoI have given myself a deadline. In two days I will go through the unthinkable which for quite some time has been the only thing I've been able to think about. I've bought the necessary equipment, planned the location, and written a letter to be published online right before I do it on a blog which just a few of my friends know about - and won't check immediately. I feel so relieved now that I've finally planned it all. 

There has to be some part of me which feels some ambivalence, seeing as I'm writing a post about it here. I'm in therapy, and work in mental health myself, but I haven't been able to tell anyone the depth and longevity of this misery. I don't know if my posting here is some sort of plea for a convincing argument to go on, because I've been through them all, but I've felt so alone for so long that I just wanted to communicate something out there into the world. Thank you to anyone who bothered to read this short mess. I hope, whoever you are, that you are doing well, and that if you are here because of the same reason as me, that you will find a convincing reason to go on. I really do. Whoever you are.
