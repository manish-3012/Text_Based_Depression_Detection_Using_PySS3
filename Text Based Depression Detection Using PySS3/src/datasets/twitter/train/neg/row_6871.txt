My friend is depressed, can't stop cutting her self, and is considering suicide  
I have a friend that I met over the summer and for the past month or two, she's been depressed but recently it's gotten to a very extreme point. Where I'm starting to feel kind of hopeless and really worried for her.  
I don't go to her school directly but I've talked to her friend who does and she's gotten her a guidance counselor to help her and her parents now know as well (but they haven't handled it the best from what my friend has told me). I've also recommended that she see a therapist and that she seek professional help but she's so far been extremely unwilling.  
She has also (through text) mentioned committing suicide but treats it jokingly and is kind of acting on the borderline of it. I'm not really sure what to think of it, though I do understand that this is something super serious and I've also mentioned this to her friend.  
I'm really lost as to what to do, I feel like I've tried everything i possibly can do from where I am but I know that I have to find a way to do more in order to help her out.
