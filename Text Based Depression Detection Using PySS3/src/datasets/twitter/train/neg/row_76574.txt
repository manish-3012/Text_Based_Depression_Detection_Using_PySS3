Reasons to stay alive - personal collectionSince I am feeling better at the moment, I will use the momentum and collect all the things I enjoy and could deter me from commiting suicide:

- Listening to Rachmaninovs 2nd piano concerto
- Watching dancing with the stars with my mum
- Watching House MD with my mum
- Play with my niece and nephew
- Play Zelda Breath of the Wild
- Kiss a woman /  Have sex

I will use this as a log and happily accept any suggestions.
