I won't take my life.I won't take my life.  


As much as I want to go, I can't.   
I admit... suicide could be seen as taboo. The guilt, and burden of self kill and the impact of others around us.  


I've felt this way for years, and it only seems to get worse with time. I won't take my life, but I'm ready. I'm weak yet strong. I have resolve. It may be awful having to "live" in this world, but it would be more awful if we ended it.  


So- I've given a lot of thought to this... the best way to die, without being held responsible, or carrying the burden.  
Not ending my life, but it just ending on it's own.  


Suicide is an action. A verb, or something that is done.  But what if don't do anything? What is the crime? Nothing.  


This body that I hate, the body that i'm in. It needs food to survive, not me.   


So... I'm done with it.   


3 months. That's how long it will take.   


If I start by January 7th, I should be dead by the end of march.  


There is only 1 reason why i'm alive right now. Family.  
So i'll be spending the rest of the year with them. Eating my favorite things for the last time.   


I'll drink water. Dehydration is painful and no fun. I'm sure that I don't have the willpower to deny water while being it's presence. Not eating is far easier. It's just an extended fast. I've dealt with eating and body image disorders anyway.  


So for now. I'm here, and I'll see you in a month.

The nice thing about this is, it isn't impulsive. It's not just a quick minute decision. In order to go through with this, a person has to have resolve, and if it goes how i'm expecting, there will be no regrets.   


The thought of dying with the earth during winter, but not revitalizing during spring is very fitting.
