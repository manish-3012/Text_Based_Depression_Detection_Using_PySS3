Uh oh.OK. Drunk again. Shit. Whyyyy???

I need to drink to feel nothing but I almost attempted again. The only thing that had stopped me is the thought that my kids are home and I can't do that to them. I want to fucking die...but I am having a hard time connecting with any feelings. I am still numb...mostly.

I need another beer. I think I will just drink myself unconscious now.

Sorry to be a bother and I know what you will say.

Please save your advice and love for someone deserving and who is willing to listen...I am too far gone.

Please give someone else some love. :)

That is my wish right now.
