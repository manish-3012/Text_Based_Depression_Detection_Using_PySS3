I'm still contemplating. And suicide is looking like a great answer.I've been contemplating committing suicide for years now for many different reasons, and I think I may soon.

I just quit my job recently so i wont be having income, unless one of the other employers I applied to hire me (which I doubt). I'll be getting my final check soon which I can use to buy a gun. 

I dont want to grow old, I dont want to watch my mother get old and inevitably die. Life is just... horrible, for lack of better words. 

I'm scum. If It were up to me I'd sit inside all day, eat and gain even more weight and play video games. But we live in a society that we have to slave away our lives for currency in order to have a place to live, buy food/beverages. 

If you tell me that you enjoy life, I will never truly believe you. How the fuck can anyone enjoy being alive. Theres nothing I've experienced that made me happy about being here. It feels like I'm forced to keep going because If I dont then I'm a disappointment to everyone. 

I cant even act like myself because of our society being hateful towards anything other than social norms, and just because of crippling anxiety/depression. Everyone judges eachother and if you say you dont you are a liar. 

Fuck this world

I dont know what happens when you die but I hope once the trigger is pulled I wont have a consciousness.
