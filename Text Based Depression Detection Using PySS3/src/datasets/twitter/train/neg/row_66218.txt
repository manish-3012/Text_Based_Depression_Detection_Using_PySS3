Dealing with the policeI can't talk about this to my former friends (Who I no longer speak with because I don't want them to feel like they could have done something) so I guess I'm dumping it all here.

&amp;#x200B;

Every night this past week, with one exception (Thursday night), I went out driving around looking for a place to Long Drop that's the perfect distance from a hospital for every vital organ except my brain to be saved.  Long Dropping is a method of hanging where you fall so far that the rope snaps your neck, rendering it almost completely painless; but not far enough that your head decapitates.  It's the method of hanging that was used for official executions in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Unfortunately for normal people without special apparatus it can be logistically tricky setting it all up right.  I'm pretty tall and I need an unimpeded vertical space of 14 feet within which I can drop.  What's more, I want to make sure the ambulance arrives on the scene RIGHT as the 6 minute mark passes (the point of brain death).  This way my organs have the best chance of being harvested for other people's use.  [https://www.cicm.org.au/CICM\_Media/CICMSite/CICM-Website/Resources/Publications/CCR%20Journal/Previous%20Editions/March%202016/ccr\_18\_1\_010316-37.pdf](https://www.cicm.org.au/CICM_Media/CICMSite/CICM-Website/Resources/Publications/CCR%20Journal/Previous%20Editions/March%202016/ccr_18_1_010316-37.pdf) estimates 30.6 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) saved over doing it in my apartment (which has such a drop).  That's a big deal to me.  I don't want to live, but there are plenty of mentally healthy individuals undergoing critical surgery, who are loved and needed by their families, friends, spouses, children, communities, employers, all of whom desperately want them in their lives - and who themselves wish to continue living.  If I have perfectly functioning organs untinged by drug abuse or medical issues, why shouldn't I give them that opportunity???  I want them to have the freedom to continue their fulfilling lives as greatly as I desire the freedom to end mine.

&amp;#x200B;

So around I went through the southern neighbourhoods (Colonias) of my city, in the dead of night, keeping an eye out for any stiff horizontal beams onto which I might tie my knot.  Not to do it there and then, mind you; my baby sister is still in undergrad exam period, and I still need to visit the States one more time to probate-proof.  I was just in the research phase.  I soon realized that the climb itself was a major consideration, and that while I could have a ladder shipped out to anywhere, it'd be much easier and less suspicious to drive up and scale it on the spot.   Isolation and the correct distance from hospitals were also key.  This effectively whittled my options down to an abandoned water tower in Miramar just south of where the main city starts, and the various unguarded transmission towers even further south.  (All the towers in the main city are cordoned off from access, but the newer and poorer districts haven't had that luxury.)

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday or Wednesday I bought some measuring tape and on Friday night I bought a rope from Home Depot - again, just to see where it hangs.  On Friday in the Colonia Arcoiris I find the PERFECT string of towers, way in the outskirts of town and absolutely enormous, their legs lifting them a full 30 feet off the earth.  What's more, they're on a dirt road specially made for transmission tower access - there's NOTHING there, just towers and weeds.  Most of the other towers here, I have to watch out for passersby, cops, cameras, not to mention how hard it was to get a clean drop with zero obstruction from lower beams.  But the Arcoiris towers have joints with nothing under them but bush and bramble, anywhere from 10 to 30 feet.  I find the leg with maintenance footholds and hoist myself up to the first beam that I deem high enough, where when they cut the rope, my body would still fall a good 8 feet into the bramble.  I love climbing and heights and it's exhilarating being up there.  I think about my secretly suicidal middle sister (who doesn't know that I know, I snuck through her high school diary one day) who's taken up rock climbing as an adult.  I know exactly how she feels and what she's been plotting all these years.  The first thing I think is how tight would it be to climb the whole damn tower, see the entire city from 200 feet above.  The second thing I think is Damn I wish I had her skills.  I wonder if she failed once and took up rock climbing so she would know exactly how to do it the second time.  Then I wonder if rock climbing gave her a reason to live.  Being able to climb that whole tower might give me that reason, although I'd probably get thrown in jail or deported.

&amp;#x200B;

Reality set in.  I had work to do.  Trembling, I tied the rope to a beam at 17 feet.  I knew if I fell that night I would wind up in a hospital and be asked a million questions not to mention my plan would physically be fucked for months.  Carefully I clambered back down.  My fall would be clear, alright; I just needed to trim the tops off some bramble.  This was simply the perfect place to do it.  At last after nights of scoping the ghettos, I had found my spot.  I couldn't help but keep admiring how perfect this tower was.  At last.  It was just perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I heard a truck roar past.  I'd parked on the side of the dirt road.  That's funny, I thought, obviously that's not a utility worker.  I remembered there being some abandoned looking signs and fences further down the road.  Maybe they weren't so abandoned after all.  Then I heard the truck roar back.  Stop around my car.  I saw lights.  Blue and red ones.

&amp;#x200B;

This wasn't good.

&amp;#x200B;

You really don't want to mess with the police in Mexico.  Actual criminals, at least the ones I've encountered or heard of, don't care about civilians.  It's not Brazil and they have bigger fish to fry than kidnapping gringos.  But the cops, you have no idea what they'll be up to, who they know, or what they want on any given night.  Every single interaction I've had with them has been them stopping me for no reason, questioning what I'm doing, searching my pockets, or trying to rob me.  I'm out here all by myself in the prairie with the Estatales.  Do I have my Bitcoins with me?  I'm pretty sure I left my flash drive at home, it has all the real goods.  My laptop's still here.  In any case, this is bad.

&amp;#x200B;

'Hola, que pasa?' I shouted.

&amp;#x200B;

'Que pasa contigo?'  What's up with you? one of them asked.  He was younger than me and slightly built.  His partner was older, gruff and thick-set.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just walking around, exploring, I said in my best attempt at casual Spanish.  They tell me to put my hands on the car and separate my legs.  Holy shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I do so.  They pat me down and proceed to ask me whether I have drugs or am drinking.  Whether I'm there with anyone.  I assure them I'm alright and I'm just out, touring around like a dumb tourist.  No particular destination.  I live in Centro and I work online doing computer stuff.  Here are my IDs.  You want to search the car?  Be my guest.

&amp;#x200B;

The younger guy starts talking to me, as the older guy walks off to the tower with a flashlight.  We're here to help you and protect you, because at this time of night, there are some bad people around, and we want to make sure you're not in trouble.  I'm not, I say, I'm doing just fine.  I just like walking around seeing what's out here.  Facially, I'm cool as a cucumber; mentally I'm scrambling to figure out how to explain the rope still tied at 17 feet to his partner when he returns.  I know the truth will get me 5150'd immediately, possibly deported.  Don't these guys have drug dealers to catch? I think to myself.

&amp;#x200B;

To my surprise, they let me go without further questioning.  'I strongly advise you to go back home,' the young guy says.  I nod, pretending to pretend to understand.  What's your name? I ask.  Brayan, he says.  Have a safe night, Brayan.  They drive off.

&amp;#x200B;

Whew.  That could have ended a lot worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I return to the tower and resume thinking.  I'll need to practice tying that knot.  I'd be better off buying a bike lock with the rope pre-attached and draped around my neck, so I can just clip it on.  That way I can try out the strength of all materials at home.  I have plenty of space.  My biggest fear, bar none, was fucking up.  Being a cripple for decades, prevented by well-wishers from ever doing it again, being forced to lie in bed or drink through a tube.  That could not happen and would not happen.  I could always decap from a pedestrian overbridge I knew downtown.  But it would be so ugly for my parents.  Not to mention the first responders.  No, I had to do what I could to drop hang.  And that meant dealing with my fear of falling and retrieving that rope so I could measure out its length from the knot point.

&amp;#x200B;

Just as I was about to climb back on, I heard someone pull up slowly behind my vehicle.

&amp;#x200B;

I quietly strode back to my car.  The real bad guys this time?

&amp;#x200B;

It was the same cop, now with all lights off.  I stretched out my arms.  What? I demanded.  You know it's kind of weird, you guys coming back here like this?

&amp;#x200B;

No, the weird one is you, the young cop said in English.  You're the one being weird.

&amp;#x200B;

I just think I left something back there, that's all.  Something fell out of my pocket... My measuring tape.  I tried looking around in my car but I couldn't find it.  

&amp;#x200B;

The young guy said he'd go with me.  Erm, what kind of gun is that you got?  An M-4 (assault rifle), he said.  You know I don't have a lot of money on me, I said.  Don't worry, he said, we're here to help you.  We're here to make sure you're alright.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my tape measure, on a rock, a few feet from my rope, and swiftly turn around before he could ask any awkward questions.  I immediately get in my car and say, Thanks for your help, Brayan.  Have a good night.  Ignoring the troubled expression on his face, I drive off ahead of them, happy to be alive.  But only so I can tidy up my estate and bequeath my Bitcoins so I can come back and kill myself in a week.  Of course.  But happy to be alive nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

When I get home after 20 minutes, I notice there's a truck driving very, very slowly, several blocks behind me.  I turn around to stare at it.  Presently it approaches where I'm standing.  It's a police truck.  It speeds up as it passes me, but I distinctly see Brayan and his partner through the windows.

&amp;#x200B;

It dawned on me that even the scumbag Mexican state police was for some reason fundamentally and sincerely invested in preventing my death.  Had I explained that it would save hundreds of lives in Africa - not to mention ameliorate the exploitation of thousands of their own Mexican countrymen in the fields and factories - they would still have 5150'd me.  Had I explained that the only thing they were doing is forcing me to decap, or even worse, ruining the postmortem donation value of my organs, they would STILL have 5150'd me.  I'm 100% sure of this.  Sure, it's called doing your job.  Sure, it's called a protocol.  But somebody high up in the ranks of the police force decided to include my life in that protocol.  Decided that I should not die so that others may live.  Decided that the proximity of my death to that community gave it more weight than the deaths of labourers and farmers in Mexico and Africa.  Decided that my organs are worth more together than apart.  All without knowing me and everything that's wrong with my evil soul.

&amp;#x200B;

No matter its consequences, the thing I intend to do is detestable and absolutely unacceptable to society; everybody is going to do everything they can to oppose it.  What Brayan represented was the implicit rejection of my desires by Western society.  I saw through his words and actions that no one will ever trust anything I say, regardless of how jovial or relaxed my mood appears to be.  In fact there is an invisible barrier of distrust separating me from every other reasoning functioning human being on earth which no amount of logic or ethics will ever break down, no matter how indisputable and obvious it becomes that the world will be a better place if I'm dead.  I've tried to hire people to help me, to no avail.  I met a couple, boyfriend and girlfriend, who both claimed they supported voluntary euthanasia, the right to leave this life with dignity and choice.  But when it came to a specific person, me, they could not even be paid to help.  It's like I've become a place where logic itself frays.

&amp;#x200B;

I truly don't understand it.
