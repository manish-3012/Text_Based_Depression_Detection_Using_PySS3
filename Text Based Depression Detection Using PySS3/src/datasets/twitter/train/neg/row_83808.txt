My suicide note, should i decide to end my lifeHello, my friends,

I want to first start this off by saying that iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry for the pain this will cause, and I am sorry for breaking any promises that i have made, and iâ€™m sorry for letting some of you down. It couldnâ€™t be helped.

I donâ€™t want any of you for a second to feel like any of this could be your fault. this was my personal battle to lose, and at the end of the day it rests on none of your shoulders. You all were the best and nicest people i could meet in my life. i am so so so grateful for all of you. None of you played into my decision to end my life.
 
In the moments before my departure, I would 
again like to give my apologies, as the last I would want to do is to hurt you, but I do truly feel that this decision will be the better one in the long run., as i hurt too much in a world not meant for me. thanks to those who made my life as amazing as possible. 

Thank you.
