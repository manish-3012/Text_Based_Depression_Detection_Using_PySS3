My aunt tried to kill herself today - please adviseHi SW. My aunt tried to kill herself today. I've read that people who try to kill themselves just want someone to listen to. My aunt is in a relationship in which she wouldn't often be listened to, and so I thought she fit this profile. I spoke to her today and it seems that she has nothing to say to anyone. She kept saying "I'm fine". I'm very scared she'll try it again. I tried to tell her I love her and would listen to her if she ever needed someone to speak to, but I felt as though I couldn't get through to her. Does she genuinely not want to talk about her problems? What can be said to stop her from trying this again?

Thanks guys.

Edit: She's always been there for us and our problems and appears not to want to burden us with hers.
