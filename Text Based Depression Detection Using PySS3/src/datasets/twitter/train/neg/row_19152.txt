Why is everything so exhaustingI've been feeling so exhausted for so long and I don't know what to do. Things like getting up in the morning and having a chat with a friend use to be so easy but now I find it so hard to even force a laugh and carry on a conversation. Mentally I'm so drained, have been for a few years, I don't feel any emotions as well. My friend told me about her grandparents and how they were about to pass away and I just sat there not saying or feeling anything. Is that a bad thing?
