they don't deserve deathin November of last year, and even the year before that, I have witnessed and heard the shallow last breaths from my two month old kittens. it's not much as compared to other people's sorrows and I am in no way demeaning others, I should never. but my kittens are the only thing which gets me going. 

for now though, two of my new two month old kittens, are feeling sick and I'm pretty sure there's nothing else I can do to stop it from happening. 

what have they done to deserve death at such an early age? why can't they deserve to grow up? 

anyway, if they die, I'm going. I can't take another death, another loss, another sound of their painful cries, another dreadful night, another burial, another chance. 

TL;DR: I am destined to lose everything that matters to me. I thought I can save them. but I can't even save myself, how do I expect myself to be helpful to the world?
