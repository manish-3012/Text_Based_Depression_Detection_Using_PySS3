The OceanItâ€™s hopeless. Iâ€™m going to the ocean tonight. Iâ€™m seriously considering drowning myself. I could jump off the rocks and make it look like an accident. They probably wouldnâ€™t find me for like a day. Iâ€™d like to think maybe somebody aside from my family would miss me, but Iâ€™ve come to realize I canâ€™t count on anybody.
