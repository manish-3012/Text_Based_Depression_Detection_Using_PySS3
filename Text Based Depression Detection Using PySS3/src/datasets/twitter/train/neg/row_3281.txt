Mentally ShatteredWhen your only thoughts daily are hanging yourself or kidnapping ex and inflicting excessive amounts of pain upon her..

My life wasn't anything special before her but at least I went day by day gaming and enjoying my self somewhat. Now though? I don't even want to sleep because I see that disgusting, sociopathic cunt in my dreams, here and there. I've OD'd twice and cut when it gets too hard. Not to kill myself but just to release everything bottled up. Tried talking to people but unless you're female then no one gives a fuck and they don't take you seriously unless you call them mid hanging. It's only a matter of time before I can find somewhere to hang myself. I think the only reason I haven't is because yet is because there's nowhere to do it sufficiently in my flat. I used to go out quite a bit but spiralled out of control with alcohol and because of that I'm now a house hermit and if all that wasn't bad enough, I've got to deal with the fact I have Aspergers which sucks and size matters ^^ if you know what I mean. So yeah.. I don't matter. Prefer not to talk about things like this as I think it's pathetic to create drama and be a burden on my family.
