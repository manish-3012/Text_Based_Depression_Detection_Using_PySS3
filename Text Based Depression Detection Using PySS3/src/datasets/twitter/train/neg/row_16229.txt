I dont knowI want to preface this post with the fact that I'm not looking for anyone to encourage me or to sympathise with me I simply have nowhere to vent. So this morning I planned my suicide, I would take my step dads gun shoot myself in the head and by the time anyone would find my body it would be too late. I even planned a good time when I new our neighbors wouldn't be home. But I'm not going to kill myself today, not because I care about how my death would affect anyone, not because I was too afraid to pull the trigger but because I can't find the gun. To be honest if I found the gun I wouldn't be posting this.

I don't think that I'm sad and I'm not suicidal I just got annoyed with ya know being alive. I cant even tell how I'm feeling while typing this. I cant tell if I even feel anything. I'm not trying to be dramatic I can just tell that my emotions aren't here. When I should be happy I don't know if I'm happy when I should be sad I can't tell if I'm sad. I dont know anymore.
