RuinedTodayâ€™s my last final at school and I didnâ€™t have the motivation to study for it. I feel like a failure that doesnâ€™t know how to do anything and doesnâ€™t deserve to live. Todayâ€™s also the day where I get sexually harassed on the bus and on my way home. I was the dumbass who even let the guy think I was interested and now he wonâ€™t leave me alone. We did exchange numbers because he seemed okay at first. I live in a quiet city so thereâ€™s barely no one around when Iâ€™m walking home. This is when he touches me inappropriately and forces me to kiss him. I feel so worthless that sometimes I just let it happen even though Im thinking stop. Iâ€™m particularly scared this day because he said he now has a car. Iâ€™m too afraid to call him out and tell him to leave me alone. You never know what someoneâ€™s capable of but at the same time, I donâ€™t really care. The only reason I donâ€™t want to go yet is my dog. She relies on me for so much that I couldnâ€™t just leave her. This whole thing just makes me so scared of myself and what I could do. I donâ€™t consider myself high risk at the moment and donâ€™t want others to waste their time on me. I just feel like I need to vent and hope that will help.
