Everyone else I knew got married, had children, bought a house, got a job. They have a life. And I'm just here wanting to die, as the world passes me by.I will never marry.
I will never have kids.
I will never buy a house.
I will never get another job.

I will never be anything, do anything or feel anything.

The only certainty in my life is this: Someday, I will die. I just don't know how yet. I don't know if it will be from an illness, an accident or by my own hands.
