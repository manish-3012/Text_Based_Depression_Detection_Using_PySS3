There's literally nothing I want to do more than kill myselfBut I can't. My family loves me, my friends love me. Fuck I even have a fucking dog who loves me. 

But I still don't want to be alive. I'm a 15 year old girl that has excessive body hair (and probably has PCOS), and I just can't fucking take it anymore. I'm so sick of the way i look. I'm so tired of being abnormal and disgusting. 

But my friends don't know. They know I had to go to the doctors to get hormones checked for the hair (which didn't help with anything), but they don't know how bad it is. They don't know that it's worse than every guy I've ever met, they don't know that I'm developing chest hair and stomach hair. I hide everything. I only wear hoodies and jeans. I never wear anything I like because of the hair. If they ever find out about how hairy I am, they wouldn't want to be friends with me anymore. 

My family knows about the hair, but they insist I'm fine. My mother insists that there's nothing wrong with me. It's like she doesn't have eyes. Can't she fucking see that my leg hair is worse than my own brother's? Or worse than my father's?

If it weren't for my friends and family I'd take my father's gun and shoot myself. Killing myself would be the smart thing to do, it's not like things will get any better for me. I'm never gonna find a guy that's attracted to me, I'll lose all my friend and I'll lose my family. What the fuck is the point? I should just do it and get it over with.
