Iâ€™ve recently turned 18.The big one eight. Doesnâ€™t seem like much has changed honestly. In 2019, on February 12th, I attempted suicide by OD on Prozac. Didnâ€™t do much damage, just a terrible headache. Ended up with me in a long term residential treatment center for 7 months or so. Came home, had some struggles still. If Iâ€™m completely honest, I just got bored at the facility so I faked my wellness so I could be discharged. Now, about 5 months later or so, itâ€™s around the time same time I attempted last year. No, itâ€™s not because Iâ€™m alone and blah blah. Iâ€™ve been suicidal lately. Who am I kidding, Iâ€™m always suicidal. Just more than usual.

I want to OD on my Zoloft. I take 200mg, I got a refill so now I have about 30 pills. Thatâ€™s about 6,000mg. Surely thatâ€™ll do some damage, yeah?
Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s stopping me:
What if I survive the overdose, but suffer severe consequences because of it? Not the whole, having to go back to a psych ward and such, Iâ€™m talking medically. What if I fuck up an organ and I have to live with that for the rest of my life??
If Iâ€™m honest Iâ€™d go for a gun and just go that route, but I donâ€™t want my parents to come into my room and see my brain splattered on the wall. Especially my mom.
I want to die â€œpeacefullyâ€
But of course theres no way of that, especially if youâ€™re young and healthy and just wonna kill yourself lol. 

Idk, Iâ€™m just ranting on here since I have no idea what to do. No, Iâ€™m not gonna call someone and tell them Iâ€™m suicidal. The last thing I need is for police to knock on my door and worry my parents.

And what sucks even more, is that my parents have lost a child already. A year old baby. My brother. He passed due to rare medical conditions that doctors couldnâ€™t diagnose at the time. Really, the doctors didnâ€™t know wtf to do. My dad still has a hard time with it to this day. Heâ€™s a military dad. Heâ€™s seen some shit. I donâ€™t want to make my death worsen his life.

Yes, I know this is selfish. But then again I think itâ€™s the most selfless thing I can do? Idk. Itâ€™s very contradicting. 

Idk why Iâ€™m here. Like, on reddit, bitching and boohooing about my life. Itâ€™s not even that bad. Iâ€™m not in poverty, Iâ€™m not abused. If anything Iâ€™m just sounding ungrateful lmao.
