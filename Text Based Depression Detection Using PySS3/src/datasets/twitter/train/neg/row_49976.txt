I'm so scared. It's a cycle.I just want to spend a second not hating myself for hating myself and not hating myself for reaching out and not hating myself for not reaching out. I push away all the people who make my mind still and hate myself for it because it isn't fair to give them that level of responsibility. Please help. I'm so scared of myself. I just want everything to stop.
