What's the pointWhen will I be enough for anyone? I never thought of myself as a weak person but I'm tired of being the strong one, the responsible one, the faithful one, the dependable one. I want someone to worry about me, take care of me. I want someone to hold me and tell me I'm worthy and that it's going to ok. I want someone to appreciate me and fight for me. I'm tired. So tired. I'm not sure how much longer I can pretend  that everything is ok.
