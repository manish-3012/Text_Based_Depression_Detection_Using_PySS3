I donâ€™t give my life any value.I donâ€™t give life any value and I donâ€™t know why. If anyone died in my life right now I wouldnâ€™t care. I feel like I am a background character in my own story and I canâ€™t deal with it anymore. I told some of my friends about my suicidal mental state and they all blew it off not taking me seriously. I just developed a personality of not caring about anything. I donâ€™t wanna live if I live an emotionless life.
