Suicidal with no reason toHi r/SuicideWatch,  


I'm a high school senior and lately I've been having feelings of wanting to kill myself.   


This would all make sense to me if something was wrong or if there was a reason for me to but I can not find a reason to justify this desire at all. I have a loving family, girlfriend and friends, I'm going to a great college next year, I have a job, a car, a lot of money, I play volleyball and do martial arts, I play the piano... There's nothing in my life that's making me want to kill myself but yet, it's like a constant tiny nagging thought in the back of my head, realistically. 

I don't know why I want to. Maybe it's a fascination? An intrigue?   


I'd understand if I could find a reason to because that'd make some sense but as of right now, I just want to kill myself and I have no real reason to.   


I don't suffer from any mental illness and I highly doubt I have shizophrenia as no one in my family suffers from it and I definitely don't hear voices in my head. I'm not depressed, I'm highly driven, I love going out and talking to people, the whole 9 yards.  


If anyone can help me, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you.
