dating is making me suicidal (seriously)I know this sounds stupid, and I recognize that it is but I still experience these feelings. I am a 27 year old woman and have never dated (ever). I'm painfully shy and just have a difficult time with it all. I have two friends (both are married) and they tend to always remind me I'm "running out of time" to get married because I'm getting old. They tried to set me up once in the past and it didn't go well because the dude wasn't my type (I guess I people with more nerdy hobbies and this dude was a real "bro" who was a bit rude). I have tried online dating but it is all vulgar messages (which I think some has to be bots) and not like, actual messages. I hate being so broken, I wish I could talk with people in the real world because I do want to have a romantic life and feel like an impossible loser. I feel like any man I try to connect with now will immediately write me off as a fucking weirdo because I've never dated or had sex (and I wouldn't blame them). I cannot turn this ship around.
