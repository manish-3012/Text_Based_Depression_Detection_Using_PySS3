Can't kill myself yet because of my catsI think about killing myself every hour and I know my parents would take care of them but I'm scared they will never get the love and affection that I give them from anyone else.

I'm not the world's best owner. I try to be but it's hard being so fucking depressed. Sometimes I kick myself for not cleaning the cat box when I should have. But still. I can't kill myself until I know they'll be loved like they are now.
