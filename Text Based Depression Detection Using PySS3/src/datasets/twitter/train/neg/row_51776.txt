Staring at my wristI'm pretty dizzy and just laying in bed after a FIFA night with my friends thinking how easy it would be to make a cut on my left wrist and fall asleep. I'm actually crying and I don't know why. I'm alone, but there are people who care about me so I kind of hate myself for having these selfish thoughts. I hate myself, but I love many things about the world we live in, I love artists, I love my friends, I love good people, I love athletes and I love the people in this sub, but I hate myself for beeing just a waste, if another sperm cell would have made it, he or she could have made this world a better place, but I'm just me, having the consciousness to make a difference, but beeing too much of a failure to do so.   
   
I really wish we had a plug we can take out whenever we feel like we've had enough. Looking back, I would have pulled it out years ago and as my life has been since then I would have not regretted it even for a moment.  
  
I am truly sorry as I know some people here are going through real pain and obstacles, while I'm thinking about suicide because of depression and loneliness, so this is more of a rant against myself.
