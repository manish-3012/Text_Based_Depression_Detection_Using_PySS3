I'm unemployed, in debt, friendless, and I'll be living with my parents indefinitely. I have a plan, and I don't see why I shouldn't go through with it considering that.I'm 23, living with my parents, and the student loan debt is nearly $30k.  The few friends I had have left the area, and I spend most of my time alone or with my parents.

The depression has always been with me, but never like this.  I'm sleeping half the day, have no apetite, can't enjoy anything.

What's the point?  Work, suffer, and kill time?  I could find a retail job, work full time, and wouldn't make enough to move out.  Powering through the isolation and lack of purpose, I could hold onto it until I got promoted to a desk job earning a mediocre salary.  Maybe after that I could find a wife, and spend the rest of life going through the motions.  Why, though, would I deal with all of that?  What's the end-goal?

Despite trying, I can't buy into any religion.  The military turned me away after finding out about an ADHD prescription.  Any other option that comes to mind doesn't pan out.

The only thing causing me hesitation in the past was the thought of more pain from a botched attempt, leaving me worse off.  An exit bag doesn't have those problems, and now every day now I consider it.  It would be rash to try something an impulse, but it has been a decade since I first asked myself if suicide was my best bet.

Please don't say "it will get better", when there is no guarantee of that.
