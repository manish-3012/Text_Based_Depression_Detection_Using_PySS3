I just wanna end everythingCant stand almost everything in my life, I hate that I still love my mom even though she hurt me so many times, and she's the only one I would count on, but at the same time she just disappointed me, I can't do this anymore,all those lies and cheap love. Hopefully I can end my life this winter and never have to cry through countless nights.
