Iâ€™m so tired.I just donâ€™t know what to do. Nothing is ever good for me. I feel like Iâ€™ve done all that I can. Iâ€™m only 25 and over the last 6 years I went from nothing to owning my own home. I worked so hard. And for what? I have nobody to share my happiness with, no real friends anymore, family barely talks to me. Nobody around me truly understands what Iâ€™m going through. I always hear things will get better but they never do. Iâ€™m so tired. The only reason Iâ€™m even alive right now is because I have cats that nobody can take care of and they still have 10-15 years left at least. But Iâ€™ve been hated my whole life by so many people. So why should I stick around? I just ostracized the only person I could actually talk to. Iâ€™m just exhausted. I donâ€™t even trust myself to drive. The only thing Iâ€™ve eaten in two weeks is a lunchable and that was just to make it through work without passing out. I want to give up. Even if I died today, nobody would know for at least 3 weeks and that person would be the trailer park owner looking for lot rent. I hear sleeping pill overdose is peaceful. Iâ€™d just take a bottle and open the door right? Let the cats go, the weather is a little warmer so Iâ€™d be okay in the last few minutes. Maybe tomorrow. I can get the pills in the morning and wash them down with some rum. I just wish I could find something to take these thoughts out of my head.
