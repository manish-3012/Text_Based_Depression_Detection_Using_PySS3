IdeationI canâ€™t really stop myself from thinking of it as an option. And even if I donâ€™t do it soon, I have this knowledge that I will eventually. Everything always leads back to it. I know youâ€™re supposed to change your life when you start thinking of it as the best option. Youâ€™re supposed to deal with problems, and make healthy changes, and â€œkill the life you donâ€™t likeâ€ but I actually think Iâ€™m just ungrateful. I think I have an okay life but it doesnâ€™t make me happy. And itâ€™s so hard to make the kind of changes I want to make. Everything is so disappointing. I feel so alone in this world. Thatâ€™s with friends, and a lover, and even a decent, if aloof, family. Weâ€™re not close but weâ€™re good at putting on closeness when weâ€™re around each other. Nobody knows me. The people who do donâ€™t want to know me well. Everyone settles for this shell of a person. I guess I can imagine killing myself because I donâ€™t feel like a real person anyway.
