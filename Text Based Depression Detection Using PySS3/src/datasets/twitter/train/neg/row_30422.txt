I have maid my decision today. Eventually I will kill my self
Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide for a long time. The only thing that kept me away from it was the fact that I believed in god and I didnâ€™t want to go to hell. But after I studied science and realized that god does not exist I started to take that thought seriously. Itâ€™s because I came up with the following conclusion. 

Even though life is full of pleasure it is also full of pain not like death which is completely empty. Yes it will be hard on your loved ones and some of them might repeat what you did but it really doesnâ€™t matter because we are all just atoms bonded together. 

Also, almost all of my family have put them selves first so it is reasonable that I become selfish as well.

Edit: Iâ€™m not planing to kill myself now Iâ€™m just saying at some point in the future I will.
