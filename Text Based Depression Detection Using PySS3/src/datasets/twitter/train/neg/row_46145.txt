I hope it's not a joke.I've been feeling awful lately. Extremely depressed. Suicidal. 

The other day I was talking to my best friend and she said in a kinda joking manner that when we are old and our respective partners have died, me and her should buy a house and live together. SHe said we should have a whole heap of pets and an indoor swimming pool. I said I wanted a granite kitchen with one of those centre islands that have a pot rack above. We talked like this for a few hours.

She has no idea how bad it's gotten for me lately. I feel like I can't tell anyone.

Right now the hope of that house is all I have to live for. It's the only thing stopping me from offing myself. 

I really hope she was being serious, because I was. I am. I want that damn house.
