Getting divorcedMy wife and I have been fighting a lot recently and last night she asked for a divorce.
She's on the cusp of a surgery that will tell her is she has cancer or not. She said that she doesn't have any confidence in my ability to handle a cancer diagnosis and she can't go through this if she's on chemo. She also very recently lied to me about have an emotion affair with a woman and came out as Bisexual. I'm at a point where I don't feel like I can continue going. My world as I know it is gone.
