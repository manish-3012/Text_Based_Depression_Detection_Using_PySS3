I'm not gonna make itIm 100% sure at this point i wont make it past 25 because i'm currently 15 and my depression is so bad as I just want to find a gun or pill and end it sometimes, im addicted to alcohol and we are running out and my parents dont drink and im scared for when we run out cause i tried going sober for 3 days and on that third day ive never felt so low, and this is all at just 15 and idk if its ever gonna get better. I've literally tried imagining my future and all i see is just me getting wasted and ending it before 25
