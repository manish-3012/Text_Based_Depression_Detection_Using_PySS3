ApplesThis sounds ludicrous, I know...

I eat a lot of apples. If I were to collect a giant amount of apple seeds over the course of about two months, crush them and eat them all in one would that be enough cyanide to guarantee death? Does the deadliness of apple seeds reduce after a certain amount of time?   


I'm really grasping at straws here.
