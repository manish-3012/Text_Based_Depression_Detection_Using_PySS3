ContemplationI don't want to live anymore.

All I've ever tried to do was help people. Make them happy, help them out when they needed someone. But I just make everything worse.

Every day I think about suicide. I just want this monotonous torture that is life to end. Every day is a struggle, and I don't want to live any more if that's what life is.

I know I may have really vague sounding reasons, but I'm having a really hard time vocalizing my feelings right now...

I just want some help. Please.
