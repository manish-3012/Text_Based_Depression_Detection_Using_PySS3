I want to kill myself.Hi there. 
Uhm... I'm not really sure what to say. I have a lot of problems. More than I can begin to explain, but my major ones is mental illness. I'm horribly mentally ill. I'm bipolar, first off, and I have horrible episodes that consist of me either being very destructive to myself or to my relationships. I hurt a lot of people unintentionally, and I don't control it well. Meds help, but... it's a struggle.
I have depression and anxiety as well. Have since I was a young kid, and it doesn't really improve much.
I have PTSD. I was raped and possibly molested, and theres not a day that goes by where I don't imagine these things again.
I go to college full time, but this last semester I did horrible and my parents were really disappointed with me. I don't know really what to do anymore.
It's gotten to the point to where all my dreams and aspirations are going away. I don't really desire anything anymore. Maybe an orgasm, but I feel guilty for that due to my hypersexuality. I lost all interest in hobbies I used to once do.
I just am done with life. I'm done with trying and it never going anywhere. I'm done with dealing with all these things. People say I'm strong, but I'm not. I'm just living, I guess, for everyone elses sake. I don't love myself. I don't like who I am. I'm disgusted by everything about me.
I don't know. I think its time.
