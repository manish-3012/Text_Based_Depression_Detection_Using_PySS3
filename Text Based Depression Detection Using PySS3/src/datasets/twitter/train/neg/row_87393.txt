I'm afraid of death but dying sounds so good now.I've always been on and off suicidal but the older I get the stronger the feeling gets. I think I might like getting hurt. I think it's something my body and mind recognize as appealing. I am attracted to the pain of being upset, heartbroken and betrayed. Maybe I've always been conditioned to feel this way. It makes me feel alive. But I'm tired of all that now, I want peace, and not being alive to feel all this sounds really, really good.
