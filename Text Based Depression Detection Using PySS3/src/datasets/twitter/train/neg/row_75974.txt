I keep fucking things upI want to slit my wrists. Iâ€™m fucking up the best thing that has ever happened to me. My boyfriend is my rock but I think heâ€™s going to break up with me eventually. I just feel like Iâ€™m losing the only person whoâ€™s in my corner. But maybe he would be better off. Iâ€™m a burden to him. He has so much potential. Heâ€™s this perfect, patient guy and I ruined him with my insecurities. Heâ€™s better off without me. He can get the girl he wants and live the life he wants to have without me holding him back. When I die, heâ€™ll be free of me and my issues.
