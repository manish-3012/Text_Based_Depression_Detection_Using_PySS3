I don't know what to doI don't want to be alive anymore. I'm losing friends, my anxiety and depression are through the roof, I can't talk to any friends or family, and I'm too shy and awkward to talk to a therapist. I'm under so much stress from school and thoughts on my future plans. When anyone asks about my future I feel like I have no purpose or reason to be alive. I don't hardly eat; I just don't have the will to. 

But in opposition to that, I think so in depth about actually killing myself. I want to end it, but I don't want anyone to mourn me. I want to go quickly, but I don't know what's the fastest aside from a gun. I fear failing and causing my parents to have to spend an arm and a leg on hospital bills, we aren't good financially. I don't want to kill myself somewhere where my family will remember what my lifeless corpse looks like in the bathtub, my bed, etc.

I'm stuck in between needing to end it, and not being able to. I'm numb. Nothing makes me happy and all I do is cry every night. I don't know what to do.
