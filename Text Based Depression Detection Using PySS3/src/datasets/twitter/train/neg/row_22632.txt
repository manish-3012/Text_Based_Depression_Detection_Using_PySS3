I started to OD on benzos and oxy last night. Very scary flashback.Started with 2 beers, 15mg of Valium. Another 5 in a few mins. Then 12.5 of oxy. Then 600mg gabapentin, 5 more mg of Valium, then I lost count. I stopped and passed out. A new script of klonopin, 20 more milligrams of oxy, and some liqueur were next on my list. Then I stopped.  I totally passed out in bed. On my homework. 




I donâ€™t know if I stopped from the exhaustion or if something subconscious in my head told me to give it up, though I was barely cohesive. Took a fall. Just a few bruises. I feel like complete shit. I canâ€™t believe I was in that mindset again. I need to talk and I canâ€™t. Itâ€™s a sensitive medical situation on top of psych and everyone goes nuts when you mention psych, and Iâ€™m really sick physicallyâ€” permanently. What the fuck is wrong with me; whyâ€™d I do that? 




Fuck.
