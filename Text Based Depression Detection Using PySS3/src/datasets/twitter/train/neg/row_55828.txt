I don't deserve happinesswhen I start to get better I feel guilty - I know that I don't deserve happiness. I try to make myself miserable whenever things improve because being okay feels wrong. I know that the only thing that I deserve is death. I deserve every single bad thing that ever happened to me. I make myself suffer and put myself in the position to get hurt intentionally. Being miserable just feels right, I don't even know how to explain it properly.
