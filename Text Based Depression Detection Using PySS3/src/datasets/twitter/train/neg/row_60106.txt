Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯Been off zoloft for 2 weeks and I don't miss feeling like this. Only thing holding me back from relapsing and cutting is I don't want to deal with the mess afterwards. I really want to kill myself. I don't feel like I'm worth anything, or ever will be. I don't know what I want in life and I won't really amount to much. What's even the point in living when you're this miserable? I'm tired of always falling back into my depression. It's such a safe spot for me because I push everyone out in fear of them hurting me, and hurt myself in the process. I'm just tired of everything. I really do not wanna keep trying.
