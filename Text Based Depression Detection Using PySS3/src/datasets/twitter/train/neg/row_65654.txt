needed helpi want to leave something bc it will let ppl around me know that such a tiny thing can save someone.

texted everyone i know since this morning bc i canâ€™t pick up my meds. unknown charge to my bank account and itâ€™s empty. i have had mental illness for a very long time and only have a reason to live that i can pick up my meds and feel a bit better.

i needed Â£6 to pick up what i need. thatâ€™s less than $10. i even said i could pay it back when i got paid in 2 days but that didnâ€™t do any good. ppl donâ€™t undestand how important it is. some ppl even replied and said i should call the dr as if i didnâ€™t try all that before!

so iâ€™m done i cant go through what i went through last time this happend. i have pawened evrything i own and i cant pawn my familys computer. thereâ€™s nothing else to be done. i just wish wish someone would have helped me for teo fays
