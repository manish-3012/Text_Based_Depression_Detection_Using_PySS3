Life is miserableIâ€™m a 34 year old male that still lives with his mother. Iâ€™ve been working a dead end job for 15 years and I havenâ€™t enjoyed a single day of it since it began. 

I collect shopping carts at a supermarket and itâ€™s shameful, the weather is terrible to work in, I have no friends at work, no love for the work and I spend half the day hiding. I have no other skills, interests, or qualifications. I canâ€™t drive a car, I have no motivation, a minuscule attention span and I am stupid. I am utterly incompetent.

There are too many more problems in my life to even mention that make everyday so bleak. I have no support from family or friends. I reached out for help to the doctors countless times but nothing changed. Iâ€™ve heard all the advice you could give a 1000 times before. I either donâ€™t follow it or Iâ€™m incapable of following it. My life is pretty much the same as it was when I was 18, just worse.

I am so tired and back thinking about suicide a lot. I had a girlfriend who was wonderful but I lied about my life for 2 years just so I could date her because Iâ€™m thoroughly ashamed of the loser I am in reality. She lives in a different country and I have no way of living a good life with her. She deserves a lot better.

I feel like I was cursed and the only way to end it is to die. I might even go to hell afterwards, but it would be hard to distinguish hell from my current life so I donâ€™t really care anymore.
