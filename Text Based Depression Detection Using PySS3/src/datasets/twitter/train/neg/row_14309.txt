A WhimI shouldn't be posting this here, I shouldn't write anything. But this is a whim I'm giving myself this last time.

I think I'll do this tonight. Or not. I don't know, sometimes it fades really quickly, but I hope I do. I hate being here, inside this body, inside this mind. Most of the time I feel that I'm already gone, and that the only thing keeping me here is this shell. It's time to let it go too.

I can't help but think the amount of trouble I'll give the people around me, but I hope the will forget me soon. Actually, I wish they never remembered me.

I'm scared it won't work, or that I won't be able to wait for it to work. If I don't, I guess I'll be here again tomorrow. If it does, then I'm free.

I'm so sorry for posting this, if this makes you feel bad in any way. I really am. I just wanted to talk and I couldn't help but do it.

I really wish this is the last time, though
