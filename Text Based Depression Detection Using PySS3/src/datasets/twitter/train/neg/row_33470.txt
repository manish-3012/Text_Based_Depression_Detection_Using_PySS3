Too little, too late...I'm mtf transgender.

I'm 38 years old.

I've only recently started transitioning. 

I have severe depression. 

I'm overweight.

I'm drowning in unpaid debt.

I will never look or feel the way I desire.

I can never reclaim my lost youth.

I will only grow older, uglier, and more miserable.

What's the point...

:-(
