New member. Don't know what I'm looking for or why I'm hereI've lost count of how many attempts I've made over the last two weeks.
Several attempts with CO poisoning (each time the fire went out and just wouldn't relight)
Another time I got razor blades ready on the side of the bath but didn't even have the courage to break the skin (afterwards I read up and found you have to go really really deep, so I'm glad I didn't even try that method).
I tried suspension hanging, but the pain was excruciating.
I've been experimenting with partial suspension hanging, but can't seem to block my Carotid artery without blocking my windpipe.
Why can't I just have an "off" button?
