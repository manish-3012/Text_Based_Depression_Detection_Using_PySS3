Do I suck at life? Am I being pitty? 

So look, I recently bought one of my most desired games ever on steam, MGRR and I gotta say it was discouraging at first but then, it slowly became frustrating, I played and I set the game on Normal because I assumed it was a jumpy action game, similar to spiderman, I assumed that there will be frustrating and challenging moments, in-game, as the blade wolf boss battle, but I overcame it, following the Mistral fight, which was challenging and fun, I came to monsoon and that shit became impossible for me, time and time again I keep failing, dying, attacks constantly doing nothing, attacks going through me as if I am to doing anything, you may say "WhY DoNt I pArRy" Well I do I am using the left stick to focusing on the direction of the enemy and press square/, 6/10 it works. The game decides when I can parry, you know at first I was like you know...maybe it's me, maybe I am the one fucking up and I kept that mindset for the next 20-30 times of me dying. Eventually, I realized I am not cut out for this kind of games and now I am contemplating whether I should refund it on steam (10 hrs playtime) to get another one instead. Now I come to terms with the fact I suck at videogames in general, but it's so frustrating I wanted something and now I have it and know that something kicks me in the nuts repeatedly. Also on youtube, I searched for tutorials, and these motherfuckers show up with fully maxed out upgraded shit and I am here with a 100% health, yes I got a sufficient amount fo upgraded and skills maxed but nothing helps, he just goes through my attacks, and I just wanna blast my head open, look I get it people have similar problems to me or bigger, but the world doesn't revolve on me for a fucking Game, but what do I do in this situation considering the fact I fucked my save file where I tried to make into a way where it went to the first level.
