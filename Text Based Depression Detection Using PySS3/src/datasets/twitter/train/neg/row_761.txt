I'm done with wanting to fix myselfI had reasons to try before

Now it's just empty void and imperious need to stop existing. I used to consider suicide as a scary thing, now it's more and more appealing. I self harmed for the first time a week ago and I wanted to stab my throat the whole time.

I don't even want to get better I just want to die by my own hand
