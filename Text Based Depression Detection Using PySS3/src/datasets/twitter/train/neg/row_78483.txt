l prayed and prayed that God would give me something to live for.That something never came. You can say that something, whatever it may be, is still on its way to me. I give up. I have nothing and no one to live for. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m writing my last words on the internet. 

People tell me to keep my head up and everything will work out. Thatâ€™s a sick joke to me. Is that all life is to people? Just waiting and hoping that things will get better? I donâ€™t know a single person who is honestly happy. Good things never last. 

My parents are awful horrible people. I have been called every single name in the book by them and physically abused as well. Donâ€™t have any extended family. I thought all I had was my sister but she stole from me and sold the only nice things I had left. I finally felt like I could trust someone and now thatâ€™s been ruined.

The only time I was happy was when I was living in my car. Itâ€™s sad to think about, cause even then it was hard. I lost my job. My job was the only thing that I FINALLY felt like I fit in with people. I finally had friends. The sad thing about this, is that they probably didnâ€™t appreciate me as much as I appreciated them. No one ever does. I finally felt like I was back on track and I was exactly where I supposed to be in life. 

Now Iâ€™m stuck. No direction. No focus. No friends. No family. Iâ€™m alone and thatâ€™s the way it always will be. Nothing good ever lasts. I was shown that time and time again. Iâ€™m so tired of being heartbroken and disappointed in life. 

I need this pain to stop and Iâ€™m stopping it tonight.
