postpartum and I already canâ€™t handle itHonestly I just feel so overwhelmed and thereâ€™s been quite a few days where I kinda just wanna end my life and leave my 2 boys and husband behind. I just had my baby boy and he is a month premature. Iâ€™m getting harassed by in-laws for not letting them see the new baby due to COVID, flu season and whooping cough. They pretty much say Iâ€™m overreacting for keeping my premie baby safe. Idk maybe I am cause somedays I feel like they would be better without me as their mom. My oldest boy has been acting out so bad since his baby brother came home and I was expecting a little acting out but itâ€™s been tantrum after tantrum consistently like every hour. 

I was actually in the ER this morning due to a 104 fever and raging headache. Thought it was COVID but turns out that my epidural gave me meningitis. Like something that is fucking deadly! Itâ€™s extremely rare but of course it had to happen to me and make everything so much more difficult to heal. My head pounds with bright lights, I can barely move my neck, my fever still has been spiking up all day but I am on antibiotics and expected to feel better soon. I was going back and forth about just wishing I would spike a higher fever and go into a coma or some thing but as a new mom again thereâ€™s also a part of me that just wants to be with my son and newborn baby. I just wish this feeling would go away. I had to have therapy and meds after I had my first son since I felt the same way but with COVID I canâ€™t even find a place taking new patients. My obgyn wonâ€™t prescribe anything either since they just tell moms that itâ€™s â€œbaby bluesâ€ and it goes away with sleep. Yeah like new moms get sleep. My husband helps when he can but itâ€™s like a instinct where I just wanna take over and take the baby and deal with the intense crying depression fits later. I feel trapped in this cycle.
