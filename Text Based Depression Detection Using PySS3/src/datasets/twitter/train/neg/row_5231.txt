I'm more than halfway through a bottle of whiskey and wish I could end it all cause I'm worthless to everyoneThrowaway account for obvious reasons. I'm in the navy and wanna just end it all because I feel like I'm worthless. I got spot promoted recently and I know I dont deserve it. No one trusts me with tasks and I'm constantly treated like I'm stupid or can't handle managing projects on my own. I'm not even respected by my own peers or my chain of command. I just wanna die but I know it would  devastate my brother. I know shouldn't be feeling like this but I'm just tired of having g to fight to show that I'm worth something. I'm to much of a coward to end it but I'm just so deep in this hole I dont see any other way out
