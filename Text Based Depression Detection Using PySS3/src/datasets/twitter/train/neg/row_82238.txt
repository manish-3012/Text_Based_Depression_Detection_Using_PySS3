PLEASE HELP MEI don't want to die but my mind is telling me otherwise. I don't want to commit suicide but each day I wake up it's a struggle. I have a daughter, I need to be her mommy I need to be there for her she's only 4 months old but I can't take this anymore. The mental distress is so overbearing I can't function. I can't live like this I just don't know what to do anymore. Nothing around me feels real I don't feel real and I just want to scream out. Please just try to talk to me and help me genuinely I don't want to do this I feel like my brain is going to fucking explode im so overwhelmed and I don't know.. Everyday is a struggle each day is a mental nightmare. I don't have money or insurance for therapy so please don't use that as a comment I know I need mental help just please help me
