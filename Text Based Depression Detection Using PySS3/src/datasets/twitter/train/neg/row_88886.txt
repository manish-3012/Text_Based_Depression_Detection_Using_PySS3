Justification?I've been suicidal for the majority of my life. I made attempts as a young adult though I'm not sure deep down I truly wanted to succeed hence this post years later. When I was younger I really had no ties to the world outside of my family. I lived alone, no girlfriend, no children. Now that I'm older I'm at peace with the thought of suicide, but I now share my life with people who I care about. I've heard it said many times that suicide is selfish. I don't share this feeling, but I do recognize the impact my death would have on others. I recognize that it may be unfair to them, but I also recognize that continuing my life is unfair to myself. How do you folks who have gone through this reconcile those feelings and continue on?
