I guess this is the right placeI keep thinking about it. I don't know why, I don't know how. But it just keeps on pushing itself into my brain, I can't help it.

I've thought about it before, I came close a while back. I used to get the train to school every day and I'd considered what jumping in front of a train would be like but this time I felt like I had to. Like if I didn't and carried on, got my my train and left, I'd be making a mistake.

But recently I can't stop thinking about it, but it isn't even like I'm depressed at the time. In a *really* neutral manner I will ponder (with a slight wistfulness) the idea of shooting myself. Taking a handgun or rifle and shooting myself in the head. It's weird, it occurs to me with no real pattern, it just does. Increasingly often, as of late. It wouldn't be hard, either. I am able to access a rifle and ammunition and it would be a simple matter to do it.

But it's weird because I feel so... Neutral, when I consider it. I feel nothing, but not in a "I feel nothing as I fall through the abyss" sort of way, just as a... Well, blankness. I apathetically consider shooting myself in the head and often.

I don't understand...
