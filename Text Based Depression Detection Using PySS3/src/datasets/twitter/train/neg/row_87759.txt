Goodbye...I dont know what to do anymore...I'm not about to spill every detail of my life on here...so long story short, I cannot do this anymore. I've stopped cutting a long long time ago, but for some reason, today I broke out a shiny new razor blade. I think I may have done some damage, judging by the size of the puddle I've produced...but the question is...why should I even go for help this time? I have nothing left...I feel fuzzy, warm almost...despite the fact my arm is becoming increasingly cold. I guess I just wanted to say goodbye here since no one else listens...
