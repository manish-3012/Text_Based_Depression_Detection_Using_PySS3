I am going to kill myselfM/30
Well I tired and I'm pretty much done with life.
I'm going to turn 31 in a couple of weeks and I just can't see anything to live for.
I was sexually abuse from the ages of 7-10 by my cunt of a father and older cousin( both did it separately of each other and I extremely doubt they knew what the other was doing).I witnessed watching my dad beat the shit out of my mother and after the divorce other people.I was constantly bullied at school by kids about being dumb(I was held back a year then skipped a year when I was about 6 to 8)so I always feel like an outsider)and being Darkskined by my family and school kids .when I got home I was bullied by my older brother.my teens were pretty shit too having to visit my cunt of a fathers house and bitch of of a girlfriend who was also my mums sister.my twenties were shit  too I can't hold down a job and I would dissapper from my friends lives due to what I now know was and is long term depression.during this time I've never had a girlfriend  and I'm a virgin.I keep drinking lately(from about Jan of last year I stopped drinking but would start up and stop every couple of months) and smoking.I can't talk to friends because they don't understand.I hate myself with a passion only Hitler could fathom.I'm tired of this life and want it too end. I always knew it would come to this.I plan on going to a carpark on my birthday and jumping after downing a bottle of vodka.
I don't want to exist and I'm fed up of feeling constantly alone even when I'm surrounded by people.I have no drive It's like I will my self to lose,every opportunite I've had I fuck up beyond belief.
On the 26th/27th of June I'm going to kill myself and that the only thing right now that gives me hope.
