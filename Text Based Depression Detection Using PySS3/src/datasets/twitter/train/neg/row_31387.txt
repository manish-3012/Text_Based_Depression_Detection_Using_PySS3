Waking up is a dragWaking up is a drag. From the moment I woke up this morning I have a sinking feeling. My wife is leaving me and taking the kids. I'm not taking my medicine anymore it was fucking with me too much. I don't want to work I need time to get my shit together but life cones at me full force every morning. I'm going to pack my shit and take off soon or I'm going to blow my god damn brains out.
