Give me a reason not to.I'm failing all of my classes (and life in general), my "friends" don't care about me or my troubles, and my family is disappointed in me for being depressed. In general, I'm a loser. Have been and will be.

I defy you to give me one reason not to down the months supply of the four medications I'm on.
