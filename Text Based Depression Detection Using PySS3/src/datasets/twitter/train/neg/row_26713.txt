I've made plans to end it tonight.It's weird trying to word this. But basically I (20m) feel like this is the best outcome for me. 

For the better part of this year, I've been without work (Got laid of because of Covid.) and I haven't managed to find anything. I've stopped talking to friends that I graduated with since March, I've stopped caring  about myself, and I barely talk to the family I live with anymore. My dad keeps telling me that I need to get a job and "Have you even been looking for work? I wont have you live here if you're just gonna sit inside all day.".

I know he means well, he just want to see his son get somewhere in life. Even though he seems to be oblivious that I need help. But I'm too scared to ask for it because he might not understand and just get mad, thinking I'm making excuses.

So on and on it goes. But I'm ending that cycle tonight. It's a good thing crying makes you sleepy. I'm going to bed after posting this while it's still early in the evening, to wake up around 4 AM where I will fix the root of the problems. I found a suitable place and height to end my life early morning. The suicide letter is written, and I ate a decent last meal. Will update in like 7 hours when I go through with it.
