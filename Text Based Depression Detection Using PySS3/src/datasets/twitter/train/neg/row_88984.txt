it's 1 amits 1am, not quite late but an hour where everyone is asleep in my house and here I am, awake and my last resort is reddit because I can't talk to anyone because it's no use, i try my hardest to feel better but no matter what, I end up having doubts about myself and my existence. even though I'm 15, I already feel like my life is over, with no actual talent at anything and not being good at any particular thing I feel useless, everyone I know has something to look for, something to keep on living every day and keep on breathing, whether it's either their passion for something or someone. but what about me? It sound so selfish and I hate it because even though I'm diagnosed with anxiety and depression, I don't actually feel like I should be wasting my parents money to go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist, what I feel is probably nothing compared to other people and I have no right to feel this way because I have a 'perfect' life. I hope that once quarantine is over, I can get what I need to end it all already.
