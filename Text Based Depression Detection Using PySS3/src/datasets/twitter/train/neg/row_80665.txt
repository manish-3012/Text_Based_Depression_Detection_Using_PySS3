Every feeling I have is just so overwhelming.Posting from a throwaway. 

I have never felt so terrible before. I've gone through the motions of suicidal feeling, I had it fixed, and I went free and happy. And now, it's different. I have never felt so insignificant, so worthless, or so miserable before. I'm 15 years old, and every last bit of my life is nothing.
I used to have so much creativity. I used to be a creative genius. I was one of the smartest kids, one of the most artistic, one of the best writers. Now, I have nothing. There is nothing that makes me unique, nothing that defines me as me. I've lost my identity. I'm nobody. Everything I want is too far. I live a different life than I want to. Every thought I have is different than what I do. My body acts independently of my mind. I have no self control. I hate it. I feel so alone in everything I do. I feel like a failure, like nobody. I'm too afraid to call a hotline and physically speak. What if my mom hears and gets concerned? Then, she'll port me off to someone to get help. I don't want to bring any more pain or suffering into my parents' lives than need be. I hate myself. Why can't I control myself? Why is crying my only way to comfort myself? I don't want to feel so lonely. I don't want to feel so useless. What's the point in living if all I am or ever will be is mediocre?
