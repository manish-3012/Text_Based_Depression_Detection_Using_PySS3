Fuck everythingNot a day goes by without me wanting to shoot someone and/or myself. There's nothing particularly wrong with my environment, I'm just fucked in the head. I'll take a good thing and ruin the shit out of it. I'm in college, 2nd year. I was diagnosed with depression in my 1st year. The social anxiety was murdering my fuckin soul and everytime I would step out of my dorm I would feel like everyone is judging me. I hate it. I've been on Zoloft for 5 months now and I have mental breakdowns every other day. I want to kill someone. I fantasize about shooting the people that done me wrong in the past. Even if you took a measly 5 dollars from me I still want to kill you. My friends are all doing better than me by a long stretch and I hid away the fact that I have depression from them. My parents know but they don't understand my pain. Sometimes I feel like no one does. I ask myself what I did to deserve this and then I realize that it's all self inflicted. I let the only girl that ever loved me get away and it was done by my own hands. Was the IG clout worth it bro? Was it? Fucking moron. Nowadays the only thing that keeps me going is basketball. I really like playing it, even though I'm not good at it. Only thing keeping me from ending it all. I can interest girls but eventually they lose interest because..I'm me. I can't even express my feelings. Haven't gotten pussy in monthes. Send help. I want to kill but I know I lack the balls. Are you a man or a mouse? I can't stop overthinking. I'm so paranoid I feel like someone's gonna shoot up my house. Help me? Please? Please? I feel like shinji.
