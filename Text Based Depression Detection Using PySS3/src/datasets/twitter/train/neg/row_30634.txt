My Schroedinger's Cat.Deadhome and I started talking a month ago. 22 days ago, she stopped replying. Did she commit suicide? Did she recover, and stop using reddit? I know it's not likely, but there's still hope. But mine is dwindling. Deep down, I know I couldn't save her. I'm selfish though. All I learned is that you have to want help for it to work. Stay strong, everyone.
