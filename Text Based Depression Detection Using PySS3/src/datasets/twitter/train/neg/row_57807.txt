I can't live with my sexualityHi reddit, 

I'm turning to you guys because I couldn't tell anyone I actually know about what I feel right now. So, here is my story. Up until a few months ago I was like a regular heterosexual teenager, ogling after every woman on r/nsfw and the like. However in these past months I have lost my attraction to the female body and become more aroused by men. I'm afraid that I can't live like that. I am not homophobic and I believe everyone should be allowed to love whoever they love but I don't want to be with a man. It has always been my dream to get married and have children of my own, this brings me to why I have had suicidal thoughts recently.

How could I possibly do that to someone? How could I marry a woman and know deep inside that while I may love her in the way best friends love each other, I will never be sexually attracted to her? I am currently in a relationship with the most amazing girl I have ever met and I love her to pieces but it kills me every time I talk to her or see her knowing that essentially I'm just lying about what I really feel. 

My evenings are becoming a living nightmare, I try to convince myself I'm not gay by looking at woman (I know I'm in denial) and, without getting into too much detail, can't get off as easily so instead I do to gay porn. I then cry myself to sleep and all I can think is how much I hate myself. You only get one life and I'm stuck being gay. I would honestly rather be dead. Please don't tell me to suck it up and go and have some fun or whatever because it's not going to happen. I'm sorry but this is one thing that I refuse to accept about myself, again I would rather just end it all than live with the conflict and drama that would come from being in a heterosexual relationship even though that is what I want out of life

Thank you for reading this, I cant talk to anyone else
