ex-best friend and my gf fucked, now i'm alone and depressedThis all happened in my house while I was asleep, they were both drunk, on xanax and adderall but honestly I don't think that excuses anything.  I stopped talking to both of them (so far it's only been a day) but the fact that these two people were my best friends is tearing me apart.

They keep saying they're sorry, and a part of me wants to accept them back and then another part wants to just kill myself because I can't trust anyone anymore.  This is so fucked up that killing myself seems worth it, especially since I have no family or close friends to turn to.
