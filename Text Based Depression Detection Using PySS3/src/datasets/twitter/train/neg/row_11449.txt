TiredWork is stressful and cold.
Life is stressful and cold.
People and activities are uninteresting.
Love is worthwhile but I suffocate those who love me and they always leave.
It's not worth the stress. You want something, someone, and somewhere you'll just be happy. But it doesn't exist. It's just stress and difficulty that even if you conquer you just get different stress and difficulty.
It's not worth it anymore. There's nothing here. There's only pain and disappointed and disillusionment. I want to die.
