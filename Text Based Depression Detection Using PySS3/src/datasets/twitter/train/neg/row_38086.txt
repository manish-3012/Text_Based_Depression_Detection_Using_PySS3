I feel suicidal, and the reason is stupidI just want someone to talk to. Here's my story,: I was sexually and physically abused during my undergrad which ruined my mental health. I can't sleep, I get triggered often and I exhaust myself with the hate for him. But it also ruined my grades. I was always good at studies, but he ruined it. I lost all hope of getting into a grad school but I did. And I did everything I could, I did excellently on my courses and my dissertation. But my advisor gave me grades which have honestly ruined my chance of getting a grade I deserved. I feel helpless again. All my efforts are wasted. I won't get in anywhere, and my life makes no sense. I wish I could disappear into thin air right now, because my existence has been such a burden on me that it's getting unbearable. I wish I had someone to talk to, everyone is busy with their lives and have enough problems and I don't want to burden them with myself.
