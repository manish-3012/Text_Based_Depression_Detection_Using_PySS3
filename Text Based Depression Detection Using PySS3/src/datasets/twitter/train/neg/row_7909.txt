Hurt, need help!I'm not sure if I'm posting in the right subreddit, but here it goes...

I have been abused as a child by my mother, both physically and verbally. I have endured continuous bullying when I was young in school, I was the most mocked person in the school- I was the laughing stock. I have been thrown rocks at, and been beaten to shits for being me. I never really excelled at anything- I was average. I have always felt gulty for being just average. I wanted to be soo much better. That was then: Now, I have a bf- it's not going the greatest with him, and always blame myself for not being good enough. I have a job that doesn't pay much, requires me to work shitty hours- most times until 1 in the morning- I don't get to see my friends during this time. I haven't told my friends that I am feeling this way, I am ashamed, I just tell them I have anxiety problems, and going through a tough time. I don't know if I actually am suicital or not, when I am being asked the question- I do often think: what if... what if I were dead, would anyone actually cry at my funeral. I often do think as well... what If I were to take some pills, what would happen... I do however feel like hurting myself.. burning, cutting etc.

Will someone please shead some light on how I am feeling, offer advice... please help!
