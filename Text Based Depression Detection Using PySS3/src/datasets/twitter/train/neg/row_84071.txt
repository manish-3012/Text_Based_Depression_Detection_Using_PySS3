Abusive ex contacted me just to make me feel bad about myselfHe was trying to be amicable at first. I never thought heâ€™d contact me again. Iâ€™ve been on a good path in my life again so I thought Iâ€™d try the forgiveness route and entertain the conversation. Turns out it would just bring a shit ton of terrifying memories and feelings I never wanted again 

It just ended with him telling me that heâ€™s in the bad place in his life because of me. Started accusing me of things that I didnâ€™t do. This man did horrible things to me and my life but Iâ€™ve chosen to move on and forgive, but heâ€™s still like this. Iâ€™ve chosen to be happy again and be happy with who I am now, but all he wanted to do was to put me down bc heâ€™s not happy anymore, so we both have to suffer. I thought I could escape this. I was so happy today and he showed up and stepped on it.

I forgot this feeling of hopelessness. I forgot this feeling of despair. I donâ€™t blame him, like he did to me. I blame myself for not getting myself out of this mindset on my own. I hate that I feel this way again. That my only escape is death from these dark feelings. I just want it all to stop when I fall asleep
