She leftIt's been 3 months since my girlfriend left me for another guy. I can't handle it. I feel worthless and sad all the time. Nothing makes me happy. She was the only one that could and now I will never be with her again. I have been depressed for a long time and this just makes it so much worse. Everyday I cry when I get home.I feel like I just want to die. I have been really tried hanging out with friends but nothing matters to me anymore. What should I do reddit? :*(
