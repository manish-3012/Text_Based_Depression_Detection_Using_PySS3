HelpI have basically given up on life. It doesnâ€™t interest me anymore. I donâ€™t see the point in living through the hard parts to enjoy the good parts for a moment, only for them to be replaced by the hard parts again. And from what Iâ€™ve seen in life so far, itâ€™s incredibly boring. Iâ€™d rather move on, see what happens after death, if anything, even if it is just me disappearing forever. I know Iâ€™d hurt the people close to me, but Iâ€™ve convinced myself that Iâ€™ll be gone and I wonâ€™t be able to think about it. If anyone has been in a similar situation and found a way out of it, please tell me. Iâ€™m more afraid to live than to die right now, and that scares me. I also have no one to talk to. I donâ€™t really trust my parents that much and from recent events, I think my sister, the only one I thought I could trust, has been telling my parents everything Iâ€™ve been talking to her about. I donâ€™t really have many close friends either so no help there. Itâ€™s why Iâ€™m coming to the internet. So please, a bit of help would be nice. And if I do end up *illing myself, I just hope nobody follows me.
