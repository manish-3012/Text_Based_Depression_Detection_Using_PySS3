Thoughts on this.Ive been thinking whats so important about staying alive? You repeat a process day in and day out. Wake up, work/school, sleep, eat. I dont see anything special in what there is in that. We all do the same thing just to one day get married? have kids? work a job? I dont see any importance in doing it, it doesnt make you special and you dont have any difference from anyone else. So why do I have to continue you on with that?
