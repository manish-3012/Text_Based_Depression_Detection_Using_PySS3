thanks for talking to me.... I only recently started toying with reddit. I found this subreddit because I have been having lots of problems with depression and suicidal thoughts but I am trying to rebuild my life. Again. I wasn't feeling very well earlier but listening to similar experiences and getting to talk to a few folks about them has helped me feel a little better. So thanks. I appreciate it.
