i feel kind of happy......and that's because i know i'm going to kill myself soon. i don't have a plan, but it's going to happen. i'm overwhelmed with everything happening in my life at the moment. i'm sorry in advance for the annoying post.  
i'm a student and i'm horrible in all of my classes. i'm so stupid i can hardly pay attention in lecture. i don't have any friends either. i'm always alone, and it fucking sucks. even online, people hate me. everyone i know talks about how ugly and stupid i am behind my back.  
as i've said before on here, i'm almost 20, and i've never dated anyone. i've never even been kissed. i don't blame anyone for not wanting to be with me though, i'm fucking disgusting. my face is hideous and my body is repulsive and obese and scarred and my personality is horrible. i'm so disgustingly fat. no one in their right mind would ever want to spend time with me, much less love me and want to be with me.  
i'm not good at anything. i'm not funny or smart, i can't play sports, i can't sing or dance or play an instrument or anything like that. i can't even talk to people. i'm so fucking awkward and weird, people just feel sorry for me because i'm constantly embarrassing myself.   
i also have cancer, on top of a multitude of other health issues, including severe OCD. half the time i want to bash my skull in because things aren't right. it would be much easier on my family if they didn't have to deal with me because i'm such a burden. i wish i had died during surgery.  
i'm sorry for posting here so much, but i can't go anywhere else. i'm sorry for being annoying. i just hate myself so much. but i hope that this will be my last post here. thank you to everyone on here who has messaged me in the past with kind words, it does mean a lot. but my life is not worth living anymore. the world is a horrible place and i want to leave. i'm worthless.
