Life is exhausting, why do I continue?Itâ€™s a constant for me. Iâ€™m ignored, told My ideas or thoughts are stupid, treated like Iâ€™m nothing. If I move back in with family, I canâ€™t be myself or have friends over or express anything. If I continue to live where Iâ€™m at, I get to sleep without AC, get used and abused, and have to live in squalor. 

Job is pushing us to death, so much forced overtime, I donâ€™t have any time for anything. I am so exhausted, I just want to enjoy the things I used to, like games or YouTube or being creative. 

Everyone keeps guilting me as well. â€œWeâ€™ll miss you so much!â€ â€œWe love you!â€ â€œJust be happy!â€. I should have never made friends, I should have ended it earlier in my life... 

I donâ€™t see a future, I canâ€™t physically change into who I am, itâ€™s not scientifically possible, and even if I transitioned I would be subject to hatred and violence.

Maybe I should just end it now... stop the suffering...

Iâ€™m sorry, I wish I could be better..
