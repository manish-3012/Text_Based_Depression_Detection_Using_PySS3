I just don't knowI've had bad anxiety for about 3 years now. Always a stress machine but it's just gotten worse. I'm just at the point to why even bother. I have my boyfriend but all I do is cause pain. I think I do more harm than good. I just think at this point, if I go away forever, I can fix everyone else's problems. Maybe it's time.
