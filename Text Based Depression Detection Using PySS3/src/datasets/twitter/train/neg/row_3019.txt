Why?That is the only question. Why? Why did our lives begin? Why did I have to be the one sperm that made it to the egg?

Thinking about it, as a sperm, I probably killed many other cells just to reach my objective. Thinking about it that way, I'm an asshole.

Why am I a human? Why not another animal, like a fish, which can live a mostly carefree life under the sea in it's beautiful reefs and all?

I hate myself. I wish I could just die.

What purpose do we have in life? All we do is live on a planet in a vast, vast universe, filled with countless other rocks like ours, filled with countless stars and galaxies, possibly countless other species of life.

I'll admit, I have a goal. I have something I want to do when I'm done with high school. But I don't do anything at all to try and achieve it. I tell myself to study, but I don't. At this point, I'm just scraping by in school.

I want to die. I'm not afraid of death. But I am afraid of the pain that comes with death.

I may have just rambled. I'm sorry. All I wanted to do was get some stuff off my mind.
