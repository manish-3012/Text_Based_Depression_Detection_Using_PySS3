Tired.If I had a gun right now Iâ€™d blow my brains out.  Nothing in my life is going right.  Iâ€™m really confused as to why I was put on this earth to stress and struggle.  Iâ€™m ready to leave.  I wish I could die in my sleep but the universe isnâ€™t that kind.  The only reason I havenâ€™t gotten a cpl and bought a gun to kill myself is because of my mom.  It would destroy her if I killed myself.  But I hate my existence.  I have headaches everyday.  My life is fucking pointless.  Why canâ€™t I just die in my sleep.
