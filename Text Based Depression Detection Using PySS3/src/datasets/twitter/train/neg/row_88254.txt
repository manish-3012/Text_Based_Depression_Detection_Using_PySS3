Living my life is a complete wasteItâ€™s not just a waste of my own potential, which I never got to explore due to my own failings in being a human being, itâ€™s a waste of other peopleâ€™s time. Precious time they could spend improving their own lives. Unlike any other person, I know how my life works and I know that itâ€™d be more advantageous for everyone if I chose to end it.

I donâ€™t want to try anymore, iâ€™m tired. Fuck 80% of you out there in the world.
