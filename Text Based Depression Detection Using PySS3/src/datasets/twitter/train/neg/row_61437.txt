FinallyIâ€™ve set a date. And after two failed attempts, this will be a straight shooter

Itâ€™s been an almost 16 year fight. Iâ€™m ready. 

Im not looking for advice. I just canâ€™t tell anyone 

It gets better is bullshit. Iâ€™ve spent more of my life wanting to die than wanting to be alive. Therapy meds whatever 


Some of us are broken. Please accept it
