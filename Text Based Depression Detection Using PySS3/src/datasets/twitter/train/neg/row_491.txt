Today was badI really donâ€™t want to get into it. There have been a few close calls. Iâ€™ve held a gun to my head and a rope around my neck but iâ€™ve always failed to follow through. My coworker and I did everything right today. But we still get reamed out by the boss. I donâ€™t know why iâ€™m so angry. I thought I would be able to calm myself like I always do after a rough day at work, But today just keep getting angrier as the day goes on. Iâ€™m enraged but i donâ€™t know why. I know Iâ€™m not going to kill myself. I know iâ€™m not. I feel like a fraud posting here, like. There are other people that need to vent, I donâ€™t even know if iâ€™m going to hit the post button. Other people that need to be talked down from the ledge. I joke a lot about how I might kill myself. Nobody ever takes me seriously. I make sure of that. I do know that joking about suicide can be a sign that someone needs help. I canâ€™t afford professional help though. I always ask people that joke about suicide if they need to talk. Nobody has ever taken me up on my offer but I do hope that they would come to me if they needed to. 

My biggest fear is that some day I might kill myself on accident. When I have that gun to my head I may be so enraged that I just pull the trigger and then nothing. I donâ€™t want my parents to find me. I really donâ€™t want to die. I donâ€™t. And I think I have my emotions under enough control to not do anything stupid, I thought at least. I am not going to kill myself. I just need some room to breathe I think 

I just canâ€™t stop crying
