Would be nice to have another community of people who were not only accepting of your dark side, but didn't try to dissuade you from your choice.There was a community like that some time ago, and I'm sure many people here would see it as a shit show (unsurprisingly). No platitudes, no false positivity bullshit, no trying to dissuade you from your choice because they believe life is mandatory. Sick of the "Lets just say all these positive things because even though I don't know you, the positive answers I give are true, because they make people feel good. The negative is never true." 

People may see that as detrimental, but funny enough, people on the outside and people who love to spread "positivity" have been way more detrimental to me than those I met in Sanctioned Suicide. But people don't want to hear that, do they? 

It felt so fucking good talking to like minded people. I get some of that here, which is nice. I detest the notion that I must live despite my seething hatred for being alive in a species I never asked to be a part of. I don't want to live to spite people, I want to be gone. There is no Cosmic law saying I shouldn't, so why should humans decide whether I should? 

Literally a pretty horrible person. I can't understand how I'm *me. Alive.* I shouldn't be here. I'm not really asking people to agree with that, but I'm not for hearing the "I must say something positive to this person I don't know, but this positive thing I'm about to say is true." 

Like, I really appreciate it, I'm glad anyone would even take time to even say anything to me, but the insistence that said positive thing is true drives me insane. It causes people to get mad at you when you deny it. "It's just your depression talking" or some shit, while never asking why you feel that way. Ignoring that even when I'm really happy, I still feel that way about myself. 

Is it still my depression *then?*
