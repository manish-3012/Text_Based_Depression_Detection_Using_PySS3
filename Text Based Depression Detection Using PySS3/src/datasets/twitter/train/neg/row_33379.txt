I cannot take the pain anymore. I'm not getting help for neither the physical pain nor the mental pain and it will kill me.The one thing that kept me sane during hours of severe pain was the support my family and friends gave me. Especially after we found out what was causing my pain, when they got proof that I wasn't faking it.

My pain tripled ever since a month ago I decided to cut off my pain meds due to my addictive personality. 

I started having the flare ups of pain where I'd pass out completely around 3x a week rather than 2x a month, like when I was on medication. 

With that happening, my mood started to decrease significantly. 

The people I love are all mostly physically healthy and do not understand the type of pain I'm going through. 

I do not talk about my pain unless I'm asked and when I'm asked I often get told I'm overreacting and that surely I'm not in pain as much as i make it out to be. 

I feel like most people stopped caring and with the pain being worse, my already existing depression got A LOT worse.

I'm considering suicide a lot more than I was before and I'm just so tired.
