Trying to fight off what feels inevitableThis isn't my first, second, or third battle. 

After a lifetime of trauma without any consecutive breaks, I have a strong inner voice telling me to end my life. 

I was on meds for ten years after a serious breakdown. A lot of painful things occurred during that decade, and the resulting scenarios are causing much pain to this day. 

I've overcome a lot of traumatic experiences, pushed myself to the limits of desperation, and anger. The last thing I would ever want to do is cause pain to the small group of people who are still a part of my life. 

For the last year I haven't had health insurance. So I've been on and off of the meds that allowed me to function. My best friend has died during this time. He inspired me and held me in an esteem that nobody else ever will. His love made me feel so much more safety and value and now he is gone forever.

After a couple of attempts and some self injuring behaviors, I'm afraid of losing control. The loneliness has taken hold and once the walls are up it is very hard to bring them back down. Not sure what to expect by posting here, just really need to vent. 

My artistic  has disappeared with much more of my identity. Fun and joyful experiences have faded. It feels like I have nothing to look forward to. Life has just become something far from what I've expected and I've let myself down in so many ways.

I have reached out for help many times. Nothing has really panned out recently which is an additional challenge. This week I've finally got insurance so I can get some treatment but even the idea of revisiting the pain is very intimidating.
