Looking for a purposeI don't get it. It feels like my life has no meaning. I was really unstable for most of this year and now I'm probably the most "sane" I've ever been. But the only purpose I could find the only thing that made me push through the B's was my friends and now that they're gone it feels like I'm without purpose. There's nothing I really want to do. No dreams or ambition's. It makes me sad.
