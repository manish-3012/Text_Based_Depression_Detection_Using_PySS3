i have no reason to be alivei'm going to rant here, as to not bother or burden my friends and family, i'm not worth wasting their time lol. thankful for places like this. 

but anyway, the more i think about it, the more i realize i actually have no reason to be alive. i wanna die, i hurt myself, i feel depressed and anxious all the time, i get in the way, i have no clear talents...i could go on and on about it. but it truly feels like as time i goes on, i find less reasons to live. i wish it were the opposite, but it isn't. 

and i feel fucking selfish, because my family provides me with everything i need, and i feel so ungrateful. and that's another reason dying would be good, they wouldn't have to spend money on me, or waste their valuable time on me, or worry about me anymore. 

but anyway, how are you all? if anybody wants to talk, i'm all ears. feeling like this sucks. so, if anybody wants somebody they don't know to talk to, i'm all ears
