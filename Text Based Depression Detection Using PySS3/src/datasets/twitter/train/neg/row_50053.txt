Pointless titleI spent 5 hours today stranded on my local public transportation system. Why would anyone do that? Well, because I'm poor. I can't afford a car, and I have to work or I won't be able to afford such niceties as food and housing. This isn't even an odd event. It happens frequently. This is the punishment I have to deal with for being poor. I have to spend 5 hours getting to and from my 8 hour, low paying job because our culture requires it of me. My only other option is to take a shot at homelessness. I've considered it.

What exactly is the point to spending 13.5 hours a day (half hour unpaid lunch) busting your ass doing something you absolutely hate? Is this a life worth living? A life devoid of options and opportunities? What is the point to living a life if the only way our culture will allow that life to be led is by spending almost all of your time doing something you hate? Why do that?

Anyone who tells you hard work is rewarded is delusional. We should all be lucky enough to die in our sleep tonight.
