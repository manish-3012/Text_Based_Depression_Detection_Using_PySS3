I donâ€™t want to hear about famous suicidesI was doing well mentally and I thought I was getting better but now Iâ€™m crashing back down

I want to die tonight, ever since I heard the news itâ€™s all I can think about. Even when I think Iâ€™m enjoying myself I just think about how easy it would be for me to kill myself and how much better everyone else would be when I die

I donâ€™t want my family to have to find my body but I think that their lives would be so much better when Iâ€™m gone

I donâ€™t know what to do
