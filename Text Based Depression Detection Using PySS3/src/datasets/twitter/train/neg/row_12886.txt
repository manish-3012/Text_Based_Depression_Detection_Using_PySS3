Bye byeeWhat a fcking joke of a life. Nice attempt at college ruined bc of autism. Jeej i dont take anything seriously thats why i kill myself bc my life didnt matter bc no choice was ever thought out. I never actually tried to achieve anything bc i was going to kill myself anyways. Why try if you have a decade long depression. Now i have officially quit college and everyone keeps judging me, making bad remarks, making me look like an annoying drunk. IM DONE. Theres nothing to live for.
