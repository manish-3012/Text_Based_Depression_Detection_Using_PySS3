Want to dieI've posted here a few times in the years I've been on Reddit. Using a throwaway now.

I remember the first time was just general depression, the second was losing a girlfriend, and the third, was again, just wanting to die.

Now here I am with a lost girlfriend. We were in a long distance relationship, as I tend to be in all the time. I always wind up moving, or some such, and trying to make it work.

The first girlfriend was no big deal, looking back. We had no future that we could see, I guess I was just afraid of losing her.

Now, with this long distance relationship, she'd been really distant for awhile, we weren't talking often. Later on, I had people telling me about another guy, and I found her Tumblr. and she has someone else she's calling "her man"

I think I'm done for. I thought I had a future, but I don't.
