Why is suicide a such a negative thingOkay hear me out,

I didn't choose to be here. I didn't bring myself into this life. I think having children should be considered the selfish act. Look at the state of the world right now and people want to bring innocent babies into this world. 
 Sometimes I feel slight resentment toward my mom for having me. My entire life I've struggled not knowing how to be happy. Suicide is something that's been on my mind for a long time now. I feel like it's inevitable I'll die by suicide but when is the question. When I finally hit that extra level of low I never knew was there I think I'll just poof, vanish. Living for everyone else is a really shitty, exhausting feeling. 

So why is it such a bad thing if it's my own life to end? Yes they'll miss me but clinical depression in my mind is far worse... I can't seem to beat these demons, they keep coming back to haunt me.. 
I just want to be out of my misery at this point. I'm just so incredibly tired
