I'm on the edgeI am damaged goods. I was abused and raped by a boyfriend almost three years ago. I kept going back. I fucking deserved it. Now I can't trust anyone. I'm ruining the best relationship I have ever hoped for. He's incredible. I've pretty much already ruined it. Because every mistake he's made, I've thrown it back in his face. I don't trust anyone. I can't. I can't betray myself. I can't live like this. Someone fucking help me

edit: I'm not still with the abusive one.
