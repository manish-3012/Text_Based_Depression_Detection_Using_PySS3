Im so sick of myself, i feel like a waste of humanIm not so good at expressing myself but i am dealing depression over a year now. And i never felt like i made a progress whenever i thought i was getting better the next day i am feeling my agony again. Im just so done with this mood swings and suicidal thoughts whenever im feeling down. I dont have anyone to talk about myself besides my parents but i bother my parents too much with my same problems. I sometimes feel like im just a burden to them. I am so lonely whenever i try to make friends i end up losing them. I never felt loved either which is what im craving. I usually think maybe im the problem maybe if i end this i would be fine. I let  myself down too many times. Im not such person to give up easly but this emptiness, loneliness and my thoughts are so hard to handle. Things only got worse. All i do is sit and try to get by. And try not to end it but im just a coward who scare of death. I wanted to pour my thoughts. I have been holding them for so long it hurts my chest.
