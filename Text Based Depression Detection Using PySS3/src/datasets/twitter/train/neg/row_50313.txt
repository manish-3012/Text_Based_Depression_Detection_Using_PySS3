What the fuck should I title this stupid shit I'm about to write?!I'm so sick of living. 
I'm so sick of being here.
I'm so sick of breathing.
I'm so sick of feeling my heartbeat.
I'm so sick of feeling like everything is piled up on top of my chest.

I'm at the point where I just don't give a fuck about shit. I'm done with living. I'm done with breathing. I'm so over being around. Maybe part of me wants help and that's why I'm posting here or maybe I just need to say bye to someone even if it is a bunch of strangers. 

My heart is racing so fast, I'm ready to let go. Goodbye.
