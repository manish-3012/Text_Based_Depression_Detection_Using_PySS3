HelpI just took 7 sleeping pills (over the counter so they probably wont do anything) because I saw the man I love is now in a relationship super long distance with a chick from Canada who he apparently left me for. 

I really need someone to talk to. Really badly. 

Please tell me I'll be ok. Someone, anyone. I have no one.
