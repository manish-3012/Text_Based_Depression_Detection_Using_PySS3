It's just one of those days.I'm getting pretty sick of hurting myself over someone that has already moved on. It has only been a few months, but the feeling has only grown. I kept telling myself the same pathetic phrase of "it getting better", but it hasn't. Waking up everyday feels like I'm being executed by a firing squad and I'm just so sick of it. Nobody gives a solitary fuck of what I have to say. "Looks like Nick is having his daily routine of acting like a complete bitch, it's nothing important." Don't worry, my existence won't annoy anyone anymore once I'm gone. I wish things hadn't ended the way they did; I wish there was another way, but I made up my mind. I have already proceeded on with it and there's no going back. I guess best friends doesn't mean forever afterall.
