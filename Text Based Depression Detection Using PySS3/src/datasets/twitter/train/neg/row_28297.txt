I'm terrified, but I think it will soon be time for me to go.I hope it hurts, and I hope it's a slow torturous death. I hope I cry like a bitch, and I hope I find myself regretting killing myself at the very end. I hope it's punishment enough.

Fuck me, I believe in the existence of hell, and if there is where I'll go then fuck me again. 

Death is sad, and scary, and honestly, I do not want to die yet. What a miserable life it was, it had its good moments, I guess, I'll go out thinking about those.

I don't want to hurt my family, but I want to talk to them. It's perplexing. I don't want to inconvenience or hurt anybody, but the thought of dropping dead alone, with nobody to talk to, terrifies me. People want you to talk, then they shut you up, and then they want you to talk, but they want you to say only what they want to hear. If you do not, then you are hurting them and being selfish, because yeah that's how it works. Poor you, but fuck me, I guess.

I'm tired that at the beginning I was manipulated to come to a place I did not want to come, study something I never wanted to study, part with people I would have rather not parted with, deal with a dysfunctional home situation, etc. And now, years later, I fucking hate myself because I became this sort of twisted piece of shit I cannot stand, a liar, a fucking useless human being who would rather die than keep falling into this fucking pit of shit I find myself neck-deep in.

Hopefully, I have the balls to off myself, if not then I'll just run away and make sure I'm not found, which is as far as those around me are concerned, the same as me dying.

Good riddance.
