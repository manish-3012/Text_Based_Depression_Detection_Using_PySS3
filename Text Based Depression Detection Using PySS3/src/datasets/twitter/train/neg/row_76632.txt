Why is suicide a bad thing?I'm not going to lie, I am scared. But every part of me truly believes that this is the best thing I can possibly do for the world.

No one will be affected by this. I don't have any friends to speak of. I don't have any family members who I've talked to in years. I don't have any significant contributions to my work or to other people or to the world at large.

I've heard everything from "push through, it'll get better" to "you'll never know how happy you can be if you cut it too early". But honest question: why?

Why would I want to? Every second being alive is another second of suffering. I hate it here. No promise of some magical happy distant future will ever make the present worth it. No one will be impacted by my death. Why should I stay alive?
