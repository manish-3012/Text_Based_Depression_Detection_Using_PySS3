Suicide-freeThank you everyone here for not shaming against those who are suicidal. The connection &amp; knowing someone truly understood and felt what I was going through means the world to me. I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you to the people of this sub for helping me get past my suicidal thoughts. 

After having no direction for my life, drug problems and being made homeless I've managed to get a job, I'm no longer homeless and I'm going to university to study to become a paramedic, which work will give me time off for. 8 months sober.

The only downside is that I still don't see my 2 year old daughter because her mother won't let me; but you know, I dont blame her because of the person I used to be. Maybe in a few years or when she's older she will come to understand. Or perhaps not, who knows. 

You can turn it all around guys. The thing that sparked it for me when I was talking to someone from this sub they said "if you're gonna do it, try living your life doing things you wouldnt have dreamed of doing or are too scared to do, help people... fuck a prostitute... Its never too late to change"

And that's what truly resonates with me. It's never too late to change. 

If any of you are in England and wanna inbox me, I can give you my number or we can just have a chat. If you're homeless like I was I can help the best I can; I just want you to know I'm here for you guys like you were for me.

Thank you all &lt;3
