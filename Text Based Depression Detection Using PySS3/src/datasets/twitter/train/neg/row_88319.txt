Made an appointment for counseling today.I posted my situation here a few weeks back. [LINK](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rjc10/no_idea_what_to_do/) Just wanted to give an update.

I'm still here and I made an appointment today to go for counseling.

I can't beat this on my own.  I've always considered myself strong and thought I could fight through anything but for the last 5 years life has gotten steadily heavier and I gotta do something.  It scares me that as I lie in bed at night I think of suicide every single night.  I'm not ready to quit fighting yet.

Wish me luck folks.
