myspaceso i was looking through some old myspace posts. yes i know what your thinking "myspace *really*?" but its the only way i can keep in contact with some of my family. and i get this notification about a comment and when i look at it, its someone telling my brother that he should commit suicide. and im just sitting there shocked that someone could do that when hes in that much pain....

EDIT when i said something to them they replied something along the lines of "go back to your hole you little rat" 
my only thoughts were "wow a disney reference..." if you have never seen the movie ratatouille you wouldnt understand, the rats name is remmy and thats what my bro calls me
