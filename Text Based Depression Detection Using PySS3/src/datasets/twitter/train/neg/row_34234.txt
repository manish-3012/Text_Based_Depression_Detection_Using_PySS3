Just got kicked out of highschool, canâ€™t stop contemplating.I just got kicked out of my online highschool program. It was the easiest program for school Iâ€™ve ever been in and I still failed. I didnâ€™t do my work. I was lazy. Iâ€™m a failure. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll graduate now. I canâ€™t stop thinking how much easier it would be if I just killed my self. It doesnâ€™t seem worth it anymore.
