Not in any grave danger, just... could use some encouragement.I have OCD and depression. I just change my meds a few weeks ago, this seems to be working far better. But today was bad, so some kind words would be nice, for me now and to look back on, and for anyone in similar spots. Thanks for the time.

I just... It's just unnatural to be able to rationalize one's own worthlessness so quickly. When I'm alright, I don't think that way, but- what does a person even offer? My parents have my brother, I have no friends really, and my fiance could find another girlfriend. The only think I want to do in life is write, and no one's going to suffer massive heartbreak over a few never-written novels.

And it just takes a few seconds too... I can be fine, downright chipper, and the wrong word, or tone, or anything really, has me thinking that it doesn't really matter. I've never gone far with the suicidal thoughts or plan- just end up scratching my hands, biting fingers and pulling hair. My skin's quite fair, so some of the marks are looking permanent. 

I'm religious too, Catholic, so that should put in some weight for the don't hurt yourself / suicide is bad. And it used to, but I can even ignore God if I'm not alright, and I'm not one to do that. I just shut down over stupid thinks, like light scolding or even a joke I took too seriously.

I'm looking into getting a new therapist, the first two I had just seemed more mildly interested than anything. I know it's their job, and it might get boring after a while, I even excuse them for a session or two-- but when all I do is feel inferior and try to prove to them that I'm intelligent, or want them to at least care as much as a doc should for a patient, it isn't helping.

Again, thanks for reading, thanks for your time. God Bless you all, *hugs* for everyone.
