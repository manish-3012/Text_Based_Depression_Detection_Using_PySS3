Don't know where I'm going with this but okay.So, first things first, some background info:
1.) 16 years old, high school senior.
2.) Nonbinary, they pronouns only, please.
3.) I'm a part of a trauma-based multiple and median system. That means that because of ongoing abuse, I have developed several other ~identities~ (the others are people too, please don't call them identities) to help me cope with the situation.

Moving on, we're suicidal. We can't tell anyone (/ongoing/ abuse), and we don't really want to. There is nothing we particularly want to do, nobody we love or couldn't emotionally detach ourselves from. We used to have some different goals and ideas, and when we have manic episodes, we still do. But it's not enough. We're tired, apathetic, lonely, etc., etc.

So, I don't know, what keeps non-mentally ill people going? What keeps our fellow neurodivergent people going? What did you have to do to find a reason to stay alive? 

Please don't feel obliged to respond to this, I'm not currently at risk of committing suicide. Just feel like shit.
