Why can't I think of any option but suicideI am unemployed at the moment I've been living on the little bit of money I had saved up for quite a while now and it's almost out and I can't seem to bring myself to get another job that I've applied to a few but the only kind of jobs I'm going to end up getting our terrible I don't want to be a McDonald's cashier for the rest of my life and that's all I'm qualified for I'm 27 years old and I have no training to be anything but a general laborer or a cashier or something like that and no matter what I do I can't pass test or study or do the kind of things you need to actually make something of yourself that and I'm so socially awkward and a messed-up person that I feel like I have no chance of ever being anything but alone so I don't see what the point of living is when I'm going to be alone and a failure forever and I really don't believe I'll ever be anything but a failure.as dumb as it is I think of the characters from big bang theory you know they were socially awkward and couldn't find girlfriend stuff like that they had phds in at least had a fulfilling career I feel like I'm those people but without the intellect or careers he said they were depressed as hell just being alone I mean I know these are they are TV characters but still it resonates with me.

I pretty much just spend all day thinking about suicide and the thought of that now I need to get a job is making it even worse when I have a job I have anxiety every night before I go to sleep and I can't get to sleep because I'm dreading the day of work ahead of me regardless of what I'm doing and it's getting worse now that I know my money is running out and I'm going to need to get one soon
