I am stuck in the darkest recesses of my mind and all I see is nothingI've posted recently, again and again, and now it seems there isn't a single person out there that cares. My pain is throwing me into panic attacks, fits of rage, and I don't know what to do with no one to talk it through.

I feel alone, I don't even know if it would matter if I was gone
