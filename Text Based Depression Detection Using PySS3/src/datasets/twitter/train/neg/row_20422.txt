Suicidal thoughts in past 24 hours after stopping ElavilI was prescribed Elavil for neuropathic pain on Monday. The medication made me fatigued and weak the entire week. Yesterday I obtained a second opinion from a different doc who advised me to immediately stop taking Elavil. 

I complied but since this morning my head is filled with suicidal thoughts. I have never contemplated suicide before. I am alone at home right now and I certainly won't act on these thoughts. But I want to be rid of these bad thoughts. How do people manage?
