Wtf is the pointI live in the US. Trump never had any place to call anywhere else a "shithole country" because he and his cult have made this place is an absolute dumpster. I hate being brown. I hate living here. I hate all of this on top of life long unrelated traumas. Nothing can change. There is no point.
