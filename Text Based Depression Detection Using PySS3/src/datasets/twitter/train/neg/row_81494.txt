lost a friend today. how do i kill myselfim 13 and my parents are pretty strict

i think i have trust issues and i was curious if one of my best friends were fake because they said they were 'using' someone and i couldnt tell if they were joking. anyways, she found out. i fucked up. what's the most painless way to just leave?
