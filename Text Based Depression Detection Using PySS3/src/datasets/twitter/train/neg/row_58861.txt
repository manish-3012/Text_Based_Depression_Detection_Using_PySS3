that feeling of hopelessness and worthlessnessi managed to hold a job for a while after nearly a year of jobhunting, and now im on month 4 of jobhunting again. it genuinely feels like such a waste of fucking time to be spending 3-4 hours a day, day in day out, trying to keep up appearances in letters or emails or interviews trying to prove im worth hiring more than the next guy and then hearing fuck all back. 

and its not that i need money, im financially stable. i just need something to do. sitting around effectively eating money just so i can live long enough to earn money doing some job i dont care about  (already applied to and been rejected from the fields i want to work in) 

whats the point in working towards getting a job if i dont care about the work or the money? i already own the things i need to do the hobbies i enjoy, and if i dont get the job, the hobbies and food and rent and electricity and water and gas bills all burn through that rainy day fund ive been falling back on for effectively over a year? 

i dont have any reachable goals, the hobbies become less and less exciting and fun the more i do them, i dont have anyone to look after, and my life could fit behind a screen.  

any clue on how to feel worth something or hopeful again? or excited? i just feel more numb, the more pointless things i do.. 

life right now is just wake up, shower, breakfast, jobsearch stuff for a reasonable time, game for a chunk of time, eat , sleep.
