Turd already starving myself. I hope it will succeed this timeI already almost starved myself a few years ago. I was hospitalized because my blood sugar was low enough to be deadly. Never completed high school, skipped most days in elementary and middle school, never had ONE friend, kissless handholdless hugless virgin, depressed, PDD-NOS, learning disability, probably schizoid personality disorder, had horrible parents, and have wanted to die for a DECADE now.

Tell me normies, why should I bother trying when life is completely unfair and I never stood a chance of living a happy existence? What reason, what false hope do you have to offer, to convince me not to slowly starve myself until this awful life ends.
