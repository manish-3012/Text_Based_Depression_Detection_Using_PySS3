12 hours to make decisionsI'm going to be going back to college later tonight, though I'm reluctant about doing so. The student part of me wants me to just go back to school and be ready for class on Monday, but the other part of me feels that I'm going to feel more overwhelmed than I can handle.

Campus police have been rather rough with me, in my opinion, to say the least. I have chronic depression and/or possibly other mental disorders. I don't want to go back to campus because it sets off a lot of mental triggers in my mind. Certain locations or sounds trigger me. I tend to panic whenever I hear walky-talkies because I feel like campus police are after me, even if the walky-talkies I hear are only from custodians or other staff. I avoid sleeping on the left side of my head because campus police tackled me down to bring me to a mental hospital and I hit the left side of my head on the concrete fairly hard. I still have bruises/scars from that incident even though it was awhile ago. Laying down and having pressure on that part of my head just causes me to visually and audibly play out that event in my head.

I'm not quite fond of the police department at my school due to those events as well as other events. If I go back to campus, I don't want to die or commit suicide there. I just don't like the idea of campus police poking around my corpse. But I don't really want to die, and I don't want to drop out of college or take medical leave either especially near the end of the academic term. I just want to actually enjoy my college experience and life in general.

I don't even have a full day to know what to do. I'm considering writing wills and suicide notes just in case because I just don't know how things will play out.
