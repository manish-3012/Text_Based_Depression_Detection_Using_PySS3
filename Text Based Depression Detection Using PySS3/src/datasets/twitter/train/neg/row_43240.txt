Everything is great but..I can't help but to think about committing suicide. I keep telling myself that im happy but i have that feeling inside my head that keeps telling i should just end it all. I finally met a wonderful girl but something keeps telling me that it wont workout and i wont meet anyone else. Im close to finishing up school but that voice keeps telling me ill fail. I keep telling myself ill just end up in a dead end job and never amount to anything. I hate this fucking voice and how.it makes me feel and just want it to stop.
