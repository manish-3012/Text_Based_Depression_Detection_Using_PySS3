My last year.Never had love. Never had happiness. Never had enjoyment. And I know i never will... I turned 27 in January.. I'm so useless, hideously repulsive and unlovable.. I'm not sticking around to turn 28. Some point need the end of this year I'm going to take my own life. No one will care anyway.
