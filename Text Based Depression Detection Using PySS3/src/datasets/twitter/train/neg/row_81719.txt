Iâ€™m going to dieIm ready to give up. Iâ€™ve fought so hard to get better. I honestly want to die - Iâ€™ll be better off else where. I know my death would cause so much pain to my family and friends but I need to think of myself for once. 
And anyway, people say theyâ€™re happy if your happy, and Iâ€™m happy dead.
I have thought long and hard about ending it all. Suicide is on my mind all the time but going through with it is different. But I think next week is my time.
Reaching out and talking to people has done nothing for me. Iâ€™ve tried getting better. But I guess Iâ€™m just not meant to.
I donâ€™t want the people I care about to be in the same pain I feel but I have no other choice
Waking up each day, going on with my life, faking my smile is to exhausting and I canâ€™t continue it anymore.
Iâ€™ve just gone back to school and there is no way Iâ€™m surviving. So even if my attempt doesnâ€™t work, it will for sure not be the last.
