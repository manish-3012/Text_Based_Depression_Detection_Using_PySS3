Money doesnâ€™t mean shit. I still have zero fucking purpose or happiness. Life is suffering.Spent my entire fucking childhood in hospitals due to physical illness. Spent my entire adolescence in hospitals due to mental illness.

Iâ€™m now 20. Over 300k in my bank account from investing the 25k I saved up. I can literally live off the interest from putting it into an ETF and barely ever need to work.

But none of that means shit. Money doesnâ€™t mean shit. I sit in the corner of my room on my bed every few days and fucking break down over how lonely I feel every waking hour. 

I havenâ€™t properly been outside to meet up with another person in over a year because, not only do I not have anyone, the anxiety is too severe now. I can manage 5 minutes outside to get groceries but only at night or whenever nobodies around.

My days for the past year have consisted of spending up to 12 hours on reddit on multiple accounts giving people advice and general answers to questions to feel like maybe I have a shred of fucking purpose in life.

But that doesnâ€™t fix the constant loneliness. Neither does the money. Neither fixes the constant anxiety from simply being outside. Or the crippling feeling of just wanting to fucking end the daily suffering.

The only close family member I have is dying. The only person whoâ€™s made me feel like life has some worth to it is leaving.
