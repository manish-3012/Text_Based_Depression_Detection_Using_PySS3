BullshitI see a lot of graphically detailed posts on here Iâ€™m just gonna share my point of view. Who do people walk around interested in life when nothing matters? Iâ€™m expected to go to school and work in order to sustain myself but why? I heard a report about a government official speaking about galactic federations. Thereâ€™s no way weâ€™re the only ones here and weâ€™re just so small and little that nothing we do ever matters. And thatâ€™s what makes it hard, not that Iâ€™m sad or I wanna die but just the fact that all our stresses and fears are stupid, not just that but  our whole existence is such a small insignificant period in an insanely large time line. Weâ€™ll be here and gone before we know anything. I can strive my whole life to my successful and happy and on the off chance I do what then? I get to have the perfect family and be comfortable with my money? We have to give up our priceless time in order to make money. Something made by us that has divided us unlike anything else. Our emotions arenâ€™t important at all. So why am I having these shitty emotions all the time when Iâ€™m significant. It pisses me the fuck off when I think about it, and sadly, itâ€™s all I think about. I look at myself in the mirror and I see nothing. I look at what I own and I see nothing. I try to look in the future and picture myself and I can see nothing. Iâ€™ve lost interest in anything I have ever loved. I never missed a ball game a few years ago and now I canâ€™t sit through one without falling asleep. Itâ€™s like I have 5 options in this life, be toxic, sleep, eat, work, study. Nothing is fun anymore, nothing is worth it anymore. It just sucks thatâ€™s all.
