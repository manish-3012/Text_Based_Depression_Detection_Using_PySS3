Would you want to know if someone close to you is going to commit suicide?I'm gonna kill myself in 19 days. My parents are going to be out of town that weekend, and I don't know if I should call them and say goodbye before I do it, or do it and have the police or whoever contact them. 

If you were my parents, what would you prefer?
