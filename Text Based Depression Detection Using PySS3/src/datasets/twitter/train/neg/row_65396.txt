fucking help mei dint eveb have the fucjing energy to type this i am so tired. keeping it short 

1) i hate who ive become, constantly wanting to change for the better but also constantly going back to square 1. just want to slit my wrist and bleed it out. got 2 pen knives in my bag everywhere i go just in case and i dont have the self restriction not to use it anymore.

2) judgements. back in my old sch the teachers kept an eye out for me everywhere i went. the story is i kept coming late to school about 40 times but it wasnt intentional. i had panic attacks and had to take time to breathe properly again and it's hard to be at a bus stop wanting to cry ur eyeballs out feeling like death and not dash across the road. whatever this story doesnt fucking matter no one knows and no one has to.
now in my new sch i thought this wiuld change maybe this bad rep for coming late wouldnt stick but lately ive had 0 motivation for sch. skipped sch 3 times without my mom knowing and other days im late. i dont want to be late but it just feels like perhaps im taking it too slow. and lately teachers have been complaining i look lethargic and told me i dont have to attend classes if i dont want to be there. fuck, i'm not lethargic im fucking exhausted and no i dont want to be in urfucjing lecture i wna be buried 6 feet deep. fuck

3) does it ever get better. grew up witnessing abuse, am a victim of mental and emotional abuse. fuck it this sounds like a fucking pity party im sick of myself.

4) just 1 more push and tell everyone i fucking hated them when i was alive
