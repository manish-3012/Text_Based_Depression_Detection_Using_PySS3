Giving God an ultimatumI'm a 17 year old guy, single, homeschooled, "Christian", and I'm screaming inside. I fucking hate myself and I don't understand why God hasn't killed me yet. 

I read all these blogs and posts where the advice is to go see a professional or talk to someone close to you, but I'm only 17, still at home, and no way to privately contact a professional for help. I can't talk to anyone in my family or the few friends I have because I'm terrified of being treated differently. 

Last night I carefully planned out how I could attempt to kill myself and if I succeeded then I would know that God had given up on me and if I didn't then at least everyone would finally know what I'm dealing with. 

I know it's incredibly foolish to challenge God, but at this point I honestly don't care anymore.
