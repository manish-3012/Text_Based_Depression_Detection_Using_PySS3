Iâ€™m tired of livingI donâ€™t understand why I continue to go on like this knowing that I hate life. I donâ€™t have anyone that I really feel like understands me or can help me? I take meds and they just give me this false satisfaction and I hate it so much. I donâ€™t know what to do and for the past few weeks Iâ€™ve been flipping a coin to see if I should kill myself. If it lands on tails I donâ€™t and it lands on heads I do, this is the first time it landed on heads.
