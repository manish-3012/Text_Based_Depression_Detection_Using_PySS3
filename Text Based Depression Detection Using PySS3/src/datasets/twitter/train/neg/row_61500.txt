Unsure if childhood memory was an attemptTo preface this, I'm doing better nowadays, and I also have noted problems with repression, denial, dissociation, and time loss/amnesia, so... I was not especially surprised when I remembered this. 

There was some trauma and some abuse, and my life was really being twisted up, and I was just 9 years old... probably nearly 10? I had taken to self-harm via watching hardcore porn to recreate the abuse further. I hated myself so much. Everything was kept secret. I didn't know it was even abuse, back then. I thought I was going to grow up to be a rapist. I didn't want to hurt anybody. I thought I would mercy-kill myself. End it now, before other people saw my true, sinful colors... I thought, my mom will really be happy, she'll think much better of me after my death now, rather than if I grow up and become a rapist. I thought, rapists deserve death, I'm destined to become a rapist. I should go now, before I hurt anyone. I didn't want to be around my abuser anymore, it hurt, but I couldn't leave her... I was just scared, really. I was NINE! 

The house was empty and I took mug and filled it with Drano and I sat down in front of the toliet and fully intended to drink it... then my memory winks out. I clearly didn't die. I think I stared at it for a long, long while. Then I blocked out the entire event, and only remembered it a few months ago, while I was journalling about the abuse and I started getting flashbacks of this event. 

Before anyone asks, yes, I'm in therapy :P

Was that an attempt? I've been calling it a "suicide attempt-attempt", as in, I attempted to attempt suicide. But... replace the acid with a gun, and suddenly "I took it in my hands and was trying to hype myself up to do it" seems much clearer, that's a suicide attempt. But... oh, I don't know. If I didn't actually move to drink it (though I did pour it out), is that still an attempt? If not, what is it?
