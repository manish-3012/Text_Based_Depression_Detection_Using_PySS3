Barely 21 and Nothing Left to LoseI just recently turned 21 in January. I honestly never thought I would last this long. I never thought I could make it to 18. From age 6-13 I was molested and raped. I felt as though I had no self worth. I found out around 15, I have bipolar disorder and anxiety though.

I was always depressed when I was younger. Always trying to off myself. Over the years Iâ€™ve tried over 30 times. I hated myself, I seen no reason to live. When I was 18, I met this older guy in his 50s. He is a Dom, he practically took me in and molded me. This man, he enjoys girls like me. He takes them, drugs them up and exploits them.  Recently because of this man, I am now facing up to 40 years in prison because of a sex charge.

I havenâ€™t lived my life but Iâ€™ve pretty much lost it already. Iâ€™m in school to be a teacher, but that dream is killed. Iâ€™m out on bond. I canâ€™t be around the children in my family and I have nothing anymore.

He would drug me up and force me to watch illegal things and do things with other men. I remember one night I was whored out to over 30 men. I feel so worthless and degraded and used. He eventually left me for a skinnier girl who has a young daughter. Heâ€™s going to ruin them and they donâ€™t even know it.

Iâ€™m scared to tell the truth because I am so afraid of him and I hat he could do to my family or me. Iâ€™ve lost everything. My fiancÃ©e was the only thing keeping me together but Iâ€™ve lost him too tonight.

I donâ€™t think I can keep up the facade of having it together anymore. I donâ€™t want to live like this. I hate myself. I hate my life and I donâ€™t know how to fix things.

Iâ€™m not killing myself over these men. Iâ€™m just tired of being used. I just hope he gets the prison time Iâ€™m facing after Iâ€™m gone.
