My plan. (sorry for bad english) Okay, I have nothing more to live for, I have tried everything I can think of to make my life worth living but nothing has worked. about a month ago I decided to kill myself but I want it to make as little impact as possible for my family. 

 I came up with a one year plan to do as little damage as possible. briefly, I will slowly remove myself from their lives. take longer and longer for me to answer their sms / phone calls. Then I will inform them that I am moving abroad to help other people. where it becomes easier to distance from family and friends and easy to blame for poor connection. This means that I lose contact completely with my family and friends and can finally take my life. 

do you think this slow removal can make it easier for my family than just one day be dead? 

   
do you have a better plan or a serious opinion please comment.
