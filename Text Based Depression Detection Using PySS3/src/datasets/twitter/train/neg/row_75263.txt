Iâ€™m concernedThe other night I was sitting on the ledge of my porch (as I do). My porch is pretty high up, but wide enough to sit on so I like to go up there at night. Things were going normal until I got a sudden urge to jump. Not just an intrusive thought, this was an almost uncontrollable urge. I had to quite literally fight my body from pushing itself off. I was hit with an intense fear that I wouldnâ€™t be able to stop it and really struggled climbing off. It felt like I was almost taken over? Nothing like this has happened before. 

I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever actually commit. Ofcourse when Iâ€™m feeling low I consider it but doesnâ€™t everyone? But- my mom has a few attempts and even the idea of her feeling *that* low really shakes me- so I couldnâ€™t do that to my family. But now, Iâ€™m worried one of my dark moments will be it for me.

I feel itâ€™s important to mention that I donâ€™t think I have depression, I feel like a fraud every time that crossed my mind. Iâ€™ve seen real depression with my mom, and whatâ€™s going on with me is nothing near that severe. However Iâ€™ve been having *really* depressed phases lately. Anyways Iâ€™ve stayed away from my porch since then. I thought Iâ€™d share this here since I donâ€™t know what to make of it. Thanks for reading &lt;3
