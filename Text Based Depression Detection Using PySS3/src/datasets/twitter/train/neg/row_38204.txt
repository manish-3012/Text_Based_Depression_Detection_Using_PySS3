Haunted by thoughts of my ex and suicideMy ex and I broke up 4 months ago after an 8 month relationship. She was the first person I ever loved, and we broke up because we were bored. She instantly starts seeing another guy. I try, but nobody seems to be interested in me.

For the past couple months, I've had this reoccurring dream that I run into her and this guy, I see them, and they're in love. They're doing the same things we used to do. I would try to convince myself that they weren't actually in love cuz the guy is somewhat of a loser compared to me.

Last night I witnessed them in love. I can't stop thinking about it and suicide. The most comforting thought is putting a pistol against my head and pulling the trigger. I cannot stop crying. I think I'm going to actually do it. I have a history of depression but I've never felt this compelled to die. I don't know what to do.
