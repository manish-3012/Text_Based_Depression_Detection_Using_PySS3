my boyfriend broke up with me and my world is crumblingevery day is getting harder and harder. he was all i had, and now i dont have him anymore. he was a dick, and treated me like shit, but he has been the only one caring for me for a whole year. i dont know how to have friends. i miss him so much. he told me when we broke up, that i never was there for him, that i didnt love him. i never did anything else than loving him as much i can. am i such  garbage of a human, that i cant even make someone feel l loved. SOMEONE I LOVED MORE THAN MY MOTHER. i hate my fucking self. i wanna die.  i used to do a lot of molly, like 2g a day everyday for 2 months. this is maybe 1-2 months ago, and i crave it so much. my brain is so fucked up and i cant tell anyone how i feel because my parents have tried to help me so many times, but withour success, and it just gets worse and worse. 

im sorry for this grammar and all im just so sad and im seriously considering taking my own life. will an od hurt
