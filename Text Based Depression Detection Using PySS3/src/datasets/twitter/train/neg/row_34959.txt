How do I stop feeling like shit after being rejected?I dont get where I went wrong or what I did to deserve this. I'm 17 and I'm pretty sure I just found out the girl who I thought was into me a week ago isnt interested in me at all. She dropped so many positive hints last week and we hit it off but this week everything got fucked up and she hinted at having a bf already and friend zoning me. 

And this is right after my past gf broke up with me cause her parents are crazy after only seeing her for a month. 

Lost 2 perfect girls in the span of a couple months.

People have told me I'm decent or good looking but I know that I look like trash whenever I see myself in a pic. In very specific light I'll look passable but otherwise I'm hideous.

Literally everything else in my life is fine I just cant for the life of me find a girl who's interested in me while I'm also interested in them. I got good grades and a family that's well off, it's literally just the one aspect of life I can't succeed in while everyone else does it easily.

Is there anyone going through the same thing? I need to talk to someone because I cant handle this anymore. I'm always giving 100% and nobody else is.
