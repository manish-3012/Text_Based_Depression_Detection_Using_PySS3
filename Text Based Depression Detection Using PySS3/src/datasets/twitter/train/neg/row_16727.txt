Don't want to die but don't want to stayPost didn't go through last time, so I'm reposting this.

Anyway, flash forward to now and I'm just tired of feeling this way. I'm tired of always being the weird guy with low self esteem, who always feels uneasy around people and always looks angry or depressed.

All I really want in this world is to connect with others and find a good group of friends and hopefully a girlfriend. But no matter how hard I try, nothing seems to change. I've tried everything from meds, exposure therapy, meditation, diet, exercise, changing thought patterns. Nothing seems to work and I just don't have the energy anymore.

I really don't want to kill myself, but I just don't want to go on living like this. Some days I think that maybe I'm already dead and this is just hell for me. Obviously I don't want to leave my family with this burden and I know I'll be missed, but they, nor can anyone else truly understand what it's like to live like this.

Imagine always being uncomfortable in public settings, not being able to engage with others, and always being treated like you're different by those around you. This is my life and I'm done with it.

I'm not exactly sure how I'll do it, still figuring that part out so I won't get into the details. Thank you to anyone who read this whole thing, in another life maybe things could be different.

Goodbye, all.
