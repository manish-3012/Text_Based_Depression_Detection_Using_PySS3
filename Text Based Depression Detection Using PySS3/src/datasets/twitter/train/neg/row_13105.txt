JesterI'm just a fucking jester. everyone treats me like I'm here to provide for them, whether it be money, or advice, an opinion, or entertainment. and then, when i have something to say or start developing emotions, or just when I don't have any use for them anymore, then they throw me away until later. or they just abandon me. my dad left, my friends left, members of my family left. everyone leaves me at some point or another. I'm tired of being treated like everyone's court jester and personal punching bag. maybe when they find me with crosses sliced into my arms they'll finally take me seriously, but it'll be too late then.
