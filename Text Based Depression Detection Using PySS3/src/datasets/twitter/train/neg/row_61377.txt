Iâ€™m contemplating suicide.Throwaway Account.

I am contemplating suicide. 

I just donâ€™t see the point in life, what is the point if living life when itâ€™s so painful? Iâ€™ve suffered from depression all my life, looking back, I suffered with it from a very young age, I have a nephew who is turning 7 soon and it makes my stomach turn when I look at him, how can an innocent child have such thoughts of hopelessness and anxiety at that age. I didnâ€™t have a bad childhood but definitely a lonely one, I had my ass beat a few times by my brother which I think about sometimes but honestly nothing major. Iâ€™ve reached out for help and Iâ€™m currently on a waiting list for counselling that I referred myself for, 6 months waiting list and I have been put on medication from my MH nurse. 

Socially, Iâ€™m relatively normal, you wouldnâ€™t guess it looking at me as Iâ€™m often â€œlife of the partyâ€, quite chatty and have a lot of banter at work but when I come home, I am a broken person. Iâ€™ve had a lot of people in my life that have just thrown me away, Iâ€™ve always been quite disposable of a person, Iâ€™ve had things happen to me that shouldnâ€™t have, and Iâ€™ve knowingly let people take advantage of me and use me, probably because of my self-esteem. So many people have let me down and done shitty things to me that itâ€™s now apparent I am the problem, you canâ€™t go through life blaming other people, there must be a reason why it always happens to me. Nobody wants me and itâ€™s probably all my fault. Iâ€™ve had enough, Iâ€™ve been thinking about that a lot, I think the only people who would really care are my mum and dad, Iâ€™d leave them my savings and a letter explaining, theyâ€™d just be so much better off. 

I have had a lot of heart break lately, stress at work with a grievance I have put in about a member management bullying me, rejection. Iâ€™m a mess.

Iâ€™m not looking for advice, or pleas to not do it. I just needed a place to rant.
