I think this all might be futileIâ€™m not ever happy. Never been happy and I donâ€™t know what will make me happy. It feels like everything Iâ€™m working for is pointless. I feel like the only reason I even try anymore is just to prove to others that Iâ€™m not worthless. If i had it my way Iâ€™d be gone already, but I feel like Iâ€™d just be proving those people right if I did decide to just die. It seems like no matter what I decide to do here, itâ€™s the wrong choice.

Sorry if this doesnâ€™t make any sense, I just needed to vent somewhere.
