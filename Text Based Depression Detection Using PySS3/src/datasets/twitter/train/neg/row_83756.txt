Started medication a couple days ago and I hate itI realise its meant to take a while for this shit to start working as intended and idk if its placebo but I already feel emotionless as fuck.

I can't really describe it but it feels as though my brain is frazzled. Like the day after an acid trip.

Idk man, I was really holding out for this stuff to work and I don't want it to be a dud because it's literally my last hope.
