Am I alone?So long story short, the past two years have been the toughest Iâ€™ve ever dealt with.  I tried to take my own life twice but thankfully had people who were able to talk me out of it. 

Anyways, Iâ€™ve been noticing that each time I deal with a bout of depression it seems harder to get back on track. This time is the toughest it has been. I pushed the last friend I had away last night, and I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll want to talk to me anymore. I tried messaging them, but havenâ€™t gotten a reply. 

This round of depression has been going on for a couple weeks now, and something is different with it. I donâ€™t feel like I can come out of this one in the same shape. I feel more defeated and lost than ever. Does it get harder to get back on your feet each time? Or should I be seeking better help soon?
