Sorry if this gets confusingOk so Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™ve shown way to many signs up being suicidal, depressed and a whole lot of other things, and yes every now and then I get these thoughts of just being gone and yadda yadda 

thatâ€™s not the point, I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m going to kill my self, but my friends are worried and Iâ€™m scaring them, my fsmily doesnâ€™t understand anything and Iâ€™m just a mess really

Iâ€™m sorry for rambling, what I really need help with is.

1. How do I find a healthy outlet

itâ€™s a long story and I donâ€™t want to bother everyone with it but Iâ€™m short Iâ€™m never seen with out a smile but it kills me because Iâ€™m never actually happy I just want others to be 

2. Am I mentally hurt? 

I keep streaks on Snapchat, although I donâ€™t really talk to half the people I just want to have that connect, an interaction with someone, regardless when I sent a streak the other day my friend called me worried about my well being, apparently every now and then when I send these streaks It seems to be a call for help, an example would be a picture of a few of my stress balls and me saying â€œIâ€™m going to need more :(â€œ you get the jist 

And finally 3. Is craving social interaction so wrong? 

I donâ€™t know why, I just need it and it causes me to be the butt of every joke and it hurts me deeply, I canâ€™t go to my parents because they joke about me constantly, sexuality (straight but they think [want?] other wise) and bunch of other stuff, I just want to be cared about and not attacked by everyone 

Iâ€™m sorry for this, I just want to talk to someone and I know Iâ€™m contradictory, I donâ€™t know. Writing these post I am helps me just a little
