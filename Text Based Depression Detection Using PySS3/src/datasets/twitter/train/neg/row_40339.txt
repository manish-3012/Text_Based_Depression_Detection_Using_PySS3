How do I tell a therapist that I'm suicidal without getting hospitalized?I really need help. I've been having these suicidal thoughts for a while now and I've been very close to killing myself many times about week ago I wrote a suicide not and I was going to take a bottle of pills but I didn't end up doing it and I still have the note. In my head I know that suicide isn't that answer but the thoughts are so intrusive and I can't control them, I also tend to make a lot of impulsive decisions. It's like I want to die but at the same time I don't and I feel really guilty for feel this way. I'm afraid that one of these days I'm going to actually attempt to kill myself and I'm going to succeed at it. I've been thinking about reaching out to the counselor at my college for help as my college offers free counseling and therapy for all student and that's the only way I can get professional help but I'm afraid to tell them about my suicidal thoughts because I'm afraid of what would happen if I do. I can't tell anyone else about it because I don't really have any supportive friends or family and if I tell  my parents they would just tell me that I'm being selfish and they would be more ashamed than concerned.
