Now It's My Turn To Leave.For once, before I go, I wanted to be true.

I was always described as too much. 

So much so that even the kindest, most understanding man that I can be with gave up on me. 

And I don't blame him. I made him miserable. I self-sabotaged and now our wonderful relationship is almost ruined. And it's all my fault. 

Looking at the city lights in front of me, in this building's rooftop, I realized how life would be unbearable without him in it. And I cannot fathom a day without him. 

I went and fought to live because of him. Because of a future that I wanted with him. I changed so much because of him. And for a while I was good. 

I loved myself around him. Calm, happy, contented. But my underlying traumas and manipulative tendencies pushed him to the edge until he cant breathe. 

And I cannot forgive myself for what I did. The only man who will ever, truly love me asked to stay away from me because I am hurting him. I couldn't be so low. 

I deserve this. For all the pain and hatred that I inflicted to all my loved ones, let me, with this small gesture, make things right. Please let me make this right. 

For john, who I loved the most in my life, I know you won't ever read this or will be able to read this. But I want to thank you for every single thing you did for me. For accepting and loving me as long as you possibly can, even if it hurts so much on your part. I love you, I appreciate you, and thank you for spending your precious time with me. I want you to be happy. It's not your fault. 

For my sister and everyone else, It's also not your fault. I love you more than words can ever say. Thank you for tolerating me and I'm sorry for the burden.  

I want to see the sunrise today. They say you treasure something the most if you know it might be the last time you'll ever experience it. 

I pray for you all to have a Life that is so so beautiful. I hope mine's next will be the same. 

thank you for reading.
