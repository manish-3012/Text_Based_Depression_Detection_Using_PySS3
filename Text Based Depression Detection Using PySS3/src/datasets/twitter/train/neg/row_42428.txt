ThanksThanks, /r/suicidewatch.

Yesterday, you taught me that people are evil; that everyone is the same, and that only women deserve love.  You do this through your actions, how you respond to people.

I learned that as a man, I am both responsible for everything in my life, as well as everyone elseâ€™s. I learned that we view men as gods, and shun them when they show weakness.

Thank you, you showed me the true side of people, that empathy is lie, that goodness is a lie, that deep down, all humans are the same. That men suffer silently because even here, you make them.
I learned I have no part in this society beyond the silent slave. I am so thankful to understand this so young, your shame has no effect on me any longer; shame only works when you were a part of the group to start. You all made sure that never happened. By you, I mean everyone Iâ€™ve ever interacted with, ever.

More than anything, I found it so fascinating how you all, everyone, is so adept at putting other's down; you all seem to understand the entirety of the universe, causality, humanity, everything, when it comes to another's problems, especially one you look down to, yet there is never any actual advice beyond "man up and shut up."  You'd think, if you all really were as knowledgeable as you pretend to be as you shout me down and insult me, that you could offer some of that insight.  How humbled I would be; but that doesn't exist, we know that, it's just insult, shout, demean, mock, laugh at dead body, wonder why, call them weak, cry.
