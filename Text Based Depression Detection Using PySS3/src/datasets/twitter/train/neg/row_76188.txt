i feel like ill never succeed.iâ€™m 16 and i never thought id even make it to 16 so i never did any school past 6th grade (was homeschooled) and i never got my permit/drivers licenses. i was pretty set on ending it before 16, but 2 months into being 16 here i am. 

ive started studying for both my ged and drivers licenses but i lack so much knowledge its making me want to say fuck it and give up like my original plan. i feel at any moment i will potentially kill myself. i feel like ill never succeed or be smart, i have no friends and no one to really talk to and im all alone. i applied for a job and i didnt show up to orientation because it was too stressful, i cant do it and i feel like ill never be able to do anything. i feel like ill never amount to anything no matter how hard i try. i read the entire handbook for my permit and it asked a few questions at the end and i didnâ€™t know a thing, i tried so hard and actually put effort into studying and i feel so stupid im ready to give up. 

i know this might be something so small to you or to other people but the fact that im still here at 16 when i thought i wouldnâ€™t be and not being able to do anything or succeed at anything makes me wanna give up and not even try anymore. what the point yanno? im absolutely alone and im so dumb and canâ€™t do basic things i genuinely want to kill myself.
