There's no point in trying anymoreJust that. No fucking point at all in trying. Life is so utterly pointless. There's no reason to keep on living. There's no reason to start climbing the mountain. Just let go. Fall into the abyss. It will suck for a little, but climing a mountain will suck for a long time, if you don't haphazardly fall into the abyss before reaching the top anyways. There's nothing at the top of the mountain. If you make it, there still isn't anything to look forward to.
