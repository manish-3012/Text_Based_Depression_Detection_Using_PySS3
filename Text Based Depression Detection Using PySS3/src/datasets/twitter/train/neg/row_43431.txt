didn't jumpthis is the story of what happened.

I planned out my suicide this whole month. I even had a calendar marking off the dates that went by with a big X. I tore off the rest of the dates after the 26th because that was the day I would finally do it. I quit my part time job, sold all my belongings. On the morning of the 26th, I left my money in an envelope next to my mom when she was sleeping. I wanted to pay her back for everything. 

I then headed towards the bridge, with the thought of ending it all. I was bullied throughout elementary, middle school, and never had anyone friends.. but the thing is, I was bullied because I used to be a bully when I was a kid. Things flipped on me and suddenly I was the one who got bullied. I wanted to end it all because I thought that the world didn't need me. But then on my way to the bridge, I met a girl who looked similar to a girl I bullied when I was a kid. Turns out, it was her. Back when I was the bully. Back when I had the power. Back when I laughed at the misery of others. Before I wanted to jump, I wanted to make amends with her because now I knew how it all felt. To cut it short, I talked to her. It wasn't easy, but to sum it up, she is the reason I decided to live. And I want to say, I will make it up to her for the rest of my life.
