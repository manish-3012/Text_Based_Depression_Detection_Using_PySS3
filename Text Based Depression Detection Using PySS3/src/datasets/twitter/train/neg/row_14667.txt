Inpatient or outpatient?? Experience?I need to go somewhere. Both options have been offered to me, but Iâ€™m really not sure which one to do. The outpatient place needs me to call them and Iâ€™m really struggling with that. And I know I would struggle just being able to get up and actually GO back each day. Makes me think inpatient would be a better option for me. But Iâ€™m not sure how to get there or who to talk to or what to bring.. when to go.. etc. all these questions really. 

Can anyone share their experience of either? And if you feel that it helped you at all?
