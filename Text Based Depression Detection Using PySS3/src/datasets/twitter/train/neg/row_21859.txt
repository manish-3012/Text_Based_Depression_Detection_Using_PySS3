yo fuck the internet just tell me how to die jesus christHoly fuck every single response to any question about suicide is a "dont do it" story. I look up methods to kill myself because my idea of the diving off a high up abandoned building is hard to do because it's hard to found a building high up enough to result in death instead of breaking my neck or legs and just being in pain. I guess I could just break a window,  I don't really need to be on a rooftop? Though I'm way too much of a pussy to both break a window AND jump off, let alone just the one. But also don't want to cause others trauma, so it was going to be a mostly abandoned building. If I lived near those chinese ghost cities that would be perfect.

I don't even having fucking depression I'm literally just an odd lonely-ass motherfucker who has sick thoughts that I wish I could stop thinking about. Kind of feels like an insult to people with depression, but even if I did have depression it's like 1/4 people in the world do too so who cares. 

Like, I'm googling for pills that kill you the quickest instead of just slowly giving you liver cancer or whatever it is like Tylenol apparently does if you down a whole bottle. Right now tryna switch my method to pills or some kind of any household object. If there's a bottle of some kind of pill that takes 1 minute to guaranteed kill me that be fucking amazing.
