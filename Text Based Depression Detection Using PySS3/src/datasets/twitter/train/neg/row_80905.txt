I won't commit it but I can't lie, I really wanna dieI will keep on living and stuff but whenever something happens to my body (can't breathe well, a sudden tingling in an arm) I feel a bit happy because it makes me think that I might be dying soon, only to feel a bit disappointed when I realize that this I was just having asthma symptoms or that the tingling was because I leaned too hard on my arm.
