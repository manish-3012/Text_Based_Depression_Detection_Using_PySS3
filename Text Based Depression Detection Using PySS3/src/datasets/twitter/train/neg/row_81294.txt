How do I stop Self Harming? (TW)I was told by the people on r/tooafraidtoask that the people here might be able to give me better advice.

I have been on and off for about 3 years. It has been really bad lately as my life is currently falling apart. For these 3 years I have used it as a way to satisfy my urge to commit suicide. I never cut deep enough to leave a white scar, just pink ones. I want to stop, but I donâ€™t know how and it is not like I can ask anyone I know. I donâ€™t know how to stop without replacing it with another unhealthy thing.

I can provide more details if necessary.
I will answer questions, but only if they are helpful.
