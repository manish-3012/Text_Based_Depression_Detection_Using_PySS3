1/1/2020I think that is my go date. I cant live without my wife and kids. I cannot continue this life on. I love her. I love my kids. She walked out of me. Everyone thinks she may come back but I dunno. I am lonely. I am depressed. I am sad. I miss them. I didnt make a family for them to leave. I am tired of being alone every day. Despite her leaving I am still nice to her. I still help her. I cant any longer. I want to be out of this life. I want to die. I hope and pray every day I drive to and from work something happens and I die but now I have circled a date. Now to shut that voice off in the back of my head that says this is wrong so i can do it. I am done. I hope one day she finds this post.
