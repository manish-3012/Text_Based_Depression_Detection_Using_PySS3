I need to stop lying to myself.One of the main driving forces behind me still being here (other than not having access to a method I'm happy with) is that I keep telling myself "It'll get better!", "I'll be the kind of person I like to daydream of being!", etc.

I need to stop lying though.

I'm never going to have my best friend back.

I'm never going to experience love, intimacy, someone even *wanting* me.

I'm never going to fully fix my hunched over, deteriorated body.

I'm never going to get over the issues my childhood brought me (smacked, spanked, shouted at over basically anything that involved expressing myself).

I'm never going to be good at my only skill (coding).

I'm never going to be able to socialise with people.

I'm never going to get back all my teenaged years I lost to depression, the full on range of 13-19 was spent in this chair for 16 hours a day, every day.

The list goes on...

I just want to die. I'm always going to be behind other people, struggling to even resemble a normal person.

It's too hard to fix myself. I need to stop lying that I'll eventually be better. It's easier just to die.
