Iâ€™ve Gone HollowThe only reason Iâ€™m still alive is my younger siblings, but right now when I canâ€™t even see them, itâ€™s easy to forget what keeps me.  

People always had high expectations about me.  Itâ€™s like a weighted chain I wore around my neck.  High expectations but no tolerance for mistakes and eventually no faith in me.

Iâ€™m not even a person am I?  Iâ€™m just their problem.

I think...I think Iâ€™ve finally lost hope.  Iâ€™ll keep on living, but I donâ€™t think from this point forward that Iâ€™ll ever be truly happy again.  Iâ€™ve seen too much.  Felt too much.

Iâ€™m not even tired anymore.  Just apathetic.  Nothing but grey.

Most people wonâ€™t get it but fuck them I guess.  I hate to be like this but, Iâ€™ve never had the support I needed anyways.  Only what was convenient at the time.

This world is totally fucked.  Why do I have to feel guilty for saying that when itâ€™s self-evident.  Why do I have to feel guilt for trying to be who I am?

I gave it my best shot.  I really did.  Not that anyone ever fucking believed me when I told them.

Whether I kill myself or not doesnâ€™t matter anymore.  Iâ€™m effectively dead either way.  A ghost who only remains attached because of the obligations they have to others.  I literally am only alive because of other people.

Iâ€™ve given up on myself in this life.  I feel terrible about it but if thereâ€™s a way out of this hole for someone as poor and inexperienced as I am Iâ€™d love to hear it.  Everything out there is sadly paywalled, and it doesnâ€™t matter in the end how smart you are if you donâ€™t have the goods to spend.

Let this act of surrender by my last selfish defiance.  I was nothing,  am nothing, and will return to nothing.
