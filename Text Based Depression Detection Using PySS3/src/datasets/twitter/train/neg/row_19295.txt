I used to dreama poem i wrote

It stares at me, taunting me
Laughing at me and making me ill
I try to runaway and be free
But these people keep dragging me up a hill...

"Eat" they yell as I clamp my mouth shut 
My stomach growing at the sight
I get away into an abandoned hut
I can't give up this fight

Is it wrong to dream? 
The dream of being thin
Over the porcelain toilet I lean
It feels as if eating is a sin

I stumble out feeling great
Just to face this hill again
Tears fall down as I begin to hate
The food hill, giving me pain...

For when I eat.. I can't stop
Until I feel sick and fat
Standing on the hill. Right at the top
Back to the toilet base I sat

Heaving and crying
Filled with disgrace and shame
My heart slowly dying
I'm the only one to blame

I sit their filled with hatred for myself
My arms wrapped around my stomach 
Not even thinking of my health 
Just of how my tummy aches

Claustrophobia setting in
I can't stand to be in my body
How can not wanting to feel this way be a sin?
Wishing someone were here to hold me

I turn away ashamed for yet another day.
