If I died everyone would be okayIâ€™d honestly be surprised if I got more than 20 people coming to my funeral. Those who would cry would probably only cry for themselves and not because Iâ€™m gone. My life is inconsequential and I know it. No point in not doing it cause other people wouldnâ€™t be okay. They would be.
