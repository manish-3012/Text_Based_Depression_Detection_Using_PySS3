Will tommorow be better?I have been feeling empty ever since she left. I was only trying to better myself so that i could be with her and get ahead in my own life...but she gave up on us.


I have zero faith in the small hope of me getting a better life in the future. I'm an emotional wreck who has lost his ambition to chase his dreams and nearly killed himself once. I just don't know what to do. Should i keep going with the constant pain i have in my heart?, or just throw in the towel and give up?

All i know for a fact is that no one will care when i'm gone. Most of my "friends" no longer talk to me or help me when i need them. My family doesn't care about my wellbeing either, always leaving me to fend for myself, no matter how miserable i feel.


I just don't know it anymore ðŸ˜ž



I want the pain to stop.
