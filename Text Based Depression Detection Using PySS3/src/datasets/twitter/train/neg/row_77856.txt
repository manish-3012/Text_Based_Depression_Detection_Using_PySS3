How do I talk with someone about massive issues after they attempted suicide?My spouse recently tried to commit suicide. Thankfully it didn't work and they are currently on a hold. I want her to come home. I am trying very hard to not bring specific things up. I know they need time but there are so many things I found on their phone (I wasn't snooping but I had to look through texts to see if they told anyone anything, or see what they googled, etc. etc.) Obviously I'm going to see things if I'm doing this. I found stuff that does not match this person's character. Talking about joining specific sites for money which we don't need, talking about how they are tired of being around me, which has literally never been indicated once before, pictures of them cutting, which is a new to me thing, sketchy contacts and so on. 

I doubt any cheating has taken place but, these websites and talking about drugs and these other things clearly need to be addressed. I don't want to pile on them when they are finally released but how is this supposed to be addressed and sooner rather than later? When they get home and have access to their things, they will know it was gone through. I didn't ever want to have to look up a subreddit for this stuff so I don't know what I'm doing.

How do I approach all of this soon and on top of not making them feel like a child who doesn't need to have access to these things, or possibly a phone or these people now?
