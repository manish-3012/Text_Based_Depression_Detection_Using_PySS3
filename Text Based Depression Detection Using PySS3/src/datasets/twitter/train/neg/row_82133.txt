I'm just so tiredI've been carrying this weight my whole life. I've met a few people willing to shoulder it for a while, but they all end up leaving. I can't blame them. They don't realize how heavy it is until they have to carry it, and they hand it back pretty quickly.

I tried to be honest with my partner. I told him I was depressed, but trying to get better. His reaction, like everyone, was either derision and disbelief, or outright disgust. He said he was going to be there for me, to help me, but whenever I actually talked about it? Pure hatred in his eyes.

He said he feels like I'm trying to one-up him. He feels like he can't complain. I don't want him to feel that way, but I feel like an can't unload...

I had to leave my desk to cry in the bathroom today. All I can do about it is shout into the darkness of an unpopular subreddit. 

My garage has no exterior switch. Only the radio switch opens it. I'm heavy enough for a partial hanging to be reliable. I have a car and a hose. I have bleach and ammonia. I have plastic bags. So many options, but I'm trying to resist.

I know he'll be sad if I do it, but he'll get over it, right? 

It's like being a prisoner in a prison with no bars. The warden is a mean son of a bitch, and the other inmates are telling me that the torture isn't a big deal. All I have to do is walk away. I can quit any time.

I can put the weight down. I can finally sleep.
