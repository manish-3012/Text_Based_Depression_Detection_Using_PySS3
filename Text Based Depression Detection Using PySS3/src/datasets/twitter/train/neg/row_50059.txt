Somebody saved my life by saying this:If you're upset by the state of current life and your circumstances, life isn't feeling fulfilling, isn't feeling equitable- 
you care enough about life (if not yourself) to know that this doesn't feel right, things need to change. 

If you feel like there isn't space in the world for people like you, like us, you may be correct. Don't let this discourage you. 

It means that there's an opportunity to make the space- for yourself, and for everybody else out there feeling like you. To change the things that don't feel right with your life and the world. 

It takes witnessing the pain to know what needs to change.
