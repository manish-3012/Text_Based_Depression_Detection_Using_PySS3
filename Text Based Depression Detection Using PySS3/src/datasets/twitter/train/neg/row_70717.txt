I wish my parents let me goI'm so tired. Nothing gives me any pleasure or happiness. I've been in this rodeo for years, taking all the meds imaginable, being hospitalized, my parents really have tried everything, and I'm so thankful for them, even if nothing worked. 
But unfortunately life is still just miserable for me. I wish they didn't kept saying they couldn't live without me, because I just want to die. They're the only things keeping me here, because they're too scared of me killing myself and keep me on watch all the time. But everything hurts.

I want to go. Please.
