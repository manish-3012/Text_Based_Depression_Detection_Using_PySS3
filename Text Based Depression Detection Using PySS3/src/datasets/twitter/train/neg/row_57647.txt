I sometimes harm myself or think about killing myself for attentionThere have been times in my life where I have actually been suicidal and almost killer myself but other time I think about how people would react to that and it kind of makes me want to do it. I also used to also act like I was going to kill myself to get sent to a mental hospital. But at the same time I kinda did want to die. Am I a bad person. And recently Iâ€™ve imagined hanging myself and I cut tonight but wonâ€™t show anyone so I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s for attention. Any thoughts?
