I wish someone would ask me if i was okay.But everyone only cares about if im succesful in school, which im not. Im failing nearly every class and wanting to go to therapy to get diagnosed and get pills like itll magically change my life. Sadly everyone gave up on me and my family is too poor to afford therapy.
