DepressedLately I've been depressed, more depressed than I was already. Depression cause by stress, stress caused by family. Back when I was a Christian/Agnostic I would have thoughts of suicide. I would think that maybe if I commuted suicide and saw God in heaven he would see that I'm a good guy and turn the other cheek. When I turned into an atheist I got an immediate high. This high was made possible with the realization that I am my own maker and that I ultimately have control over my destiny. The depression went away but not for long.
My family, being the Protestants that they are, scheduled a mandatory bible study every night and made me attend every hutch activity when they found out the news. I, having no friends outside the faith, have no one to TRULY talk to about this matter in real life. I talked to some but it's always the same shit, turn to their god for the answer.
Now I'm more depressed than ever: no friends to help cope with, family is at its worse, and - recently turning nineteen, having no job, and relying completely on my parents financially - no where to escape.

The reason I live today is because reality is all I know to be certain and I don't want to end it early, but if its constantly filled with depression and no sign of getting out of it any time soon, I might do just that. What can I do?
