Forever alone post, hope to find "co-minders" hereAbsolutely feeling alone and empty. I have a girlfriend and we are dating for 3 yrs, 1,5 of them on distance. She used to fight me and block in all social media. Last week found her cheating on me with probably any guy on her way. Tired of this. People tell me I am very pretty and intelligent, but I am afraid to be lonely.
