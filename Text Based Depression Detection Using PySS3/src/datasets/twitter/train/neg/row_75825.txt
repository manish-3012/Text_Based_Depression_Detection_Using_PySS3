I don't think I really exist.Nothing feels real, ever. I can't remember feeling like a real person. Like I actually exist. People ignore me or don't listen to me or forget about me all the time. All I am is a disposable extra in people's lives, existing only at convenient times for them.







It's like I'm fading away from this world. Not even cutting feels like anything anymore. I'm just nonexistent. I don't see the point in living if this is all there is. It's all fake. I'm not real. It's getting worse and it's only going to keep getting worse.
