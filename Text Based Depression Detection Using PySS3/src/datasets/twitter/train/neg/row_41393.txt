I overheard my mom talking about how much of a burden I am on her and my familyShe was having a zoom meeting with some therapist or dr and most of her time was spent talking about me. How she canâ€™t function properly because sheâ€™s worried about me and how my family is suffering because my presence is so depressing. I agree with everything she said. I know she loves me so much, but as long as Iâ€™m still alive Iâ€™m hurting her. She constantly worries that sheâ€™ll come home from work and find me dead. I just want to give her peace of mind. I know sheâ€™ll be devastated to lose me, but at least sheâ€™ll know that itâ€™s over. That Iâ€™m no longer pain. Sheâ€™ll be able to grieve and then hopefully move on with her life. She wonâ€™t be ridden with anxiety everyday wondering if Iâ€™m safe. Sheâ€™ll be able to focus on other parts of her life that sheâ€™s neglected over the past few years because of me. Iâ€™m planning on finally ending it next week. Iâ€™ve been writing suicide notes for 3 years since I was 16 and now I have a whole notebook full of them. The tiny shred of hope Iâ€™d been hanging on to is gone, and Iâ€™m ready to finally free myself from my mind and this world. Iâ€™ll probably write one last post before I go because this sub has helped me feel so understood when no one else did and itâ€™s helped me a lot over the years. I hope you all can somehow find peace one day. I hope I can too.
