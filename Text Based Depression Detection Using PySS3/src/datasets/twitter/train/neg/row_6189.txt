I hate it all.I hate when people complain about their lifes because they cant buy something really expensive while there are others who dont even know what they're gonna eat the next day or if they're gonna eat at all.

I hate when people say they have depression when in reality they only have sad moments because of stupid things like boyfriends/girlriends.

I hate that everyone has "normalized" suicide and use it as a joke nowadays "i wanna die" "girl same"

It's not funny wanting to die, it's not something to be joked about. Being suicidal is waking everyday wishing that the sun hadnt crept throught the window. It's giving up on anything that one day might make you happy, because at the moment you're in so much pain and mental stress that you just want to escape it all... and the worst of it all is when you're not able to do it. It sucks when you can't actually kill yourself. I'm a cowards, I will problably never kill myself because im a coward. I wish I had the courage so I could escape it all.
