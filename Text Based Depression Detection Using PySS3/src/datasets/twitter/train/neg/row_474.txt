I understand why transgender suicide rates are so highIâ€™m never gonna be cis, never gonna be cured of dysphoria. Honestly donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll feel better no matter how long Iâ€™m on hormones. Will always be ostracized and a target for violence. Therapy canâ€™t even help with this because thereâ€™s literally no changing the fact I was born wrong. Thereâ€™s no point in drawing out the suffering. It never gets better. Iâ€™m going to kill myself. Holy shit.
