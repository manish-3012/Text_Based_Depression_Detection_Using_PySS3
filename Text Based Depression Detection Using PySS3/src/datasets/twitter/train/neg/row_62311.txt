ciao!nice reading all the posts and talking to people here, but it seems that nothing's actually gotten better and I'll be taking my own life :D I'm not very excited about it but oh well. sorry for being another "goodbye" post here, I'd leave my logins and credit cards on this post but i have a loved one who would love to look after all of that for me once I'm in a wooden box.

i hope you lot are better off, bye!
