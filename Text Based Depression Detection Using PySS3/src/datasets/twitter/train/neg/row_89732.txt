I can't take being home.I just can't take it anymore. Things have piled up over time and I'm the sole reason why. I've been dealing with this for over 4 years now and things have never stayed better. I've been in the hospital twice because of attempting before and now a year and a half after the last time I'm going to do it again. Ever since then I've been racking up credit card debts and don't have a job or money, so I opened up to my family about it and they were initially seeming supportive but since I'm home for the holidays I heard them talking about how they really feel about that and me in general. The only person I have that really cares is my boyfriend and I pushed him away and freaked him out saying I couldn't take it and I was sorry but it was too much. But he isn't here to stop me so nobody that knows can do anything. We're supposed to have all the family over for christmas but I'm not going to make it to then. I'm probably going to kill myself tomorrow night. I've been crying all day and I don't want it to be like this anymore.
