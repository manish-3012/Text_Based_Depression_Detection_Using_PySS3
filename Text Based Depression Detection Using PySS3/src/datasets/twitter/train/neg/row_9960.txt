I tell someone I'm tired at least daily...I leave out the "of life" part.

If I had a way to go painlessly I would.  I've already driven off almost everyone who would've cared.

Of course now I'm lonely which makes me wanna do it even more.  I just wish someone would hold me one last time before I leave.
