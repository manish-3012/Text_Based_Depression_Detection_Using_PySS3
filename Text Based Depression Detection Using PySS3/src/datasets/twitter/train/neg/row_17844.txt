I just wanna be a toddler againMy toddler years were the only years where I wasnâ€™t relentlessly abused, bullied, or beat up until now. Now itâ€™s all scarred me into one hell of a dark person. I cry every single night like I am right now just WISHING life could be different. These are the moments where suicide is justifiably the right way to go. No more pain. Iâ€™m 17 and I have worse blood pressure than a middle aged man because of all the stress. People tell me I look good so often but my mental health tells me itâ€™s all for nothing. I just want to be a toddler again. I just need peace. I just need it, or I need death.

I remember in middle school falling down on the way to my bus to go home and passing out from dehydration. At minimum dozens of kids had to have walked past me before a bus driver saw me and carried me to the nurse. Literally only one person gave a damn and he only did because it would be his job if he didnâ€™t. Why would anyone want to associate themselves with the skinny loser with no friends whoâ€™s getting his ass kicked left and right and was just recovering from a few blows to the eyes when he refused to give a kid his only change of clothes for the gym uniform? Why would anybody want to associate with the quiet kid they didnâ€™t know was being physically and emotionally abused every second at home by a sibling, and his parents couldnâ€™t do a thing because they were constantly fighting and hitting each other? 

I laid there on the scorching hot concrete that day unconscious, but when I awoke I swore on my heart that if things didnâ€™t change I was going to take my own life. 

I have multiple mental illnesses, none of which were genetic, from my years as a child.

Body Dysmorphia
Anger Management
Major Depressive Disorder
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
Bipolar Disorder
Generalized Anxiety Disorder

There is no god. When I go through with it, if there is one, send me to hell. Send me to hell for what Iâ€™m about to say to you. Send me to hell for all the things you did to me, the family you birthed me in. Send me to hell for all the times I had to swing for my life. Send me to hell for letting me lye on that concrete that summer day. Send me to hell for giving me what you gave. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Fuck you, from my heart and soul, fuck you god. You canâ€™t do anything to me you havenâ€™t already done. You can kill me, but killing me will only free me. You can put me in a fucking coma, but making me unconscious will only help me. We both know youâ€™d never do that.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nobody can help me anymore.
