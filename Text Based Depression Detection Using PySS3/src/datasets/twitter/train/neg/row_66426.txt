I literally help everyone but nobody ever helps meI always go out of my way to help people, I push aside what I'm doing to help my colleagues but they never do anything for me.

I literally have no real life friends. I don't have anyone to talk to. 

I'm so fucking tired.

People always fucking use me.

This has been my life for the past 4 years. 

Life doesn't get better, you just find new ways to pretend you're okay.
