I can see the on coming train clearly, I just wish I had the willpower to step off the tracks.I'm 20 years-old and I've been addicted to painkillers for the last two years (mainly oxycontin and oxymorphone, tried heroin but didn't stick to it).  I also use cocain, xanax, adderall and ecstasy pretty regularly but I wouldn't consider those a problem...yet. I've tried to quit the opiates a few times, but the same thing always happens- I just don't know what else to do with myself.  Pretty much all my friends use and getting fucked up and partying is the only thing we really do for fun.  When I'm sober, I can't even hang out with the people I like or do the things I like (like partying, or even listening to fucking music) because it's just an instant trigger for me).

And i can't see it getting much better...

Come August I'm going to be moving in with two of my good friends, who both use daily, and we'll pretty much be using the apt as a party house.  How the fuck am I going to be able to stay sober in that situation. 

I've got tens-of-thousands of dollars in bonds in my name and have a pretty much free pass for school, start a new semester in the fall, but I stand to lose all that if I don't get my shit together.  My girlfriend of three years already left me due to all the lying and shit, and I don't blame her.  I just don't have my hope for myself, nothing really interests me anymore other than getting fucked up.
