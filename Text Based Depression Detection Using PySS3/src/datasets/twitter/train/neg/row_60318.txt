isle of broken dreams...Hello stranger. Good to meet you, well informally. I have known left, it's my fault. I moved to California, pursuing my acting dream.  No family, or friends in this state. All but one friend...but he is kicking me out in a month. I'm not worried. I have been homeless before. Why, though. I spend so much love. I feed the homeless, I help everyone I can. Why do horrible things happen to me? What's wrong with me? Knowone wants to cast me, I look too weird to be cast in anything...

Nothing works out for me...I dont even have the energy to finish this post. I want to explain and want help...but I just don't know what to do...
