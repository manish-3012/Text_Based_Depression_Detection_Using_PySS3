My partner left and its been substantially harderIts been about a year since we broke up and I no longer have confidence about my body anymore. I'm fat and hairy but my ex never made me feel terrible because of it. I'm bi (but not out) and whenever I'm on Grindr, I just really feel an immediate urge to shed 70 lbs and my hair and be androgynous and toned just so it wouldn't be hard for anyone to love me. I've been wanting to kill myself because I really want to be in school but I'm not there and it all feels meaningless otherwise. I lost my partner because my parents couldn't accept her ethnicity and I was terrible with dealing with that, I don't even know where to begin to tell them I'm also bi without a secure future.  Running helps me lose weight and get a high but the days I miss that or when my back hurts, I self harm instead. The constant urges to kill myself have been there since high school but this last year has been especially hard, I don't know what to do.
