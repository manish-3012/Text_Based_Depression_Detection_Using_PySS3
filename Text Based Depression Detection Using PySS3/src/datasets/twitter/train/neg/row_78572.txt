I feel I want to dieI have fucked up my whole life.

I have been in major depression for more than a year. I have broke up with my fiancÃ©, I have lost my job and my apartment. I moved back to my parents house and now I feel like I am nothing.

I want to commit suicide, because I have been suffering so much. But I have read that 'never commit suicide'. Suffering do not stop by that, but it ampified by that.

I have never enjoyed my life really. I was always a kind of depressed. I felt I was an outsider and only my relationships with girls gave me some relief.

I believe in reincarnation and I think my suffering and my suicidal tendency is the result of past live's suicides. As I child during night I always went back to a place where suffering was unbearable. I think thats from where I have arrived.

How could I break the cycle of feeling terrible, killing myself, suffering more, rebirthing, feeling terrible...

Has anyone have had experience/thoughtylike this?

I need help!!!

I went to see therapists. I told them I thought I had also ASPD. None believed me. But they do not know what kind of things I have done in my life... maybe I desereve all of this suffering.


But I do not eant to die, I want to live and enjoy life to a certain extent. I want to evolve.
