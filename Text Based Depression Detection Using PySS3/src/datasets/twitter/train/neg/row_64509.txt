hopefully iâ€™ll be dead before sept 3rd when i start school.i wish i could stay but life is just too much. itâ€™s too stressful. way too much to think about. i know iâ€™d have people that miss me but i canâ€™t deal with this. iâ€™m sad and stressed and anxious. my best friend told me she wanted me to be her maid of honor at her wedding the other day and i just smiled and laughed along cause iâ€™m not gonna be alive by then. i just feel so guilty and shitty. i donâ€™t know what to do.
