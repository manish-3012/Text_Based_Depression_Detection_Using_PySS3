I feel so, so emptyAnd itâ€™s only been getting worse. Being petrified of death was the one thing that seemed to hold me back, but now even the thought of me dying leaves me cold and emotionless. Iâ€™m a failure, a disgrace and a useless waste of resources, and I feel like nothing good will come of my life. I feel trapped; like no matter what I do, everything in my life will go wrong. I just wish I could cry.
