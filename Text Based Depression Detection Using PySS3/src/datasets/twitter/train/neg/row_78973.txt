its becoming harder and harder to stay alive, and my motivation to try was already nullmy country is getting worse and worse to live in, gas and basic food items are 8 times what they were, ive gotten kicked out of every parttime job i held(im a first year in college), and i cant afford most of my needs anymore. add to that being basically an orphan whos been living alone since he was 14, having no friends, and just generally not having a reason to live in the first place, and it just gets worse for me to live every single day. ive tried ending it before but im just such a coward that i keep hesitating at the last minute and i hate it all i hate absolutely everything in me and around me and idk what im supposed to do but wait for bread to outprice me and just slowly die of not being able to afford electricity and water
