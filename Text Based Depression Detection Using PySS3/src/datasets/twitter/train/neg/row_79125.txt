I can easily die
The Suicidal thoughts have been scraping at my brain
A flash of my own neck cut by the cord. The rope. The shoelace or the belt.
So easy if I could die
Itâ€™d be so easy for me to die
Iâ€™d be dead 
Iâ€™ve tasted the rope around my neck before
The small burn on the left side of my neck 
The feeling of the cord pressing on my vein
Stopping my blood from going to my brain
If I kill myself I wonâ€™t have to worry about anything
If I kill myself it would be so easy 
I could easily end my life whenever I want
Sometimes I crave a rope around my neck
To die for my failure and lack of good nature
To die for my stupidity and horrible timing
For all the times Iâ€™ve ever felt uncomfortable 
And for all the times Iâ€™ve hurt others feelings and hope in me
If I could just kill myself for the sake of it 
So that I am not needed
Because I am a waste of time
