This was wrong, right?I want to mention first that I am not suicidal, but I really needed a place to talk to about this and here seemed like the right place...

I have been having a metal health crisis in the last couple of days, so I called a talk helpline. Everything was going fine, until he started talking about suicide. I told him, I wasn't feeling suicidal. He ignored, asked if I had had suicidal thoughts before. I said yes. He asked that if I had them now, how would I feel. And then kept going on about it. I thought, wait a minute, this feels entirely wrong. Wtf is this guy doing, trying to suggest suicide? I tried to end the call quickly after that, thanking him for his help earlier in the call and not mentioning the bit at the end.

I am really shaken.

Can I have some reassurance or support with this? I was in a bad way and he has somehow made me feel worse.
