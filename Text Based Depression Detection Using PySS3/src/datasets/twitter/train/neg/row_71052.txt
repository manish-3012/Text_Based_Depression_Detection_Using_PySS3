Thinking about the best way to do itTwo weeks now I've been taking ever OTC 'anti depression' med you can find. St Johns, Sam-E, Fish oil, Rhodia, HTC5, some other shit I can't recall right now. Nothing. I still cry constantly. I still hurt constantly. And after this Stanford thing, add that I've been reliving my rape all week over and over. Twenty years ago and it's normally not the source of my depression.

I still have the massive amounts of pain pills and alcohol I was ready to use last year. But it's so hard and the odds of vomiting are too high. 

I am thinking I get on my bike and ride as aggressively as I can with minimal gear. Get out in the country and go fucking crazy. Someone will find the body, sorry about that. Maybe, if I'm out enough, only animals will find it. 

I'm so sick of crying. I'm so sick of hurting. And it's not getting better. I asked a friend to send me antidepressants, the real kind, as I have no insurance and can't get them.  She has bottles full. She said I was faking it for attention. Wonder what she'll think at my funeral about faking it. 

I'm losing my mind. Maybe already have. No one will miss me. I have no real friends. My family is all gone. Even my pets leave the bed when I cry. 

I think it's time. Just have to figure out the most likely successful means that won't fuck up whoever finds me too much. Fuck guns.
