I miss him...I just... I dont know how to describe how I feel at this point... in late May a friend took his own life.. he was the happiest and nicest person I have ever met.. He saved me from suicide once... At this point I see him every day.. I see him in my dreams and nightmares... in life... It should of been me.. i get told that everyday.. it should have been me...
