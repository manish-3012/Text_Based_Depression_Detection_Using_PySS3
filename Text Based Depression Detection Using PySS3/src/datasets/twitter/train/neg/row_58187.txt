I'm close to coming close.I can feel my life headed in a downward spiral. I am in my last year of college and I have no drive to do or learn or anything. I know I have below average intelligence and grasping power when it comes to anything. I have no talent really. I suck st everything I enjoy. What's worse is that the closest friends that I have and really love, are quite easily the nicest and most talented (in this particular case, I really enjoy listening to western music and started trying to learn, but I'm unbearably horrible at it) people I know. I honestly don't think I have anything to offer to anyone. I'm a dull sod. Just an amassing of protoplasm waiting to end. It's just a question of when.

I've seen people say encouraging things on this subreddit. You guys need to be given more credit for that. I'm just another one who's nearly in need of help. Or maybe I'm just too much of a wimp to do anything of substance. Including committing suicide.
