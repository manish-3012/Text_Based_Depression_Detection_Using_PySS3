Right on scheduleFor a while now, I've been wondering how it's possible that I've managed to make it this long. I know that if someone else were me, they would have ended it a long time ago. 

But I wanted to hold out, just in case- maybe, I'm wrong. That maybe the old saying "It gets better" is actually true.

I know now what I've always known, it doesn't. That's not to say it can't, just that it doesn't. It hasn't, and will continue not to.

Things decay. That's just "life".

I hate to be so pessimistic, but that's just reality. It would be best if people would be honest with themselves about it.

With all of that said- I'm honestly more at peace, because now I know that I can leave at anytime. I know how, just not when. I just have to wait for the right moment. I'm so sick of feeling like I'm crying wolf.

The day will come though, maybe soon. I'll be right on schedule.
