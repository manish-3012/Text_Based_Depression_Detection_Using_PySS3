Are there any small groups on here where people can air problems without people feeling obliged to reply?Donâ€™t know if this is the right place to post but Iâ€™ve got so much on my mind all the time and I just want somewhere to air it without having to directly having to talk to one person, sorry if confusing, thanks.
