Lily, I need you to know that none of it was intentionalBefore I go, all I can think about is how that would stop me from doing it. You'll never see this post. Because this is a throwaway on a subreddit you don't read. There's no way you could ever see my words again

That's part of the reason. I loved you, and I hurt you, and now you think I'm a monster and I've come to the conclusion that you're right. I deserve all that. And where before, my lack of memory prevented me from believing you, now I believe you.

And I can't live with what I've done. You were all I cared about, your happiness was all I had left to live for. I fucked everything we had, and your happiness, it's all my fault.

I can't fix it. So I have no other option. I am trapped in what is about to happen. I'm powerless to stop it.

I love you, baby. I'm so sorry that it turned out this way. I hope you can forgive me, someday. I hope you find true happiness, with someone who deserves you.
