I need answersAll I want is people to talk to and communicate with others in this world. But it seems the polar opposite for everyone else. As in today's society everyone is way too focused on money and being friends with people just for their own personal gains rather than a pure connection. As I think pure connection is the only way we can stay sane in this world. That's why we keep having more and more shootings and people aren't understanding the problem. This alone fact makes me wanna die everyday. You can say there are real people in this world who want that too but honestly everyone is fucking zombies.
