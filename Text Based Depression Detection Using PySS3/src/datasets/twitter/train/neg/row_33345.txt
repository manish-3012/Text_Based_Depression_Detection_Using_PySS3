Isolation is making me crazySometimes I feel so bad I want to die. The first time I "tried" to kill myself I was 12. At 14 I ended up at the hospital for trying again with pills and then I was put away from my parents house for 2 years (1 year in rehab center and 1 year in foster home) then I returned to my parents house when I was 16 I didn't have friends at school and some girls where lauging at me because I was weird/alone. So I skipped school a lot and I was so afraid of school honestly I hated it. I was so fucking desesperate because when I came back from foster home I thought I was going to have a new life anyway I ended up having my high school diploma but stopped after that because I was too afraid to continue to another school and to be alone again. So now at 17 I work full time at a fast food, feeling miserable bc I'm too afraid to live. But the truth is since I'm 14 and got help, I never really stopped wanting to die. I stopped self-harm and got rid of my ed idk how. Some days I feel so happy and have so much hope, I have self-esteem and I feel like I will succeed in breaking out of isolation and do shit like leaving my job and talking a lot to people around me. Then some other days I feel so fucking bad and like I'm never going to have a normal life and I want to die. Idk why I was writing all of this honestly but most of the time I'm normal tho, not always up or down. But I was going to try to kill myself 2 others times since my 14 (at 15 and at 17) but never did it again because I don't have the balls anymore. When I feel good or normal I'm scared I just end up killing myself one day I feel bad.
