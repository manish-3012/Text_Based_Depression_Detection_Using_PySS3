Impasse between suicidal thoughts and not wanting to die.I do not want to kill myself, but life becomes increasingly too much to bear. Suicidal thoughts resurface day after day. It wears me down to the point I can't take it anymore. But the thought of not being around too troubles me. I don't want the people who love me to be hurt. They have expectations associated with me, but this in itself further burdens me. I don't think I would ever be able to kill myself, and this scares me. The thought of having to live an entire life with this cloud over my head would be too unbearable. I want an escape out of this life, but I am conflicted. I cannot kill myself, and I cannot live either.
