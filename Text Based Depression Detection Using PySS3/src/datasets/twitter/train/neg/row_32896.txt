What should I do? / VentingI've been severely depressed/suicidal for around 6 years but these last 2 years in particular, every day just feels like a rollercoaster of emotions.

One moment i'll be calm and in a relatively good mood and then after a few hours i'll be pulling out my hair and searching for painless suicide methods or have a million and one thoughts rushing through my head all at once whilst i'm in bed, unable or unwilling to move.

Due to a whole variety of medical issues and a general lack of energy (it all feels like too much to deal with) I haven't seen my doctor about any of these feelings. It seems after having these "episodes" I can calm down and manage to get motivated to book a doctors appointment. But due to a small appointment booking window (8am-8:30am) at my local GP, I find that the next morning I am completely unwilling to call and attempt to book an appointment due to fear and feeling overwhelmed.

I really need to get help because I just can't function anymore. i'm paranoid, at my lowest point, unemployed, causing stress for my parents and just want it all to end. This has ruined my life, I was getting good grades at school and had big plans for university and a career but dropped out completely to spend the next 4 years in on/off again entry level employment.

This is actually the only time I have ever spoken about my mental health with anyone as i'm just way too scared to tell my parents and friends so apologies if this comes across as incoherent rambling but it's rare for me to conjur up the effort to write a long post.

What should I do, book a doctors appointment, crisis line, therapist??
