sooner than I thought18F. this is my first reddit post. I have nobody, not even my own family. I have no friends. I have a significant other who makes me happier than I have ever been in my life but I cannot tell him about any of the issues I'm having. I am causing too many problems for him.  I do not deserve him. I am living in an unfamiliar state across the country and do not have the first idea about how I could get treatment, and besides, I have no health insurance and no job. I also refuse to take SSRIs. I wish there was a way to get rid of the pain besides suicide but it is my only option, I am doomed and stuck in a downward spiral and I cannot stand this feeling for much longer.
