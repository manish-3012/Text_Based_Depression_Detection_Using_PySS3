Suicide Cycle?This is my first time posting in a forum and it's weird, but I guess I just want to vent a little...

I've also realized that since he died I haven't been able to create any bonds with other people. I feel like I'm an alien, so disconnected from everyone else, does anyone else feel like this?  
I feel like I've already lived the best part of my life, soon my parents will die too and I don't feel like going through more deaths, to be honest. I had a pretty good life, but I'm starting to think that it is enough. But then I start to think about my family and I don't want them to go through this again. I don't want to create a vicious cycle of suicide. But I feel kinda hopeless... 
My brother left detailed instructions on how to do it, so I could just do it and get this over with...
