No Hope?Im diagnosed schizoaffective bipolar type, ptsd, and bpd. I've been on at least 16 different antidepressants. I feel suicidal again. I dont know what to do. I go to therapy. I've basically completed my tms.. but every month or so I get suicidal and go inpatient. It doesn't matter what meds they put me on, I'll always end up back there.

It's also wearing on my fiances last nerve that I go inpatient so often, so much so that he doesn't think he can stay with me if it keeps happening. If I lose him I lose all of my friends as well.

I'm at a loss. And I honestly believe in this situation I'm in that I'm better off dead.
