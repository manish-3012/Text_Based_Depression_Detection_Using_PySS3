ScarredI'm scared.....I'm scarred I'm sitting miles from you as my heart sits slightly a-jar, but my brain is a mess, and my soul is mess I'm scared of hurting anyone or being a disappointment; Attention! Attention! I've made an arrangement! The second I have less then 1 reason to stand then I'll start to be a better man! 
I'm scared that I'm standing in the sand...with the heat against my back and the only reason I'm not moving is because I'm fighting for the wrong reason and it's hope not strength I lack. For a greater man would have drank his piss to live and the weaker man would curl up and die,but instead I stick my toes in the sand, stand straight and cry with my lips cracked and my mouth dry singing along to shitty songs.
I'm scared that after everything is gone I'll have a house and live alone and the rest of my life will be a dramatic marathon.
