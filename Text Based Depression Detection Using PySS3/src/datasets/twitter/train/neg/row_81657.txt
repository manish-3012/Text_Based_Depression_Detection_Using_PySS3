The letter hGod i hate talking about my problems over the internet but i just wish i had my bottle of rum and a gun. Theres no logical explanation for the way things are in my brain. Theres no diagnosis to every thought and every memory ive had. No antidepressant is perfectly tailored to me, so i turn to my sweet, sweet alcohol and it eases the pain more than a stupid pill that my mom will get angry at if i dont take. Pills are there to normalize you and throw you around society's rules like theyre unbreakable. I dont like the idea of living a cookie cutter life and doing fuck all with my life, but that seems to be inevitable so id rather die than live in stupidity. Im not gonna waste my time on this stupid fucking site, im gonna go find some painkillers.
