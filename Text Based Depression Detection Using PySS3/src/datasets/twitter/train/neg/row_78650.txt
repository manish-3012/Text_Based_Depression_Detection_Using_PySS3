Why is it that there are people out there dying of illness who would love to live, then there are people wanting to die yet we have to carry on suffering.There should be a 'life chip' which can be exchanged with someone who is terminally ill. 

It is strange how vulnerable the human body is and how easily it can die, yet I can't seem to kill myself. Why couldn't I get the terminal cancer instead of my dad? He loved life. He loved living. I never did, but now here I am.
