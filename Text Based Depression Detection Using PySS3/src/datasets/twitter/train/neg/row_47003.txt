Type 2 diabetic. The stress of another ACA repeal is too much for me to handle.Not trying to bring politics into this, but the reality of the situation is that the Trump administration just reversed their stance on ACA (affordable care act) protection, telling a court that the pre\-existing conditions clause (the heart of the bill) is unconstitutional. 

Last year, when the GOP tried to kill the ACA, I was beside myself with stress for months. As someone who has a chronic illness I already went through Bankruptcy once (back in 07' before the ACA) due to medical bills. The ACA literally saved my life and allowed me to start my own small business and support myself. I'm 32 years old an am managing my disease thanks to my ability to be able to afford insulin and other medications.

Without the ACA I would lose everything again. I can't...live with the stress looming over me of having this safety\-net ripped out from under me again. The optimists will say that Congress won't let this happen, but they are obviously saying it's unconstitutional for a reason. What hope is there any more? God, sometimes I wish I was born in Canada or Europe. Where healthcare isn't a fucking political trading card. 

Am I a bad person for being sick? Am I a bad citizen? Do I deserve to die? If I do then why not at my own fucking hands and not some chump in a cheap fucking suit? I value my life, but I can't take this anymore.
