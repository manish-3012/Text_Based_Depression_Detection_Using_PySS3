Life is meaninglessI live in a house I hate with my partner, their sibling and their siblings partner. We moved here to save money because I had poor physical health and so did their (my partner) sibling and they were going to give us a free room in exchange for taking care of them. Well, they got better and now they have full energy and are even back in school full time but they're still slobs. And now my partner is having severe mental health issues so they won't do any household chores and they said that they aren't in a place to help me with my emotions or really be affectionate when I need it. Literally nobody picks up after themselves. There's a trash can in every room and I still pick up everyone's trash. I have to gather dishes from every room every day. I unload dishes and wash dishes every day. I clean the counters, take out the trash/compost/recycling, sweep the house, go grocery shopping, do laundry, clean other stuff, make everyones lunches (partner now is going to intensive outpatient counseling, sibling to school and their partner to work), whilst having to deal with my severe pain (getting scans for possible Paget's disease of the bone tomorrow), online schoolwork and appointments. 

And on top of that, I don't get love or support from my partner because they "aren't in a good place". I feel like a fucking maid. I don't have money to move out and i have no other support system either because my family was abusive and I have no friends. This isn't a life worth living.
