Thank youHi there.

My brother posted here a few years ago. I found his account (I won't be posting it, sorry) and scrolled through his posts and comments. He made two posts here, and he received kindness and understanding.

My brother ended his life last August. I can't explain to you the exceptional pain of his loss, how I think of him multiple times a day, how I wish I could have done more. He was the other half of my soul and, towards the end, I know his depression made that difficult for him to remember. Depression lies, it tells you no one cares, that no one will ever love you, that even if they did it would be a tragedy because you aren't worth it.

It isn't true. Seeing how my family and his friends reacted to his passing was the third-most difficult thing I've ever witnessed. It was the sole reason I didn't follow after him. Over a year later, I've come to terms with the fact I'll never get over it. There will never come a day I don't think about him and feel pain, or remember something about him and smile.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for your kindness towards him when he posted here. You didn't fail him (the posts were made over a year before he passed, so I'm sure they helped him postpone for longer and longer), you saved him. You made him reconsider for the longest time, and during that time, he was able to reconnect with people he hadn't seen in years. He was able to tell my mother he loved her for a little longer, to laugh for us to hear for a little longer, and to do so much more. If it hadn't been for a certain unavoidable (so he believed, due to his compassion and empathy for others) circumstance, he would have made it; in large part because of this community.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for helping him when he reached out.
