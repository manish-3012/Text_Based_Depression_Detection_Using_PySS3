We live in a dystopiaThere a lot of us. People who are willing to end it all. Something is seriously wrong. For us, and myself, to stay alive and/or be a semi-productive member of society we must consume drugs. Drugs that will take away the thoughts we think, keep us from ending it all. Our lives are so unbelievebly shit and unfulfilling, that for us simply to keep on living in this hellhole we must consume drugs. 

If this isnt a dystopia, then I dont know what is.
