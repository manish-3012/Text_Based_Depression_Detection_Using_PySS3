Been feeling sad and angry for a long time.For most of my life, I've felt angry and sad. I've had suicidal thoughts too and a couple times I almost went through with it. I walked in front of a car which missed me and I tried cutting myself but lost my nerve. I've never felt more alone than I do now. I try to be a positive person and show people love but it makes me feel more alone. I believe that no one cares how I feel so here I am, posting on the internet for all to see. 
I really want to kill myself. Whenever I get mad, I explode. I've been diagnosed with depression, autism, bipolar disorder, so my emotions are all over the place. 
I'm tired of feeling like this and I just want to be done. I might try again, I don't know.
