I just want a choice.I want to have the choice to blow my brains out honestly. I don't care anymore about hurting others, I was never that important to them anyway. Both my parents just find ways to shit on me rather than fucking realize I try incredibly hard to be successful, and then I finally try to talk to people and be outgoing and just...people don't hate me but...im just "that guy who's nice and takes photos." I guess maybe I should do some photos foreshadowing it, at least id be remembered that way.
