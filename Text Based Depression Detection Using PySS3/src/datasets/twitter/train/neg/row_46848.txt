I have so much energy now as I plan my suicide.It's weird. I felt so lifeless and depressed in the past few weeks. Now that I'm making plans to end everything, I'm doing it with zeal and passion. No tears. 

I just want to talk to my ex-bf one last time. Finally get the truth from him, though I know he will probably continue to lie and string me on.

Tonight is the night. I will take pills, go over to my ex-bf's house, and lay in his arms as the pills make me fall asleep. I won't tell him anything, I don't want him to send me to the hospital. While I am in his arms, I can pretend that he loves me, and go to sleep forever. If somehow this fails, there are a ton of bridges and cliffs around. I live in a scenic area. I will jump, my town is famous for that.  

I kinda want to call my family. I have four siblings, three younger. My littlest sister is 9 years old. I know that this will destroy them for life. That's why I can't call them, I can't bear to hear their voices on the phone. I'll break down and won't be able to tell them why. Or I will stop what I'm doing and try to live for them. 

But shouldn't I live for myself instead of for other people? It's my life, my pain, right?

I live with four housemates. I feel bad about the mess I've been since going through this breakup. I'll tidy up everything, my room, the kitchen, leave it very clean, pay them back any bills I owe.
