How the fuck do I keep me from killing myself?I'm so fucking depressed. I have no real friends. No hobbies besides gaming. I don't go outside and I'm too anxious to ever leave my room. I'm failing school. I'm a loser. All I really do is sleep or play video games for 10+ hours a day.

The fucking suicidal thoughts are all I can think of right now. I just *want to fucking die*.
