Attempted so many times and it doesn't seem like I have much time leftI've got my shitty backstory like everyone else. Most noteworthy is my abusive parents, who I cut contact with five years ago after a suicide attempt and psych ward stay. They were the most abusive they had ever been when they got the bill. I realized if I kept them in my life I wouldn't have a chance at being able to keep myself alive. I've had more suicide attempts than I can count, and two additional psych ward stays. After one of them my then-partner told me that they wish I hadn't called them after I had attempted suicide, when I was overdosed and blacked out, because it was mother's day and they had plans to video chat with their mom.

I've also been raped twice, and my first partner when I was a teenager was abusive, but like whatever. Pointless to list all my traumas. Everyone has their traumas but not everyone keeps ending up in the situation I'm in now.

&amp;#x200B;

About two years ago I had my last real suicide attempt. I wanted to not just die, but erase any evidence that I had ever existed. I ripped up every journal, got rid of like 3/4 of my belongings, deleted every picture of myself, every social media profile. When the attempt failed I realized I didn't even have anyone I could talk to about it.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year and a half ago I decided to go on a diet (I've always been obese) and that immediately turned into an eating disorder. I was eating very very low calories for six months. I finally got down to the normal BMI range and now I'm obsessed with maintaining my weight, which is its own hell. I'm getting loose skin removal surgery in a couple weeks which is the only reason I haven't attempted suicide yet - can't fail and then be denied surgery because they realize how crazy I am. (But now I'm starting to think... ok... just don't fail, then.)

&amp;#x200B;

So there's all of that, I guess, but the worst part of it all is I don't have anyone in my life. No family for five years now. No partner for like two and a half. No close friends for about a year now, when my only close friend relapsed with her alcoholism and blocked me. Just people I see occasionally who I can't seem to click with in that way. I leave social situations feeling even more lonely than before. I cannot describe how crushing it is to feel so lonely so I won't even begin to try. I've tried meeting new people, getting out in social settings, spending more time with the people I do know, but I feel like I'm just incapable of connecting with people anymore. Ever since my ex had that reaction to my psych ward stay it feels impossible to connect with anybody.

&amp;#x200B;

Each suicide attempt I have gets more serious. I think at first they were more cry for help attempts, but I realized what a cry for help actually gets me: getting yelled at about how expensive it is to take care of me, or being made very acutely aware of what an inconvenience I am on others. The last one that I failed, where I tried to erase any evidence that I existed, would have been successful but the item I got was faulty (won't say what that item was at the risk of sharing tips with other suicidal people reading this). It's not like I even had anyone to cry to help \*to\* during my last suicide attempt, It was not a cry for help attempt, I was very set on dying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not acutely suicidal right now but when I get hit by a suicidal feeling, it's frantic. I have a plan, and I have exactly what I need to carry out the plan. At this exact point in time it's only a gnawing feeling that I can put off. But depending on the day, it can feel like killing myself is urgent. It feels like I MUST die IMMEDIATELY. I think this is because I realized with all my failed attempts before that any hesitation in a suicide attempt leads to failure. If I put it off to the next day I might decide not to, if I talk to someone before I'll get distracted, if I talk to someone after they'll call 911, if I write a note then by the time I've finished writing it I might decide to just go to sleep, etc. I think I have learned that if I am ever going to kill myself I'll only accomplish it by acting on impulse, and so now when I feel suicidal, it's what I'm singularly focused on. It's the only thing that exists in my brain. Fighting the urge can take so much mental effort that it's actually physically painful - like I'll get intense headaches, feel nauseous, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So RIGHT NOW I am not at risk but I feel the impulse growing. I've gotten close to another attempt a couple times recently. I don't know that I'll be able to keep fighting it. My life has been awful and the only time I've been happy is when I was losing weight. There is nobody in my life who helps me feel better, or connected. There is nothing that brings me pleasure and I've tried many many many things. So now I'm posting here I guess, though I don't really know what kind of response I'm hoping for. I don't believe that anything will help. I've spent my whole life feeling this way and I know that if I put an incredible amount of work into my mental health I MAY feel SLIGHTLY better someday but it's so, so much work for so little payoff and I just don't have it in me to try anymore. I'm tired of working so hard only to be as miserable as before but now with stupid DBT skills or what the fuck ever. I've been going through the motions of life and "recovery" for so long and my life is not better for it. I don't want to keep subjecting myself to an existence that brings me deep loneliness and a complete lack of pleasure at BEST.
