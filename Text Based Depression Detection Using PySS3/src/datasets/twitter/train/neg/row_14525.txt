I doubt it'll work but maybe I can think I deserve to be hereI'm at work planning on how I'll kill myself. I tried to kill myself last new year and failed miserably ending up in the psych ward. This year I tried to make a change and have a fun New year's. And something horrible happened. It only showed me that I indeed should have just stuck to trying to end myself. I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I don't want empathy. I'm not joking at all when I say I'm an awful bad despicable person. No it's not my mental illness convincing me. It's hard rational concrete evidence. I need to get rid of myself before I hurt anyone else or ruin anything else. It's only right. Ive tried to get better to no avail. It's over now.
