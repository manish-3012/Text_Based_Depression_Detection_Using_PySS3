I have picked a date. I am not asking people to change my mind, just read please.28th of October 2018. It will forever be a special day for me.  


I am giving myself two month to see if miracles happen. Or something. Currently my mind is set so please spare us the "its going to be all better" baloney.  


Just tell me your stories if you're feeling like I do, what are your plans, how do you cope? Keep my busy, I'll reply to every single comment. I don't want to feel alone. Ask my anything.  


I have given up. No matter how hard Ive tried recently I just can't keep going. And at this point I don't even want to anymore.  


My mom and my brother don't stop lecturing me about how much I ruined my life, and how everything is my fault. I know I've messed up. STOP REMINDING ME. Even after I told my mom about my suicidal thoughts.  


My mom is a firm believer of god, she would always tell me its god's will and he has a plan, and the plan is apparently for me to be so miserable. She would always just say god is with you. I told her god doesn't care about me. I have never been religious. And she got mad and told me I should actually just kill myself for not believing in god.  


Thank you.
