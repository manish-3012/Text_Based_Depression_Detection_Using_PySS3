The worst feeling in the world is feeling alone in a marriage and I've done just that to my[24] wife[23]So I've really messed things up in my marriage the past two years. My wife warned my I was spending to much time on my phone and that I wasn't paying attention to her and I didn't listen. Why? I have no answer because I truly do not know. I loved her then as I do know. There isn't a single being on this planet that will ever love her and care about her as much I do. So why was I ignoring her? Why wasn't I listening to the signs she was giving? Now it's to late... 


She says she doesn't want us to separate and that she wants us to work out but she's emotionally done trying. She's been trying for two years to get my attention. That's all she wanted was my attention. Why would I ignore the one person I love and care about the most on this world. PLEASE SOMEONE EXPLAIN IT cause I can't understand why? I'm losing her day by day if I haven't lost her already. for once in my life I understand what the feeling is to want to go away and end it all to not feel like this anymore.

What's life without that one person that completes you? I never thought I'd feel like this unless we were old and dying. I sit at home alone trying to think of how life would go without her and nothing makes sense. I wouldn't want to be alive anymore. 

I've never regretted marrying her. I've never questioned my love for her. I've never stopped caring for her. I'd do anything for her so why did I do this to her. Why did I act like this and make her beg for my attention and then not see it when she was trying? I'm lost. I need someone to explain why? I've tried a psychiatrist but my new jobs insurance is no good till January 1st and I can't handle this anymore. Please help 

Td;lr why would I ignore the person I love and care about the most when she was telling me this might happen if I didn't stop.
