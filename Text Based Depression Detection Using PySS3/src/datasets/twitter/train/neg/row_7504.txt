It's my only choiceI'm 90% certain I will fail a class, and I've never failed a class before. I talked to my mom over the phone about it and she said I needed to do everything I can to get a good grade, or "I'll screw everything up" and she'll say crude words to the teacher, which is embarrassing because I'm an adult in senior year of college. I can't do anything since I can technically still be treated like this: she pays everything for me. 

So I have to live up to this standard, or I get embarrassed. So what? Well I'm afraid my mom and dad will hurt me to. My dad has done it before, and they wouldn't be opposed to it. 

Aside from disappointing them, I'm also spending all their money. I don't want to do that anymore. 

I honestly have no choice but to kill myself. I have two ways of doing it and I'm not afraid. I just don't know when. I plan on talking to my therapist at the university but I don't think it will help. I think death is my only option. I want my parents to be happy.

Edit: this isn't my reason, but it's the most recent. I got a lot of them.
