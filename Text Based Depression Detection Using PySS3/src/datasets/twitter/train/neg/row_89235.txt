think I'm gonna end it tonightit's 1am atm and I have lots of pills right next. I'm suffering from insomnia and I just want to get some sleep I am turning slowly insane. I'm very young I can't buy medicine or something like that and my mother won't buy nor allow me to consume any. I get it it could make u addicted and so on but I barely get sleep anymore, I'm so tired of everything I just want to sleep . I have no really friends who could miss me anymore and I'm no use for my family as well. 
can't do this anymore, I'm trying my best to only see the good in life but this doesn't work anymore I can't do this I just want to get some rest and if that's the only way I could get some I'm going to do it
