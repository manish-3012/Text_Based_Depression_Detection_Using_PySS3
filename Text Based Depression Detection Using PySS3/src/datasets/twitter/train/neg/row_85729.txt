Laying in bed crying like usual. Pain sucks. This road trip called life is a lot harder than I thought to drive. Anyone in their twenties wanna chat?It's been an incredibly dangerous and terrifying road I've traveled over my 23 years. 

Not many people understand the traveling I've done, how many road blocks I had to get through. That I'm driving down this road with a consistent flat tire with ppl saying I should be able to drive on it or fix the tire myself. But I can't; I'm stuck in the front seat with no energy, motivation, or even ability to get out and fix it. And even if I could I don't have a spare tire!! The engine is kinking out and my steering is becoming out of control. Wish I had a partner in my shotgun seat to go down this journey with me. Telling stories of our mental 'road trips' and how we're still driving despite the fact we kinda just want to drive the car into a tree or over a cliff, maybe connecting on something deeper where love can triumph our suffering and we can find a better road to drive on together.

That metaphor just came into my head, what do you guys think of it?  Do you relate? 

I'd love to chat to some people near my age, no one my age gets this life of pain and dealing with suicidal thoughts. Hell maybe we can be pain buddies and see where that goes.
