I feel like my antidepressants aren't working because I'm so lazy.I take my medication as prescribed, and I don't feel anything. My doctor tells me something along the lines of I have to do stuff for myself to be not depressed, and the medication alone won't make me feel better. But if I improved my life without the medication, I probably wouldn't need it. But I don't improve my life without medication, I'm too lazy and I never do anything. So I get the medication but I don't put in the "work" to feel better because I'm lazy. At the end of the day it's my fault I'm depressed and none of the medication I've tried has worked. It's my fault I don't have any marketable skills to get a real job, it's my fault I don't go and seek out those skills. The worst part is it's also my fault I haven't killed myself yet. I have the means and the know how to do it. I certainly get left alone long enough to pull it off, but I still won't do it for some reason. I'm so damn lazy I can't even take the easy way out
