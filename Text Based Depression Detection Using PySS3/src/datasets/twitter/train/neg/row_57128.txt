I hate my step fatherI have the worst step father ever. All he ever does is talk shit about me. I was explaining to my brother how I haven't had any luck with interviews and how today was the day I finally got one but my parents ruined it and I ended up missing my appointment. He felt bad and he mentioned how my step dad has been talking negatively about me to his customers. He said he called me a good for nothing lazy tub of lard. I believe my brother because it's not the first time he has said things like that about me. Ever since I was young he has always had something against me. He used to beat me because he didn't like my father. After my real dad passed he started beating me all the way up until my sophomore year of hs. I already have a lot of problems and it really sucks that he feels that way about me and talks that way about me to complete strangers. I hate him with everything that I have. I have cut so many times thanks to him. I try helping in the house and he always finds something so he can scream at me for. All I can do for now is cry. Idk what else to do. If my own parents put me down then who can I turn to for comfort?, I am afraid of being kicked out so I just take it I don't want to be on the street with my dog she shouldn't suffer because of me.
