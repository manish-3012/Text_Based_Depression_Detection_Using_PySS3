How do I tell my parents I am depressed, without coming out and telling them "I am depressed"?I am depressed, I have planned out how to tell my parents I am depressed, and I am willing to get help. The only problem is I don't just want to come out and say "Hey Mom, Dad, I am depressed." I want it to be subtle, but something they will understand (and if they don't understand, I will just come out and say it). Any ideas? Thank you for any suggestions you can offer.
