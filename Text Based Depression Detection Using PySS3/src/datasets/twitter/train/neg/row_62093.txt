2 voicesI'm posting from my main account so that if I'm alive and well in the future I can look back and see my growth and also for accountability. 

My thoughts are scaring me right now. I'm not depressed anymore but sometimes something takes over my mind. It's just a monster. I am incapacitated and it takes mental gymnastics to convince myself not just to grab the steak knife in the kitchen. I've been so uncomfortable for so long. I want to know myself. I feel like an imposter, or like a narcissist. I don't know if my perception is reality. 

I do know that this feeling will pass as it always has but it seems to be getting stronger and I'm scared that one day I'll get fucked up enough to go through with it because ultimately writing it out I know that I shouldn't kill myself because of various reasons. 

I disappoint myself daily. I don't know how to lower my standards. That's a problem. 

I don't know why my head wants me to kill myself. It feels like another entity. But also a part of me... like I'm a flower and it's a weed and our roots have tangled. Maybe it's the devil; I don't know. But I seriously need some spiritual health.
