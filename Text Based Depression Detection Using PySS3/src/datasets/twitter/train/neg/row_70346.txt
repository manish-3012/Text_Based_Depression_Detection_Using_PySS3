How Do I Tell My Parents?I just want to go to a psychiatrist because I want to help myself get better, but I have no clue how to tell my parents about how I feel.

My mom is a bit crazy when it comes to my health. She does everything to try to fix me, but thatâ€™s not what I want from her when dealing with this. I know itâ€™s a silly problem to have, but how do I manage to tell her and my dad when theyâ€™re both just going to treat me like a baby for the next year.

Please tell me your past experiences with opening up to family or close friends and give me tips on how to tell my family what is going on.
