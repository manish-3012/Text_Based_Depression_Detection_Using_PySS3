Would you leave a noteI have pretty severe BPD, and have been struggling with ideation for as long as I can remember.  I've written so many drafts of notes that I can think of distinct 'styles' to do - I could do a long one where I try to rationally explain, I could do short and sweet, a call-out note where I just air greivances, one where I just say a sentence like "sorry it came to this" or "please don't blame yourself".  Maybe I'll hang myself and just say "how's it hanging?"  One time during a particularly bad break I actually just started writing the intrusive thoughts on my walls.  I also think about not leaving one - would it even really make a difference?  

I've probably written about 5 drafts (not including the time with the wall) - 2 ended up being failed attempts, 1 was a near-attempt that I bailed out of at the last second, and I just deleted the other 2 so it'd be more tedious to go through with it.  I feel like I'll do it eventually, but I honestly just don't even care enough to go through with it these days.  I try to keep going for my family, but eventually I'm going to get exhausted of living for other people - I just pray it's after my parents pass.
