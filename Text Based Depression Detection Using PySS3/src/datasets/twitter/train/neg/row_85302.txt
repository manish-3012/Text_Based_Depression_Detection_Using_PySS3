Just lost my support systemI feel like Iâ€™ve just been abandoned by almost all of my friends because of a toxic relationship. I feel like Iâ€™ve been blamed for the way my toxic ex has treated me. I already felt so alone to begin with, because I couldnâ€™t ever depend on my family or partners in the past. Iâ€™m hanging on by a thread right now, and Iâ€™m afraid of losing other people in my life. I feel like Iâ€™m never going to get out of this toxicity in my life, that itâ€™s my fault I always choose â€œbadâ€ partners. I feel like thereâ€™s not light at the end, and itâ€™s better to end it now because no one is there for me now, and Iâ€™m tired of feeling alone.
