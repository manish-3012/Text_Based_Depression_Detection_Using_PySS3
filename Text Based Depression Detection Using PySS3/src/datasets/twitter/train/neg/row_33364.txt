Was I Wrong to Involve People When She Said Not To?My ex [22F] broke up with me [23M] 2 days ago. She did this because she felt guilt for cheating on me, and knew she wasn't ready to commit to a relationship. She was bullied a few years ago, and has more recently had trouble dealing with study, money and a busy schedule. Yesterday she told me that she was considering suicide. She said things like "I don't see any other way", "I'm a burden", "a horrible person", "goodbye".

 I am currently half way around the world from her and my initial feelings were absolute panic. I tried calling the embassy to see if I could get local emergency services to help her, that didn't work. I asked my friends to see if she was home. I told her sister, and asked her for help. I asked other people, without revealing details of the situation, if they knew where she was. This was all going on while I was trying to talk with her and go through the situation. 

She told me not to tell anyone, she was VERY clear about that. 

Now she's feeling better, she's talked to her parents about being upset, but not the full extent of the situation. But now she knows all the people I told, and she's angry. 

I need to know, did I do anything wrong? Could I have done better? I do feel somewhat guilty for involving her sister. But I still feel like preventing her possible death was the right thing to do, not just for others sake but her own.
