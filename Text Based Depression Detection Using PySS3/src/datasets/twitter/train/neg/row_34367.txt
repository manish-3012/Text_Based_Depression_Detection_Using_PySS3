90% sure I won't do it but...I'm pretty close. If I could guarantee it would be painless and sucessful I would do it.

I did the one thing I knew I shouldn't have. I let myself hope. I let my guard down and bought into the hope. I feel incredibly stupid. I should have known better. I let myself believe that it was possible. Right now my guilt is stronger than my urge to die, but I don't know how much more I can take. 

My husband is at his wits' end. His love for me is so fucking strong, and I feel like a shit for not being mentally healthy. All he wants is for me to be happy, and I'm pretty sure it's not possible.

He thinks I base happiness on things and when I don't get them I freak out. In a small way that's true, but it's only because I see how my life is, and how I want it to be. The problem is, where I want to be is unrealistic. Good things don't happen to me. 

I was told it would be hard work. But things also have to fall into place. I let myself work hard, through physical pain and even when nobody else was helping. And things just aren't falling into place. 

It would be better if I wasn't promised that THIS TIME it was real.

I'm just so sick of getting my hopes up and being disappointed.

I just want the pain to stop.

The only friend I have wants me to talk to her when I'm like this, but I feel horrible. Her life really sucks and mine really doesn't. My brain tells me does. I mean, she should be on Ellen getting a car and a giant pile of cash bad. But she listens to my selfish pettiness and talks me out of suicide. Her life sucks ass, and she still believes in God. She wants me to put it in His hands. 

I don't know what to do. Like I said, I'm 90% sure I won't kill myself. I just feel so helpless and alone.
