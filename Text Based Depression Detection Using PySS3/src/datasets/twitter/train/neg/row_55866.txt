Lost someone when you were a kid?I'm seeking stories from anyone who lost someone to suicide when they were a child. Like age 4-8. Old enough to remember, young enough to still have a really new, developing brain. Outside that range is welcome as well, of course, but now I'll explain.

I moved across the country for a friend. Not a partner, my best friend. I wanted to move to this region of the country anyway, and she was the reason I chose the city I did. I am now fully entwined in her life and those of her husband and three small children (6, 4, and 1). I love those kids. I love my friend. I love her husband platonically. They are the family I chose and they all love me unconditionally. I have loving parents and a sibling back in my hometown, plus many other close friends around the country and on another continent.

However, I am fairly confident I will be single forever. I'm in my early 30s; other details would make this post too long and are largely irrelevant. I have always been a depressed person and my poor life partner prospects compound this. There are other factors contributing to my mental illness as well. I have been trying for years to manage this with therapy and medication. There has been moderate success. However, I still fantasize about euthanasia for terminal depression. It just never seems to get that much better.

So I'm asking for help to not do have these thoughts. I know the adults in my life would never be the same either, but... Those kids. Would it really fuck them up? Or the adults more?

I could never hurt any of them like that. But for moments right now when I think about how everyone would all still have each other, I'm just an auxiliary family member and nobody's number one priority, while I'm temporarily hopeless and all I can think about is my own lifelong depression pain... Knock some sense into me by sharing your story. (Or make a case for euthanasia. I'm open to both, but maybe that should be a separate post.)
