Do you find any value in mental health services?You call and the earliest they can see you is five weeks from now. You wait those five weeks like a champ and your therapist doesn't connect at all, or just doesn't care. Wait anywhere from four to eight weeks to see that person again, or another five-week wait to switch to a new person (if available). Even if you finally find a good therapist, the turnover is ridiculous, and soon enough you get an e-mail telling you that your therapist has left and that you have to start over again.

That's not even getting to the medical side of "treating" depression, which is the equivalent of trying to solve a computer problem by randomly mashing different combinations of keys and hoping, somehow, that it works. 

And hell, that's if you HAVE health insurance. 

Am I just unlucky here? Is this what everyone goes through?
