Is A Third Attempt The Charm?I've tried twice before.  Obviously I failed, although second attempt docs said I was only a few MG away from lethal.  

I feel myself going down the same path.  Not out of hopelessness, but because I'm tired.  I'm emotionally tired.  

I have a unique condition that some would call a photographic memory.  It's a wonderful thing to have in academics, but life isn't academics.  Have you ever heard the saying: "Forgive and forget?"  Not only do I never forget, but my mind also conjures up the emotions attached to the memory.  I mentally cannot forgive because if I remember how somebody hurt me, I instantly feel the same pain I felt the day they hurt me.  This is all but killed my capacity to love, because with love, even healthy love, comes pain.  Think of it this way, you see a scar on your body.  Imagine reliving the pain the wound created. 

The medication I'm on numbs me, but I've come off of it.  So the pain has returned.  So I'm tired.  I feel like I've done the best I can and I just really don't want to do it anymore.  I really don't.
