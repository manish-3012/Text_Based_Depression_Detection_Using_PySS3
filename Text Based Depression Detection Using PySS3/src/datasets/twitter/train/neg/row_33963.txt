Car crash last week, evicted tomorrow, exam in a few days.I'm very worried about myself, I can't function, I have a uni exam in a few days and I'm so stressed I can't even study, I can't eat, these are the darkest days of my life. 

I had psychosis this morning, talking to people who weren't there, having phone calls I never had. I had dark thoughts earlier, now that I'm lucid I won't do anything but I'm worried.
