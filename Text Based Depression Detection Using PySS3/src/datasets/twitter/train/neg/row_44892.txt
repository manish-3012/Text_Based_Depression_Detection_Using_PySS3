Come to think of it, there is no good reason NOT to do it.I'm sick of all the fucking hippies who never had a shitty day in their lives telling me how beautiful life is and how it's my fault I'm in my shitty situation. I'm sick of seeing people who are having it well and enjoying their lives, while mine is a disaster. I'm sick of failing at every little thing I try and being a continuous disappointment to my family, as much as everyone else around me. I'm sick of going to bed every night hoping I'll never wake up. I'm sick of looking around and not finding one damn reason to continue this miserable existence.

And don't tell me about the sweet girl I will marry in a few years or the great job that I will score if I don't off myself. I really doubt that either of them is going to happen and, if you tell me about them, you're only giving me false hopes, which is the worst thing you could to to someone in my situation.

My mom(which I haven't seen in months, since I don't live with my family anymore) is coming to visit me for a few days next week. I'm gonna spend some great days with her, then, when I drop her off at the airport, I'm gonna give her a hug and tell her how much I love her. Then, after she boards, I'm going to drown myself in the river.

Fuck it, this life is just not worth living. I'd be better off dead.
