fuck end me fuck fuck Iâ€™ve hit rock bottom fuckJust when I thought things couldnâ€™t get worse they did, I keep finding myself spiralling into despair. I feel like even when Iâ€™ve thought Iâ€™ve had the worst day ever, I somehow manage to dig an even greater hole where Iâ€™ll be in deeper shit than ever before. And rinse and repeat. Fuck this I want out, they say things get better with time, I say things canâ€™t get any worse when you cease to exist.
