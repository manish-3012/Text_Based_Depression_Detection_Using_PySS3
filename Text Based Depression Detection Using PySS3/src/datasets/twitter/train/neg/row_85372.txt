I can't keep lying to myselfI'm overcome with emotional pain that I struggle to cope with. I've picked back up with cutting, something I hadn't done in 6 years. I've wasted the last two years building a relationship with someone who it was obvious didn't want a future with me. It was long distance, but he's been tellin me he loves me for the past year. I knew things were coming to an end, but I wanted one last visit before things were ended. 4 days after I buy his ticket to come here, he tells me he's coming as a friend and is already seeing someone else. I don't know if I can live another day with this pain. Giving up sounds so relieving. I don't know how to make the pain stop or even go away for a little while. Cutting helps but I know it's terrible. I'm afraid to turn to alcohol because I don't want to develop an addiction. It's getting harder to see pics of them together on Facebook. Every time she posts on his wall or he mentions her name, I cut. The cuts just keep getting worse. He's the only one who knows I've picked this back up. He's told me hates me but that it would destroy him if I killed myself. He says he doesn't care about me but tells me I'm pathetic for cutting and wishes I wouldn't do it anymore. I know this is just a jumbled rant, but I'm afraid by not saying out loud I wish I could die it might consume me. His plane lands Wednesday. Tonight I considered telling him not to come because I might try and act on my feelings in the next couple days. I wish I didn't love him. I wish I loved myself. I wish I knew how to want to live again. I don't know how much longer I have left.
