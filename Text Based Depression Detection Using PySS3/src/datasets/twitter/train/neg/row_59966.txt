I had a dreamLast night I had a dream of a happier time, a time I'll will never return to .

I'm 17 ,friendless, futurless and hopless . For the last two years my life has been a downward spiral everything my anxiety told me would go wrong has . And last night I dreamt of a time when I was truly happy ,I was 15 had friends ,had some sort of a future planed and most importantly I had real prospects of success.  The dream was of no particular moment just time I spent with friends .in the time since then I've, failed to get onto A-levels ,put back on any weight I lost in the previous years ,i told myself i would come out t9 my parents but the idea of that only drifts further away as i see them for who they really are ,ive lost contact with  friends and drifted away from family and I'm about to fail my second choice course ,not because I can't because I won't. I just don't care anymore . Why should I no one really cares about me ,they see my pathetic attempt at looking happy and leave me to it .no one questions me when I don't attended college for 2 weeks ,no asks why I sleep all day or never leave the house . And now the prospect of growing older terrifies me how much further will I fall ?

I guess my dream was the final tipping point ,it shew me just how far I've fallen in just two years what will I be like in another two if I decide to stick around ? Even worse than today ? Death seems like the only way to stop myself falling and to maybe be rember for what i was like befor and for people to see my pain to really understand how I feel today .
