One of my best friends killed himself, and I don't know how to handle it.I haven't seen him in over a year, but when we were in college together, he was always so happy and kind to everyone, even if those people were dickheads to everyone else. Not a single bad bone in his body. 

I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and ideation on a number of occasions, and have attempted to take my life a few times as well. When I was suicidal back in year 10/11 (when I last made a post here, ages ago I know), it was my friend who got me through and helped me on my feet. 

I found out today (Wednesday), but it was Monday that he had done it. No one told me, but it was from my sister's friend's brother (who told his sister, told my sister and then me) that I found out.

Now, thankfully I haven't felt suicidal for a couple of months, and instead of any anxiety it's just been explosive + repressed anger, so I'm in a right state. I'm not angry at him for killing himself, but he was still at the same college I was at, and if it ends up being the college at fault for not dealing or helping him, I think I'm going to do something bad.

I always thought it'd be me who'd commit suicide out of anyone I knew, but when I found out my friend had died, a part of me wish I had died instead. I'm speechless, numb. I've no idea what or when any funeral is taking place, but I'm also going to Ireland for a holiday on Friday, so hopefully this will give me some peace of mind and allow me to process this.

For someone to have been suicidal numerous times before, and then lose someone to suicide when you'd last expect it, I need some guidance on what to do.
