Iâ€™m never going to be happy.Explaining my situation would take ages so Iâ€™ll try to summarize. My father, who my mother loved so much, broke her heart multiple times and left her a single mom with me. My grandpa helped to raise me until I turned 12, when he died. My mom has used me as the adult essentially, I have to bring her even the smallest things, like glasses of ice water and the remote when itâ€™s out of her reach. She isnâ€™t handicapped, sheâ€™s just lazy. When I was a kid sheâ€™d do this too, and sheâ€™d force me to take things to my grandpa even though he would always try to bail me out and stop her and do things for himself. Since he canâ€™t protect me, she does what she wants. (Iâ€™m 21 now.). I canâ€™t go to even female friendsâ€™ houses because she doesnâ€™t trust other peopleâ€™s driving and if she doesnâ€™t know the person super well she doesnâ€™t trust them. I was allowed to a friend of mines a couple times, and only for a couple hours, she came and picked me up even when I asked for more time. My best friend and love of my life lives with my mom and I, has for almost 3 years, but weâ€™re never allowed alone in the house together (heâ€™s a guy) and when we hang out she has to be in the room. (Thereâ€™s so much more to all of this but this is the basis). Iâ€™m not even allowed to accept rides to work from my male coworker because I â€˜shouldnâ€™t be in a car with a guy alone.â€™ I donâ€™t have my license or means of a car. I have to work part time because I take online classes and my mom doesnâ€™t want me â€˜overworking myself.â€™ She calls my bosses if they work me over 20 hours. Iâ€™m a laughing stock at work.  Now Iâ€™m on leave because of this virus, and Iâ€™m stuck with just her 24/7. Iâ€™ve been talking about marriage lately, as she doesnâ€™t allowing dating in her house and so me and my best friend canâ€™t have a label. She knows weâ€™re in love and plan to marry. But Iâ€™m not allowed to make any plans. Today I asked to show her wedding dresses and she got mad at me, and asked me very disgusted why Iâ€™d want to look at them. Iâ€™m just so sick of my life. I have no freedom and she has me genuinely convinced I couldnâ€™t live on my own. My bf and I have had to discuss how she can live with us when weâ€™re married and raising a family, because Iâ€™m afraid of being on my own without her. Now I feel my only way out is dying. Iâ€™m too afraid to leave, and i dont know how i would survive.  I have no car, and not a well paying job. Iâ€™ve had chronic depression and anxiety since I was 12, and experienced a lot of suicidal thoughts and self harm. Lately the self harm has been worse and Iâ€™ve been genuinely considering suicide. It seems my only way out of this life. Itâ€™ll never get better. I thought itâ€™d get better at 18, at 19, at 20, at 21. Itâ€™ll never get better. I might as well just die.
