itâ€™s useless.my friends try to reach out. But theyâ€™re tired. And so am I. just fuck it. My trauma? People tell me it was meant to be a lesson. Or that I evolve from it. But all itâ€™s led me is down this path every single time. 
Hurting myself, hurting on the inside.
Iâ€™m trapped, Iâ€™m fucking trapped in this cycle, this abyss. Where I canâ€™t fucking escape. My abusers, my rapists, every single person who hurt me. Circling around me, telling me that this world isnâ€™t worth it. Because in reality Iâ€™ll never get the justice I deserve. And I just need to escape.
