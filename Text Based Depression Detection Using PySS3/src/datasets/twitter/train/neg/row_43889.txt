Can't kill myself because I have too many responsibilities that affect others. But that is the only reason.Last semester of college I was going to do it, but I was put under a 10-13 which is mandated hospitalization against my will. I was going to do it. But then I was put on meds and stuff. I was feeling better for a while, but I have lost 15 pounds and can't even look at food 90% of the time and I think not eating brings my mood down a lot. And now I can't afford my medicine so not taking it for a couple weeks might be a factor as well.

Anyways. I came to ask if anyone has had similar reasons to live. I am a member of 6 different organizations on campus and a leader in 4 of them. Often times, I am a bit of a perfectionist so I spend a lot of effort on anything I do and am pretty bad at delegating big or important things. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because these organizations would fall or struggle without me. But I am just so tired of living and yet horrified that student activities are my only real reason for living. 

I don't know what I am asking, but I guess I am just scared.
