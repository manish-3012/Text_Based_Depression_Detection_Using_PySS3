No More AnchorsFor majority of my life I've had a deep seated want to end my life. However, I've always felt there's been just enough anchors in my life that kept me from doing so (I've only been close once). But I don't have any now. Don't have any people that care about me (which is very fair given my fuckups), no place I feel safe, no thing I feel attached to anymore. I think I'm finally ready to do it--my life was only going to go downhill from here anyways.
