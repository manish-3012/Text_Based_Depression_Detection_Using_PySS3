No one actually cares about me.It just seems like as I just have friends for the sake of it. They don't seem to actually care about me in any shape or form.

I technically am part of several circles. Though I am always that guy that is there, because "an even number is better".  
Countless people have received my help throughout  depression, sometimes even suicidal thoughts. Yet no one seem to be bothered about me. Whenever I open out to the slightest degree, people change the topic. How come people for which I was the only real help, for which I went out of my way just so they can dump me after they are fine. Sometimes as far as literally completely avoid me.

I feel like some dump-fire ignited by the sole need for "having someone so I am not bored lol".

Everything is shit. I can't even have actual friends. Friends who actually care. Screw this.
