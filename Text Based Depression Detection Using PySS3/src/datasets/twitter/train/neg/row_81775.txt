Drunk enough to likely try something again.I lost my job as a manager with AT&amp;T corporate offices because a bunch of my employees hated me, and then a bunch of female employees lied a couple weeks after I asked my girfriend to marry me and said I was sexually harassing them. I was fired without uestion and now cant seam to get or keep a job, went from making over 60k a year to not making more then 3k in the last 18 months, i have attempted suicide twice. First time I got drunk and tried to drown myself, my mother (whom me and my fiance were forced to move back in with) found me, being a nurse she resuscitated me I lied and said i was just taking a "bath". Second time i took a bunch of oxyxontin drunk again and my Fiance heard me in the middle of the nigh puking (2 months ago) tonight im drunk because my birthday is tomorrow and on the 22nd if i cant pay my  $366 car payment i will lose it, i just want to drink enough to take the no way out, way out. Kinda makes it feel like im not leaving a note, but maybe if anyone really cares they can could search hard enough to find my post, since this isnt a throw away account.
