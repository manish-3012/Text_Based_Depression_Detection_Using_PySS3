I feel like the option to kill myself has been taken away from me. I'm fucking livid right now.I've had depression and suicidal thoughts for practically my whole life. I went to my weekly therapy session yesterday and near the end, she asked me if I was suicidal. I said yes and told her not to tell my parents. Later that night, I catch my dad on the phone talking to her about it. She lied to me and went behind my back. That's the first time I've ever seen my dad cry.


I don't know why, but I always took comfort in knowing there was a way out. I feel like I don't have that way anymore. I've already given up on myself. The only reason I'm living is for them. I don't feel like my own person anymore, I just feel like my parents son.


I've never had a normal life and I never will. I'm not normal. I'm different from everyone else. This is just making it worse. I don't like the life I was given. I don't want to live it. I fucking hate it.


I don't even know what to do anymore. I just can't take it any longer
