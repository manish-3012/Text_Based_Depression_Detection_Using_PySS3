Planning my demise.I've come to the conclusion that no matter what, i'll never be happy. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm a great dad to my one year old daughter but I feel like I'm just going to let her down in the long run. The mother of my child physically and mentally abuses me. I have no job, no confidence, and the anti depressants I'm taking are not working. My plan is to try and source some heroin and overdose on it. At least then I will be comfortable in death.
