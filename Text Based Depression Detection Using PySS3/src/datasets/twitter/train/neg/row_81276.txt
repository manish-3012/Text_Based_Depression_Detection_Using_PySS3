Anxious and WorriedI was in class and there was this girl that said "If anyone ruins my photo I'm going to kill them." (She was taking a photo to finish a documentation) And I said "Dosen't matter cause I want to die anyways."  Now that was my fuck-up. She turns to me and says "Ehm, was that a joke or for real?" I turn silent. She starts worrying about me and I finally say that I've already been suicidal for 7 years. She then says "Don't think about that. You're a great person and many people like you." After that I get all shaky and we go back to what we were doing. The entire lesson I blasted music into my ears because I just felt so bad for that and I was worrying that this would spread to my friends and I didn't want sympathy. Now I am super anxious and worried for tomorrow. This girl is quite nice also and I liked her a bit.

Sorry if I spelled something wrong btw. English isn't my first language.

EDIT : I think she forgot already, don't know atleast she hasn't talked to me yet. I hope so.
