17 year old guy Feeling down after getting yelled at by my parents for procrastinating on my online work, thinking about buying my first acoustic guitar.So my mom just beat me after she found me up at 5 a.m. still on the computer doing my homework. Would buying an acoustic guitar and making time for myself make me feel better?
