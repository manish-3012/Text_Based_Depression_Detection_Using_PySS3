i just wanna die right nowso im a 20 yo male from morocco an introvert and a complete failure.

im a student in CPGE where you study for 2 years in order to have a contest where based on it you can get access to multiple engineering universities based on your ranking last year i did it i had a really bad ranking so i thought to myself if i redo it next year i would get a better ranking that i would be satisfied with so fast forward i just received my ranking and its fucking terrible i know some of you would think thats not a reason to make you wanna kill yourself but for me it is whats making me even more devastated is thinking how am i supposed to tell this to my mother.

ps: sorry for my bad english
