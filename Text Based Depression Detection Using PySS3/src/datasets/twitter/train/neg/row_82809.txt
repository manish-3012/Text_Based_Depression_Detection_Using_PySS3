Sometimes I wonderSometimes I wonder if death is better. College is getting too much for me, and even if I graduate, I'll be in massive debt. I don't know if I even have what it takes to survive in this world. My mom ruined that for me by keeping me isolated as a child. And the majority of my family doesn't really care about me. I don't like my skin color anyway, and the only way to get rid of it is to bleach it, which will be damaging. What's the point in being alive when you don't even like the appearance you're born with? But every time I think of suicide, I hear the ringing bell on the collar of my kitten. If I didn't have the kitten, I probably wouldn't mind taking my own life.
