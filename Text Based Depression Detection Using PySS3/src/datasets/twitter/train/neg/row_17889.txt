How do I live?So many emotions, but I'm empty at the same time.

I'm broken, and half the time I just want to go quietly in the night

I fail, and I keep failing, I've lost myself, lost control of my life.

How do I fix myself, how do I learn to live with myself?

People say you have to love yourself and learn to be alone, but I don't feel I can, and I only suffer in loneliness.

I'm happiest when I'm making others happy.    
I'm at my best when I'm bettering other people's lives.    
I live to help others live.

I simply go to waste, and feel useless when I have nothing to do, no motivation, and no woman to love me, and accept me as I am.

Edit: To clarify, I have ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, anger management issues, low self esteem, little motivation, I'm physically unfit, but fit enough to ride long distances.
