Do you know the feeling when everything goes as expected? Me neither lol.I don't really know where to start. The last 14 days have been a roller coaster of emotions. I've finally managed to talk to doctors about my conditions and well.. Looks like I'm manic-depressive/bipolar. Great, right? I guess that makes sense. That explains my ups and downs. I also 'came out' to my family and told them about my mental health, the self-harming and the suicidal shit. Didn't work out as planned. My mom had something like a breakdown, blaming herself the entire time and stuff like this. You get the deal. It's a stressful situation for me and I feel like depression is eating me up from the inside more and more. I knew it was a bad idea to tell my family - I still did it and fucked up. I feel more isolated than before.

I'll probably end it tonight.
