Tell me something I haven't heard before. Every  day of my life is pain. I get no enjoyment from anything and I have no  energy or motivation to do anything. I barely have enough to get out of  bed. I've been like this for years and nothing has changed no matter  what I try. There's no hope for me I'm never going to find anything to  help. I don't want to keep living like this. I have no reasons to live  anyway. I have no responsibilities, my friends hardly remember I exist,  I'm worthless. Why should I keep living when I feel like total shit both  mentally and physically every single day? And don't try to tell me "it  gets better" I've heard that 1000 times already. It hasn't gotten  better. Why should I even continue? Just the vague hope that it might  get better some day? Just because people who barely remember I exist  claim to care about me?
