How to live?hello, i'm a 28, almost 29 year old, guy i guess, I'm transgender but i dont really have any hopes of transitioning, i'm not bad looking, i'm just a bit overweight, tall, by all accounts i'm a decent looking guy. anyway basically I dont have any friends, never had, i always hated school, dropped out of highshool twice until i finally managed to graduate when i was 21, one of the reasons i hated school was because they didn't let me have long hair, now at 29 i find not much has changed, i can't hold down a job because the only thing were i can work are call centers, i live in guatemala city btw, honestly i would have liked to work at a hotel, i'm good with tourists, and i enjoy interacting with them. the problem is that im not allowed to have long hair anywhere i go, and every job that i've tried to apply to outside of call centers never hires me, i've been suicidal and depressed for a while, i have been seeing a psychologist and i'm on zoloft. the only thing that keeps me here and a bit sane is cannabis, which ofc is illegal where i live and bars me from a lot of jobs. 

anyway, i was feeling horrible like 10 mins ago and considering suicide again, unfortunately right now i'm out of cannabis which usually calms me down so it was really rough. I'm feeling a little better now, but i still feel really lost, i really dont know how to "live"

today i'm starting a new job in sales which im dreading, I hate these jobs, I hate getting hate just because i'm not a native english speaker, call center jobs are miserable, but i literally can't even find a job at mcdonalds, not to mention that over here a lot of the jobs that i would be able to do are restricted to "female" like even things that make no sense, like for a candy shop cashier, they only want women working there, and it's the same everywhere.

I need adult friends to coach me on how to like, do things, but of course i'm really bad at making friends and even worse at keeping them so

tl;dr i guess: how do i get a job i don't dread? how do i move to a new city (antigua guatemala)? 

idk what else to ask but if anyone has some time to spare on me, i would like a sort of "life mentor" so to speak who can teach me all this stupid adult stuff that i dont know how to do
