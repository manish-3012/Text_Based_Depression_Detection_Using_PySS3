Do you think our bodies need to be intact if there is an afterlife?The only method available to me will likely decapitate me and I'm worried that I will be how my body died for ever. Do you think that I would be sent to hell for killing myself? I think I already succeeded in killing myself a previous time and now I am stuck in some kind of hell or limbo and I can never leave. A lot of the time I am like a ghost and people wont even notice that I am there
