Anyone gonna shoot themselves to commit suicide?Because I have a plan ready to go and I just want to make sure everything goes well.

And suicide would be good to escape nuclear war,no?

I mean,when the world goes all fucking mad max/fallout,most of us are gonna die anyway,so who gives a fuck?

What's a good gun caliber to commit suicide with?
