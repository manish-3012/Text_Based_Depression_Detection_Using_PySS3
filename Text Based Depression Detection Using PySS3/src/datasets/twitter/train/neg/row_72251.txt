Computer games are a drug; and I am a parasiteI'm not suicidal, but if I knew I could commit suicide under certain conditions (my family would be physically alright without me, I wouldn't go to hell, etc.) I wouldn't hesitate to do it. I'm probably going to rant, I understand if the mods delete this or people downvote it into oblivion. 

&amp;nbsp;

My parents divorced when I was a kid. My father? Hardworking middle/upper class but has some personality/abusive issues which caused my mother to leave him. Has a loving and supportive family. My mother? Virtuous to a fault, but abused in different ways (mostly emotional/verbally) by her family/ex-family. Her brother doesn't care about her, she only has 2 children (me and my brother).

&amp;nbsp;

Me? Given everything. Good looks, intelligence and opportunities to go to school debt free from my father. I was a naughty kid, and this caused some family members to prefer my brother over me (and spoil him/treat me unfairly). This caused me to become mature at an earlier age relative to my peers (believe it or not, asides from being lazy, I have very few other "negative" faults. I accept criticism well and thanks to my mother, have learned many lessons at a young age). Annoying as a kid, I was bullied in middle school. Became silent/cold, high school was pretty good. Had some friends, but was socially autistic. Also, friends introduced me to League of Legends. Became addicted to the game. Didn't have to study to get good grades and a decent SAT score. Got into a great program at a great state university. 

&amp;nbsp;

Life goes downhill as predicted by my mother. Addicted to computer games and used to not studying for grades, I quickly brought down my university grades. Failed out of the program (but not out of the university), I clung onto my games and stayed in my dorm everyday. 4 years of University, wasted. Making up the excuse that said program was not for me, I looked to law school. Took the LSAT repeatedly without studying, got a mediocre score. Scraped by into a mediocre law school. A new life? A second chance? I made excuses and remained hopeful as ever.   


&amp;nbsp;

Now 2 years into law school, my gaming habits have not changed despite repeated emphasis by my family members to quit gaming, study hard and live life. Mediocre and bad law school grades due to gaming and not studying. Scraped some mediocre summer internships after my 1st year. I recognized that my life was going downhill long ago, but I kept making excuses and not changing my habits.

&amp;nbsp;

Presently, I have no summer job (due to applying late and having terrible grades). My mother just now practically disowned me (not actually) (she told me to do something, equivalent to spending my day sitting at a desk b/c that's better than wasting my day playing games) and I thought it was a stupid idea (to be clear, I'm not opposed to working; I just oppose wasting my time doing nothing vs doing something; but I know my mother is right). I love my mother, she deserves a better son than me (after all she's gone through). My father deserves better too (at the very least, a hardworking son). I have contemplated suicide, but because I know my mother depends on me, I have not done anything. I also know, suicide is dumb, and people regret it at the last moment. 

&amp;nbsp;

I know I'm lazy and have squandered my opportunities. My life isn't ruined yet; I can still "pull it around" by working hard. I'm still young after all. I know what I have to do. Quit games, study hard, exercise, socialize, etc. Doing it is hard though, when you have no friends/family to actually work with you. My father works day and night, I haven't lived with my mother since high school. I have some friends, but no actual exclusive best friend. I haven't had a single girlfriend (I've had many opportunities, but being socially autistic I basically purposely ignored all of them). 

&amp;nbsp;

I am well aware that I have had SO many opportunities that other people in this world would KILL for. I'm not oblivious or ungrateful. Maybe I took it for granted. I know people are starving. I know I had it easy. I wish I could go back 10 years and never get into computer games. Games are literally another form of drugs. Anything that can get addicting (drugs/games/gambling/etc.) is dangerous to life. Don't get into it kids.
