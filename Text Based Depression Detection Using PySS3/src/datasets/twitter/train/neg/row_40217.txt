So many problems and no solutionsHey,

I am currently 18 years old and have been suffering from avoidant personality disorder and depression for a long time now. For about 5 years now, my life has been a total mess. I stopped socializing with all of my friends, stopped leaving the house because of severe anxiety and panic attacks. This caused me to drop out of school very early after so many years working hard to get good grades, now it's all for nothing. The past years were a loop of staying inside for months and then being forced to stay in a locked psych ward for a few months before continuing the loop again.

My mum kicked me out, I ran away from the psych ward, the police, suicide attempts, so so many panic attacks, my life is barely worth living. I can't even go out the front door without breaking down in a panic. I rarely have any money, the relationship with my mum is totally ruined, she HATES me and doesn't want to understand my problems.

I am just wasting away currently, haven't left the house in half a year, don't even manage to shower regulary, I hate my body. I have an infection which I really need medical attention for or it will kill me, but I can't go outside and nobody knows, everything is ruined.

I also have a history of drug abuse, which almost killed me, now I have mild permanent brain damage. Recently some drugs got caught in the mail by customs and now I will probably have to pay a big fine or appear in court and I can't do that and I don't know what will happen.

Some days I dont even eat because I don't have food or food money or cant get myself to go out to buy something. I am a total mess and everything that can be wrong is wrong. I cannot recover from all of this. I will end it very soon. Sorry.
