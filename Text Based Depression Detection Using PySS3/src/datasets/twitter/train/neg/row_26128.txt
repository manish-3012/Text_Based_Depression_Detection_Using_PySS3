You fucked up. Now give up.Youâ€™ve always been an overdramatic motherfucker. You screwed up in spectacular fashion this time. Now keep up your streak and die properly. You wrote a letter. You said goodbye. You listened to all your favourite songs for the last time. You didnâ€™t tell that guy in the lab that you wouldnâ€™t be in but your mama will call Shannon and Shannon will sort it. Shannon is a better mama than your mama. But she hasnâ€™t been here recently to listen. Nobody has. Youâ€™ve been alone and youâ€™ve been angry and you just need out. Do it quiet and clean. No more pills and no more blades. I know itâ€™ll remind your mum of your uncle but even you canâ€™t fuck up a good asphyxiation. I hope they find you but I hope they donâ€™t. I hope they donâ€™t judge you too hard on your tattoos and the weight you lost because everything was so shit. I hope theyâ€™re happy now. I hope youâ€™ll be happy. This is what youâ€™ve wanted for so long. Just get the fuck out of the bath and go home. You were never built to survive.
