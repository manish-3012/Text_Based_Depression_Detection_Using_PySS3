Depression at age 13-14I see a lot of depressed 13-14 year olds online and that made me think about how 13-14 is around the time I got really depressed too. I used to be very happy and optimistic as a child, even though I didn't have any friends, was living in poverty, and suffered emotional abuse from my parents I still looked forward to waking up everyday and I think positively even in horrible situations. And then when I turned 13-14 all of my optimism and energy are just gone almost overnight and I'm now extremely whiny and negative. There were no drastic change in my life, I didn't lose any friends or family or get abused or anything. I just suddenly became really depessed for no reason at all. Did anyone else go through the same thing? What about being 13-14 make so many kids depressed? I'm very curious
