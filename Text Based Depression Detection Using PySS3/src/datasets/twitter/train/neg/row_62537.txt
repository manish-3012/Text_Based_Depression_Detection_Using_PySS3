I really need helpSo I've browsed reddit usually this sub so I know a little but I've tried all of my options today and nothing has helped so I made an account maybe someone can relate and talk to me help me through the night. My wife who I love and wanted to genuinely wanted to spend the rest of my life with is apparently a lesbian or gay whatever she identifies as regardless I'm having quite a bit of trouble with it. I've had depression my whole life and it has poised many difficulties with our marriage but now I feel like it's making my heartbreak worse than it normally is most times I don't feel justified in not wanting to live for my basically average problem but I can't deal with her not being here let alone someone I've never known please tell me someone can help me tonight because I feel like I've reached my breaking point and I can't stop thinking about dying tonight I have the means but I'm trying to resist because of my daughter and I just need someone with me here
