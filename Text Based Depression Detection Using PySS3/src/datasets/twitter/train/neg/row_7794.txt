I need help not killing myselfHello, redditors! I'm a suicidal teenager and I need help.

The reason I can't go on anymore is loneliness. I'm a Forever Alone guy, and while I'm aware that I'm really young, I can't take it anymore. Go out: couples. Go to high school: couples. Go on social media: couples. Due to my personality and my physical aspect, I've never had a girlfriend, never kissed or held hands with a girl and never did anything romantic. No girls ever want to be around me.

Over the years, this problem of mine has managed to destroy my mental health more and more, inducing depression and anxiety.

I feel like I will never have a significant other, and I can't live with that thought.

Like most, if not all teenagers, I have a crush on a girl. I fall asleep and wake up thinking about her, creating imaginary scenarios in which we are together in my mind. But then I realize that it is a dream that will never come true.

And it's not only her. No girl I ever approached seemed to have an interest in me (and I don't judge them. Were I a girl, I wouldn't be with someone like me either).

I can't imagine living 4-6 more decades like this. Whenever I see a couple I just want to burst into flames and die once and for all.

This has completely drained my will to live. It's really unfair how some people are born with good looks and other good features while I'm the sum of the worst possible features.

Whenever I go out with the three friends I have I walk with my head down so I don't have to see all the happy couples. It takes all I have not to burst into tears when I see couples kissing.

I'm sorry for the blogpost.

Edit: Thank you for answering! I managed to get rid of my suicidal thoughts and depression, and will now work harder on getting a relationship.
