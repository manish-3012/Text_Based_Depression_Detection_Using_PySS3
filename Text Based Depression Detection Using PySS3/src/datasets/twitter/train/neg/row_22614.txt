I hate myself...People tell me I'm talented, I'm gifted, I'm a "cool guy"...

...but I just can't bring myself to "accept" those kinds of compliments.

I feel like everything I do is bound to end in failure. I'm slipping up in pretty much everything I do at this point, to where I start to ask myself "why I do even bother continuing to do this?" I have been told over and over that I'm just not "good enough", by teachers and colleagues, that I'm just "wasting my time".

I personally find myself to be just an annoyance to people. My friends are starting to ignore me more and more and I recently lost a friend after he told me that he didn't want to be around me anymore because he thought I was an annoying twat around him. Making new friends is an extremely hard task for me because I'm very socially awkward, and I don't have many interests in anything these days, which makes it rather hard for me to have much in common with anyone.

I don't even think my family cares much about me. My parents don't even say they "love" me anymore or show any form of affection. I am always ignored during family meetings. My mom sold my car without my consent and stole $4000 of my financial aid refund for her personal gain.

I have tried to talk with others about it, but I never found it helpful. In fact, my depression is actually starting to annoy my friends to where they tell me not to make it a habit, whenever I act up. No one really asks "what's wrong?" or "how can I help?" They just don't care anymore. Are they really my friends anymore?

All this led me to believe that I'm nothing more than just an annoying twat who always fails at "simple things" and is just not "good enough". I hate myself and I don't understand I even still have friends, or as they so say they are. I've considered suicide many times and attempted it a few times in the past.
