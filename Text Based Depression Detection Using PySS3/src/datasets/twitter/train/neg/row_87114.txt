Pls help me, I guess??Hello, I'm F18 and recently graduated HS. I always thought that leaving school would make me appreciate life more but I have come to realise that, although school was a factor, it isn't entirely at fault. 
I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts and the only thing stopping me is bcs I haven't decided how to off myself yet. I don't know if I'm over reacting or not but I really am so tired and I just wanna stop living. There's about 7 billion people in this world, and me being gone won't really be a crisis, i guess. And I know that I should talk to someone like a family member, or a friend or even call the suicide hotline but everytime I gather the courage to do so, I back out last minute and, not only is mental illness taboo in my culture, I don't think they'd understand me and just tell me to "get over it" or "just get better". If you can pls tell me why I should keep living or atleast console me and tell me that it will get better, pls do it.


TLDR; I want to kill myself so pls give me a reason to live.
