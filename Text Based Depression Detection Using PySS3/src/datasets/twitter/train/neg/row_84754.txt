25m, i just don't want to anymore.my whole life has been a series of closing doors, i know how that sounds, missed oppertunities abound oh no!

i just feel so stuck, and i can fathom completely the future of the people around me and their lives, i can live it out in my mind and its just disapointing, i just dont want it anymore, this burdon of conciously processing everything and making bad decisions good decisions it just doesnt matter anymore.

love has left me bereaved and any connection i make will end eventually.

i just dont want to do anything, im just done.

i figure the easiest way to do it considering my family is to poison myself, i am a chemical engineer, ive got what i need already, just need to swallow.

this is i guess a cry for help or for someone to help me see some better side, Reddit has always been a nice refuge, so i think ill confide in you one last time.
