will i ever stop thinking about her?i feel so pathetic. if i would have acted out and done it, i would have betrayed my family and friends. over this. im not ever going to do it, i couldnt imagine how broken those who care about me would be. but i cant keep living like this. its not the end of the world, not even close, but it feels like it. i want to live again, i just sleep, smoke cigarettes, watch media i dont pay attention to and hit refresh to see if she messaged me. i get it. its pathetic, i should move on. if it was only that easy. somebody just please tell me, have you ever gone through this? this breakup is killing me. will i know when i stop thinking about her? will it happen? what are some ways that helped you? i was so motivated to do things, now i just lay here and wait for old age. why cant she just tell me she doesnt have feelings anymore. i cant let go of the smallest bit of hope despite how obvious she doesnt want me anymore. she tells me she wants me in her life, that she misses me, she thinks about me and fantasizes about me. but she shows the opposite. its been month after month of excuses for not talking. its been a week since she last messaged me, when she said she thinks about me a lot and fantasizes about me. again nothing, didnt bring up when we could talk. just radio silence, again and again. i really needed to ramble. any advice welcome, even the obvious if thats what you got. thanks for your time.
