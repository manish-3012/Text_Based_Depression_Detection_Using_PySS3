Worthless person whose just a waste of space.I am such a worthless human being... I canâ€™t do anything right; somehow every decision I make is wrong and I just destroy everyoneâ€™s life around me by being here. Everyone would be better of with me gone. Iâ€™m a waste of time, money, emotion.. Iâ€™m a drain... and I deserve to be dead.. I should have been a long time ago..
