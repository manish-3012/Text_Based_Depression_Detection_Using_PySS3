Threatened with compulsory treatmentThis is so unreal. My psychiatrist is threatening me talking about how if I don't get better soon I'll get permanent brain damage and they'll have to put me into compulsory treatment to prevent me from killing myself.

I'm so fucking done with this shitty fucking world we live in. Excuse my swearing but I'm so tired and so done.

My life would turn to hell if they do this to me, as if it wasn't already. It would leave me so fucked up and if they put me into treatment and monitoring they could prevent me from killing myself. Either I need to do it now or I'll have to live through hell.
