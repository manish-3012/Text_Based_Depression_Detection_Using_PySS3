Depressed girl looking for an alternative to cuttingSo i'm 17 years old, i live in the UK and i've been clean from cutting for 116 days (Please don't congratulate me, or say "stay strong"). Technically i'm not self-harm free, i punch myself on the daily, so hard that i sometimes think i've broken bones. I'm always in agony. I need an alternative to cutting because i know i'm going to end up relapsing soon if i don't have an alternative. I need drugs. Probably going to start experimenting soon because otherwise i'll end up killing myself.
