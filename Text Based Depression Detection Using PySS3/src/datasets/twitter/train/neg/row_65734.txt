Have a gun sitting next to meAt this point, I just don't see any reason to go on. My depression has ruined my relationship with my wife, and I've let it affect my relationship with my kids. I've felt this way for so long, and it's starting to bleed into every aspect of my life. I've come close before, and have used cutting to cope in the past. Now I just feel done, and like a bullet is my best way to stop feeling like this. 

My wife and I had a fight tonight, and she went for a drive and turned her phone off. I've called more times than I can count, just wanting to say sorry for being who I am. Now it feels like a sign that I can't get a hold of her. I left a note on her pillow and drove to a secluded spot. Now I just have to decide if tonight is really the night I get to be done.
