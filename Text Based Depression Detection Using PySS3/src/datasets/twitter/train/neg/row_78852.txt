What has everything been for?I feel like everything I do turns to shit, went to college and feel like it was just a big waste of time and money. Got together with a friend to open iur own business and it feels all wrong now. Have been in a relationship for 13 years and now I feel like we canâ€™t even talk.  Every night I go to bed thinking I donâ€™t want to wake up, I just want to disappear... I fear soon that feeling will turn into action and I donâ€™t know what to do. 

I keep going back to other times in my life, like the time my father walked in on me kissing another guy and how I almost felt like jumping off the college dorm building, tonight I lay in my bed wishing I had jumped that night.
