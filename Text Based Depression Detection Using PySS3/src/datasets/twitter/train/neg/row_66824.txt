I broke up with my boyfriend and want to die. So, I just broke up with my boyfriend of a year and a half because I had a small crush on another guy. I felt unfaithful for liking the other guy and ended it. I now regret it so much and I want to be back with my boyfriend, but I know I hurt him more than I ever have before. I just want him back. I really feel like he was my soul mate and I regret breaking up with him. 

Because of this, I'm very depressed and was hurting myself last night. I accidentally burned myself while burning some paper and scratched my chest with scissors. I thought about killing myself, hoping it would send a message that I really do regret what I did and to prove that I truly do love him. I didn't because my puppy was watching me the whole time and he was the only reason I'm still here. 

I'm really scared of myself and want to end my life. I want to make the pain stop or get him back. I just feel like he doesn't want to be with me anymore. Please, if anyone has anything to say, please say it... I'm really positive that I will hurt myself more if I don't get help...
