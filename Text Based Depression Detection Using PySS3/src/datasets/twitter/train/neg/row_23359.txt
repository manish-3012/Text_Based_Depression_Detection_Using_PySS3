Iâ€™m a crazy loser and donâ€™t know how to get through thisIve put my family through so much. Lost my high paying job six weeks ago. Fired. Have been depressed and occasionally suicidal since. Bi polar and on a bunch of meds. Then last night I snapped and destroyed my 14 year old childâ€™s new macbook I bought as a gift for the holidays and shoved the child by the neck/throat in front of my spouse and 12 year old. I donâ€™t know what came over me I was in a fit of rage. It has scared the crap out of me. The rest of the family is in shock. My spouse said that we should get a divorce that I should move out immediately but since I donâ€™t have a job I would need to live in my car. I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s any coming back from this. I feel so low and ready to end it all. I do not have any friends at all. My family isnâ€™t supportive because they all think/know that Iâ€™m crazy. Iâ€™m a recovering alcoholic three years of sobriety prior to that I was a horrible person and put my spouse and kids through hell on a regular basis. Now I feel like itâ€™s all starting over again.
