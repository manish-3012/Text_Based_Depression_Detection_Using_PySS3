Need help with friendI have a really close friend of mine who is very depressed and has already tried to kill herself once. Her upbringing was terrible, her current life is going pretty badly and her future isn't looking too good either. The thing is, she doesen't have any family to support her and she basically only has me in her life, so I feel VERY obligated to keep up with her, as I'm pretty sure she will break without me. This, in turn, makes me feel terrible, and worse everytime I talk to her. How can I walkout of this without causing harm to her? I wouldn't be able to live with myself If anything happened to her.
