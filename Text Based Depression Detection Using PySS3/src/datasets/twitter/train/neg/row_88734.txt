it's been almost 3 full months.I still dwell. I wasn't even nearly in a relationship with her. She gave me hope, kept me company for a very short while (literally 3 days), when needed it most. She didn't even really contribute to the short lived conversations, so why have I managed to dwell on it beyond reason for almost 3 months? May or may not be related to seeing her 4-5 days a week. It probably is. Eh.
