Almost committed to ending itSo I've come close to finally committing to finalizing things with myself. Almost. I still have reservations about it because I'm concerned for my son and how it will affect him, but at the same time I'm at the end of my rope - hanging on by the tiniest of threads.

I've modified some bullets (technically cartridges) by grinding some cross patterns into the tips, so that they'll spray open more and be more lethal, thereby helping to guarantee that I will be successful. I know where I will go to complete it, I know where I will aim, to be almost sure that it'll be 'lights out' for this body.

I'm so close, but I'm still slightly struggling with the fear of pulling the trigger. I've told myself that it'll be rather quick. Equivalent to maybe being stung by a bee or something. It might hurt for a brief moment, but I'll be out and dead soon after. It'll be a forever sleep, free from the pain of this life that I've endured for over 25 years. It will be a relief when I've become comfortable enough to finally do it. I look forward to that serenity.
