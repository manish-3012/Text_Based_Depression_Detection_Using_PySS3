fast, cheap preferably painless way to cut the ropeIâ€™m wondering if anybody knows any relatively simple methods to ending it all with as little pain as possible.
Mental anguish not a concern, as any choice execution will be more or less the same, I'm worried about the physical reactions as my pain tolerance is next to none, like bleeding out from a throat laceration or failing an overdose and living in vegetative state locked up in a psych ward. 
Just anything. Anything that's quick and done with once it's done. 
No access to guns or carbon monoxide poisoning. Any readily available pills? How about asphyxiation with a bag? Helpful advice greatly appreciated.
