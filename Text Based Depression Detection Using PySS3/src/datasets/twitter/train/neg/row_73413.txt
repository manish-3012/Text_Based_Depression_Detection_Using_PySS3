I hate being loneliness but I hate socializingEveryday I wake up and feel so alone and so worthless. I feel like nobody in the world wants me or wants me around them. But as soon as I start to try and reach out to people I immediately retreat. I havent been able to trust anyone in so long. I wish I had someone to just vent and to just cry to. but I know with how bad my trust issues are I will never attain that again

I'm just waiting for the day I finally get the balls to kill myself. 10 days and counting
