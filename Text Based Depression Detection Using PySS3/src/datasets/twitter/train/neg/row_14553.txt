tldr i'm doneNot sure why I'm still here, lol. Why is it so hard to kill yourself in so many invisible cities... Anyhoo, feel like I've been dead for a long time. Just lost everything my life has stood for, and honestly, there's not much more in life I want to experience. I've done everything or most of what I've wanted to do. I don't need to accumulate any more of anything. Honestly, I cause more pain to the people who love me when I'm alive, and I don't care for the luxuries of the living. I've experienced great loves, and the most amazing things. I really do not need more. Thanks universe, peace out. I wish I could be more, but everything upsets me. I fucking hate capitalism. And inequality. And I can't do much about these things. I'm so angry and helpless. And tired. And done. I'm sorry.
