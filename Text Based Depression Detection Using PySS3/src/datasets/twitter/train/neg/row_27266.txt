I feel so lost.After going to therapy for a while, being on Prozac for months, and being out of my classes for a long time, I don't know what to do anymore.
I feel completely numb now, if anything good happens it doesn't affect me. I saw a man almost overdosed on heroin today and I didn't feel affected. Nothing affects me anymore. I just feel so depressed all the time, I feel gross. I am so disconnected from myself and my life.
Have I turned into a heartless person? My therapist asked me a question I've been asking myself for years, "Why do I think I deserve this?". I am meeting with her again on Thursday and I don't even know what to say. I don't know where to go from here.
I smile and laugh but it's all fake. I don't want my family to worry.
I'll take any advice, please help me.
