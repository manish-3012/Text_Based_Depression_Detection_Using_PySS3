I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing anymoreFor the past month, things have gotten to the point where life is just unbearable. Im barely making enough money to survive, Iâ€™m constantly being threatened with homelessness. My fiancÃ© of five years dumped me because he said I was â€œa miserable person to be aroundâ€ and that he found a more attractive guy who â€œmade him feel like he could be a good person.â€ Oh and then he said he â€œhasnâ€™t loved me for the past two years and was just pretending.â€ I got disowned by my family. All in the same fucking month. Fuck, this sucks. 

And what I hate the most is Iâ€™ve got the pills by my bed. Every night I look at them. Every night I get close to just pouring them down my throat and finishing it all. But I just canâ€™t do it. I turn into a coward the last second. 

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I feel so lost. Life is meaningless yet Iâ€™m still afraid to end it? God, I suck.
