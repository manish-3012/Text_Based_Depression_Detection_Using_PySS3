this is my " suicide note ".I don't know if what I'm about to do will work, but Iv'e been fantasizing about it for a long time.

This isn't supposed to be a fuck you, to anybody. All my problems, are all my fault. They where right when they told me to stop blaming the world for my problems, they where right. 

I know, I was doing well right? haven't gone to the psych hospital in a long time. I was only trying to prevent making anybody suffer because I'm suffering, that's not fair, to anyone. 

I want to make this short, but you might be wondering why I'm doing this. My life isn't going to get any better, from here. I can't even get through school, All I have done all day for months, if fantizise about an impossible life. I am jobless, fat, depressed, and constantly dissociated. There are other reasons I think of all the time, but those are the biggest, i guess. 

Am I scared? fuck yeah. wish I wasn't scared but I am. I still have so many happy moments in my life, but nothing conquers the darker side of things. I'm worried I wont be able to do it...

I love my family, I always will, but this just has to be done.

I know everyone say's "im sorry. " But I am truly, sorry.
