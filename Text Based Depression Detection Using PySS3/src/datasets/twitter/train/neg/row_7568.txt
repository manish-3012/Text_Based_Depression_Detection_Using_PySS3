These depressive waves at 18I continue to feel more sad about the life I live in. My parents physically abuse each other and yell in the middle of the street. Me and my mom the other day watch a Netflix show and this girl was attempting suicide. And now everytime I feel like Iâ€™m gonna do it I think of her method. Iâ€™m done with therapist and I have nobody to talk to.

 Sometimes I feel like I shouldnâ€™t put all my emotions on to someone because Iâ€™ll feel like a burden and then never asked for all that input. I really want to die and the only purpose I have to love is just my future self in 10 years. Thatâ€™s it. I canâ€™t take school, work, home, friends, or myself any more. Iâ€™m so bitter I still look at the things that got me upset from the past (yearrrs ago). Just wanted to share...
