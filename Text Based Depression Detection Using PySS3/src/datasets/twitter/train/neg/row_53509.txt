How do you make your family and friends understand their lives would be better off without youHonestly, I feel like their lives would be amazing without me. If I was never born my sister would be better off and would have no doubts our parents love her more (which they do anyway, she just thinks otherwise because I needed more care), my parents wouldnt have to extra care me, my friends would not have to listen to my complaints and my bf would have a relationship with a skinnier, smarter, more compassionate woman that's not a constant downer and a disappointment. 


ONLY IF THEY GOT IT I COULD KILL MYSELF AND END IT ALL BUT NOOOOOOO ALL LIFE IS VALUABLE FOR SOME FUCKING REASON 

I wish they werent attached emotionally to me. I dont want to make them suffer. But now that I exist they just have to suffer because of my existence and my everyday stupid actions (not doing enough in the home, not having a good enough job, mediocre grades etc). If I never existed there would be NO suffering on their part.  If I die they suffer because I existed and now I'll just not be there and humans have stupid unpractical emotions. 


Fuck I wish they were sociopaths everyday
