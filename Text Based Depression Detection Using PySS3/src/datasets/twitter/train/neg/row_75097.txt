Might be ending it soon.School is harder than ever and my mom is being mean about it, all she does is yell at me for not trying even though I have gotten two of my grades up to passing and have one left to get up. There is a lot of things I need to do in life but it won't matter anyways since all that matters is education that tears me apart and nobody seems to care about my well being in my family, if I have to do summer school I will kill myself I already get bullied for being fat and ugly at school and dumb for my grades at school, why the fuck would I want that to go on?
