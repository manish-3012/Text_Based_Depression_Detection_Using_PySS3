I'm so tired of feeling.I've been sitting on the floor of my living room for two days.  My apartment is a mess and I don't have it in me to clean it up.  I wake up in the morning and start crying.  I'm 35 years old and have nothing to wake up for.   I've never had a relationship last more than a few months.  I don't know what it's like to know anyone.  The only reason anyone knows I'm alive is that I show up for work.  I quit smoking his year cause I thought it might make my life better, but all it did was get rid of the only thing that made me feel better.  I go for long walks in the woods and its the only time I feel okay.  The only time I don't cry.  I was deathly afraid of heights and now all I do is look for larger cliffs to  jump off.  I keep practicing getting closer to the edge. I've never had a dream of falling, I'm always hanging on until I realize I'm dreaming and let go.  I want to let go.  I want to stop feeling and wanting and trying to hang on to this empty life.  It will take 5 days for anyone to wonder where I am.  I'm so afraid but I can't keep holding on.
