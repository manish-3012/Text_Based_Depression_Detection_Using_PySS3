The irony on my lifeSorry for any english mistakes, it is not my native language. Anyway...
When I was a little kid my life was pretty bad already but I never thought suicide was the answer. I didn't understand why people would kill themselves. I had hope in a better future, I had hope that things would get better.
But they didn't, they only got worse. My horrible childhood never left my mind. My completely dysfunctional family aggravated their "dysfunctionality". Chronic, incurable, physical ilness struck me, leaving me in pain, every single day, for the rest of my life. My mental health problems aggravated. Severe depersonalization; OCD. I'm not even depressed. I just feel like I am almost dead inside. 
So there you go. The kid who once view suicide as something he would never do, now knows it is probably inevitable. Not today, not tomorrow. One day.
The irony...
