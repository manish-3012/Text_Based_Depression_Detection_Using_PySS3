sometimes i wake up and i want to stop tryingmy 2020 has been horrendous, I got disowned by parents because they didn't approve of my partners race. they told me i was dead to them wll because i chose someone I love, they've shut me out of their life and it's been 7 months now

i got diagnosed with anxiety and started taking anti depressants.

I found a banking role in Brisbane, Australia and it was a new chapter, partner and I moved away from our family who pretty much told us we were dead just because we chose to love each other.

my anxiety got worse and on the first day I was meant to start work i had an anxiety attack and had cyclic vomiting for 7 days straight, since this happened i was too far behind on training due to the days i missed at work and they advised me I'd have to start on the next intake which is feb 2021.

i don't know how i got so unlucky, but I've been on no income for 2 months and it's eating away at me, my partner is working insane 14 hour days and we're just scraping by, while she was at work today i sold some of my personal items just so i could cover rent.

my partner is getting stressed too but she doesn't say much, she's too nice too.

I'm desperately looking for work but keep getting knocked back, i got accepted for two roles but they start end of Jan.

It felt so weird selling some of my items that i held dear to me, I wish i had a family to support me in times like this.

i do apologise if it seems like I'm complaining, thank you all who got this far, the emotional rollercoaster that is my mind is struggling to handle the pressure of seeing direct debits not go through, applying for financial hardship etc i feel worthless and I'm not bringing anything to the relationship

i just want things to go back to normal i hate all of this.
