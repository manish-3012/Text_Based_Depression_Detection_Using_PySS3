I don't know what to do anymore. It's been so much for so long, I can't stand it anymore.I am at the end of my rope. I am more than a little drunk, staring at a supply of clonazepam and seriously considering just taking them all. I don't know what to do anymore. I am so stressed out at work, I had to take three clonazepam just to make it through the day yesterday. I made it in to work for an hour today before they sent me home because I am just not functional.

I cut myself this morning. It helps, just knowing that the veins are so close, right there, all I need to do is dig a little deeper and it could all be over. I don't want to die, but I do. I can't keep living like this, it's not life. I'm out of money, I can't function at work, every day I think about just taking all my drugs and vodka and then I would never have to feel this bad again. I don't know what to do anymore. I've been to my psychiatrist, she wasn't available today but the drugs don't always work like they should. I don't even know what I need anymore. I've been struggling with this for so long, and I am so tired, and so worn down. They say it gets better, but it hasn't, or if it does it's only for a few days. 

I'm sorry for the ranting. I'm sorry this doesn't make any sense. I've taken my clonazepam with vodka, and I know that's a terrible choice, but I can't take it any more.  I just can't fail at life any more. I have responsibilities, I have people and animals that depend on me, and I know I have to go on for them, but god dammit, it is so hard. I just want it to end.
