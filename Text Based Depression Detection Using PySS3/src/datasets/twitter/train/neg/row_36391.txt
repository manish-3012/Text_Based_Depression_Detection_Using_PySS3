Finding little to no meaning or interest in my lifeI've been idolizing suicide and death for most of my life. I don't look forward to my future because for what? My whole life I've felt like a miserable piece of crap. The thought of carrying on like this is exhausting. And right now I don't know what I'm doing with my life.  I've been to therapy, inpatient, outpatient, meds, etc. I feel an overwhelming sense of boredom and a void in my soul. I rapid cycle hourly and then bottom out and stay down for days. Too tired from depression to move, think, let alone try to manage my life.  Crappy, lonely childhood. Codependent, abusive long term relationship in adulthood with a narcissist addict. But for some reason I'm in love with all my abusers. I need constant validation, which is impossible. Being trapped in my own head full of pain and obsessions is so, so tiring. I just want to end my life. I'm sick of it. The fear of the act and the impact it would have on my loved ones keeps me at bay. But I want to be living for me. Just not this me.
