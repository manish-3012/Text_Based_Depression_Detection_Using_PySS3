Why can't i have good things?My best friend was depressed, after going to doctor, and talking a few meds, i saw her smile, it was so genuine, i cried, like literally. I wonder why, then i realized, i want to have that kind of smile too,  but how can i do that,  even if i drink hundreds or thousands of meds, when the people around me are always pulling me down, it's impossible. Im so tired.
