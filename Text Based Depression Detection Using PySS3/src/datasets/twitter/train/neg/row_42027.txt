Getting really tried of lifemy life consists of going to school and getting make fun of, going to work for 6hrs and dealing with shitty customers then coming home and having to deal with my mom whose having a mental breakdown.

Im completing my senior year of highschool and my dad told me he was moving 7hrs away for a job a week before he was set to move, I had no idea he was moving. I'm not moving with him, my dad's lease is up in July so I need to be moved out by then, so I've been living with my brother and my mom because she moved into the house.

My mom can't afford the rent, so we all need to be moved out before my dad's lease is up, I can't stand living with my mom I need to find a place of my own

I don't know that life even after all this mess is sorted out is worth it.
