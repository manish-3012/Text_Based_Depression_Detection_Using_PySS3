I'm Not AloneI have a loving mother who will do anything for me, I have a girlfriend who loves me and I love her back, I have cats that I love Dearly but it just does not help with the suicidal thoughts. Tonight would be the worst its been and the only thing stopping me is my girlfriend (will call her W). I have known W for awhile now and I love her but even my love for her is wearing out when it comes down to times like these. Why cant I just be wiped from fucking history
