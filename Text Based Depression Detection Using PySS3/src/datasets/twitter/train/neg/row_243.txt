Thoughts of suicideI (23F) donâ€™t know really, Iâ€™ve been touched by the darkness from a very young age - maybe 11 or 12 and Iâ€™ve been fighting the urge to end it all for just as long. I think Iâ€™m finally at the end of my rope so to speak, my world has completely crumbled in more ways than one and I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s much reason left for me to continue to pretend I want to be alive. I wish I could say that things get better but theyâ€™ve only gotten progressively worse...
