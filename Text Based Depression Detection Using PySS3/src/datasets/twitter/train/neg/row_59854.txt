I don't know.Holidays suck for a lot of people. I'm no one special. When she decided to give up on a decade-long relationship, I thought I'd be okay. With Xmas coming up, I knew it would suck, but it's worse than I imagined. The family buzzed around as I sat on the bed for 45 minutes unable to move. When I could move, I tried a shower but had a hard time with even that. When she yelled at me for holding up the family, I told her to go. I don't know why I took so long in the shower. Maybe I didn't want to go. I keep telling myself it's because I wanted reassurance that going to my ex's family's house for xmas would be okay since I felt like utter shit about it. But.. she yelled at me instead. Told me I was holding up the family. Called me names. I told her to just go and eventually she did. I miss my kids. This is my first Christmas, let alone day without them. I'm very tired. I don't know if I see a point in any of this anymore. I know the kids would miss me, but.. maybe everyone is just better off. My soul is tired. It's just cold and empty inside of me at the moment. I could Uber there but they already opened their gifts. It's too late. Christmas is ruined. And it's my fault. I got nothing for Xmas, and all I wanted was to be around my family. But my family is gone. Her parents were my family until now, but I'm alone. So.. fuck it. Why bother.

Fuck it. I mean I don't know why I'm here. It's all pretty stupid when you think about it.
