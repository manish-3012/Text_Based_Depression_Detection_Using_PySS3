I have no other option left. I don't think I have any reason to continue living. I wish someone knew other way out than suicide.I live in central europe. I'm 26 finishing masters in psychology (useless with no experience). It takes 5 years here to complete it. I wanted to be a counselor/school psychologist or working with diagnostics but that is obviously never going to happen. I have no job experience, never had a job. Parents didn't care enough to teach me anything and never pushed me and just contributed to my depression, then I got into bachelor program and I just focused on studies because I was always depressed so i had no energy for anything else. I commuted long hours every day so I couldn't get a job during week. Last three summer breaks I tried to get internships or even a retail job but I was always denied so I became seriously depressed but didn't want to visit psychiatrist or my degree would be useless with that in my cart.

So now I will soon graduate (hopefully) with never having a job, having useless degree, no experience, no friends or contacts. There are no uni help options like in US or ways of volunteering so there's that. I think my only option is suicide because I won't be ever hired even for 12 hours 3 shift factory job because I am a risk with no work history. Is this a logical way to end ones life? I am the most pathetic and incompetent, inexperienced person I know irl.

I am starting to believe I just need to prepare to end it all and get over myself. I had a chance but failed on all fronts so I must face it and end it or just accept I will be homeless which I don't want to be.

Just wanted to vent. Honeslty I don't know if I will write again. I guess this is the only possible plan how my life will end up. Not like anyone will care.
