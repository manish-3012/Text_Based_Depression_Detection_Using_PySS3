Help! My cousin sounds suicidal, can you give some tips?She's lost her job a couple weeks ago that she was in for 18 years. One of the higher ups had a lawsuit from years ago, and didn't like her. Anyway, she was fired without being given a reason, and now I found her drunk (she doesn't drink) and she's rambling like crazy.

She didn't say anything specific around suicide, but she's incredibly depressed and I'm not sure what she might do. 

Do you have tips about what I can do to help her?
