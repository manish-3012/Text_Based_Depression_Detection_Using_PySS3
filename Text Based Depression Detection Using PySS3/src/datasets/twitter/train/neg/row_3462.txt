I tried to OD this weekBut my roommate and only friend found out and made me puke out some of it. I was still knocked out for 24 hours. And I feel like shit. I now remember that she knew something was up and didn't want to leave my room and I acted like an asshole, cussing at her and stuff, telling her I don't want her in my room....and when she found out that I tried to OD I screamed at her...she was crying and I fucking screamed at her to just let me die?! I feel like such an asshole...

I still think about suicide, which makes me feel even worse...the fact that she probably blames herself makes me feel awful...

She safed my life and I acted like a bitch...and how do I thank her? By still wanting to die?... I hate myself so much

Why can't I just erase my past? I don't want these memories that keep haunting me and make me want to die...
