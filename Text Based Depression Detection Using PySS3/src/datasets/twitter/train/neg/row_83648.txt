[17M] Currently seriously contemplating suicide because im so stressed out all the time.Hello Reddit

Lately I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts due to the fact that I have been so stressed out. Nowadays I feel like I don't get time to breathe. I'm currently working a full time job 40 hours a week. I'm always getting bullied due to fact I'm so young in my industry and that I'm a 1st year apprentice. 

I'm struggling to make things meet. I try to treat my me and my lovely girlfriend of a little more then a year to nice experiences, keep my friends happy, go to the gym and take care of myself , keep work happy, save for a car, try to do my passions, buy tools for work, and still get 8 hours of sleep, keep my appearance alright clothing and hygiene wise, maintain my motorbike all at the same time. 

I am really fucking depressed because I'm really trying and it's like nobody sees that. I just get told I need to try harder all the time and I'm constantly thinking that it would be easier if I was dead because then I wouldn't need to bother anymore. I'm so stressed out... Please can someone give me some advice I'm hanging on my last string right now. It doesn't help I got depression and anxiety I try so hard to battle it all the time and prove to everyone I'm good enough but I'm about to give up on life.
