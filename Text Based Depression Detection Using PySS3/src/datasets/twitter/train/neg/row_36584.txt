Life is pain25M who struggles so much socially and has nothing to say in conversation with people feels detached from society and disconnected from other humans. 

Contemplating what the point is of living life if I genuinely can't connect with others around me and feel so uncomfortable in a social setting? 

I know these are things that can be worked on but for me it feels like it's not the case.
