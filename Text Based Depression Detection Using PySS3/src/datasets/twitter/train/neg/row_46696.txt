I feel like the walls are caving inGoing through a tough split with my wife. We have two children together and I've been dealing with depression for a while now.

Our relationship is really toxic and I'm ok with going our separate ways but she was my best and only friend. I put all my trust in her and devoted my life to her so I've ended up distant with my friends and family.

I feel like I can't handle this. She says she wants to leave and I'm not stopping her but she can't do so without tearing me down. This has been a cycle for a few years now, I just can't take it. I can't stop thinking about how much easier it would be if I could just fucking die already.
