the apple never hangs far from the tree.that's what i would write. On a piece of paper on the ground in my room. It's not really my room. It's my room here at a homeless shelter. 

I would surround this paper with evidence pictures from my mom's medical records. From when she hanged herself. When she was inpatient at a psych hospital. I'll put her progress notes and charts too. All arranged. 

the apple never hangs far from the tree. Her and me.
