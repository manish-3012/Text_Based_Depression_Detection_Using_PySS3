What's the point?My boyfriend hates me. I'm pretty sure he's going to break up with me tonight. I literally don't think I can live without him. He's been distant, and I think he has feelings for someone else. 

My job is exhausting. I have so many chronic health issues. Nothing is ever going to get better, so why do I bother anymore.
