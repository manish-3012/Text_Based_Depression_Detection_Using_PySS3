What should I do?I (21F) met my ex-boyfriend (24M) when he was in America for business. We dated for about a year until he had to go back to Italy. He always had mental illnesses, including borderline personality disorder and depression. Drugs and self-harm were always part of the equation, and I tried hard to be supportive without being an enabler. We decided to break up since the distance wasn't working, but we stayed friends and still keep in touch. Today he reached out to warn me that if I don't hear from him, it's because he finally killed himself. I don't know what to do, as I don't know any of his family or friends in Italy, and he will not seek help on his own. He has always talked about suicide but never on this level. Does anyone have any advice? What would you need to hear?
