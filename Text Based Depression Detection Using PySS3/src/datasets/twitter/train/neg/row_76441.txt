I have tried so hard for you, but you still say I am determined to suffer.A short version of my back story is, in third grade depression made its move into my life. Although it wasnâ€™t something I noticed until 4th grade. Thus I suffered through life. I would go back and forth of wether to ask for help or to die. I made my move at the beginning of sixth grade. Called 911 broke my familyâ€™s hearts and went to a mental hospital. All I got from it was anxiety and meds. I stayed on my meds for 2 months before I wanted to end it all. So I almost did. Took the bottle of meds and them promptly spit them all out in the toilet. My parents were disappointed in me. Took away my freedom and thus therapy began. It did nothing, we never talked about my problems. So once COVID began my parents ended my therapy. Now, waiting for August when I start 7th grade. Iâ€™m ready to end it all. I have done every way of feeling better. Meds, therapy, self harm, attempt suicide. Nothing happened Iâ€™m only alive for my cat. Iâ€™m just ready to go.
