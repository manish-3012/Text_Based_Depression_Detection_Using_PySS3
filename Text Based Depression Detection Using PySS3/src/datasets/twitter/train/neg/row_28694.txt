Can somebody help me? PleaseIâ€™m going to kill myself. I donâ€™t know when. I donâ€™t know how. I just know that itâ€™s only a matter of time. I have barely any friends, never had a best friend. Iâ€™m ugly, disgusting. People refuse to touch me, people call me creepy. People mock my body all the time. I have nothing to live for at all. I have no prospect or hope of my life improving because Iâ€™m a fucking coward who canâ€™t handle social situations in any way. 

Give me a reason to live...
