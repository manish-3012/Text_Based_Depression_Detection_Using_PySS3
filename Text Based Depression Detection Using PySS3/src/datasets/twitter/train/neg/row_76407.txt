I Wish My Family Hated MeThey're pretty much the only reason why I am alive right now, even though I wake up and wish I were dead every day. I've had bouts of depression and serious suicidal thoughts ever since I was 5, and I really just want it to fucking end. Even when I'm genuinely happy I think about how I wouldn't really run or fight for my life if someone tried to murder me.

I think life is pointless. I'll agree with people saying that we do have an impact on the world, no matter how small, but does that really matter in the grand scheme of things? Eventually the earth and our entire solar system will come to an end, and I know some of you will say something along the lines of "well it doesn't matter if it will end, we are thrown in here against our will and it's better to do something useful with our time here than to just mope around until death," but you know what? Fuck that. I don't care if I'm being unreasonable or if there is a way to resolve my unhappiness, I don't want it. I just don't like living. I hate the cycle, the human limitations, the fact that I need to do shit like have a bunch of friends, exercise, eat balanced meals to be able to be happy.

I really don't care if I have a "purpose" in life. I don't want to fulfill it, and when I die, I just want to disappear. No reincarnation, no heaven, nothing. I just don't want to be conscious anymore.
