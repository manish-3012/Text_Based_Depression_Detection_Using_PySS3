IM NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.my uncle killed himself recently (2 weeks ago) with the .22 revolver that i sold him 4 months ago. he was my best friend. he taught me how to rock climb, drag race, ride a motorcycle when my dad insisted they were too dangerous. he allways had time for me when i needed him. most emportantly he helped me through the death of my aunt who died 2 years ago due to medical complications. 
when my uncle died he was recently divorced and the reason he took his life was supposidly because his wife wouldnt let his kids see him on christmas. needless to say nobody in the family had much money and i dumped my savings and alot of credit to help pay for funaral arangments and travel for some of the family. the day he died my wife decided that she wants a divorce and that it was my fault that john died. she called me and voicemail recorded it. now to me. i work for a worldwide software company that is nationally known, im allways being yelled at for something from clients and its hard not to let work flow over into home and vice versa. i feel like im standing on the edge. i feel alone and my heart hurts. i have thoughts of taking my life. i have nothing left as everything has been taken away.
