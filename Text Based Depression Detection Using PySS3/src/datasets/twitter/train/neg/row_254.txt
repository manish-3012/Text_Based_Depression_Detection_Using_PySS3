In a BoxI'm already dead, my body just hasn't caught up to the fact yet. 29, single, jobless/careerless, can count my "friends" (people who feel pity for me) on one hand, thousands of dollars in debt, living in a shit hole apartment, ugly, and have 0 social skills. I wish someone would walk up behind me and shoot me in the back of my head. I'm thinking of joining the military but I'm afraid of only getting maimed and not killed. I can't kill myself because I don't have the willpower, so instead I exist in a colorless limbo, waiting to die. Every second I'm alive literally feels like an eternity of suffering. I'm fully aware how cheesy that sounds, but it's the truth. I feel a thousand years old.
