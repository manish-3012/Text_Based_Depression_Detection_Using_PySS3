Tired of being ignoredSo I was looking at my messages the other day and realized something. No one starts the convos with me. Not texts, facebook, etc. 

I tested for two weeks not messaging anyone and it was pretty telling. Even when I do message people only a few of all my friends respond so I guess whats the point if no one cares?
