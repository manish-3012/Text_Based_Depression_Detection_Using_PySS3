My OCD is overwhelming the last few days and I could use some helpIt's hard to tell how much of my suicidal ideation right now is because of obsessive thoughts and not my actual desires, and how much is my depressive, I really do want to die, thoughts.

All I know is that I feel so hopeless and useless. I'm realising today that part of me wants to drink or use drugs just to make the day go by so at least I get to deal with work sooner. I can't handle my time off. I just want to be unconscious until it's time to work again.

Then I think about how pathetic and sad that is. That's about the time I think it would be so much easier to not have to wake up anymore. I'm starting to lose any reason to bother getting up.
