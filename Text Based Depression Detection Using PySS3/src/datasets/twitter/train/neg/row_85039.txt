CowardTomorrow night I'll visit a friend's house. They have a shotgun. But I know I won't be able to pull the trigger, because I'm a coward. I thought I would die with honor. Everyone thought I was a bad-ass for only bringing a knife to gun-fights, but they didn't know the reason-  I was trying to get someone else to kill me, because I don't have the balls; I wanted to get close enough so they wouldn't miss, but somehow the metal never found my flesh. Even in a personal confrontation I would take my knife out and slide it across the floor to them, only for them to refuse to pick it up, looking at me with fear in their eyes. Now my family are almost all in prison or the graveyard. Now I'm no longer an outlaw- I have a civilian job, a civilian life. Now there is no honor to die for. For a while, after I left that life, I found happiness. But I've just been reminded that I'm nothing but a ghost to others; I feel like I'm living someone else's life that's already been written and lived, and this is the last page. So I find once more that I want someone's aim to find a home between my eyes. I'd do it myself, but I'm a coward.
