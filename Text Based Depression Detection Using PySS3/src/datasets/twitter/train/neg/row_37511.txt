Suicidal rant, I guessGod Iâ€™ve been suicidal ever since I was 12 and had my first attempt but here I am a few years later, closest Iâ€™ve every been to going through with it. I really do just want to die. Iâ€™m just a fucking failure and thatâ€™s never going to change. 

My parents donâ€™t give a shit about me, my mom is refused to make me an appointment with my therapist because I had refused to go to one once they day after one of my guinea pigs died. I hear her openly mocking me when on the phone with my dad, talking shit about me to my siblings. My dad has kicked me out of his house after I dropped out of school, my siblings resent me and barely interact with me, my brother bullied me for years because me being suicidal meant he had to go to family therapy like 10 times over the course of half a year and because I required a lot of support and attention.


I hope when I off myself theyâ€™ll finally start to fucking care, even if itâ€™s too late. This rant about my family is really only the tip of the iceberg that is my horrible life. Might go and jump off a bridge tonight.
