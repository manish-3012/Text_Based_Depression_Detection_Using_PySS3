I see no reason to live and i cry oftenI don't know why i live. I barely have any real friends, which really means zero. Nobody enjoys hanging out with me. Or atleast nobody does. Nobody can love me. Nobody likes they way i look. Nobody sees anything positive in me. 

I am just darkness in its own manifestation. I bring sadness and i am the mirror that shows others if they were shit. I am shit. I don't know why i do anything anymore. 

But the worst part of it all. The absolute worst part. The part i hate the most. Is the fact that no girl has ever liked me. NEVER. 18 years. No girl has ever thought that i could be goodlooking, or attractive. NEVER, and it probably will never happen. ITS OVER FOR ME. I WANT LOVE. I WANT TO LOVE SOMEONE ELSE. I WANT TO FEEL VALIDATED. I WANT SOMEONE TO WANT TO VALIDATE MY EXISTENCE. I WANT SOMEONE TO WHOLEHEARTEDLY TELL ME THAT I CAN MAKE THEM HAPPY, THE SAME WAY A POLITE SMILE FROM MY CRUSH CAN MAKE MY MONTH. 

I HATE THAT I AM NOTHING TO EVERYONE. WHAT IS THE FUCKING POINT?! 

FUCK LIFE. FUCK THIS PIECE OF SHIT. FUCK THE WAY I LOOK. FUCK EVERYBODY.
