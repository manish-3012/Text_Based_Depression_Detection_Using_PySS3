I will never amount to anythingI miss the days when I was the golden girl, who could do anything with her life. I was special, smart and confident. I could have been a drag king, a doctor, a professional clarinet player, all the things I aspire to today. I will probably never even graduate from this mediocre course at this mediocre university. I AM SHIT I AM SCUM I AM THE WORST SHIT IN THE WORLD
