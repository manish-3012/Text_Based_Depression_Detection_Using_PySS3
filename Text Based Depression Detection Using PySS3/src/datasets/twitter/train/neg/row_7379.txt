What would even happen if I went to the hospital?I'm beyond depressed. I've thought of a thousand different ways to end it, and all of the consequences that come with it. I genuinely and sincerely believe, nay, know that everyone in my life will be better off without me.

I'm being urged to go to the emergency room by people who care about me, but are too blind to see that they shouldn't care about me.

Let's say I'll humor them... won't the hospital just tell me "that sucks, call the suicide hotline"?

I certainly don't care to explain myself to a stranger who will also just say the generic and usual "life is worth living" bullshit.

Please, I really dont want any of that generic crap from you people, either. I just want to know what the ER (US) would do if I show up and tell them I'm suicidal
