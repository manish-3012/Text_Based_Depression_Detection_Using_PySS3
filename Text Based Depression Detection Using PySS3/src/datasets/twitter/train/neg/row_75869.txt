My life is perfect, I want to die but I really want toHello, itâ€™s quite difficult writing this. My life is perfect, everyone thinks Iâ€™m happy but Iâ€™m just so sad. And what annoys me the most is that thereâ€™s no important reason why Iâ€™m sad and depressed. People have their lives so much tougher than mine, and Iâ€™m here perfect relationship perfect job, family yet Iâ€™m still contemplating whether I should just jump now.

My mind itâ€™s battling, do it. Donâ€™t do it. What makes me sad is my lack of interest for social or entertaining things. For example watching Tv, drinking, just anything that involves enjoying life. All I want to do in life is work work and be better. Itâ€™s sounds so fucking stupid, fuck I canâ€™t explain it
