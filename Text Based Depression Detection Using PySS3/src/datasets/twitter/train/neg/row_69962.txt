Record a voice memo suicide note and listen to it.I hope that this helps someone out there. Since Iâ€™ve started doing this, itâ€™s carried me through the hard times. I am roughing it out here mostly on my own; my parents and fiancÃ© died at a young age. So I am going, suicidal, and alone. 


I understand the ache. I understand the inescapable meltdown of thoughts that floods you with reasons to take your life and doesnâ€™t allow you to see any reason as sufficient for why you shouldnâ€™t. You feel that you are destined to unhappiness and that it will never get better. But darlings, that. That is a lie. 


Life doesnâ€™t hold your hand. It doesnâ€™t walk you through life when you do well or punish you when you donâ€™t. Life simply does not care about you. It is harsh. Itâ€™s a reality. Itâ€™s survival. But it also means that good times are in your future. You just cannot see it right now. 


I hope that this helps some people out there as it definitely helps me. When I am feeling helpless, at my wits end, and one jump from ending all the pain, I record a voice memo of a suicide note where I say everything to anyone I have something to say to about why I want to die. I ask why certain people hurt me the way they did. I tell them that I will never understand it. I tell them that I hope they recognize the pain they caused. I talk about my grief, sorrows, and then I share the good times of my life and give thanks for that. And I apologize to the world for failing. Then, I just sit down and listen to it. I let my own words and feelings come back to me and think about all the people Iâ€™d hurt if I went through with it. I think about all the times that Iâ€™ve felt this way, stuck it out, and things get better. 


I never send it to anyone. Even though the suicide note is addressed to the world and many people in my life, they will never hear it. Itâ€™s mine. My thoughts. By the end of it, the drive to actually commit the act is lessened. 


When I was more suicidal in the past, there were times where I would do this every day because I was just in that much pain. Last night I did it for the first time in 4 months and I canâ€™t tell you how much better I feel. 


I hope this works for someone. As much as I wished reaching out to friends worked, it just doesnâ€™t. They never know what to say and usually it pushes people away. This gives you a way to feel your emotions without having to push them down to make it worse. Cheers.
