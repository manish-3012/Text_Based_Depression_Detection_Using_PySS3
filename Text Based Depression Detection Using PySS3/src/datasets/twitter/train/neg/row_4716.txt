Is it a bad idea to tell a therapist about suicidal thoughts?Started seeing someone. Weâ€™ve had one session. I know itâ€™s important to be open and honest. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts on and off for over 10 years. I donâ€™t want to be thrown in a psych ward, but I need help for this. What kind of wording should I use to talk about it? Or should I leave it out?
