I don't think I can last pass the new yearI just got back from a deployment and I had been dealing with issues before I left for about 8 years. While I was gone I felt so alone and that nobody really cared about me with the exception of 1 person. I almost took my life one night but c ouldnt bring myself to do it because of that person. I figured that when I got back i would get better but I've only gotten worse. I let that person know of what's going on and now I just feel like the only reason they have been talking to me is because they feel sorry for me and not that they really care. I had my thoughts again the other night and texted them about it but they never got back to me. I don't know how much longer I can take this.
