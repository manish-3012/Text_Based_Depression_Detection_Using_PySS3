I hate everyone including the lgbt community and I am suicidal because of themAt first I was abused mentally and physically by family and classmates for being homosexual and now I am being attacked online for the same reason by the shitty lgbt community because "transmen are men". I dont give 2 shits what some women want to call themselves but I'm not gonna pretend that my sexuality, which is based on SEX, not on stupid GENDER, includes them! No one ever asks WHY are transmen men! Because they make themselves look like one? So what? Many men look like women, doesnt mean they are women and many women look like men, doesnt mean they are men. Or is it because they simply identify as men? In both cases why do I have to pretend they are part of my sexuality just because "transmen are men"?!?

Besides this I am also told that "sexuality is fluid" by the same assholes. I swear that I truly hate the bisexual pieces of shit who keep saying that, sexuality is fluid for them cuz they are bisexual, i am homosexual, for me it isnt fluid, i was sent to conversion therapy and now I am told that I can "stop being gay" by the lgbt community itself. And I hate how this is corrupting many gay men who include transmen or "experiment" with women and I am honestly disgusted, openly gay men pretending to be gay after having piv sex? Cant those assholes admit they are bisexual instead of spreading bi erasure and homophobia? I have nothing against bisexual people, my ex was bisexual, but he wasnt a lying piece of shit bisexual like these libtards "gay" men.

I honestly hate everyone now because they either are homophobic because "lgbt is wrong" or they are homophobic because "transmen are men" and I am honestly sick of it and of everything and I dont feel like going on because I feel like an outcast everywhere.
