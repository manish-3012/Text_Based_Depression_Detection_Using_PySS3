So hereâ€™s my night Iâ€™m sitting here at the airport waiting for my flight to leave everything behind and disappear.I deal with anger and fear episodes, panic disorder, anxiety disorder, etc. My family has been with me through everything. But today was a bad episode and my mom yelled at me during it which makes me pull out my hair and scratch myself and bleed. I have an unknown rash thatâ€™s spread through both my arms and starting itâ€™s way to my back and chest. I had the fear of hurting my own mother today during that attack. So after, I took everything, packed, and decided to leave. Decided Iâ€™m not safe. All the meds havent helped me this whole year. This is my breaking point. Thereâ€™s nothing in this world thatâ€™s more heartbreaking than telling your little brother who loves you more than anything that this is the last time youâ€™ll see each other. Iâ€™m still crying. All these noises at the airport are making me shake uncontrollably and making me itch and bleed from those spots. Later today I go and say goodbye to everyone I love from my home where I grew up. I donâ€™t feel safe and I wouldnâ€™t live with myself if I hurt someone I loved because it was out of my control
