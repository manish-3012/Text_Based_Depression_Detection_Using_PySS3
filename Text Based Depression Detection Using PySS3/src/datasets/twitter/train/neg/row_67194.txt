Feel bad for feeling this way but...I'm hitting an all time low and I really want to let the emotional pain out yet can't. I'm so desperate that I wish that I have a best friend who commits suicide just so I can let out my pain. I can't even cry properly what a loser. Right now I can only hide it since I live with 5 other family members. I'm sorry for feeling this way, I know it's very very wrong...
