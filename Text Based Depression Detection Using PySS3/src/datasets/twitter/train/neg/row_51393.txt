Iâ€™m just real lonely atm I need someone to talk to :/I can feel my pills not working at much as they did day by day and all Iâ€™m getting is bad news recently I can feel a downwards spiral, but I kinda like it? Sometimes I find comfort in my sadness because then I know it canâ€™t get worse I canâ€™t be let down and I feel comfortable in this blanket of self pity. Maybe someone will understand
