HollowI feel hollow. I feel like everything happening around me isnâ€™t real. Iâ€™m in a really dark place rn. I feel like there is no out for me. I feel like my time is coming to an end. I blame myself. I am the problem. Everything bad happening rn is because I couldâ€™ve done something different. Itâ€™s the game of life and I made every wrong move. I must think Iâ€™m at least somewhat smart but I guess not. Everything I know is upside down. People will be better off with me not in the picture. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry to everyone that Iâ€™ve disappointed. Iâ€™m sorry to everyone I will disappoint. I just donâ€™t know what is right and I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s left to do. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry.
