I hate what I've becomeI used to have a heart, care about people and sacrifice for them like giving away my food to them even if I'm hungry, doing their homework for them and giving them the answers, etc. But everyone has treated me like shit and walked all over me. I've only met 1 truly genuine girl in high school that was nice to me from her heart. I live with narcs, work with narcs, encounter them outside. Ugh this world has turned me so cold hearted now. I hate what I've become. I don't want to be cold but it's the only way to keep myself from being used and manipulated.  Fuck...all the more reason to kill myself.
