I feel a little less sadI posted here a couple days ago and it ended up being one of the best things I've done. I found someone who helps me feel not alone. I still wanna die on a pretty regular basis but I've got some good people now. I just wanna say thank you for getting through that day. I got a lot of messages and it helped. I got to talk to someone else openly about suicide without feeling guilty or trapped. It was really nice so I just wanted to encourage those of you who are here to help. Please know that what you're doing can make the difference.
