I just want someone to talk to.Things are really bad right now and I am afraid that I've really fucked my life up beyond repair. The last two times something like this has happened, my friend has talked me out of it but I'm scared that this time I will just accept it and jump. I have already fucked my life up to some extent but if I get charged with a race crime then that will be the last straw. I have not had the most ideal life or been in the best situations so I eventually learned to live with that and power through most of the trouble I've been in but I have no idea how bad things will get from here on out so I just have to hope things get worse and I don't get charged with a race crime because if I do then I'm afraid I might have to go through with it and I have got no one to talk to about it right now.
