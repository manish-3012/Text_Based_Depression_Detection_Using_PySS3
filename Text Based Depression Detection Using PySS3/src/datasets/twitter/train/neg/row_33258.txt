I just don't think my life is going to anywhereHere's a summary of the past 2 years of my life, from graduating high school to now:
- I've been attending community college with no direction or interests in what I'm studying. I'm going because it's kind of fun, it's normal, and it makes my parents happy
- I haven't made any friends and still don't socialize with classmates mainly because I don't care to
- I've been spending almost all my free time listening to the same song on loop until they stop being amazing
- I've been getting back into drawing and want to make music
- The job I had in high school is starting to make me super anxious everytime I have to go so I'm considering quitting
- I still live with my parents and feel like they're kind of disappointed in me but considering my past aren't really saying anything
- I've gotten over my Anorexia from high school but am feeling less in control over my eating lately
- I'm starting to feel anxious about talking to my internet friends
- I've been spending a lot of time just lying in bed listening to music contemplating life
- I feel like I'm just being lazy but I'm not sure and I don't want to think about it
- Have been considering a creative career but you have to be outgoing for that
- I feel like I'm living in my own fantasy and don't want to leave
- Still keeping my promise to eventually kill myself

I just don't know anymore. The only thing that makes me even remotely happy anymore is listening to music and just escaping into my thoughts. What am I supposed to do when I grow up? Nothing is interesting, nothing is remotely interesting. I'm so scared of interacting with strangers it is really starting to hurt me but I don't want to change.
