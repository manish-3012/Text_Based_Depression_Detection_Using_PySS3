Just wanted to sayI'm 14. The perfect girl.
That's what I was. 

One day, I moved. To another country, another continent.
I was happy. I never thought I could one day be so depressed. Life was good to me as a 10 year old girl.

The school started.
My Innocence finally died completely. I was submitted to almost every single form of torture.

Everyday I was remembered that no one loved me. My parents expectations of me were surreal. I had no friends and became a prisoner of my own feelings and a slave to those people in school that told me I wasn't going to make more friends other than them, because I was a terrible person.

Ugly.
Immature.
Innocent.
Every single offense existent. I was all of that.

I changed schools. Again. I was alone. Again.

Never found friends.
Kept getting remembered that I don't deserve love.
I never did.

Sometimes someone decided to try to be my friend. I always made them go away. Because I am who I am.
I hurted people that I cared about. 

One day a guy decided to try too. He never stopped loving me. But I don't deserve him. And he should notice this soon too. I can't make him go away, even though I know I'm hurting him too.
He has depression. And I am useless to him. He have to find someone else. I care so much for him and want him to be happy, without me.

I don't even know why I'm writing this. All of this must be a mess right now. I'm not thinking, just writing, I need to say something before I go crazy.

I'm not going to kill myself, I just can't. But I really really wanted to be dead. To stop existing. It's so tiring and feeling like I can never be happy just... Makes even more sad. 
Maybe one day I'll be better. I don't know. I won't stop believing this.
