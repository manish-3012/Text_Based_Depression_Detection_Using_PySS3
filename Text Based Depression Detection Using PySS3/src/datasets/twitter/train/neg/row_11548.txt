please come backI love you and I miss you so much. But I wasnâ€™t enough for you to change. Instead you abused the person that loved you and still loves you more than anything. But you changed for her. You even told me, after I finally admitted the pain I was in and after two long years of fighting it, I admitted I still loved you, â€œshe made you the man you needed to be.â€

I canâ€™t deal with the constant flashbacks of our good memories. Of being next to you. Your smile, your laugh, the way you made me feel just being with you. Even when you were calling me names, dragging me across the ground, mentally torturing me.. you were my everything and still are. 

You tell me â€œfocus on yourself.â€ I have. Iâ€™ve tried everything. NOTHING makes me happy, except for when Iâ€™m so fucking loaded I canâ€™t feel my emotions anymore. I canâ€™t watch the only person I ever loved have everything I ever wanted with someone else anymore. 

You told me you hope I donâ€™t do anything crazy, especially over you, but youâ€™ve broken my soul and then finished it off with a rip today. I feel like Iâ€™ll never get over you. I donâ€™t want to go through this anymore, itâ€™s been two years too long. Iâ€™ll never tell you how bad you truly hurt me, Iâ€™ll never tell you that the pain is so unbearable I donâ€™t want my life anymore. I love you too much and I donâ€™t ever want you to feel obligated to be with me because I canâ€™t handle the pain. I want you to want to be with me like I want you but you donâ€™t and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. 

You moved on after a month.. like I was nothing. Like everything we went through was nothing. Remember when you proposed to me? I was so happy. I wanted you forever and I still do, and going through life without you hurts me too fucking much. Maybe Iâ€™ll accidentally overdose, maybe Iâ€™ll die in a car crash, whatever way I go out just know youâ€™ll be the last thing on my mind.
