God help me I don't know whats wrong with meI don't know why Im like this I hate that Im like this 
Why can't I just get settled down and life the life I want to live
Ive been doing this shit for so long, Ive worked so hard and Im so tired. I just want a break  but it only gets harder and harder and it demands more of my time and sanity

I don't know how people do it. I can't keep myself in check Im losing my mind right now I can't do this just give me a break. Why am I like this why was I made to be this unmotivated and lazy its fucking cruel I can't deal with this fucking brainwash me into doing it if you have to right now I can't do anything life wants me to do.
