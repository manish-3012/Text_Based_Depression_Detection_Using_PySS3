tomorrow is my birthday, i don't want it.Tomorrow I turn 29, and have nothing to show for it. Not in the material sense. Not in the cosmic sense. In no sense at all. I was was watching this television show and a scene hit me hard. The two characters were talking about existence and one says (I'm paraphrasing) "if the life you envision in your dreams isn't beautiful, then why are you alive?" In that moment everything clicked. When I close my eyes and dream, I cannot even envision a beautiful future. How can I go on knowing that even in my imagination there is no peace or hope for me? I know I'm some nobody woman to you all but I wanted to write some of these last thoughts on how to not end up like me. On how to be a better person:

*don't let fear run your life

*respect yourself enough to not stick around for people who don't care about you

*if you have a passion, pursue it with everything. it should be scary not comfortable.

*work towards your goals (I had a dream to live in new york city when I was 19. Had I worked towards this, I'd be there today. Instead I didn't, and I'm stuck in some  town in the middle of nowhere.)

I hope you all lead better lives. For what it's worth, I became an organ donor recently, so hopefully I can at least do one thing good in my absence.
