Anyone else tired of listening to people who donâ€™t understand?Everyday it seems like everyone has all the answers for me. Stop doing this, start doing this.. but theyâ€™re not living through this. They donâ€™t understand what it feels like. I appreciate people wanting to help but more often than less they are just saying everything cause theyâ€™re tired of seeing me depressed.

I feel like Iâ€™m constantly annoying people, and everyoneâ€™s so tired of it. I hate it, and it makes things even worse in my head. Everyone says go get help, but what help is there really? Is there actually any type of help for this? Iâ€™m starting to feel like Iâ€™ll be stuck this way forever. 

Being this way ruins everything, I canâ€™t put 100 percent of myself into anything cause more than half of me is off somewhere else, thinking of the end. Sorry for the rant, just felt like getting it off my chest.
