Need help with my lifeHello friends hope everyone is alove and healthy Baruch Hashem. 

As the title reads, I need some help with my life. For about a year, I have been contemplating suicide. I am a 27 year old male who believes my life is essentially over. I have attempted suicide before, when I was 20. I walked to a river and I laid by it holding a pistol to my temple, while sobbing at the moon. After about 20 minutes, I tossed the pistol into the river. 

Seven years later....

I am feeling the same suicidal tendancies again. 

Though, I may never ultimately do it because it would inflict much pain upon my family, specically my mother who has given me her all. She has taught me everything from science to language, given me the best education. 

Most important of all, she gave me the gift of life. She carried me around for nine months, never drank or smoked; she has given me the utmost care and devotion - she has given me pure love and to reward that love with selfish suicide would be the utmost injustice.

That said... I feel like pure garbage and I may actually do it. 

I feel in love with someone. But she is completley racist towards me. Her mother has a lot of political power in the small town I live in. She is the county commissioner. They smeared my name into the ground. This is killing me because now everyone thinks I am the evil one. 

The worst part is, even though she calls me a monkey, mocks the color of my skin for being "brown" and comparing it to smelly feces, accuses me of being a drug dealer, calls me a f@&amp;&amp;$t, accuses me of being a bloody incel when I am not because I love women and I am not a virgin; it is as if everthing evil is being condensed into one small ball and she is hurling that ball of hatred and malice at me; despite all this, I still love her. 


I don't know what to do. I feel like this is it. Please help
