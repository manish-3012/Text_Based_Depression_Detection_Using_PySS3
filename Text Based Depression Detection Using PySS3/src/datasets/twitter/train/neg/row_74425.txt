An Uninteresting Title.I utterly hate my life. I honestly don't even know what to do at this point. I want to die but my step brother killed himself and I don't want to put my family through it.

 My family consists of a sister whom I hardly get along with, a father I don't talk much to, a mother who really isn't and never was a mother, and a nana who sends random memes everyday who doesn't understand quite how depressed I truly am.
 I've spent many days after work just sitting trying to muster the motivation to do something but cannot. 

 I had an ex that ruined me financially whom I put first completely, this resulted in me losing many (all) of my friends (if I even had any let's be real). 
 I use weed (Canadian so it's illegal not that it matters anyway) to pretty much ignore my life. I am out of weed and honestly don't feel comfortable driving atm due to some crazy suicidal thoughts. 

 I've been depressed since I can remember and self harmed quite a bit in my younger years as well as a few times in the more recent years (23 years old). 

I'm very tired of trying, I'm tired of not having a family, I'm tired of being lonely.

I feel so guilty about everything because everything's been blamed on me my entire life (my mother literally blamed me for my parents divorce when I was 12 or 13).

I've fucked up everything I've ever had or done. 


I really don't know what this post will even accomplish. Hope you're entertained I guessðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸
