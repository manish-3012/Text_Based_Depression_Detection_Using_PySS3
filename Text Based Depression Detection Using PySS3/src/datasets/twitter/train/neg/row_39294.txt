Finals are in a week, and I feel like blowing my head off.I despise the engineering degree I enrolled for in college, but couldn't back out because dad has spent way too much money on it. I didn't think too hard about it 4 years ago and just enrolled thinking it'll be ok, but it was nothing like I expected, and I soon lost any interest I once had.  I'm now resitting failed papers in what is supposed to be my final semester, but I don't think it's going to go anywhere. I've been barred from a few of them because I didn't attend enough classes and their demanding show-cause letters which I cannot provide. And the truth is I don't attend classes because I have zero interest in whatever they're teaching.  I'm going to get a gun and shoot myself before the week is over.  I can't do this anymore. My parents will be disappointed in me either way.  Fuck life.
