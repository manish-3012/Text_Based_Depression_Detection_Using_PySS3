existentially flipping the fuck out always.im a girl with high functioning autism. But I don't like to call it high functioning because I am completely non functioning. i feel like my brain is wrong and I must have been born not wanting to do. I feel no pleasure, there's nothing I want to be on this Earth for. The last time I had motivation was as a 7/8 year old. the motivation was school. And the only reason it motivated me was this false idea of happiness and thinking there was some perfect existence out there in the "grown up world" if you do well in school. I feel like if I had actually known the truth I would've killed myself right then. I wanted to do well only because I had this vague idea of going to college eventually, gaining money, and achieving status. I thought these things were what made people genuinely happy at their core. I started to realize that it was just a game to play in a rigged system. I got so depressed by the pointlessness of it all that I began refusing to go to school when i was like 12. None of it made sense to me so instead of school I spent my time doing childish albeit entrepreneurial things. I made less than minimum wage, but it kept me happy for awhile because it was by my own doing. But after a few years even the concept of doing things for monetary gain began to disgust me to the point of nonfunction. Most specialists said I was only getting worse because I wasn't in school. so at 16 I got a GED and went back and forced myself to finish a couple years of college, did everything I was supposed to and tried my hardest to put on a smiling face and force myself back into "being normal" but all I do is burst into tears spontaneously and have panic attacks during class and whenever I try to participate in society, because everything seems to remind me that we're in such a depressing reality. I never wanted to be here in the first place and I don't know what to do but kill myself now.
