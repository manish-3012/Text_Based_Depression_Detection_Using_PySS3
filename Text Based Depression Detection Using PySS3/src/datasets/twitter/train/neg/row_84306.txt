How do I say I'm not okI'm writing this at apretty low point so I'm sorry if it's incoherent I just really need advice and I don't know where to go.
 I've been toying with the idea of killing myself for years now, I'm a really anxious person too like to the point where leaving the house makes me panic. I dont have any irl friends, my dad's job means I move nearly every 2 years and I'm online schooled so I've got no outlet.
 I've just about pushed away the friends I have online because just interacting with people, even though I've known them for a good while, is so damn scary. Like I'm just so scared all the time it's so draining. I don't know if it'd even be fair for me to tell them about the fact I wish I was dead anyways.
  My parents are really hard to talk to like I really want to tell my mom but I can't seem to find the courage anyways. Not to mention my dad says suicide is for the weak. I don't know what to do, I'm just so tired of cutting and being scared.
