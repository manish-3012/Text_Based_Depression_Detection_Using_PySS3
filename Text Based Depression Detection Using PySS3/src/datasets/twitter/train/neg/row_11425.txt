Every year I want to end it but I'm too chickenEvery, single, fucking, year! Ever since my grandpa died when I was 16 I've wanted to end it. I've tried and I couldn't go through with it. I'm too afraid that I'll be caught and be forced into hospitalization. I can't afford to be off work much less a fucking hospital! Worst part is I have two animals I love dearly but I'm terrified I'll get angry and hurt or kill them by accident. It would be easier for everyone if I end it but I'm too scared
