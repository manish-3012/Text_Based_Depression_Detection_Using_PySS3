Everything in my life has gone wrong and I can't deal with it anymoreI am a 26 year old man and I do not see the point in living any longer. Every dream I've ever had has been dashed. I went to a mediocre college and got a useless degree. I've never really had any friends and in general people just seem to hate me or at the very least dislike me. I was in graduate school but I had to drop out because I was so depressed. I have no skills or talents, I suck at everything I do no matter how much effort I put into it. My hair is falling out, I have a hunchback, a protruding belly and disgusting skin. I've never had a boyfriend, which is beyond pathetic at my age. I can't get a job and any job I do find will probably be terrible. I don't see any reason to continue on living, none of my problems are going to get better and in all likelihood they will just get worse.
