I may have failed at saving a friend.I know next to nothing about her. She was in a chat room I was in, and ran off sounding bad, so I PM'ed her and she would hardly talk.

I couldn't get her to say anything. She says she took a full bottle of lexapro. 

If she's not dead tomorrow, what can I do to help? How can I talk to someone who won't talk back? No one in the chat room knows her any better than I do. I'm really at a loss.
