Thinking of killing myself in the next days. Hello Reddit. 

I'm thinking of killing myself. 

The reasons ? I loved a girl like I never loved any other person, she told she had feelings for me too, but now she can't make a choice between her current partner and me ( aka she doesn't give a shit about me ) 

She was the only thing bringing joy in my life.

Now it's over.
