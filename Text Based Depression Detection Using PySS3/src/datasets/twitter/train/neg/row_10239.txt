Why wait?Why should I keep waiting? Why should I keep putting it off? I romanticize my suicide so much that it feels like a super distant goal but I could literally do it right now. It doesn't have to be special or a big gesture. I could just fucking do it. It would be so easy. I want to use a gun but don't have one. I'm afraid it will hurt is the only reason I haven't done it yet. Pussy. Fucking hell.
