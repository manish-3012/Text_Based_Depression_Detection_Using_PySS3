Someone talk to me ASAPIâ€™m a fucking mess. Iâ€™m 17 almost 18. Before I even start I know Iâ€™m young and â€œthereâ€™s a lot to live forâ€ and whatever but please hear me out. Iâ€™m adopted, I have a relationship with my real dad but itâ€™s akward and whatever. Typical black dad. No clue what my mom is doing, just know sheâ€™s an addict somewhere in Cali. My adoptive family is a strange situation. I have two loving parents who make a lot of money, but donâ€™t really know how to parent a kid like me. Then again who does. With three other adoptive kids, our family has slowly grown disfunctional. I have a shit load of problems myself. ADHD, lifelong depression, bipolar disorder, and a lot of undiagnosed things idk how to explain. I have these super impulsive thought that are absolutely crazy. Like killing someone. Iâ€™ve never made a plan or come close to doing anything near that, but knowing that it was in my mind for a mere second bothers the shit out of me. I have never found genuine happiness in my life, and Iâ€™ve been in situations where I feel like I shouldâ€™ve been happy or grateful but I just canâ€™t feel it. The scariest part of this all is I think Iâ€™m going crazy. Iâ€™m starting to hear voices, extreme mood swings, and other crazy stuff making my body feel like itâ€™s braking down. Itâ€™s so bad that I used to have COLLEGE OFFERS for basketball sophomore yearand now Iâ€™m not a starter. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself many times, and in doing so have permanently fucked up my quality of life. Huffing has, taking 50 Benadryl, a shit ton of opioids, my brain isnâ€™t nearly what it used to be. Iâ€™m going downhill as I have been since junior high. I have a shit ton of hydrocodone in my room and donâ€™t see much stopping me. Iâ€™m not sure why but something inside me is telling me to ask for support. I canâ€™t tell my parents because Iâ€™ll get locked up in a facility just like last year. PLEASE HELP BEFORE I DO SOMETHING STUPID.
