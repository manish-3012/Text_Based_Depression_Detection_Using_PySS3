being gay is killing meI just cant come out, I know if I do its all over. I have supportive friends who dont mind gays but I still cant come out. My parents will kill me, divorce me or anything. My dad thinks its a sickness and my mum thinks its a trend. I just dont want to do it anymore, everyday I hope a car runs me over or I get shot. Everyday. I listen to all my friends and their girlfriends and I just get so fucking jealous. I want to be normal, I dont want to be gay, why why why. Im so fucking done, Ive tried covering up for, tried convincing myself i was bi and asexual. I just cant do it anymore, I want a girlfriend, I want it to be natural. I dont want to be gay. Every day I hope its just a phase and when im 18 ill grow out of it, I just cant be gay, i really fucking cant. I dont have anything against it, and if my parents werent so homophobic I wouldve come out, but I cant risk it. Everyday its getting worse and worse, im so fucking depressed and miserable. Why Why does being gay have to be a thing, I just want to die, i dont want to like guys, I want to like girls for fucks sake
