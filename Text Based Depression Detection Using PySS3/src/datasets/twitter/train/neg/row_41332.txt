Why are people always saying that suicide is not the solution?Couldn't it be that one's life is so unbearable and difficult to change that suicide is infact the easy solution? If someone managed to change his life for the better, they will say that it was worth it. But they say that because they now are in a better spot. For someone whos life is pain doesn't know how long it will be that way. 

Also, why is suicide egoistical? Isn't it one's own desicion to make? Are not the other people asking not to do it egoistical since it is not their choice? 

Ps: I'm not that sucidal that I need help. I don't think about how I would do it. I just think that not existing would be easier sometimes.
