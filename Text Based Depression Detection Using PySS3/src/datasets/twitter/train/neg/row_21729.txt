Need help to deal with suicidal thoughtsSo, IÂ´m Always was this hyper sensitive guy. I Always deal with this sensibility, closing myself for everyone. Ultil I meet this girl and see in her the opportunity to trust. 13 years later our history became a history of intense abuse, cheating and violence. Pretty much like my mother, sometimes she love me with all of your heart, sometimes she hate me with the same intensity, one can never see when the hate will come, one word, one behavior.

I tolerate this, because in the timeline I lost my gramma and my mother, itÂ´s like she was my only Family and the only person that sometimes can understand me. We have this moments, where she is just beautiful and at this moments I can se a purpose in my life. 

IÂ´m a not easy person, ADHD with depression, after the abuses I became a alcohool adict.

But the fact is that I never hate, I donÂ´t even know how to hate someone and hurt someone on purpose. For the tenth time she dumped me on a crisis, we pass like 20 days taking care of her sexuals issues, talking, with me showing to her where she is hurting herself, and after this 20 days in my birthday, after a lot of alcohool I just canÂ´t face her hate and start to scream with her, she got away, block me from phone, imÂ´s and stuff and I find myself sttrugling a lot with this classical suicidal thoughts, donÂ´t even know what to do, IÂ´m 3 days without sleep right and eat, finding motive to not end all.
