No one would even notice whether I will be goneFuck throwaways. I don't care anymore, since apparently I only matter whenever people want me to do something for them.

I want to die. No one will even notice I'm gone once I pay my dues. Only 3 more months living in this hellhole and slowly cutting ties from everyone I know. Once it's done, I'll just off myself. No more suffering. No more bullshitting my way through the day, no more masking the pain my own existence brings upon me. Nothing will remain and I've never desired anything more than for this shit called life to end.

Nothing brings me joy anymore; my greatest passion is just another thing which shows me how big of a failure I am. All of it is just a goose chase after some abstract goal, which once reached with countless hours of effort, blood, sweat and curses doesn't even feel rewarding. Just another thing off an endless bucket list.

I have no more will to live. I'm lying to everyone around me everyday just to go by, pretending to be someone I never was and never will be. I don't understand how anyone ever could have thought that the piece of trash that I am is worth anything.

Once I'm gone they will know I never was of any value... Can't wait for their realization of this.
