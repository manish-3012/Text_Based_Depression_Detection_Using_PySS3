I know it's time for the end but I still have questions to be answeredHello,

I have posted on here before and I have some updates since my last post. Last time, I was feeling down and I wanted to know of ways of which I could commit suicide. I have learned that my life cannot be altered in ways of which will make me happy with myself. I have a plan and a set date of when I will kill myself, and I have decided to go with the carrier bag method over the head. I have felt so different from everyone else, because I do not act typical and I get severely anxious when I'm in public. I have no one to talk to as the people I stay with are not even real family. I know if I execute this plan, I will die. But before I do this, does anyone think there is any other way of removing this pain that I feel? A constant shatter of internal pain that overpowers my entire body, entices racing irrational thoughts and provides me with an urge to harm myself. Please, I really want some answers because as far as I am concerned, ending my life will be the only way of losing this pain.
