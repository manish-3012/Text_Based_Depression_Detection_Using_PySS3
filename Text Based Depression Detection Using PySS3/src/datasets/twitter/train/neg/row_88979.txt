My mom was right. I can't be happy.When I was about 11(?) I got into an argument with my mom and grabbed a knife and threaten to kill myself.    My brother begged me not to and I  just remember the smirk on her face as she said "Govtlist's not going to do it" and walked away. 


 I don't even remember the last time I genuinely got a hug from someone.  I don't know why I exist. Everytime I think about  just stopping it all I  remember her smirk  saying I'm not. She was right.  Same as when she said I can't be happy. Same as when she said I'm the devil.   One day I am going to prove her wrong and fucking do it and what's funny is she won't care she'll just  fake cry and mention how I was never happy.  She'll  still be right.
