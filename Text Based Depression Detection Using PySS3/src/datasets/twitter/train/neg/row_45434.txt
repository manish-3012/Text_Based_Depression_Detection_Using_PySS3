I desperately need helpI've wanted to die since 1989.  I've tried so many fucking wide varieties of therapeutic things to help me.  and I ONLY ONLY ONLY get worse.

ONLY.

I've been hospitalized before and there is never any type of benefit there.

no matter what, i'm beyond fucking miserable.  it lets up for a few days (maybe weeks) here and there.

i can't get what I want/need from anyone.  when it gets worse....it gets VERY VERY bad.  right now it's very very bad.

its not even worth it to keep writing....

i'm that one person who the therapist actually thinks I should kill myself.  my family thinks that.  and I just need to make it happen.
