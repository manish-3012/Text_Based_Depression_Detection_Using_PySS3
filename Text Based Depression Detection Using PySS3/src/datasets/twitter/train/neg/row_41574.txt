Constant NegativityIâ€™m a successful and talented person, but I have some major flaws. It seems I canâ€™t make friends that are positive influences on me. My best friend has borderline personality disorder and makes loads of drama. My college program classmates donâ€™t really know me and donâ€™t care to get to know me, despite my constant attempts to make friends and join study groups. My mother makes every reference she can to convince me that Iâ€™m a woman (Iâ€™m a trans man.) Iâ€™m so lucky to have my wife, but even she spends most of her time complaining, and often doesnâ€™t understand my needs.

I 50% want to die and 50% want to run away. The latter isnâ€™t looking too great, as Iâ€™m terrible at making friends and Iâ€™d be just as lonely anywhere else in the world. I canâ€™t go for the former because my parents would broadcast me as their confused little girl who was influenced by the LGBT community and then killed herself (fuck them for indirectly taking that choice from me.)

Iâ€™m intelligent and ambitious, and quickly becoming successful professionally, and I have many other talents and hobbies, at many of which I excel. So why do I feel so damn empty? Am I never going to be happy? Even with success and money, is this emptiness all there is? What the hell am I supposed to do with it?
