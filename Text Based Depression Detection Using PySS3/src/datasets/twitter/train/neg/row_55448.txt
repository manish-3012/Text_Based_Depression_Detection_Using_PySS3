Do You Realize How Easy It Would Be To Kill Myself Right Now? It's 10:49, Sunday night, July 13, 2019 and I'm honestly thinking of just downing a bottle of my meds. 

God, how I got here is a long-ass story starting when I was the old age of 2. I'm 21 and still going though the same bs with new bs as the cherry. 

I am completely shitfaced. Drunk and high and it would be so easy to just down a bottle of my meds.

Hell, my Nmom asked me if I'd taken them yet, I replied with "I can't take them with a stomach of alcohol." 

She laughed. \*LAUGHED\* And said in that tone that says, \*\*just do it, save me some trouble\*\*, "Will you ever take them?"

My mind is so fucked up from everything in my past, I hardly know what reality is anymore. 

I'm going to take another shot and hopefully blackout or pass out. We'll see if I'm alive tomorrow...
