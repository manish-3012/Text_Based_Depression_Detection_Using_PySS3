HELP PLS!I'm a 20 y old student (nurse course), its 5 am, and I can't think straight right now. Last year I told my parents I wanted to drop out of university, and they forced me to stay, threatening to kick me out of home, get rid of my computer cellphone, basically destroy the things I love the most. Pls help, for real! This is 100% genuine, sry for any mistake but my head is spining 200km/h
