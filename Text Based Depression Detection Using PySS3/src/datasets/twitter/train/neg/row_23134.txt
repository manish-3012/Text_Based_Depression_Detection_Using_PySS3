I can't do this anymoreMy bestfriend and the love of my life just told me she hated me and told me goodbye and blocked me she was the only person I had I spent every second of my free time with her we slept together every night on call we said we loved eachother and now she is gone and I have all of these feelings that mean nothing and all of this heartache I know I fucked up and this is all my fault but I wish we could.of just put the past behind us I nevrr wanted to hurt hurt I did it so she wouldn't get hurt but I broke her precious little heart trying to not break her heart I know it sounds fucking stupid but I love her so much and now she is gone and im all alone again and I can't be alone again so I am done with this life I can't take this pain and heartache its to much I can barley move im in so much pain so I guess I am givint up on falling in love and this shitty life I live so goodbye D U were so prcious to me and I hope someday u can forgive me for breaking your precious little heart
