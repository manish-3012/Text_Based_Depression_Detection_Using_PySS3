i want to die before the year ends. whats the quickest way ?couple reasons why i wanna die.

first, my sister has been sexually molesting me and i never realized it until recently. i cant go into details of how traumatizing it actually was bc reddit will ban me again. lets just say realization dawned on me slowly and painfully. second, my family is mentally abusive. they dont respect my boundaries and only care about grades. they mock people who are suicidal and believe mental health doesnt exist. all under a "christian" facade. third, my failed friendship. i had a best friend of three years. but i projected all my anger and feelings that was all coped up from years before onto her. i was way to clingy and disrespected her boundaries. then her bf sent me two essays as to why i was disgusting and need to leave. i was a monster. i AM a monster. on her side of the story, she did wrong things too. we both understood our mistakes. but the apologies seemed so fake. in her fit of anger. she said "she thinks she has it rough. i wish she'd fucking disappear." see, i didnt cry at these messages. i laughed at them. they were honestly amusing, but they still hurt. like before, it took me a while to actually feel hurt. i dont cry easily, unless its my family. i cant stand them

its almost been a year since the failed friendship incident. since then, ive kept my mouth shut and smiled wherever i go. it took me a year to realize i wasnt needed. im only a burden, a waste of air. nobody needed me. nobody depended on me. nobody cared for me.  

the day after christmas is the 1st anniversary of that incident. i wanna die that day. i want to send her a message, apologizing to her for everything i did wrong. "youll be happy because ur wish will be fulfilled." afterwards, who knows what? i expect to kill myself before the year ends. i want to die quickly and peacefully, knowing that everyone will cry a bit then move on.

what's the quickest way to die ?
