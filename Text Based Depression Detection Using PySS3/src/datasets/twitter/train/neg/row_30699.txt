Unsure about lifeI'm not sure why, but within the past year my mind has centered around the thought of suicide. Before it used to be something I shrugged off as just one of those random thoughts running through my mind, but now they frequent much more often and I'm not entirely sure why. Within the last two weeks, I've actually considered ways to go out. My life has hit somewhat of a low point which may explain why these emotions of sadness and despair are coming out. Still the whole 6 months of college, it had been running through my mind here and there. I realized that these thoughts started forming whenever I thought about the future I set for myself and who I have made myself out to be. It may just be the anxiety weighing in on whether I'll be successful or not, but I hope this feeling goes away soon.
