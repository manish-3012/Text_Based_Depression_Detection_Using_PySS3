Fucked up dreams fuck me upI have SUPER vivid, repetitive and fucked up dreams. This causes me to feel dissociated(questioning if the dream world is even actual less "real" than our "real world" because my memories from there seem just as real to me if not moreso). This really bothers me though, especially accidentally lucid dreaming was very scary for me, so I've basically become an insomniac because I'm so afraid of having dreams that make me feel even more confused and dissociated. And it seems that the only way I do not remember and dreams is to smoke a lott of weed. Does anyone something that might resemble and explanation or good advice? Thank you
