How can you just forget about me.I don't know if I will ever forget the fact that he left me. I don't know if I will ever forget the fact that I told him, "If you don't want me there, then don't invite me!" and that was the last set of words that he heard me speak. And he did invite me to something about two years ago, much later, but I didn't go. I couldn't. If I did, would I still be the same fool? Would anything be different? Because I always think it's going to be different and it isn't. It never is. He told me once, "we will be together in the future, but not right now." This was said about 6.5 years ago after many nights of ruthless sex and agony that lasted longer than it should have. And the whole time he said he didn't want to be with me. And here I am, what, less than 10 years later and still a fucking fool. Dreaming about him and being prescribed medication for it. Still dreaming about him. So am I supposed to change my mind? It's been too fucking long. What is he waiting for? Is he ever going to try to talk to me again? Just plain conversation? Tell me he is in as much pain as me. Tell me he feels the way I feel, years after being tossed aside like a sack of old clothes.
