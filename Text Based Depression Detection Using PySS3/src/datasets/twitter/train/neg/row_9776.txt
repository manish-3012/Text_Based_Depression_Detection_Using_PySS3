just get in the cari want to just get in my car and drive to a quiet place where no will find me. i have the rope next to me i just wish i had the courage. i have no friends. no one that truly loves me. my two best friends my mom and sister are dead. i wish i could join them. i feel so empty all the time but the drugs sure do help, for about 10 minutes. 
fuck everything
