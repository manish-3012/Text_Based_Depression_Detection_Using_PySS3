So some details:

I am 19 I am in village isolated from other people There aren't ither places ar ound I can stay in. Just either abandoned houses or random houses of people. I barely have cash I am stuck with verbally and sometimes psychical abusive mother that is controlled and dad enabler. The closest bigger village I can go is 34 mins away by foot I don't have any friend that can drive me or to move to. I don't have documents cos she stealed them Zoom classes should be attended
