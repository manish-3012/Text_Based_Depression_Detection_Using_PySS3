Trying to understand if this could be suicide. I dont know if this is allowed here but I am really trying to see what his mind set could have been with this provided information. His family is deleting everything on social media. I feel so guilty and bad for him. I dont know what to do.Today about 40 minutes ago I just heard that ex co-worker (45) who was the manager of the 2nd branch of my bosses small business died under uncertain circumstances. He was found in his room by his son (17) unconscious and unresponsive. There isn't any additional information.

What makes this even more peculiar is that he was fired and being sued by my boss for slander on the business and unethical practices. My boss is a lawyer so he was really going after him with all the knowledge he had. As his assistant, he had me send out the updated court documents for the case to the Clerk of Courts and I would look over them to make sure they were in the correct order. 

The my ex-coworker was a completely normal guy financially. The slander had yet to be proven and it was just by word of mouth. The real reason the my boss was so angry at him is because his branch ended up failing and we were losing money from some of the mistakes or lack of clientele. My ex-coworker lost our biggest client by trying to rush our work and get it completed at an excessive and bewildering pace which caused things to slip through the holes.

My boss was suing him for over 300,000 dollars for this. My ex-coworker was not steady when it came to his came and my boss knew that he was winning. One day, I brought up the situation to him.

He looked at me with the coldest look on his face and laughed and told me. "**I hope "name" kills himself, I really do.**"

My supervisor, just under my boss walked in and heard it too. We told him he couldn't possibly be serious, that he had to just be emotional, that ex-coworker had kids.

He repeated that he was not emotional, in the coldest voice i have heard, " I really hope that son of a bitch kills himself, I don't care. **I hate him.** I really do."

My boss is a lawyer like I said. He is very good at hiding himself when he needs to, however over the years, I've noticed times where he will slip. Times where he will get angry and say crazy things, or need something and openly manipulate one of his employees and laugh about it to others, get drunk nearly everyday in his office and figure out how to complete shady business deals with the local officials he knows. Anything in order for money and power, and if you cross him you will be fucked in that town. He hold it in his hand like his winning token with the legacy his father, who was a lawyer, established before him. He continued to say those things throughout the entirety of the case.

I know he was really pushing limited in the case. One of the demands was that he registered on a business fraud list and he could never be in that business again. Some others where worse.

I'm not sure what to think about this, but my gut feeling is that he pushed things too far and ex-coworker really did end up doing something. I feel terrible for knowing this. If this really is a suicide, should I say anything?
