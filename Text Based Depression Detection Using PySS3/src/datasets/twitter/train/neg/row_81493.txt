my biggest fear is ending up alone.
When I was 8 years old my mother decided to go with a partner and leave us, my father was not very present in my childhood either.

my older sister ended up raising me and my sisters.
recently my sister is making plans to start living her life and moving in with her partner. for worse in recent years my social anxiety has worsened and I no longer know what to do.
