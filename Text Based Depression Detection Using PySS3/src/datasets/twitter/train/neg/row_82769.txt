I tried to kill myself last week and failed.I wish that fucking belt never broke.. I should have died when I hung myself, but just like everything else in my life, I canâ€™t even get suicide right. Iâ€™m just a burden. an annoyance. a problem for everyone. I bring pain and unhappiness to anyone around me, and the worst part being that I do it to myself.  my anxiety drives me into fits of rage. I would rather fight than cry. and people dismiss it as â€œoh heâ€™s just an asshole.â€ â€œheâ€™s just hot headed.â€ â€œhe just needs grow up already.â€ but nobody taught me how to grow up. nobody showed me how to hold a healthy relationship. or control my emotions. im just so tired of being here. my soul is tired, and beaten. I just donâ€™t want to deal with this life anymore, because all i ever do is make things worse on everyone around me. and itâ€™s never going to change as badly as i want it to. so I guess Iâ€™m just done. Iâ€™m over hurting everyone. everyone might hurt at first. but i donâ€™t want them at my funeral. I needed them while I was alive. they donâ€™t get to need me when Iâ€™m dead.
