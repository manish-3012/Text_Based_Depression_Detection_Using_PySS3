Lost life savingsI had this dream when I was young that I could have enough money to be free.

I came incredibly close to that dream. Unfortunately, I trusted the wrong person at the worst possible time. Now, he's laughing all the way to that bank. One minor, forgettable payday for him is a lifetime of suffering for me.

The only thing that will help is getting that money back. But $80,000 isn't exactly easy to come by. Sure, anybody can walk up to you and rape you of $80,000, but nobody ever wants to give you $80,000. Hell, ask a stranger to give you five bucks, and watch them laugh in your face.

I know. I was stupid for trusting the wrong person. I should have done more research. But I was in a bind at the time.

Years of being shoved from town to town, being treated like garbage, fearfully navigating a world I was never asked to be born into, enduring decades of torture, suffering, tears, thinking that just a little more pain and I can get through this, only to have one dumbass waltz in and rape you out of everything you've ever worked for just so that he can buy another summer home.

I used to try not to hate. But when somebody rapes you that viciously, leaving you to rot in agony for decades while they party for the rest of their lives, what are you supposed to do? Give them a thumbs up and tell them everything is fine and dandy?

I don't know what to do. The only that will help is getting that money back and becoming young again at the same time. So I just bide my time playing Boggle on my phone during the day and ranting on Reddit at night to curb the crippling loneliness that lurks in the background on top of the existential terror of a lifetime's work lost.

I don't know what to do.
