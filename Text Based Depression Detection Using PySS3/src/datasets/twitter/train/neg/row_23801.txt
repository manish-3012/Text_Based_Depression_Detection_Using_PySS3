Chronically ill, how do I do life?Seriously, I've been sick for years and it never got better. Basically my body reacts allergic to anything I eat, literally anything. I want to go on, but how is what I don't know since I often can even function well enough for daily tasks let alone school/work/social life/whatever. At best I sit in my room making beats for fun, unless I am too depressed.
