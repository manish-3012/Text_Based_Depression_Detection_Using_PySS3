I have the means to but why don't I?I just don't know anymore, these ups and downs I have been experiencing are excruciating. I have tried so many anti-depressants and the recent one that i am on seems to bring out a shit-load of anger in me. The other night I took a whole bunch of Klonopin and a temazepam and apparently I was up for an extra 3-4 hours that night playing games with my online friends that I have no memory of? Apparently I was really emotional too. I have a bruise on my leg and have vague memories of shambling around my house. I just don't really know what to do right now because it is so difficult to open up to anybody or to find someone that I really click with. I guess the loneliness of it all is screwing with me above all else. Its sorta like I want to hold out and get things in my life to be better but on the other hand I could easily paint the walls with my own brain matter. Its a sick thought but I just want this emotional pain to stop.
