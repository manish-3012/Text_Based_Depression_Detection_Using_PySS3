Does it ever get better? Really?I was diagnosed with major depression, anorexia and severe PTSD four years ago, and I have not been able to feel as though it will ever get better. I put on a show for those around me, make excuses, "I'm just tired", "I'm not hungry", "I'm just a bit cold", "it's nothing important", all lies. I haven't gotten better at all, and I honestly can't see myself ever defeating this. I eat myself up everyday, multiple times a day, degrading myself, self harming, starving myself, thinking back on my suicide attempts, and never taking chances with other people in both making friendships and, in the rare case that I like someone, telling them. I'm just not worthy of happiness or love. I mean, I want to take a chance, but who the fuck could love someone like me?! 
Does it ever really go away? Is there ever going to be a day where I don't count calories, where I don't scream at myself, where I can truly believe that he wonderful people I socialise with think I'm a nice person, and where I can stop thinking about the past, and a way to end the future? Or should I just give up? Because honestly, giving up seems like the better option right now, for everyone involved in my life.
