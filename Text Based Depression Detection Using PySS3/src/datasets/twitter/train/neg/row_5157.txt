Pro-Suicide ( What If ) Is there anyone out there who believes in pro-suicide that would sit with person who had no one ( a throw away ) as they lay dying so they wouldn't have to die alone...? Keep in mind the person was going to do it anyway... This is a serious question. Email me if you don't feel comfortable posting below. So, any who, would you do it?

Why or Why Not. Be original.

Just because you think life is beautiful doesn't mean it is. Please no common one liners and stereotypical cheesy blah blah blah BS.
