Sick and tired of itI'm sick and tired of this shit. Undiagnosed medical condition. The medical community keeps saying it's anxiety and all in my head. My muscles have wasted, I am weak, tired, have 0 energy and don't see the point. 

The incompetence of the medical community did this to me. I was healthy, active, just moved into a new home and had no worries. This illness, which was most likely treatable when it happened, has worn me down.

My family and even my wife thinks I'm crazy. Yeah, that's why I have no forearms and rubber calfs, thighs and biceps. It doesn't take a doctor to know that you're suffering and a goner. Why live another few days or weeks or month in turmoil when the inevitable will happen anyways?

I'm so frustrated with the arrogance of doctors and the medical community. I used to LOVE science, forensic files, space, nature, you name it. Now, I despise it all. They'll spend YEARS trying to solve a murder case, but don't give a shit when you are wasting away right in front of their eyes. Anxiety. Such an easy excuse to be incompetent.

I see no more point to carry on...
