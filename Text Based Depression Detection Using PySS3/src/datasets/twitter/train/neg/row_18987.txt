Just looking to chat...It's just another lonely Friday night after another miserable week. I'm becoming really alarmed at how often I think about killing myself, and how strong the feelings and thoughts are sometimes. I feel like one day I'm just going to wake up and snap or something, you know? I have a whole host of overwhelming emotions and have nothing to do with them.

Anyway, I feel like a absolute dick to asking, but the SW community has been helpful to me in the past, (I've lost track of the number of throwaways I've made and deleted over my reddit career) so maybe someone could just talk to me for awhile? (AIM, MSN, etc) As you might imagine, I have absolutely nobody else to ask.

Again, I really do feel awful for asking, I'm sure you guys have something better to do. Don't bother with me unless you really don't have any other priorities or something...
