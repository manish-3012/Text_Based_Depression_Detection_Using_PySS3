Im thinking of ending it a lot latelyI donâ€™t even know where to start..I just fucking hate living.. I recently moved back to my parents and things just got worse.. back in 2016 I moved 600km away to chase after my ex but things didnâ€™t turn out how I imagined it..Iâ€™m to tired to type all of that if someone cares here is the full story of my shity [life ](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/i07f5j/please_someone_read_thru_thisi_just_need_someone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

If I only had the balls to do it..Iâ€™m just a pathetic piece of shit...a fucking loser..Iâ€™m in love with someone who wonâ€™t love me back..Iâ€™m stuck in place I hate and even if I would move back to the place I like things wouldnâ€™t be the same..I donâ€™t know where to go anymore..I just want it to end. Nothing satisfies me anymore..I used to be get some satisfaction from drugs but nothing...weed doesnâ€™t do it anymore, nor does coke, mdma or alcohol. It doesnâ€™t do anything anymore..I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m depended on it but it makes existing a lot easier for me. I used to have dreams and goals but I lost the will and strength to pursue them. I fell  trapped. I canâ€™t have the things I want. Iâ€™m even unable to find a job.. my family does love me but for some fucked up reason I donâ€™t care about it and about them. Iâ€™d give a damn if someone of them would drop dead. I know thatâ€™s fucked up but honestly I donâ€™t give a shit and thatâ€™s not normal I guess.. 

Iâ€™m a fucking 26 years old grown man and I just canâ€™t handle reality..Iâ€™m just weak and pathetic. 

I wish I was never born. If I only had the money Iâ€™d buy some opioids and just end it. Life isnâ€™t for me. 

I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m typing this..probably just to vent.
