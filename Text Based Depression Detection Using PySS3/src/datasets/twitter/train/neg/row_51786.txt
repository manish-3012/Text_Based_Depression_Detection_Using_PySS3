Guilti wont go into too much but, I've done something truly evil in my childhood that hasn't really bothered me so much as it has the past few years. I have always been distant and apathetic even as a child, I could never really identify with my feelings and have a great difficulty showing them. But within the past few years I've been feeling nothing but wave after wave of crippling guilt from my horrible deeds as a child. I cant apologize, I cant reverse the damage done and the moral battle in my head is tearing me apart. I can act like i'm a normal person all day just to lay down at night and fight away these evil urges and thoughts. or i just don't.  I don't want to be the person i am and have the thoughts that i do. These conflictions between who i am and who i want to be are literally about to kill me and i refuse to carry this guilt.
