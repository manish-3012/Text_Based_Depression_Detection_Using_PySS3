To each and everyone of you!Hello! I'm a 30 year old child care worker from Germany. I come from r/trees. But most of all I am your friend. Even though I don't know you, don't know what are your talents and abilities (and you got a lot of both of these) or what worries you carry around. 
But what I know is, that this world needs you. I need you. You are here for a reason. I am not good at speeches. But I want to tell you in simple and honest words: You are loved. 
Please. Please. Please. Stay with us. If you leave, the whole world changes. 
Right now you made me write this text. I'm thinking about you. You had an impact on my life. You can't go. We are friends now...
