My best friend hung himself on Saturday and I promise you that people actually do careI donâ€™t know if this post is allowed, but my best friend was the nicest most selfless person that ever existed and I promise you that everyone is feeling so lost and hurt and confused and thereâ€™s not a single person that is happy he isnâ€™t around anymore. He had just broken up with his girlfriend and was feeling heart broken, I wish I had realised how bad he was feeling but if he had told me I would have done everything I could. Donâ€™t wait for people to come to you, go to them, tell them youâ€™re hurting, give them a chance to fix things
