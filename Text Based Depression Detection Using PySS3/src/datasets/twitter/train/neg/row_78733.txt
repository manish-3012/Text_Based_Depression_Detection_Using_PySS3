I am going to kill myself if this appeal is rejectedIâ€˜m a student at a US high school, and our school has a limit of 10 absences per year. Iâ€™ve been dealing with a lot of depression and stuff like that, and ended up going over by about 12, because, well, some days it gets so bad I canâ€˜t even leave my bed.      

I have to write an appeal to the school board to excuse them, otherwise I wontâ€˜t get any credits for the classes Iâ€˜ve taken this year even though Iâ€˜m passing all of them. I doubt the school board will accept an appeal, because having personally dealt with the people on it, theyâ€˜re legitimately kind of assholes for no real reason other than I guess they like to feel powerful. If this appeal gets rejected, Iâ€˜d have to repeat a year of high school for really no reason, and I already have enough to deal with in my personal life, so isolating me socially from people my age and making me take an extra year in high school is not really going to help, at all.

So really Iâ€˜m left with the three options of dropping out, taking an extra year, or suicide. Other than this attendance thing Iâ€™m not even a bad student, I consistently have Aâ€˜s. Iâ€˜m not going to take an extra year or drop out for no reason, so I really only have the third option of suicide left.

If my appeal isnâ€™t accepted by the school board, Iâ€˜m going to hang myself. They meet June 1st, and wonâ€˜t hear anything until then, so I wonâ€™t know they meet.

Itâ€˜s pretty sad, Iâ€˜m a musician and enjoy it a lot, I compose a lot and perform in public when I can. I really just want this appeal to be accepted so I can continue doing what I want to do, but I am going to have to kill myself in the event itâ€™s rejected, which ultimately would be my best option.
