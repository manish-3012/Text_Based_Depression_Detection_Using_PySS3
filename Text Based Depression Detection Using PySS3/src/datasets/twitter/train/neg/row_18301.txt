Poem about mental illness and suicideMind is burning, tired of learning how to simply survive with my mind.

Voices speak, as my will becomes becomes weak

Canâ€™t quiet the storm, lightning flashes and thunder clatters, will to live has suddenly shattered. Few things in life suddenly matter 

Think of the kids, think of your mom, but I all I want is to feel the calm. 

Thoughts of termination suddenly ensue, end my life is the only way to get through.

A beautiful disease has consumed my soul. There is no freedom and I have no control. 

It controls my actions and my very being, I canâ€™t even trust what I am seeing. Delusions of grandeur, an all consuming power.

Life is worth living, some people say, but when all you feel is pain it needs to be stripped away. Take my life and release my soul, another attempt failed, disease forever in control.
