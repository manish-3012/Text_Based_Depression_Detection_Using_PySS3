Losing everythingDue to a violent lash out by my alcoholic father, we lost out house last year. We moved in with my grandparents, without him thank god, and the rebuilding of our new lives began. I sacrifice going away for school to stay and help my mom and siblings. I got a job using my truck to pick up garbage. Overall life was shitty but it at least I got by. I have a variety of mental issues but I was getting by. But God or whatever the universe just keeps kicking me down. We still struggle to pay bills. Still struggling to get my little brother in a good school. Still struggling to keep positive about stuff getting better. Tonight my trucks transmission went while I was at a stop light. I can't afford this. No one can help me. God could have caused it to fail in traffic, could have ended it for me. But no, just adds another burden and expect me to pull through. I'm not strong. I'm done. I'm useless now.
