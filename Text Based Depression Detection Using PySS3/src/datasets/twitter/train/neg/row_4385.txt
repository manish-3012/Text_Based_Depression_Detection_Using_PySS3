Any advice?  Hey, I'm 19, I was recently evicted from my last apartment. Moved in with my uncle, my social life is kinda in ruins, and getting into college was my plan but I guess that's been postponed due to complications. I'm working construction. Not a huge fan tbh. I think my friends have all forgotten about me since we'll every time we talked before I left I was depressed. And when I told them I was moving they seemed to take it as a goodbye for ever. I was hoping this would be a fresh start for me. idk even know what I want to do in college. I've considered Navy alot. I can't afford college and highschool I did really poorly. I've been having feelings of patheticness, I'm almost 20 and have lost my friends and girlfriend. I think alot about using some rope to give myself a liberty knot. So uhhh, any advice for someone at rock bottom?
