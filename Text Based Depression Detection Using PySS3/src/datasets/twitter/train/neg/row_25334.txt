Iâ€™m in pain all the timeI would hang myself in my apartment but Iâ€™ve looked around for a month and nothing will hold my weight. That means Iâ€™m going to have to get drunk and take all my pills. I have a 30 day supply of two different pills so that should wipe me out pretty quick.

Iâ€™m just in pain all the time. Iâ€™m just sad all the time and itâ€™s getting worse itâ€™s not getting better. I cry all the time I canâ€™t eat I canâ€™t focus at work. People just keep saying you should talk to someone but I canâ€™t even stay focused enough to do that. My family is tired of hearing about my problems. My only real friend is my ex and he makes me feel like my mental illness messed up our relationship. I canâ€™t go back to the hospital that place was horrible. 

I donâ€™t believe anyone can love me. I donâ€™t believe I will ever be happy again. I just donâ€™t want to feel like this every day. Iâ€™m just worn out.
