Is there any poimt to this?Im numb.  Ive tied a noose in my basement and tried to forget about it , but every time I go to do the laundry, it calls my name.  It feels as if i am just dragging myself through life looking for any vice to stop my mind from wandering to the dark places it inevitability ends up in.  I just want to feel myself melt into my bed one last time, but by dawn, itll be over.
