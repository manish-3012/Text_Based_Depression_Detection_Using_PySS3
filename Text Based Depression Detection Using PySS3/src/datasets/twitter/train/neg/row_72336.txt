I'm thinking of suicide.I've been fine for the last 4ish weeks. I used to cut myself just to stop feeling so numb and i never taught of suicide before. But I'm thinking of it now. I taught things were finally going to get better, i found someone amazing to talk to, but i ended up messing things up with them, and i just been out of it these last couple of days. I haven't cut my self yet; I'm to scared that I'll start and i won't be able to stop. I don't know why I'm thinking like this.
