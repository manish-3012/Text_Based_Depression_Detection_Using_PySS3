I'm just sitting in the bathroom at my cousin's wedding reception.I can hear the band playing outside. People are still trickling in. I'm the photographer. Well, one of the photographers. I just don't want to be here. At all. I can't connect with people. I feel like I'm on autopilot. Making eye contact with people just makes me feel sick. I can't stand it. This has been going on since May. I honestly didn't think I'd make it to November. I really don't want to be alive for another one of these months but it might just fucking happen. I need to buckle down or something. I just feel bad for being a shorty person.
