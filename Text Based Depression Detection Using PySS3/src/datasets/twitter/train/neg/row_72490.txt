I've always known that I would die on my birthdayI just never knew it would be this year.

I just... Can't... Any more.

I'd do it now, but I've got some things that need taking care of before October.

For a few minutes... Just a few, recently... I felt normal. I had a friend. 

That seems to have closed off, now.

I'm so lonely.
