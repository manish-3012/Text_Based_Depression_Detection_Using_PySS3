Found out I might be HIV positive, the icing on the cake that is my already worthless life. Some NSFW details inside. I want to die.Someone, help me, please. Anybody.

I'm a straight guy, 24 years old. About a year ago, I decided to experiment with my sexuality, and met a seemingly decent guy who I proceeded to give oral sex to. Long story short, I ended up swallowing his semen before I even knew what was happening.
Today, I heard from someone who had an ongoing relationship with this man, and only him, and who was recently diagnosed as HIV positive.  The only person who could have given it to him is the man I hooked up with.

My life is already so worthless, so wasted. I think about just ending it all every single day. Now, I find out that my own recklessness may have ended with a diagnosis of being HIV positive. I can't handle it. Knowing that so much of my life is over before anything even had the chance to happen.

If there's anyone who can help me. Please. I'm so ready to just end fucking everything before life does it for me.
