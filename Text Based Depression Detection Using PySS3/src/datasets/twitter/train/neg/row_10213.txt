No friends just want to end my misery.I spend all my days in my room (im a teenager) just dreaming about having a social life having friends, a girlfriend and living a good life but to me this is only fantasy. I am terrible at talking to any1 besides my family. I also dont have common interest among teenagers my age and if i told people my interest they would probably just make fun of me and call me a weirdo. I have a brother and a sister and also a mom (my dad is not around, never was) I have a close relationship with my sister but she is going to move-out soon. My brother i also have a close relationship with but we are drifting apart in-part due to not having the same interest as one and other (he likes sports and tv i dont). It would be selfish to leave them but i just cant take it anymore i find myself crying under my blanket in my room with my face in a pillow every night trying to sleep dealing with the pain of being lonely. i just want to fade away and hope that no1 ever knew i existed, but then again, another fantasy.
