Are suicidal thoughts (without any particular reason) a normal thing?I've been having these thoughts for about two weeks now. I've been thinking that my life has no reason, meaning. 
I work through temp. employment agency, we have a nice home and I do the work that I like, good relationship with coworkers etc. so I really have no idea where do these thoughts come from. Any advice?
