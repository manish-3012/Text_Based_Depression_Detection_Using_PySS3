I should be studying right now but suicide is all I can think aboutI have a very important exam soon and I basically have to study all day if I don't want to fail. I had to break up with my bf because he kept distracting me but now I feel even worse. I keep checking my phone even though I know there won't be anything. I'm crying all day...I'm just a mess. Idk what to do. Even before this life was a struggle. Everything I used to enjoy is now actually painful to me. I can't listen to music, can't watch movies, can't play games. I don't know when was the last time I was able to relax.  I had depression and anxiety all my life but this is so much worse it's hard to describe. The only reason im still alive is because I don't want to be an even bigger burden on people. Funeral would cost money I don't have and my sister is pregnant so I don't want to stress her out right now. I wish I could just stop existing...
