I hate people and meAll my life I've been searching for friends who I can trust and be myself around. Now I've found that group and I can't just be normal. They are wonderful people but I keep fucking everything up. I hate myself and the fact I can't fucking socialise. I wish I didn't need to socialise and could just be by myself alone.
Im pretty sure everyone secretly hates me.
