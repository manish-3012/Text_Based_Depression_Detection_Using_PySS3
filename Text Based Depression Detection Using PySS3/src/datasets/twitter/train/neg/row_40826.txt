What makes life worth living?Hello, I was wondering what the point of staying alive is, in anybodyâ€™s opinion. 
I have been suicidial all my life, attempted multiple times, been on countless medications and inpatient stays, and nothing has ever seemed to help me. 
I donâ€™t have anything wrong with me or have had anything traumatic happen to me, but I still feel this way. Iâ€™ve tried every single possible thing and nothing seems to ease my desire to end my life. I donâ€™t want to hurt anybody around me, but every help line or therapist/psychiatrist has never given me any peace. I know what I want and canâ€™t see any other way, how are so many other people able to be swayed or convinced otherwise? 
I have only stayed alive up to this point because of seeing how my family reacts after a major attempt, but I donâ€™t feel like that will stop me anymore.
This is not a plea for a help, I just donâ€™t understand where else to go when I am at the same time highly motivated and not motivated at all, I am unable to achieve anything, especially not to the degree of others and I have never been without the suicidal ideation. 
Iâ€™m not really sure what else to do but I think I may end this by next weekend.

If this is the wrong place to post this Iâ€™m sorry, feel free to delete.
I am also sorry if this isnâ€™t legible or reads as ranting.
