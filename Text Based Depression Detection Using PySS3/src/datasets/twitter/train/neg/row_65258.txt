.Idk what to say anymore. My lifes been absolutely shit. Never had a dad. my real dad was abusive towards my mother. my stepdad got sent to prison for murder. he came out and found out my mother was cheating on him. ive tried to kill my self 3 times during this lockdown. and once last year. i hate being alone. its like whenever someone has a problem im always there for them but noones there for me. everyday i think about killing my self. i have a bunch of fake friends. a mother whoâ€™s emotionally abusive. no dad around. honestly. i wasnt even supposed to be here. i was supposed to be aborted but for some reason im here lol. its a matter of time before ive had enough.
