I've never done anything goodI'm 19 and I've never positively affected anyone or anything. Every time I start to feel happy, I think about the people I've hurt and realise I've never been able to do anything with some kind of impact on people that wasn't negative. If I'm having a good day, suddenly I'll remember what I've done and I feel sick and ashamed for briefly not wanting to die. I know everyone around me is waiting for me to do it and I know it's the right thing to do, but I feel like I need closure or a chance to do something good, but then I just hate myself for feeling entitled to another chance.
