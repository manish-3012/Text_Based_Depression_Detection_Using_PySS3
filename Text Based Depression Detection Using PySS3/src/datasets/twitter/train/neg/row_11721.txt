Going to kill myself in 6 months if nothing changesMade shitty decisions that may have just permanently affected me for life. Going to do whatever I can to move on, going to do the things that I've always wanted. May sound stupid and childish or cliche but it's simply how I feel. I always felt I'll someday reach my goals for a happy life, but now with some of the shitty decisions I've made, I'm going to start now. 

If I feel like it wasn't worth it, it's time to end it.
