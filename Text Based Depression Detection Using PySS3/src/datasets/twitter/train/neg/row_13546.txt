Anyone here had a girl pretend to like/flirt with them as a dare?(Idk whether this is the right sub for this)

If you havent let me tell you...its not a nice feeling.
Its not a nice feeling knowing you're so hideous that a girl literally has to be dared to flirt with you.

If anyone does ever like me for real in the future I'll probably dismiss them and cut them off because im so used to that shit...im just tired.
