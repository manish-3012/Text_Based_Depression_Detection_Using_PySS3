What I'm doing to not commit suicideA few weeks ago, I woke just past midnight and considered killing myself.  I had a rational walk through of why I should do it.  This was not some rash, leave-taking moment, but something coldly considered.

My thinking:

1) We are just meat puppets and there is no meaning to our existence.  I look around and I see people engaged in trivial activities, meaningless in all senses of the word.  Am I just like them?

2) We humans are consuming the planet.  We will continue to do so until a superbug is launched that will kill most humans.  It might also kill off most of our closest genetic neighbors.  Or perhaps just the pigs.

3) When we die, there is just nothingness.  So why not get it over with?

4) I have experienced all I need to experience.  There is no sensation so novel that I would stay alive for it.  No food, no book, movie, song, poem, no nothing.

But my son was sleeping in the next bedroom and if I killed myself, I would need to do it in such a way as to not impact him.  My father checked out of my life (he just ignored me for all of my life; I never had a conversation with him) and if I killed myself, I would just be doing to my son what my father had done to me.

That stopped me.  I could not do that.

I had beers with a friend after that and I mentioned some of the things that I listed above and he said there was one thing that I had not ever seen: my grandchildren.  I said that I doubted that my daughter would have kids and my son might, but by the time he gets around to it, I'll probably be dead anyway.

But then I had a thought.

The one thing that I have never done is learn to play a musical instrument.  That is one experience that has eluded me.  I want to learn to play guitar well enough that I can accompany myself.  Maybe just a few chords and then sing some songs I really like.

So that is the thread that is holding me up.
