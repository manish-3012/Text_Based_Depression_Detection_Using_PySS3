Having a Tough TimeHey Sorry if im writing this wrong or something i just will take any help i can get right now really

I'm having an extremely Difficult time right now. I suffer from extreme social anxiety im 16 and its so bad i cant walk into my backyard or even think about it without massive panic attacks Im always concerned about how i look and if i look dumb i see other people my age able to go outside without fear and even go into stores and i want to so bad but every time i try I just cant do it.The only friends i have are 2 online friends who live on the other side of the world, i ask my Family for help but my dad works 24/7 and my Mom and i Hate one another, i try asking them to Help me but they don't have the time. I sit in a room 24/7 now and the Only exorcise i get is lifting weights i had to because i get so much built up energy but am afraid to even step out of my room Because of family issues, I don't really know where else to go to ask for help so hopefully this might do something, I do feel suicidal sometimes but cant do much about it. Any suggestions help im sorry if im doing something wrong in posting this.
