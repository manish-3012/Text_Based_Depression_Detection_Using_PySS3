I should be happy and it's hardI just got married. We are looking for a house and the guy we talked to about a pre-qualified loan says we should try for a higher amount.  I'm in a position at work that beats out where I thought I would be in life. I also thought I would kill myself by now and I'm not fully convinced any of this is actually happening.  

The most annoying part of it is that I'm over focusing on an event where it's like my excuse.  This happened so I must be dead.  I'm this happy so I must be dead.  This is my dream apartment.  My husband hasn't left me yet.  

Too be fair though we did recently talk and he's clearly worried that I will never be really happy and he can't live like that but part of me feels like it's my mind having a conversation to level it self out.  

I have people who I know would listen. But as the person who is always the person I don't want to.  I'm always the person to be on the phone until late at night.  I always make the last minute drive to take their animal to the vet.  I can help you with your burden.  I can take the extra weight.  I don't want to be the weight.  Even writing this I don't feel I deserve to write in this channel.
