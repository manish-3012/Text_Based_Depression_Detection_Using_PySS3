Life is painI don't think i can go on any longer. There is just too much pain. It started a few months ago when i suddenly started to feel depressed. A few weeks after the depression kicked in, the girl that i really (still) love dumped me and now she is even ignoring me :(. On top of that i started to develop a form of OCD called pure O, so i am having intrusive thoughts which i can't controll. I haven't done anything productive for the last 3 weeks, i skipped my classes (which nobody noticed because i don't have any friends at uni), just sitting at home crying and playing video games so the time passes faster. Every day that i wake up i can feel these thougts coming back torturing me. I don't even know why to go on anymore. I don't see a reason to endure all of this pain. The thougt of suicide doesn't even shock me anymore, it seems fairly logical to me. I told myself to keep fighting to the end ofvthe year and ending it after that if I'm not getting better. In the past i didn't really understand people that kill themselves, now by being mentally ill myself i understand. To all of you who are fighting their own mind and still manage to live, you have my big respect.
