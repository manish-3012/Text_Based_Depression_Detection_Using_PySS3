I haven't felt this way in a long timeWell, would you look at that? It's year 13 all over again. I've already been in a suicidal slump before, when I was 13. Now it's happening again. I know that I'm going to fail 9th grade. I know I'll have to abandon all my friends and be embarrassed when I'll be forced to walk into Algebra I again but surrounded by those younger than me. What I'm learning is pointless anyway, I suppose. Either way, there aren't any perks of graduating. Being an adult will be even more painful than what I'm experiencing now. Getting in the work force, supporting myself, keeping a stable income...it doesn't sound worth it to me. So what's the point of suffering here in high school if the life I'm living will get worse afterwards? It's going to get worse no matter what. It'll be a struggle no matter what. And for that reason, I want all if this, everything I'm going through and everything that ever will be to be over and done with. I know that I've attempted suicide before and I pussed out each time, but if I can muster up the courage, maybe I can do it. But do I even have any power left to do that?
