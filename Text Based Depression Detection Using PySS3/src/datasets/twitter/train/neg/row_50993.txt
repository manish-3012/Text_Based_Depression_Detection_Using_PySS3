I donâ€™t think I can do this anymore.I reached out to just ONE person to talk about how suicidal Iâ€™ve been feeling. A person who is supposed to be my best friend. The only person I felt safe talking to about the vulnerable state Iâ€™m in. Iâ€™ve never bothered them with this before, but I know that they know what itâ€™s like to feel this way, so I thought that theyâ€™d be there for me (like I have been for them). I just wanted some hope, some encouragement, a few kind words to get me through the night. But as soon as I said that I was contemplating suicide, all they did was ask if Iâ€™d been drinking, and then they stopped responding altogether. And that sure as hell doesnâ€™t make me want to stay alive any more than I did to begin with.
