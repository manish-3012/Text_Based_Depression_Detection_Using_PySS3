my girlfriend is suicidalshe posted "i'll see you fuckers in hell" to her fb nearly an hour ago. i panicked. she's just reblogged something to her vent (read: depression black and white) tumblr. i don't know whether shes still going to go through with it or not. she also lives 6000 miles away from me in mexico; assuming shes decided not to kill herself, should i still try and contact the police through my countries embassy? if they were to burst in and she decided to go to bed, would i make her situation worse? i should mention her parents arent winning any awards and she definitely doesnt want them finding out. thank you
