I genuinely canâ€™t handle life anymoreI was so close to my third, serious and successful attempt. I was walking to the store to get the materials that nearly killed me before but my mom caught me while I was on my way there and dragged me home. 

She is just prolonging the suffering, fear, hopelessness, and not being able to deal with every minute of being alive. 

I donâ€™t remember what joy or happiness feels like. I donâ€™t remember what laughing feels like.  I donâ€™t even remember what contentness feels like. 

I want something to look forward to but there is absolutely nothing. Not even video games. Just let me be unconscious. Let me die.
