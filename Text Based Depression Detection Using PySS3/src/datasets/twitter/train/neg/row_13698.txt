How are you feeling today?I know I'm just a person on the internet, I may as well be nobody to you. But I figure it never hurts to ask, so if you would ever like to talk about your feelings or what you're going through, please feel free to message me at any time. Or just post in here. I don't know you, but I truly do care about you. EDIT: And I vow that I will leave no message unanswered. I know that there are many of you whose cries go unheard. I want you to know that even if I can't help or offer any good advice, I will hear it all and respond however with whatever means I can offer.
