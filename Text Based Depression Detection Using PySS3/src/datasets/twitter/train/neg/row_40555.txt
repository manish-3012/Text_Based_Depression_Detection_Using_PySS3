Iâ€™m so sick of living.Male. Everyday feels like a painful existence Iâ€™m starting to believe that nothing matters. The worst part is Iâ€™m so young and donâ€™t know if I belive in god anymore. And if it is I donâ€™t want to go to hell. I donâ€™t want to die. But I do. I hate living. It feels like the same thing everyday. I only care about my brother grandfather and one of my friends at this point. I hate living. I want to die. I use to cut my wrist when I was 11 I honestly feel like I wish the end was coming. I hate that Iâ€™m too scared to die. I want to just finish it but the pain scares me. I want to tell me friend but I canâ€™t. I hate this. I donâ€™t want to live.
