I really just want to dieI really don't know why I haven't been able to make myself just do it and end my life. Life is just suffering, and I'm so tired of it. I have no hope for the future, I want to be dead. I don't care about anyone in my life or my future, I hate myself so much its unbearable. I feel completely alone and worthless and I don't know what to do
