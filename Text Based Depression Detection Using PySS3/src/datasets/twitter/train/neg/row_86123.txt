Why does everyone tell me I have no life when they don't even know me?Twitter is toxic! I'm part of a movement for the chronic pain. Everyone always tells me I have no life when I organize events, posts funny memes, and etc. I'm so done, I will never make a friend, all my friends left me, all my friends replace me, all my friends have boyfriends and they ditch me, and I just don't want to live anymore. What's the point, everyone says it's gets better but it doesn't! I've been having a rough life since I was born, it's never going to get better! I used to say that to people that it'll get better, it doesn't. It does not get better, I'm sorry to burst anyone's bubble but does not get better. I am just so fed up and I just wish I was dead. The world would be better off without me anyways. it just hurts when people say I have no life when they don't even know me. I think I have some sort of a life, but how can you have a life with this f****** pandemic right? I'm just fed up, I logged off all social media besides Reddit but I guess I'm going to go cry myself to sleep because I have nobody and I have no life. F*** everyone that makes me feel like s***, I already feel suicidal every f****** day.
