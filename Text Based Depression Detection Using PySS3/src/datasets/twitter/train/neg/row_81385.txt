My long distance boyfriend is really struggling with depressionIt's making my depression go through the roof. We have been together for around 7 months but have seen each other twice,i have always known about his struggle, attempts etc. Everytime i tell him to try to get help, he just declines it and pushes me away. Someone just please help me before it's too late, i dont wanna lose him.
