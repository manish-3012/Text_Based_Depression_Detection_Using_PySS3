HopelessThat moment when you sit on the toilet just thinking about everything, how could your life be this way, 35k in debt, dead end job with no hope for the future. Never knowing what my passion is, what desire should I follow, who knows. I've come to the realization I'm worth more dead than alive, if I die my wife gets 25k and all my debt except for 9k in her name goes away for good. I'm beginning to feel like that may be the best option. She tells me how much she loves me. It's the only thing that stops me, she tells me nothing would be the same without me so I stay. I feel like I'm one bad day away from ending everything, let's see how many buttons can be pushed at work tomorrow, or how many hopeless feelings come about that drag me further and further into depression. My job will not support anything, I smoke pot to cope with depression, now I'm realizing I need to stop but the anxiety gets too much. I'm rambling. Everything still feels hopeless.
