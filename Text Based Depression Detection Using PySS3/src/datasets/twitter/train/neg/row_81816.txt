Rock bottom, physically and emotionally. I never thought Iâ€™d hate my life and myself this much.Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide occasionally for years, but as a realistic option for a few months now. I hit rock bottom about a week ago, and out of sheer desperation/idiocy, I did something very illegalâ€” victimless, not violent or anything, but bad enough to really fuck up what remains of my life if I were to get caught. I keep dreaming about letting my parents down, them finding out that Iâ€™m a bad person after all, and itâ€™s just too much to bear. I canâ€™t eat or sleep or move forward. Iâ€™m so anxious, drained. Iâ€™m so desperate for something to change. I always self-sabotage, and then internally punish myself for doing so by stressing over it. Even if external consequences donâ€™t work. I canâ€™t bring myself to tell my therapist the details. I just want everyone to think Iâ€™m ok, until Iâ€™m really really not. My friends tell me not to stress out about getting caught since itâ€™s pretty unlikelyâ€” but that doesnâ€™t even matter. That decision is just the final straw. Iâ€™m just not the person I recognize, or want to be, or want to exist, and I donâ€™t think I ever can become that person. Iâ€™ve called the suicide hotline teice in the last monthâ€” first time was helpful, second time not so much. I really donâ€™t see a point to being alive, itâ€™s so useless, itâ€™s so painful. I was thinking maybe this long anxiety attack is a wake up call, to really start accepting help from others, but what if itâ€™s too late? If Iâ€™ve dug myself into a deep hole, whatâ€™s the point of even going on? I donâ€™t know what to do.
