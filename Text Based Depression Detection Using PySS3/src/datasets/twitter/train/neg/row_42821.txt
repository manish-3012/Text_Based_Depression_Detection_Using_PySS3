I started burning my wrist and it kinda feels goodI donâ€™t need to explain how Iâ€™m feeling, you guys know !
i just failed a class, did something horrible and Iâ€™ve been depressed for as long as i can remember. Iâ€™m lonely and have been forced to leave my home for 6 months now (due to war) 
So Iâ€™d heat up a knife with a lighter and put it on my wrist 
I donâ€™t know how i feel about this but now i keep a knife and a lighter under my bed and would do it whenever Iâ€™m too fucked up
Iâ€™m really resisting the urge to actually cut my wrist and get it over with
I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m actually gonna do it tho
Thanks for listening
