You know what pisses me off the most about ending my life?....That I can almost guarantee that the people who made sure I got to this level of depression are going to milk it and make it all about them.

Like, there is no doubt in my mind that they will be the first ones looking for sympathy and attention over losing "such a close friend and colleague" despite being absolutely hellbent on bullying me into nothing for the past year.
