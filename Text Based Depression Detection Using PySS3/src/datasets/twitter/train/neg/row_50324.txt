am i good enough?TL;DR - i hate myself and i will never amount to anything

iâ€™m never gonna get a girl to talk to me because iâ€™m fat and hideous and socially awkward, plus i just hate myself so much that i canâ€™t handle putting myself out there because iâ€™m afraid that nobody can like me. everybody pities me, and nobody really likes me. iâ€™m just pathetic. i have no redeeming qualities, nothing to offer anybody but pain and misery. nobodies gonna care if i post this anyways. iâ€™m completely worthless in the world, if anything i have negative worth. how can i be good enough if all i do is hurt myself?

i canâ€™t even reach out for real help, i have to post on a social media that nobody knows i have to seek out some sort of acceptance and assurance that iâ€™m not awful. guess what, i am. iâ€™m awful in every way. the sad part is that basically nobody knows i feel this way, and iâ€™m too scared to reach out to the people who do because iâ€™m worried iâ€™ll just bother them. 

i hate being alive, i hate being sad, i hate the world, and most of all i hate myself for being like this. i legitimately peaked in 3rd fucking grade. Ever since then, my life has been on a steady decline leading to nothing but a suicidal shell of a person who could have been great.

i will never be happy and i will never be normal. iâ€™m worthless and a waste of a human life. in april of 2020, i will kill myself.
