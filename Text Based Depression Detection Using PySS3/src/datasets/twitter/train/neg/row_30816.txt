what the fucky'all might hate me for saying this but this subreddit needs to be shut down asap. the amount of people i see on here that are advocating for and even encouraging others to commit suicide is horrifying. i thought this would be a supportive place for people to go when they really need help but most of what i've seen so far is a bunch of suicidal people feeding into each other's suicidal tendencies and making it seem more and more okay to follow through with it. that is so insanely dangerous and scary.
