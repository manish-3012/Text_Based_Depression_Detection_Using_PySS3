I finally did itI ordered everything, planned it, and my heart feels relieved knowing that I know for sure I will be at peace. I canâ€™t talk, walk, or do anything anymore on my own due to my chronic illness. I have had a long panic attack for 4 days now. Itâ€™s a full time job, 8am till 6pm everyday with meds. Canâ€™t wait for this to be over, finally.
