Iâ€™m A Terrible PersonIâ€™m a terrible person. I wish that I was never born, and that I didnâ€™t exist. I donâ€™t want to exist. Iâ€™m really paranoid, too. That things Iâ€™ve said in the past will come back to haunt me. That my nudes will come back to haunt me. That Iâ€™m being watched through my phone camera. I just feel so low, And I canâ€™t be helped. Even if I didnâ€™t hate, distrust and avoid doctors. I hate the world, myself and everyone â€“ genuinely. I hate that Iâ€™m autistic. I hate that Iâ€™m gay. I hate the way I look. The way I speak. Iâ€™m so angry, bitter and depressed. I have been for years. Iâ€™m probably traumatised, honestly. 

I hate drinking to feel better, because it makes me binge eat, which makes me gain weight. I hate gaining weight. Also when Iâ€™m hungover, I feel bad again â€“ and so I need to drink again in order to feel better. I speak without thinking. I say awful things. Have said awful things. Iâ€™m very impressionable, easily influenced. Cocky. Arrogant. Bigoted. I hate myself, but I act superior to people a lot of the time. I donâ€™t mean to, but itâ€™s a pattern Iâ€™ve noticed. I think Iâ€™ll end up killing myself one day. Not any time soon, but one day, definitely. 

I just donâ€™t want to exist anymore. I want to have never existed. I am truly a mistake, and I want to disappear without a trace. I have no prospects. I am mentally ill and autistic. My job prospects are poor. My relationship prospects are poor. I am a burden to everyone around me. I am ungrateful. 

I talk about myself and my problems excessively, yet nothing changes. I donâ€™t think things can change for the better. Or maybe I just donâ€™t deserve it. Or maybe itâ€™d be too hard to change, and Iâ€™m just lazy. Maybe itâ€™s all of the above. I hate being criticised. I hate not getting my own way. I hate when people disagree with me. I canâ€™t see anything from anyone elseâ€™s point of view. Iâ€™ll probably never change. I think Iâ€™m genuinely mentally ill, and part of that is I canâ€™t change. 

Maybe I have a personality disorder, or two. I see elements of paranoid, histrionic, borderline and narcissistic in myself. And not just little bits. Significant elements. Some pieces donâ€™t fit, but the other disorders could affect each other in such ways that explain that, if they were co-morbid. I mean, I am extremely paranoid... yet I am naÃ¯ve, vulnerable and overshare personal information. Thatâ€™s probably the autism (not saying autism is a personality disorder, but yes, I do "suffer from" autism â€“ itâ€™s ruined my life, and I would cure myself of it, if I could). That doesnâ€™t mean I CANâ€™T have Paranoid Personality Disorder? I meet most of the other criteria. I think that people with Personality Disorders are incurable. They are broken. (No offence intended.) Even if I donâ€™t have a PD as such, I undeniably have a disordered personality. 

I am the problem. Not everyone else. I am a problem. Thatâ€™s my favourite quote from To The Bone: "Iâ€™m not a person, Iâ€™m a problem." Itâ€™s true. I am a problem. I am THE problem. The way I relate to others, the world. How I view it all, myself? Abnormal. Iâ€™m broken. And I donâ€™t think I can change. If I can, I most likely wonâ€™t. If I can, I know I donâ€™t deserve help. I wish I was aborted, or smothered to death as an infant. 

Iâ€™ve never took an overdose, but I wish I had something I could overdose on. Go to sleep, and not wake up. Be cremated and scattered. Selfish, I know... but I wonâ€™t care, because at least Iâ€™ll be dead. One final act of selfishness to end the existence of a selfish person.
