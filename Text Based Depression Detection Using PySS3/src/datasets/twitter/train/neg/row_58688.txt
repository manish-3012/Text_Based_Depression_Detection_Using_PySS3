December 26th or 27th is the end for me.I just wanted to say good luck to everyone on their struggle with happiness. iâ€™ve sadly given up long ago. failed my first suicide attempt, but this time i have two things to guarantee my death. 
i hate writing about my own shit, so iâ€™m not gonna rant on here. 
but if anyone else will be all alone on christmas day and would like to talk, iâ€™m here :)
just waiting until the days after christmas so i donâ€™t ruin anyoneâ€™s day. iâ€™m hoping the other side is peaceful and utter bliss. if not, then iâ€™ll feel the same amount of pain iâ€™m in now. 

best of luck to you all,

much love x
