does my life fucking suck or am I overreactingor is it just my fault for being a shitty person?

Trying so hard to make friends and I'd always be there for others just for them to laugh at it, step on me, and fuck me over. Am I just a dick? I don't fucking know if it's that or if I've just had the worst luck ever and I've just been done do much injustice

I'm going crazy guys
