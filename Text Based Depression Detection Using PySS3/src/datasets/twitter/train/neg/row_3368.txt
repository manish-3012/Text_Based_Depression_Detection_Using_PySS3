I don't remember a time when I didn't wish to be deadI am 16. I have an undiagnosed chronic intestinal issue (visible damage when I was scoped, unknown cause). I have a tendency towards very bad anxiety and I can't stand being in public when I feel like I'm going to throw up. Because of this, I miss a lot of school. When you miss a lot of school, you're required to get a doctor's note excusing you for every day that you're gone. My family has no money, and the many hospital visits made my relationship with my parents completely despondent. Also, my main doctor decided that my anxiety was the cause of my propensity for ulcers (something that studies do not support) and prescribed me Prozac. I told him that I was opposed to taking something that would alter the way that I think/feel. He decided that he didn't like that, so he described me as a belligerent, faking patient and now, no doctor in my county will see me. 

So now, I can't get a doctor's excuse, so I'm listed as unexcused, so I can't make up missed work, so I'm doing badly in classes, so my parents see me as their failure and don't wish to talk to me. My friends guilt me for being gone so often and started distancing themselves.


On an entirely separate note, my girlfriend of two years told me a few months ago that she hasn't felt that she loved me for the last year or so of saying it.

So here I am, holding onto the one thing that used to make me happy and waiting for the inevitable moment when she scrapes me off and I'm entirely alone. The only reasons that I haven't ended my life are my two brothers. One of them is 20 and the other is 5. I know that, in both of their cases, I don't want to imagine the pain that it would cause for them.

I used to self mutilate, but it didn't work and was too risky. Anymore, I just feel like I'm treading water in the middle of the ocean and I'm so tired that I'm just waiting for it to take me in.
