Rough TimesHi everybody... i dont write/speak very well the english,all i want is some help...

All of this started 3 or 4 years ago, when my parents divorce, i had 15/16 years old

At first I did not hit so hard, but time made the wound open more and more, I repressed it, because they taught me to show feelings is wrong, and now that I want to express them I can not even cry.  

My father left his itaca and I have secretly put it in my mouth more than once but I lack the guts to pull the trigger.  

I have friends who have gone through situations similar to Suicide, and it is I who supports them because I do not like to see them like this, now I am the one who needs that support but I do not feel comfortable talking about it with them, I feel weak long ago in high school I met  a girl who really helped me a lot and had not caught the clues that she liked, that happened 1 year ago and now that I discovered that she started sending less and less messages now I feel really alone, my mother is still bad about the divorce  

Because they were 30 years in the trash, my sister cries every time that topic is touched and I do not want to worry them because I am the man of the house, I write this in the hope that someone will read it before it is too late, and you know  long ago I lost my appetite and taste for doing the things I liked so much, my days are very monotonous always the same, and 

I have no one to talk to about how I feel, that's why I come here, whoever reads this  , thanks for arriving  to here
