Gosh diddly darn I want to die and it came out of nowhere.No joke though. Does anyone get the sudden urge to just wipe themselves off the planet spontaneously? 

I mean Iâ€™ve done nothing productive with my life and Iâ€™m making my loved ones miserable. Life is exhausting and Iâ€™m reckless and stupid with money.

I really wish I could just disappear, Iâ€™m awful at suicide so thereâ€™s no way I could ever succeed in  an attempt and I donâ€™t think traffic is too keen on wiping me out either.
