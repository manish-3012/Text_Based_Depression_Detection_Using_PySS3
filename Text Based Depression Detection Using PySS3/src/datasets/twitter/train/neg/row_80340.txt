this week.I want to end it. I really do. I've been planning this for two years, with two failed attempts and two hospitalizations. My best friend, the only person who understood me, died in a car wreck last year. My only support. I've had diagnosed depression, bipolar, and acute mania my whole life. Yeah, sure, it'll hurt my family's feelings, whatever. My dads abusive, and my mom doesn't give a shit. I'm better off dead anyways. 
So maybe this week will be the week.
