I'll just crash my car tonightAt work right now, it's utter hell, can't focus and the depressive and irrational thoughts just keep coming

Going out with friends tonight, won't drink anything, I'll just drive home afterwards and drive as fast on a lonely road and crash it, hoping I'll die instantly.
