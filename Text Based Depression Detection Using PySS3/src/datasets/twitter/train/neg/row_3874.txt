Visiting friend in hospital who attempted suicide - how can I support?My friend attempted suicide over the weekend, the second time in 18 months (I didn't know her this first time).

She posted a video on social media before it happened in which she thanked some friends for being there for her, naming many names including mine. Another friend saw this and ensured she went to hospital before it was too late but she will be there for a while while she gets better.

I am visiting her tonight and want some advice about what to speak about and anything I can/should bring her. Another friend visited her yesterday and brought her new pyjamas and underwear. They said the doctors wanted to commit her but she refused.

She does not have a stable support family network or home life so her friend are her main source of support.

I want to do my best to help her get better. What can I do.
