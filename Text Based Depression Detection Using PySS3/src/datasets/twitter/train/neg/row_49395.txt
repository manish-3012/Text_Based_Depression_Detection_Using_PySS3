25 with tinnitus, this feels like torture, how can I live with this for the rest of my life?I noticed it suddenly one night, just out of the blue. I don't even really know where it came from. Suddenly my head was filled with all these cacophonous buzzing and hissing noises. I also get this low-pitched eeee in my left ear too and some really low almost rumbling/humming noise that makes my left ear feel blocked.

I can't lie on either ear as it makes the sounds louder. It's been about two months and I still feel terrible at coping with this. People say you get use to it. I still feel so claustrophobic and trapped. When I'm in my room, it feels almost surreal, with all the buzzing and pressure and everything. I just want some peace and quiet. I'm not a big fan of loud places either, only ever attended 1 concert in my whole life.

And at 25? This is something people get in their old age. It feels so unfair. I don't want to bring it up with my parents or brother anymore because they can't do anything to help me and it makes them feel terrible in turn.

I just can't cope with this incessant noise. I'm going crazy. Every night for the rest of my life? I can't do it. I just want to die quietly without my family knowing. I feel like my quality of life has been reduced to like 5% now. I spent the whole day in bed, things I use to enjoy seem sullied now. I'm an avid hiker, i love being out in nature and enjoying the serene calm and silence. This is like a huge blow to me, never being able to enjoy that again. All the money in the world can't cure this. It just feels so hopeless.
