Iâ€™m in dangerI want to overdose. But I donâ€™t want to die forever. Idk my depression is getting better but my suicide and self harm urges are getting stronger. I already overdosed but it wasnâ€™t enough to kill me. I want to become very sick, I want to almost die. I have no idea why I feel like this but itâ€™s getting harder and harder to stop myself. Iâ€™m not safe, but I donâ€™t want to go to the psych ward (Iâ€™ve been before) idk what to do
