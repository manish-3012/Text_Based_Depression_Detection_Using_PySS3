I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m lucky or unlucky that every time I try to commit suicide my plan fucks up somehow. Kind of sad Iâ€™m incompetent enough so that I canâ€™t even kill myself. I couldâ€™ve died a month ago. Instead, I messed up and got sent to ER &amp; a psych ward for two weeks.Now Iâ€™m grinding away at school while staying at a residential program wondering why I am literally living for others because suicide is seen as wrong. :) just praying that I become another victim to a motor vehicle
