friend is suicidalA friend of mine who I've known for years and who's also been depressed for a long time recently told me that she might kill himself durin the coming year. I'm at my wit's end. I asked her and she said she doesn't have an actual plan but she's been thinking of that. The thing I could do is tell her family about it. But they'd probably panic and I'm not sure if it's the right thing to do right now. I am afraid to do it yet I'm also afraid that she might actually do it some day without warning.
