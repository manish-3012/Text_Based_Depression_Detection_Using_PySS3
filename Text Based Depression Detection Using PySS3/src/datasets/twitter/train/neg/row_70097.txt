I don't know if I belong here or notI'm not depressed, exactly.. Well, I mean, I am, and I'm being medicated for it. I'm even looking forward to the holidays with an SO and friends that love me...

But I keep having these detailed daydreams of killing myself. There isn't much emotion attached to it, but I just imagine after my lunch just shooting myself in the head in the bathroom. Any minor upset will trigger these brain-movies, even if I don't really feel upset. 

Thoughts?
