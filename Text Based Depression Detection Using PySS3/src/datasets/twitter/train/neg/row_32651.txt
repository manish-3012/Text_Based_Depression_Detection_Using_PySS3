Depression or clarity? What's real?I have a feeling this sadness won't go away. That I won't get better. Is that the depression affecting my thoughts, or is that a gut feeling? I can't live my entire life like this. I just want to sleep. I think I'm ready.

The only thing holding me back (other than my family) is depression, oddly enough. Are all of my thoughts filtered through this cloudy mental illness, or do some get past and still urge me to end my life? Is the me that I used to be still in there somewhere, making decisions, too?

Medicine doesn't work. Therapy doesn't work. Is this just who I am?
