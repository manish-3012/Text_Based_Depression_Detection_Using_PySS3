UPDATE: I'm okay, guys. And no longer suicidal.About a week ago, I attempted suicide VIA Tylenol PM overdose. After about an hour, I finally snapped back into a non-suicidal mode, and went to the hospital where I got treatment. I did sustain minor liver damage, and had to stay in the hospital for a week, but I'm okay after all. PS: The liver damage should heal itself by the end of the month.
