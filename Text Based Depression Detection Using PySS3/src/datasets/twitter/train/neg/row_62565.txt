I have a pain disorderI suffer from something called trigeminal neuralgia. Itâ€™s extremely rare in people my age (24), and in particular how advanced mine is. It sends random unpredictable electric shocks from my ear to my mouth and jaw. The pain is absolutely unbearable, even with medicine and surgery. Nothing helps it. The worst part though is that itâ€™s random. Iâ€™m living every second anticipating that shock of pain, never knowing when it will happen. 

My only other option is to go on heavy, opioid painkillers but I think is rather just die. My dad had a pain disorder too and was addicted to pain meds (not because he wanted to get high, his pain was so bad he became dependent on them.)

A tiny part of me says to try the painkillers and if it doesnâ€™t work, then do it. But the majority of me says go ahead and just end it. 

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
