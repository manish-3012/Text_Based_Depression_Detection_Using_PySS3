It's okay to have these thoughtsListen.

I live a pretty reasonably happy life, by most definitions.

&amp;#x200B;

But I feel like I should just end this, because I can clearly see there is no proper meaning to things.

&amp;#x200B;

But there are still a few things that stop me from doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

And it sure as hell ain't family, because my family, while nice and loving, are still bullshit, and do not connect with me.

&amp;#x200B;

And it is also not my friends exactly, because while nice and living, they still don't connect with me 100%.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The reason is only me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I feel alone when I post this.

&amp;#x200B;

And maybe I will get banned and/or removed, but to me the strongest thing that keeps me going is myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Because the reality is that NO ONE will get "you" as much as yourself, but that's okay.

&amp;#x200B;

 One time I thought I had a friend that would get "me", but that turned out to be untrue.

&amp;#x200B;

But that is okay. They are still a friend. They just cannot get all of me. Only "I" can get all of me, and "I" am my greatest, closest friend I have. Just like "you" are the greatest, closest friend you have.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't underestimate the value of the self. Of how much YOU get YOU. And no one else may understand that fully.

&amp;#x200B;

But that's okay. Understanding is not necessary for ACCEPTANCE.

&amp;#x200B;

My friends ACCEPT me, regardless of my actions and feelings, or how much they may understand me. And I hope you can find friends who see that too. You will find them, eventually. Look in strange places, if you have to. Don't worry about the judgement of others.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to see that in yourself. I would support you doing just that. You have me as a friend, at least.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, and good luck, my friends.
