I want to end it.I am unemployed and having a hard time to find a job because my birthcertificate is in process and is postponed because of the lockdown. I'm out of money as well, It's been a year since i felt like I want to die but playing video games helped me forget abt it. Now I feel like I don't want to be a burden to someone anymore cause I am being useless and I want to end my life.
The only thing that prevents me from doing this is I want to spend more years with my girlfriend and I really don't want to hurt her feelings.Btw my mom and her mom hates me cause I'm a piece of shit. The only 2 persons who understands me is her and my dad.
