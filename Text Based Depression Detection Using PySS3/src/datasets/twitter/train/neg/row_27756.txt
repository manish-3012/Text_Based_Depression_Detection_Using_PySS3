For the first time I'm 100% rationalSo I've messed up everything in my life and I just looked for a part time job to call my own. I don't want to be rich so I would gladly settle for some more free time at a lower pay.


Thing is I don't have the necessary degree. All part time jobs here are for accountants. I could've gotten that degree but at that time I wasn't aware of it being the only thing I needed to live a life I was capable of enjoying.

I now realize that it's basically over for me. That's why I'm thinking about simply ending it all because I know that what lies ahead is simply not made for me.

BEFORE YOU ACCUSE ME OF MOCKING THOSE WITH SERIOUS INTENTIONS: I've already attempted suicide twice but back then it was completely emotional. I wanted the pain to stop. I was rescued just in time. Twice.

This brings us here. My intentions are just as serious but I don't feel the urge to do it. It's simply something that pops up in my mind. I feel like doing it but... Rationally.

I screwed up big time and it's too late to correct the mistake of the past. This shitty high school IT degree is worthless to me and I'm too old to start university and still be worthy of being hired with tax benefits for my employer (basically: screwed without experience)
