I don't have the will to live anymore I'm nothingI am done with life I try so hard to be positive . I help everyone I can to be happy however I can. But I cannot help myself for some reason. I just think I am worthless no matter how I put it. I'm almost 30 still live in my parents in law apartment cause I'm just stupid. I have a decent job as a plumber and make decent money but every time I go out on my own I just fuck up somehow. Again almost 30 and never once had a real relationship in my Life. I have had plenty of girls friends but it's always the same story we go to sleep together and they see my little 4" useless appendage and that's usually the end of it. I've been told to leave the min I pulled down my pants after being with this girl for 5 months he laughed and said the s ain't going to work and I should go so she can have her friend over to fuck her. I'm not even an ugly guy I try to keep in shape and I can go down better than ever. And that's only one story I could go on for pages about girls leaving me or straight making fun of me cause of something I had no say in. Anyways I just can't live anymore so fucking lonely. I just can't do it and I wanted to put something out there before I off myself cause I've hit my breaking point 5 years ago and been fighting the demons in my Head even longer that tell me to just end the pain and misery. I've withdrawn all the money and investments I have saved and put it in an envelope for my parents who I know I'm a disappointment mistake to them. Anyways I'm not even making sense anymore I wish anyone reading this the best in life as I got about a week I wanted to make it to 2021 and at 1201am on Jan 1st I plan to just do it I acquired the drugs to do so and I'm going to go by pills in a hotel room I booked for nye. I just can't be alone anymore
