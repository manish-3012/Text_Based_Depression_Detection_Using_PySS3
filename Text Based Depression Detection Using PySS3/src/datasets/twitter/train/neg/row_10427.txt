Trying to let goTried shooting myself back in college - couldn't find the key for the trigger lock.

Stabbed myself in the stomach with an 8" knife around graduation time, got surgery and a nice scar.

Poisoned myself in grad school, but I took too much and threw up all night.


I'm so freaking tired. Success isn't happiness. Other people will keep letting you down. My birthday is in 31 days and I don't wanna see it. The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is the added guilt from the people who "need" me and rely on me. I just want to stop caring about letting them down and just die already.

Married, successful, fit, well-liked, respected... and all I want is out.
