The bad days are getting worseThis past week has been horrible and each day just feels worse than the last. I just want to kill myself and get it over with before it gets any worse. I don't own a gun but a rope sounds nice. I want to go to inpatient care but I know that the moment I do that is the moment my family finally has an excuse to abandon me. Then I will be truly alone. My mom doesn't really care about me beyond bragging to her friends when I get good grades. And my brother's an asshole who only pretends to care about me when he needs me to do a favor for him, and my sister just plain hates me. I wish I had a "normal" family that actually gave a shit about one another, then maybe I wouldn't even be in this mess. Or even just one really close friend where we both supported each other, through thick and thin no matter what. But whatever, that's never going to happen. I'm a shitty person who deserves to die anyway so who cares.
