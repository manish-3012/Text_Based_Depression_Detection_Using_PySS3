Itâ€™s quite embarrassing to say this but... I want to die because of a 6 year old.Hahah I know. Pathetic. But ever since she was 4 she absorbed my parentâ€™s love and attention. I thought, â€œsure. Itâ€™s normal. The youngest should be taken care of the most anyways.â€ But for 2 years now my parents would blame me on everything she says. Sheâ€™d slap herself and yell out, â€œOw, [my name] hit me!â€ And Iâ€™d be yelled out. 

Now this specific moment seriously made me consider death, itâ€™s when she said; â€œyouâ€™re just a burden.â€ Now I donâ€™t know if she even knows what burden means but it really stuck to me. If a toddler even tells me I just let the whole family down, then why continue? Everyone at the school never really knew me. Theyâ€™d just talk behind my back. Iâ€™m a nobody there.

My dad even said, â€œstop using violence on children!â€ I never did.

Maybe Iâ€™ll live more if Iâ€™m so scared of death, but right now, I feel ready. Maybe Iâ€™ll die soon. Good bye.
