I thought that finally I had found someone that was interested in me. I was wrong.apparently I am so fucked up I can't even realize multiple basic hints that she was not interested in me. even after she flat out blocked me I had to spend all of December desperately wondering what the fuck I should do. not that it mattered much. I was going to spend all of Christmas alone anyway. and all of new years eve.

I have spent so many years trying to improve myself. thinking that maybe I could change things in the future. well that day is here now and I am still just as fucked up inside of me. even tough I have become good pretending that Im not. 

my life is here now. and it involves me spending most of the day alone, then stopping myself from crying so that I can get some sleep. what the fuck is the point
