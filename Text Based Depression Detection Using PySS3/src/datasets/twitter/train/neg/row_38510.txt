Keep getting rejected by therapistsTold me my situation is too serious. What the fuck is a thirty person practice good for if nobody can deal with serious mental health issues. All they are doing is either pushing me away from seeking help which has already been a difficult mental hurdle or making me lie in the future. But Iâ€™m sure the head bitch in charge who made the call is rolling in cash from her Park Ave practice and doesnâ€™t give a shit. Canâ€™t fucking take this anymore
