I don't deserve to liveHonestly I deserve to be depressed. I deserve nothing more than a slow and painful death. All I've done in life is harm others and ruin my friend's lives by complaining about my dumb problems and getting wrapped up in my own toxic personality.  I've only created suffering, and never helped anyone. Half the people I know would love to see me dead at this point, and I can't blame them.

And I've read so many of the posts of people on here who talk about the various terrible things that have happened to them in life like breakups, abuse, and death. And here I am just being a toxic loser sitting in my room at midnight complaining about my cushy middle class teenager life. All of my issues literally stem from me being an asshole, and not any external suffering caused in my life.

I deserve no pity, no sympathy, and no life.
