Attempt #1 last SundayI lost everyone that mattered to me. My friends. The girl. All of them hate me. I took my belt and strapped it around my bed frame and laid in bed and leaned forward. I felt my lungs start to convulse and I blacked out. When I came to I had a bruise on the very front of my neck but I was still alive. This week has been just as bad as I have to watch the girl I love fall into the arms of someone else. It's my fault. I'm acting crazy now,  my emotions are flaring up and I'm not acting as I normally would. I don't think she understands. What I wouldn't do to change the past. Guess that's behind me now so I'll try again with something else
