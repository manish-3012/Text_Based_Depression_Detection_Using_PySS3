Even good days can be bad daysI'm 28 and two weeks ago I cut myself for the first time in roughly 9 years. I've alienated myself from all my "friends" years ago to the point where I'm close with no one. I have a few casual acquaintances and might see one of them every month or two.

I still have good days. Granted for the past 4 months they've been few and far between. The moments where I've found myself truly happy are sparse. Most of the ones I do have could indeed be alcohol induced.

My brother is pissed at me because I don't care about seeing his kids. I keep turning my family down to the point that they've stopped trying.

But there are still good days, and I'm still here.
