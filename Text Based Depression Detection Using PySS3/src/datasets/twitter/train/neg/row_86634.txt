I need supportI've been depressed for a while and my girlfriend, the most important person in my world, are on the brink of breaking up and honestly might as well be.

When I get bad all I do is bruise myself or sometimes cut myself in a way that look like a rash. I really don't like talking to people about my depression because I hate bothering people and have them worry about me, especially my parents who have done so much for me in their life and I don't them to have another suicide scare.

Can someone please just talk to me and help me in this moment- I so badly want to commit suicide and I know I shouldn't but I don't know what else to do to end my pain. Please just help me I need someone to be there for me now
