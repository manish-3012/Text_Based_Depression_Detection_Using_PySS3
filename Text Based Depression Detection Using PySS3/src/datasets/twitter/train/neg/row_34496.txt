I think Im actually gonna do it18m-My life has been a failed attempt to make things better. I really want to end it. People always say it gets better but that's all a fucking lie. The only thing I'd feel bad about is my immediate family my mom and little brother mainly. I just don't see me winning in life I'm absolutely numb now I'm scared for the future I don't see it being too good. I'm an ex coke and daily Kush user and I'm a call away from drowning myself in my sorrow. I've posted here a few times but I can't even Get people here to care. I constantly fantasize about how I'm going to off myself and i think I found the way, I'll spare the details but I just can't do this anymore. My past is haunting me I've done some shitty stuff and I feel like my karma Is coming now. Been depressed since 14 and suicidal since 16. Why suffer when you know your life isn't going to be good. I'm constantly drowning in my thoughts, nothing helps medication, therapy, extra love. Nothing. Ive already attempted suicide once a couple years and failed miserablely I was too scared but now I feel like death and I have been flirting alot and these voices are tempting me. I have no friends, nobody only family and even then it's not enough. I'm weak and I'm done trying. I don't think I'll make it to 2019. Feels like I'm going crazy.
