Iâ€™m exhausted.Iâ€™m an American in my 30s and watching my country spiral downward over the past several years has existentially exhausted me. Our COVID response has been the icing on the cake, so to speak. 

I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore. Iâ€™m afraid of the election, Iâ€™m afraid of the Supreme Court, Iâ€™m tired of being paralyzed with fear and rage. It is a constant thing now. I donâ€™t have a plan (yet) but I regularly fantasize about dying suddenly in an accident or in my sleep just so I donâ€™t have to wake up in this country anymore.
