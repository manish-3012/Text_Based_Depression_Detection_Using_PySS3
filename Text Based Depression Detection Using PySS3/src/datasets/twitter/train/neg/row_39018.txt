I keep on livingI am someone I cannot recognize anymore. I don't try to think about it. When the voices in my head get stronger, I down two tablets and go to sleep. I tried to kill myself once, but realised I don't have the courage to do it. My survival instinct is still strong somehow. I have stopped fighting and have now surrendered completely to anything that might befall me. Presently, my sister is battling cancer, so I try to be cheerful and normal. I don't want to be an asshole. My uni exams begin from 13th and I haven't studied shit. But I'll give them though, because backing out will only make my family sad. They care about me very much. I don't why I keep on living, despite the fact that I hate the idea of hope itself. I sometimes think if I could find love my life will become normal. But then I realise love isn't the answer for me because I'll self sabotage myself. But still this love thing remains on my mind. So anybody reading this, I'm not killing myself in near future, but can do so. I had to write it here because I have to do something. Can't sleep for more than 16 hours though.
