i never finished my masters thesis but walked the stage last year. Too depressed to finish it and I feel like a fraud. nobody knowsold wounds resurfaced last year. my mom and stepdad divorced leaving our home in shambles. i was laid off and my sexual abuster still interacts with some of my family members despite knowledge of his abuse towards me

just a lot of baggage and depression that is killing me. i never presented my thesis to my committee and i feel like a fraud. i just want the strength to finish so i can make my parents proud but tonight is a rough night for me
