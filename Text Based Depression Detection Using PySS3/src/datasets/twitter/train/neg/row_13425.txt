How to reach out?I feel like I should at least try to reach out for help. But I don't want to seem like I am doing it for attention or sympathy... maybe I am? I don't have many close friends, or really many friends at all. I am a introvert and a social retard. I just don't want to burden the few friends I have with it or have them always think I am "that person" who is trying to get sympathy or can't let me near sharp objects. Do I just say "have you seen Sausage Party? Was it any good? By the way I want to kill myself... Are you going to finish those fries?"

I could try a suicide hotline but then I know what trite shit they will say, try to convince me not to. "Think of your... -turns page- 'Insert Important Person Here' oh wait.. was I supposed to read that?" They have no idea who I am and why I am considering it, and frankly I doubt they would understand.


I have been making videos to important people in my life, hoping to explain why and say goodbye. The hardest was my mom and (former) step son. Give them at least something to remember me by. Figure it's the least I could do, right?
