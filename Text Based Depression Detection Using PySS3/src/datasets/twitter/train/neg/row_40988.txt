I'm just uselessFirst, please forgive my formatting I'm on mobile. Little background about me; I'm bipolar, I self injure, I have terrible self esteem, I have abandonment issues, and I'm lost. I am married to a man I know loves me, but he doesn't understand my depression, mood swings, and fits of anger. I try to explain, but he doesn't listen.. He's amazing to me. I recently lost my job and I cannot find one anywhere. I'm putting in applications everyday, but no one calls. I'm just to the point I feel like I'm more of a burden than a suitable wife. I'm useless. I think about suicide constantly. I put on a happy face, but I am getting to where I cannot fake it. I've told my husband he can leave me, or see someone else and come home to me because I know I am not good enough. He would never do those things, but I don't want him to feel like he's stuck with me and this outrageous mental defect.
