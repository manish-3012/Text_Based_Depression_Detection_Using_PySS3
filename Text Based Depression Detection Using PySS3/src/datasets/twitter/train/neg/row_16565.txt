My friends are sick of hearing how depressed I amI'll keep this short. My fiance got pregnant and broke up with me. I'm constantly thinking about her and am having very negative thoughts. My friends are sick of hearing how bummed out I am and I just need someone to listen. Sorry if I'm bothering anyone here.
