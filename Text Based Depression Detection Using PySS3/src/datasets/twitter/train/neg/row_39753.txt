I'm worth nothingMy whole life I've been told by family, friends, dates, that I'd never be anything more than a living sex doll. I'm tired of seeing my mother blame herself and become suicidal because of my decisions. All I can do right is get fucked. I'm 15 and have been raped over twenty times. I know I'll never be loved because there is nothing to love about me besides my body. I'm tired of this..I just want to end it.
