Help! What should I do?My friend has deleted his facebook, won't answer his phone, and has given away some personal belongings with a note that he won't be going to work after a break up. He has a history of depression and suicidal ideation. We also cannot get a hold of his family. I am really worried and have a bad feeling that he is going to try and kill himself. Should I call the police? What can I do?
