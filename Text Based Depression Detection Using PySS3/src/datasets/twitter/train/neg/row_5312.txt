I don't knowI understand the pain of suicide, and I've always thought of suicide as the selfish way out. I feel desperate for freedom and happiness, but I'm not strong enough to make it happen. I'm worn out and stressed. I get so stressed that I have flu like symptoms for days on end. This is probably a cry for attention too, and I hate myself for it
