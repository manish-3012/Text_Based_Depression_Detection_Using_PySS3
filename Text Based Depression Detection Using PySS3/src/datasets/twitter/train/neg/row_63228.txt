**UPDATE** "I'm a cop. I shouldn't want to end it."So I went to the doctor this week after making my last post.

Doc was concerned because one of my complaints was severe headaches, though I have never regularly had them before. She ordered bloodwork and a CT scan. Scan came back okay but it turns out for some reason I had a very low level of potassium. Turns out 3.5 is considered low and I had a level hovering about 2.9. Doc said this could lead to depression and affect my strength.

I'm on some medicine for now, and I feel a lot better about life.

Thank you all. I know better now than to act macho when my body is trying to tell me something.
