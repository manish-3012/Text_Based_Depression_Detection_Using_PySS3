Went from being hopeful about recovering from apathy to depressed and self-harmingI guess the title really says it all. I'm feeling suicidal and began self-harming again after not doing so for over a year. I know what kick-started this and I can't change that thing, I just want to know how to cope with what's going on right now. Does anyone have any words of wisdom to set my mind straight so I can kick the self-harming habit, get suicide off of my mind, and start feeling hopeful again?
