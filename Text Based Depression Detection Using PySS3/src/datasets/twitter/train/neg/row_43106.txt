Im a bit drunk so excuse meI dunno im just sick of letting people down all the time ... especially when i cant even take care myself .. half the time nothing works out all really especially while im getting help  (Professional help) i just kinda feel theres no choice for me but too.. fair enough i could prob go to sleep and wake up in the morn feeling abit okay... but i honestly feel like delaying the editable and i should go now
