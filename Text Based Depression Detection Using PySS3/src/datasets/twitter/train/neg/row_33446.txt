What is the best way to ask for help?I've never been one to ask for help. No one would expect it from me. No one knows I'm suicidal. Hell, no one knows I'm depressed. I don't know the best way to go about telling my parents to get help maybe before I end up shooting myself with my gun. Ever since the one person I ever felt cared by truely left, I haven't been the same. I can't go on like this. With nothing and no one. I feel nothing anymore. How can I fix this.
