I feel lost.My girlfriend just recently broke up with me. This girl was my entire world, she meant everything to me and she gave me a reason to want to live. She left me unexpectedly without telling me what I was doing wrong. I feel awful, I feel like I will be alone for the rest of my life. I've been thinking of suicide regularly over the course of the past few days. I don't know what to do.
