My parents make me suicidalWhenever I have an opinion my parents shut it down. They don't let me have a voice. When I speak they interrupt me and when I interrupt them they beat me up. Throughout the years I lost who I am, I'm numb to who I am. I don't know who I am, all I know is the pain my parents caused me. I never wanted to be a Computer Scientists, but I was too scared to tell them that now and now it's too late to change my mind. I read about a Google employee who hung himself and everyone was wondering why because he was "very happy and had a good job," but that's me. I am always making jokes at school, people consider me to be the class clown. But I only do that to mask the pain within. Same was with him. Just because I smile doesn't mean I'm happy. Just because I say I want to do it doesn't mean I do. I feel like I no longer exist, like I am nobody. The only reason why I don't end it all right now is that I want to prove them wrong. But I don't know how, and every day I feel like its time to kill myself. I have reached out to some adults but they wouldn't listen to me and gave me the cliche "don't be sad lol." IDK what the fuck I am supposed to do. I don't have a phone to text the suicide hotline, and even if I did I don't feel comfortable talking to an adult. I want to talk to someone who has been through what I have. But IDK anyone who has.
