What does seeing a doctor about depression actually do for you?I'm not really at the suicidal level yet, and if I ever were I have a plan in place that would take years to finish anyhow. I'm not sure if this is the right place for this then, but I've been wondering about what seeing a doctor for depression, and getting a diagnosis, will actually do for you.

I've never talked to my doctor about mental issues, but from my experiences and looking at the symptoms I'm fairly certain I would be classified as having some form of chronic depression (dysthymia) and/or cyclothymia, possibly venturing into a major depression at times. It's been this way for years, and at times I wonder about asking a doctor about it, but I always think back and figure "Well what good is that going to do?" If I was offered a card/referral to some counselor, I don't think I'd be very interested in going. I don't have the time nor the money to dedicate to something like that, and even if I did I think I would be so against the idea of "talking it out" to someone about problems that it wouldn't be very effective.

I know it's a mental issue, so it's not like there is some magic pill or surgery that takes care of it. I just feel like I'd start a process of being thrown to an endless cycle of therapy and counseling. So what purpose would there be to seeing a doctor, or would there not be any?
