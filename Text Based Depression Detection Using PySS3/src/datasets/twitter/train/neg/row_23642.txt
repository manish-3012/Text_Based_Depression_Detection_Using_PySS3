â€œA permanent solution to a temporary problemâ€Ever hear that phrase? Those stupid, pointless, falsely manufactured words. My counselor told me those words today. I almost told her straight to her face, â€œno shit Sherlockâ€. You donâ€™t fucking find temporary solutions to fucking problems, and also, what in the holy fuck is a temporary problem? All fucking problems are temporary. What the fuck are people thinking when they hear that fucking phrase? Probably, â€œoh yeahhhhh. Makes sense you shouldnâ€™t kill yourself you can get betterâ€ yeah well this fucking â€œgetting betterâ€ is actually a temporary solution to a problem. Taking ones own life is a permanent solution to a regular problem. ALL FUCKING PROBLEMS ARE TEMPORARY. If it was not able to be fixed then it is not a problem. Right now all the drugs Iâ€™m doing and all the time Iâ€™m fucking around with is just temporary. Soon the permanent solution will come. Soon it will be time. And you know what? Who the fuck agreed that a permanent solution is a bad fucking thing? Who on earth decided that? What the fuck. Itâ€™s a good thing and it is acceptable to take your own life. Itâ€™s an okay thing to do. Because finding a permanent solution is what YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO when you face a problem. And all problems are temporary. Donâ€™t believe me? Okay then, Whatâ€™s the human lifespan? Exactly everything, not just problems, are temporary. So it shouldnâ€™t matter what kind of problem you have, why wait? Why keep fucking around with temporary solutions? Why not have one final, permanent, solution?
