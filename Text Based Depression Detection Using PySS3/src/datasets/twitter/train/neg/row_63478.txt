I keep praying for deathI keep praying for death every night and I wake up and curse every morning. I always think that I would rather die than live and I have for as long as I can remember. The last few days I've been feeling it much more severely. I tried to kill myself 2 nights ago by overdosing on pills but passed out before I could take enough and woke up screaming at myself for failing. I just finished my nightly workout which used to make me feel better than I normally feel if not normal and all I can think of is how much I don't want to be here I've told my family I tried to commit suicide and no one has said anything to me they just act like I didn't say it. I'm seriously considering doing something illegal so I can go to jail and get away from this I really can't stand it anymore and I'm sure that one of these times I won't fail. One night ill get an idea that will work and I hope its tonight
