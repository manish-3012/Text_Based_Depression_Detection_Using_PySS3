I can't bring myself to see a therapist or counsellorI am currently a 15 (almost) year old male.

I've been scared or sad by many things recently, my mum has psychologically 'abused' me for over 3 years, I have a feeling of sadness whenever I see my crush, I feel like none of my friends actually care about me and I been thinking about cutting for some time now. I haven't done it before but it feels like an escape. I'm scared.

I want to see someone, anyone who could help me without judging me but im scared somebody will share anything. I'm scared of telling a counsellor and I can't do anything. Please help
