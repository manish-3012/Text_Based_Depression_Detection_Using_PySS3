ThanksHi everyone,

Using throwaway because I don't want some people to know my problem.

Tonight will be two year ago since my last suicide attempt. It's still hard but it's getting better. I just want to thank you to everyone on this subreddit. People who answer and make you feel not alone in everything. So I just wanted to say thank you, everyone for being here. Helping people doing their darkest time.
