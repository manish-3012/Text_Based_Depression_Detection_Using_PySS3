I can't keep fightingSorry for my broken English.


I'm 23 yo. I am the kind of person that doesn't go out much, hasnt many friends. I try to truly be kind to people, since I know how depression, sadness and loneliness can be destructive.
I can't be mean, I don't know how to. I got stepped on because of that. And the friends I have are the type of people who "gently" mock you to be funny. And I can respond to that, cause I don't understand why people are not just simply kind to one another.

I don't have much in my life. I love the studies I do, but I don't have hobbies or stuff to do.
I just don't like to live. I don't get the point of being here. To me, It's like I got put here, without being asked, like "OK now go have a socially acceptable life". I didn't ask to be here. I don't want to.
I'm not interested in life. I'm not interested in people because too many are assholes.

Even though I have some people around (parents), I feel lonely as fuck. I haven't had real friends for a long time now. I don't know if I ever will again.
Even though I try to explain to my mother why and how I feel, she says she understands but I don't think she does. She doesn't show signs of any support. We argue a lot.
When I get angry she mocks me. And it makes me want to hurt myself.
I've sometimes though about letting myself fall under a train (I go to work by train).

I feel like I just try to find little things to give me a semblance of existence and happiness. I try to convince myself I do stuff and like stuff and am happy of it. And that's not it.
Deep down I know I am waiting to have the courage to end it all. 

Thanks for reading
