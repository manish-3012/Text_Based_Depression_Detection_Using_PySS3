Anyone can help?I don't know, i've had this all my life 


But the second I think i hurt someone, even a complete stranger, i just can't handle it anymore after, i become really depressed and annoyed, 

Even if it isn't such a big deal, even if it's something very minor, if i feel like I hurt someone, i get this major feeling of guilt that i can't ignore, this usually wears off in a day or 2 if it's something minor. But the issue is you can't really not maybe hurt someone through words accidentally.
