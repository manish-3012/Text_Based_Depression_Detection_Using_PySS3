My noteMom, dad, Nannie, I'm sorry, but I can't live with the pain anymore. I'm tired of the frustration caused by no one understanding my loneliness or being able to effectively help me. My own efforts were futile as well - job apps not even looked at, likely because I failed my degree. No success on dating sites or in real life - how can you blame [my small town] when plenty of people my age find SOs here somehow? Going back to school will put me at an age older than I'm comfortable succeeding by, especially not having an SO to cheer me on through the process. In fact it never felt like anyone was cheering me on, they were merely holding a trampoline so I wouldn't hit rock bottom. Life doesn't make exceptions, so I'll have to make my own if I want to ever escape this endless torment. I apologise for any grief this may cause but I'm in a better state now, one where I don't have to feel anything. Please understand that I only did this because I believe that my suffering is inescapable, and was never proven wrong. I didn't receive the help I needed to succeed and instead was left to fail on my own. Now I die on my own. My own terms, my own time frame. I don't want to see tomorrow anymore, and I finally won't have to.

I love you, but not as much as I hate life. Goodbye.
