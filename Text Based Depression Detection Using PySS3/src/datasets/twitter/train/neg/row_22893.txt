I posted a photo comments have sent me over an edge I didn't think it reach againI posted a photo of my leg feeling proud of my workout progress. I'll add it in the comments cuz I can't add here. I thought i would be congratulated on progress but I was met with people saying wtf is this ..... and if you look at the pic I will put in the comments it shouldn't make you say wtf. It's just my leg. I'm a 130 lb guy that just leg presses 450 and thought that was a huge step from me being 160 lbs before but apparently I'm disgusting . I've deleted the posts but the pic I posted is in the comments . I'm. Feeling absolutely horrible right now. And like everything I've done has been a waste of time and I could have been gone a year ago and in peace instead of working my ass off
