Iâ€™m finally done living for other peopleIâ€™ve always let people talk me out of it, but I canâ€™t keep doing this to myself. Iâ€™m so sad all of the time and my plans are finally falling into place, as if itâ€™s meant to be this way. The last thing I need to do is come off my bipolar meds to give me the last little push to go through with it and thatâ€™ll be it. My affairs are in order and I have no obligations left.
