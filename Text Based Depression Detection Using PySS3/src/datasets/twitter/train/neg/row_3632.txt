No longer afraid of deathI've become fascinated about dying and have thought of creative ways for suicide.

My only problem is choosing a method, and finding a way to have a certified last will. Notaries won't touch the latter, and don't think anyone in my household will approve of this. As for the former, I can't find the perfect selection.

My question to everyone is - Why isn't assisted suicide an option to Californians?
