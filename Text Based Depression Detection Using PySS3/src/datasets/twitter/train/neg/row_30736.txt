Today might be the dayI have.. at times.. thought of selfharm. I have come close to death, several times. I know deep down that a part of me craved death. The thought of having no more pain, of being gone, of dissipating into nothingness, it's a happy thought. And everytime, I come close to doing something, permanent, each time, I'm closer to actually doing it. This started over 10 years ago. I lie alone, surrounded by the filth and dissapointment of what I have become. Today might be the day, because I cannot even call for help not without.. consequences.. things that would make it even harder, not easier. More than ever in my life, I care that I'm alive. Of what I do, of what happens to me. And yet, the single thought of ending it all, it always appears, some days it's subtle, some days it's all I can think about. It's too much, and too convenient, and it's annoying, and it's painful. Today might be the day because I'm afraid. What if I call a hotline and they come from me? What if they track my number? What if I do it anyways because.. it's no longer that im alone, it's that I don't wanna be myself and anything that resembles myself anymore? I have been fighting, day after day, night after night, to be happy okey with who I am, and who I wanna be. I'm tired, I'm too tired, I'm too tired to keep fighting, too stupid too keep on changing, too scared to look away and accept.  Today might be the day, and I hope people suffer, because then, I could have know, that it was true that someone could have help me. But it wasn't meant to be, because it's not worth it.
