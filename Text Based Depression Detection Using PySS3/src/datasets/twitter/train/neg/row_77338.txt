Iâ€™m scared that if/when my boyfriend breaks up with me I will kill myselfSo, me an my boyfriend have been together for almost four months. He has been amazing and has helped me through a lot. He is the only reason Iâ€™m still here. But now he is very unsure about everything and Iâ€™m scared he has feelings for a girl he met a week ago. He is talking to her about OUR problems and she has no idea who I even am. We have been talkin about breaking up but he has said that he tries to fix everything. We still have to meet and talk again but I feel like he is avoiding me. I hate myself and am just wondering what I did wrong. Iâ€™m scared to be alone because I have severe anxiety attacks all the time now. If he breaks up with me, I donâ€™t have anyone and will very likely kill myself. I am just so trapped and broken and am scared that this is it with him. He means the world to me and he has helped me with so many problems but now I feel like Iâ€™m not his first priority and like he doesnâ€™t care anymore.
Sorry for the rant
