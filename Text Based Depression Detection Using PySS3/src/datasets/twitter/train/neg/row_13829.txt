Today is a dark dayLately it hasnâ€™t been so bad. But today, I donâ€™t feel okay. The voice of self doubt it reminding me that I have no friends, probably because Iâ€™m a piece of shit. Although I do have a â€œboyfriendâ€! But Iâ€™m actually sure he doesnâ€™t even like me lol. He knows I have thoughts of just not wanting to live anymore, not wanting to exist. But no one really takes you serious unless you actually do it, right? I donâ€™t speak about my depression to anyone, no one really understands what itâ€™s like to truly hate yourself. Today my anxiety is keeping me hostage inside of my head. Iâ€™m reminded that I graduate in a month... I feel so sorry for my parents. Their hard work with raising me was for nothing. My moms sacrifices to put me through college was for nothing. Because Iâ€™m going to amount to nothing. For as long as I could remember Iâ€™ve suffered with depression, I donâ€™t know what if feels like to truly be happy, to truly love life. I never planned my life farther than college, because I never planned on living that long. Iâ€™m one month away and everyone has job offers, internships, interviews... but me? Why would I put in that effort when I wonâ€™t be alive anyway? Lol. My thoughts are very scattered today. Today is a shit day.
