Long term relationship ended a few months ago, I see no light at the end of the tunnel.Hi,

My partner of just over six years left me three months ago. We have been together since I was 19, I am now (F)26. I feel hopeless. I was so in love with this person and everything, everything I had shared with him. Music, culture, games, taste, everything. Whenever people tell me I just have to move on I feel like I cannot explain this - I will not be able to find this again. I just can't. They left as they 'have to be on their own'. I am finding this too much to live with.

I feel like all life from now on is going to be a direct comparison with that which came before. I feel like it will never match up. To have to compromise and live a 'lesser' life is too much for me to take. I do not want to sound ungrateful but I cannot do that - I cannot live with that. The underlying sadness is too much.

I feel like I just want to go to sleep now. I had a go, I had my life and now it is done. I cannot see a way round this that doesn't involve continued sadness or compromise. Everything which came before is too ingrained - I cannot fathom anything else.

I just want to go back.
