Suicide as an informed decisionHello, I am 26 and I think I am considering suicide. Not because my life is terrible but I donâ€™t know what else to look forward to. I spend thousands of pounds on therapy each year, I go weekly and I do my inner work. I think I am spiritually plugged into God and trust that my life experiences are building me up for something. However I donâ€™t live a Christian life or one I think I should be living. I just donâ€™t know what is happening or where my life is going. 

When I think about my childhood, the sexual abuse and exposure, the abuse from my parents and the torn self esteem I battle with everyday and this mask I have to put on everyday for the world so that no one knows I am leaking inside... I get nervous. Iâ€™ve made progress with therapy, dealing with rejection, depression and loneliness but I have this strong desire to run away. Start afresh. However, my exterior may not make that escapism so sweet so I think about suicide. Surely it is not selfish but maybe like my way of saying Iâ€™m done and no longer want to participate in this world. 

Then I think about my day to day life. I trade in 10-12 hours of my life at a job I am not convinced I enjoy but made myself to enjoy... I successfully unpack all of my psychological shortcomings in therapy and then I feel exposed. Exposed because their is no action on when to close that chapter or revelation so I can just function. Sometimes I day dream about suicide. The thought of not being here and experiencing this. It feels peaceful. 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll commit suicide. I am sure of it. However it does look like a very viable option sometimes... I just donâ€™t know what I am living for and I donâ€™t know why if I donâ€™t know what I am living for....why I am living. 

Crazy.

What next?
