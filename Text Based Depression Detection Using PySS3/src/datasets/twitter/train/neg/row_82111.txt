The only thing keeping me going is my grandparentsI (27F) have been struggling throughout my life with not wanting to exist anymore. It started when I was about 8 years old. Around 14 I attempted checking out and have a few times since then. Iâ€™m 27 years old now and despite all of my success in having my own business, being a teacher, how wonderful, special, and empathetic people tell me that I am and I know I am. I just simply donâ€™t want to live. I donâ€™t like the world. Maybe I feel too much. I understand too much and thatâ€™s my burden. I donâ€™t want to keep living, but I love and have been taking care of my grandparents so much that I donâ€™t want them to have to experience the loss of me and no one to be here to help them. I feel like once theyâ€™re gone Iâ€™ll be more okay with crossing over but the selfishness in me cannot wait. I live in agony in my own mind every day. 

TD;LR: extremely suicidal, only hanging on so that my grandparents wonâ€™t mourn me in their last years
