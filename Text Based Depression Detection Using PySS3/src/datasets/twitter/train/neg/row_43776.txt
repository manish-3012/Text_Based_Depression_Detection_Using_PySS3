So nobody does care then?Itâ€™s sad. Itâ€™s fucking disappointing that I thought â€œmaybe, maybe Iâ€™ll get some help somewhereâ€ but nobody cares. Nobody gives a shit and Iâ€™m fucking done with everything. Itâ€™s funny, Iâ€™m calm, I know that thereâ€™s nothing left for me here. I just wish I could hug someone before I go. Iâ€™m writing my letters tonight
