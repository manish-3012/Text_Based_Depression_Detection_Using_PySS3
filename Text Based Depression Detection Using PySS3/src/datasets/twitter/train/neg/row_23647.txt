A constant thoughtI have battled with clinical depression for all my life. Iâ€™m 29. I have had acquaintances my age commit suicide or pass away from accidents. Iâ€™ve noticed that people miss them. But what were the tragedies that got this person to finally go through with it? Are they truly at peace now? 

I have gotten to the point of hospitalization. Sadly I think of that time until now and realize I have done nothing of importance. I didnâ€™t need that time. Who is to say that maybe I can struggle though my mediocre and painful life or maybe I can just be free. 

Stop taking up space. Let my parents stop supporting me in more ways than I can count, let my boyfriend find someone who is stable, let my family and his family and everyone else stop talking about how much I suck or what I â€œshould doâ€. 

Maybe, I am not supposed to be here for a long time.
