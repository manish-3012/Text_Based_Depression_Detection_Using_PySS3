I'm getting help.I used to be fine, it used to just be my dark humour from all the previous attempts. It used to just be a joke. It stopped being that way a month or so ago. I just kept getting worse..and worse.. I just drank. And smoked. Nothing else. While working slowly towards just wanting to quit working. Quit living. And quit loving the things I used to. But at the end of the month I'm finally going to a treatment facility for a month.
