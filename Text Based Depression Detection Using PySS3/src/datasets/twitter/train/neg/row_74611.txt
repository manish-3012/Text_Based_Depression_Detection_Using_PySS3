Happy and scaredJust got back from a week-long stay at Green Oak's inpatient treatment unit. Met some surprisingly cool people, had a lot of support and even a few friends, (though they all have to stay in longer because they're dealing with addiction/dual diagnosis, not just SW) and have my first therapist appointment on the 30th. Got some job applications to fill out and turn in, getting my prescription filled today, and the film I'm working on is back in action, which is really super amazingly awesome. 

So... now what?

I keep thinking of the Emilie Autumn song, "One Foot In Front of the Other", *We waged a war with Hell, and look, we still survive
But just because we live does not mean that weâ€™re alive
Weâ€™ve won the final round, but how to enjoy the win
When weâ€™ve been broken down and weâ€™ll never know what could have been
Heaven help us, where do we begin?*

I don't know what's going to happen next, I've gotten so used to the cycle of depression, GAD, happiness/mania from ADHD, and then back to depression. Treat those, and...what's going to happen? I know it doesn't really make sense, but the whole unknown-of-the-future thing.
