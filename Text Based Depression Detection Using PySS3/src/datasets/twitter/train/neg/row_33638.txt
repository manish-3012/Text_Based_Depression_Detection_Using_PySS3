Lost my last bastion of hope today.Long story short-ish;  

~4 months ago my wife left me. Lost my job of the last 5+ years shortly after, unrelated to the marital shit. After a couple weeks living in my car I moved in with my step dad who's the only father I've ever had (since I was ~12), as my biological one disappeared when I was 3 weeks old. Now live in the middle of nowhere, 30 miles from civilization, with my step dad... and his mom (who doesn't really like me because I'm not blood relation) because he's just fresh from 8 years in prison himself so he lives with her.  
Divorce is slow going. I still get my two little girls on the weekends.   
They're my breath, literally my reason for getting up every day.   

However; after battling Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder for the last ~10 years on and off, today was the very first time where the urge to end it all wasn't stifled by their angelic smiling faces.   

I honestly don't know what hurts more right now...  
The pervasive yearning for death, or the very real possibility that they may not be enough to stop me anymore.   

Despite the many things my estranged wife may be, she's still a good mother.   
Not the one she once was, but still damn good. I can't help but think they'd be better off without me. She could just tell them I didn't make it through a car accident and they're still young enough to where it just might be ok at that.   

I'm worthless. I have nothing, save for them. I can't face them right now without damn near breaking down over how shit everything has become. The only thing I can really claim to have ever been good at - hell, exceeded at - is fatherhood. It's just not enough anymore. There's too many other negatives. I don't know what to do.
