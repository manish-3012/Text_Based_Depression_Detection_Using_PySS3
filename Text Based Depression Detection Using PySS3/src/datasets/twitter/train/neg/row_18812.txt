The future isn't worth living.So, I'll just cut the bullshit out, i'm 17. I've switched schools once due to  bullying, met a new friend and fell in love with him (i'm gay.) Now I've began to realise he isn't gay, and he saved me from not killing myself already once by just being a friend, now I feel like we're not as close anymore, we used to be like brothers. I don't feel like there's anything beside him to live for. 

I've gotten tired of being ignored by friends, or being given the cold shoulder, I honestly can't take this any longer, I've pretty much planned it out already, what kind of a letters I should write, the way i'd do it. Everything. At this point i'm too scared to talk to him since i'm afraid i'll make my situation worse, and if I'll talk to a psychologist. I'm afraid my medical records are going to affect my career as an airline pilot, if I ever managed to pull through or fail with my attempt.
