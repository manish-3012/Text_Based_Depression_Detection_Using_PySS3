i need distraction from these thoughtsit's 1 AM here rn
My mom's asleep, my closest friend too.
I'm crying right now, there's so many things I am overthinking.

I tried to strangle myself just to feel it, idk, I might hang myself if I find a good rope. I already downloaded an image how to tie a rope when hanging. I feel like I'm getting ready for my death. 

Next week, my mom's getting an operation. I'm thinking of doing it that time since my brother and me would be the only ones left at home.
