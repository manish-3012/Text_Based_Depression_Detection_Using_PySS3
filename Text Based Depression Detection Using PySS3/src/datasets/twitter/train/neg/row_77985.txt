Why is suicide viewed as such a negative thing? Who are we to essentially tell someone that living with severe depression is "better" than the alternative that is death?I'm a strong believer that suicide can be justified, and I likely will commit suicide later in life when the goals I've set for myself are complete. I am severely depressed, yet am known by even my closest friends &amp; family to be a very happy and friendly person. I've got my act down to an art, and not a single person I know suspects me of even being slightly depressed.

I have been severely depressed since my childhood, and have seen several psychiatrists &amp; councillors without my parents' knowledge-- all of which did not help. I am growing weary of living constantly depressed, and see no valid reason why suicide cannot be a justifiable option.

In terms of how it will affect my friends and family, I used to believe suicide was inconsiderate. Now I'm realizing that regardless of how inconsiderate it is, living a life of depression is something **I** have to deal with and that I certainly can be justified in ending my life if I feel it's the best choice.

So explain to me why suicide cannot be viewed in a positive light. Right now it seems to me that our current culture/society deems it as a terribly wrong thing, but a look at history reveals several large cultures almost embracing suicide.
