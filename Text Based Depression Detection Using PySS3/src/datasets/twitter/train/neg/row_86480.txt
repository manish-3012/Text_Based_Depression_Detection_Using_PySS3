I'm seriously about to end it.I have no real friends. No one wants me. I just happen to be born and now people have to put up with me. All the people who I considered friends aren't my real friends. They just put up with me in pity that I have literally no one else to talk to. I think my death will be a huge load off everyone's shoulders. No one will have to put up with me and I don't have to be alone all of the time. My entire life was a fucking mistake. This world has no place for me. It never did, and I'm just coming to realize it now.
