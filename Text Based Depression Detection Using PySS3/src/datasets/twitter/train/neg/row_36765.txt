I need help... please.Hi reddit.
This is my first post in this sub. I'm quite new to reddit so please excuse me if I make etiquette mistakes.

I've been severely depressed for the past 3/4 years. I'm not sure I'm ready to go into the details in public. I talked about it with a therapists (CBT) but didn't help much. My friends are too selfish to actually give a damn and they only lean on me when they need something.
What makes me even more depressed is that I don't have any serious reason to be so down. I have two kids, a good job (actually a dream job for million of people), but I don't love my wife anymore and I feel completely empty inside.
I've always been very sensitive and now I feel... Exhausted. Everything throws me over the edge and something that happens yesterday left me in a terrible state. I couldn't get out of bed the all day and only now I've been able to pick up my tablet to write this post.

I crave love. I need love.

I've always been drawn to the star crossed love stories and in fact the one with my wife started that way: impossible, intense and cursed.
We made it worked, got married and then.... It basically finished.

I'm 40 and I feel my life slipping away. I don't see any future and I'm not killing myself only because of my kids.
There is.... Someone.... Another star crossed love story... She makes my hearth beat again... but I can't have her... No matter how much I think about it there is no solution.
I live in London and the tube trains are starting to look very... appealing. They seem to be the easiest solution.
As I said I know it's stupid and most people would kill to be in my shoes.

I need help from you... please.
