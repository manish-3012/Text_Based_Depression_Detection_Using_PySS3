I really want to kill myself but I can'tI've been feeling really emotionally unstable for the past few weeks, I've been binge drinking for one and my ex dumped me. She said she didn't lie to me but I feel like she did still frequently and what she said when she dumped me contradicted stuff she told me numerous times, I really feel like I can't trust myself anymore or anyone else, she ruined what little trust I had left. 

I also feel really isolated from my family due to their own arguments and my religious beliefs not being as strong. I really want to kill myself, I feel out of my own body and I feel like an object when I look in the mirror, like I don't have free will or something to kill myself. I put a knife to my throat and I couldn't do it I feel fucking insane. I don't know what's wrong with me  feel extremely unwell and I can't enjoy anything, it isn't just the breakup its like everything in my life is against me. I thought my life would be better now but Its worse, I can't be honest about how crazy I feel because people don't like that, I don't like myself. I want to die so fucking bad but I don't know if I can do it
