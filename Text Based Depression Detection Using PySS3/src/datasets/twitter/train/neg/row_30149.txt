Afraid to dieI'm afraid to die, but damn, it feels so hopeless. I tried to kill myself in 2017 but survived. I've had my ups and downs since then, and now I'm really down again. 

I've been trying to find something to live for. Both my sisters are pregnant and so is one of my friends and it hurts because I want to have my own family so much. It's the only thing I want, but it makes me sad. I mean what if my kid ends up depressed like me? I'd just be pushing my suffering on them by having them. I'm not the most attractive by far and have my fair share of body image issues. I don't want to put that on them.

I haven't been in the dating game really at all because of past trauma involving my brother and low self esteem/mental health.  I know I'm only 22 and have plenty of time to find someone but again it feels like even if it happens everyone ends up sad anyway. 

Damn I want to go to therapy so bad but covid is stopping me. I'm scared I might actually succeed if I try again. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I just needed to cry and vent lol. Any advice is welcome
