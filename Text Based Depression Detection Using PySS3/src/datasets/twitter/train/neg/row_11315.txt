Isn't it funny?When someone else wants to kill themselves, everyone makes an effort to comfort them by saying generic things like "please don't" and especially "i'm here for you if you need to talk". But when everyone here as an individual wants to do it, its ok for them to do it. Which is it, do you want to kill yourself or do you want to live? My friend who killed himself me that many people would be sad without me if I killed myself. Apparently that didn't apply to him though. Reality is all meaningless garbage with absolutely nothing providing any meaning. 

Relationships are also really stupid. I get uncomfortable like the complete idiot I am whenever I see a happy couple in public. I am reminded of the one miserably failed relationship in the past and how I will never get a girlfriend again thanks to my mediocre self and because of covid. 

After 3 years of "depression", suicide still seems like the best option. Sure everyone would be sad and you could possibly miss out on the "wonders" of life, but you wouldn't know or think about how you did when you're in the empty void of death. It would be like sleep, except you don't have dreams or wake up because you are dead. And we all know that being asleep is way better than being awake. 

I just can't see any better options at this point. I honestly want to drive off a cliff without a seatbelt going at least 100. That should kill me and make my body fly around 50 feet in the air. I find it funny thinking about my useless body just flying in the air like the mindless rag doll it is.
