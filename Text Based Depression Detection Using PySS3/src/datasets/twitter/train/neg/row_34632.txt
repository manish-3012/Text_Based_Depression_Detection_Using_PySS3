Theres nothing for me 2Last night/this morning (4:30 am) i wrote a post and i couldnt think straight so i gave up. I dont feel any better after i slept. Usually, i snap out of it when i wake up but this time i just couldnt. this is the most depressed ive felt in my life, worse than when i went to the hospital in 2014.

There really is nothing left for me. If i tell my dad i failed one of my classes im worried hell stop helping me with my loans and ill have nothing. i cant do anything if i dont finish college. it was only one class though. one of my professors hasnt graded all the shit i turned in late for another class so ill probably fail that one too.

my cat died and before that was the only thing that kept me here but now that shes gone, i dont know what to do. i have like a couple things to keep me here like not disappointing my family and i really like watching this one streamer but oh my god that is nothing compared to how attractive dying is right now. im mostly worried that ill fail or that theres reincarnation and i make all the same mistakes i made this time all over again. im terrified of there being nothing after death but right now nothing is better than this.

thinking about any of this makes my heart want to beat out of my chest, i cant deal with this anymore. i tried to get a therapist but no one ever emailed me back and when i told my roommate about that they yelled at me and said i had to call cuz email isnt shit. imo an email is better than a phone call because you hav a record of it and you can easily forget what happened on a phone call.

the only thing that gives me solace is playing minecraft and ignoring all of my feelings and i cant fucking live like that.

if i dont kill myself i wont even do anything good. i want to be a paraeducator and a freelance artist, ill fucking starve before i can blink. if i take a minimum wage job to supplement that, ill want to kill myself even more.

i wish i could just blink and finally be dead.
