So tired of being alone, and feeling just left out of lifeI am working, it is long hours, and I don't know how to cope with the stress it causes. My mother was abusive, I no longer live with her. My 11 year old brother hates me and treats me like shit. My dad is superficial and always stressed out due to my mothers (his ex) shit she tries to pull (she is narcissistic and overall, she is just mental and delusional). I never really had a mom who cared, and my dad just does because he is supposed to. I am leaving for college this fall, and I am scared of finding friends. I am a bit awkward socially and really have had only one good group of friends. Lastly and the thing that hurts the worst, is I am unable to give up on the concept of love. My girlfriend dumped me and cheated on me after being super needy and in that relationship making her my life, it crushed me. I have tried to get a girlfriend, I fake being happy and uppity. But still no girl is interested. I want to be romantic, caring, and a good boyfriend, but beyond sex, girls just aren't into a guy who wants to just have laid back fun. I really just want someone who I can give my time to and make her feel special. I know I could be great in a relationship, but I know I can/will never get one. I am short, and probably ugly. I am too tired from work and school to work out. But it is hard for me to get over wanting someone to hug me and just tell me it will be all right. Someone to love, and have fun with. A person I can finally trust. How do I get over it? I just feel so alone in my life, and it kills me. I can't take it any more. Luck never goes my way.

Forgive the wall of text. I just feel worthless and alone. The only thing I got going for me is that I try to do well. I am ahead of lazy people, but that in even work has not gotten me anywhere. I don't want to live anymore knowing that I won't find friends, and I will be alone for the rest of my life.
