I think I'm readyI've been so tired for so long, and I think I'm finally ready to put an end to this. I have the means, and the place, and the note. I'm going to pretend everything is fine, no one will suspect it. And then I just won't wake up ever again.

Sorry, I just really needed to get that out.
