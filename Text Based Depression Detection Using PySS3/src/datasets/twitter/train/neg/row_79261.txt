i can't handle the thought of winter and the future *vent*i'm dreading the end of summer. i'd genuinely rather die than have to live through another rainy gray autumn and cold, dead winter. i hate those seasons, so so much. everything is so dull and dark and also during college season so it's extra stressful. summer is so happy and warm and full of nature and life, so i usually "thrive" during that time. it's not even fall yet and i'm already getting suicidal thinking about the future. i hate my career choice (but i have nothing else and already put so much money into it), i hate myself, i see no appeal in the future, i'm just alive for my family and dog. i am honestly decently happy right now just due to the fact that it's summer but once this season's over i'm scared i'm gonna lose myself and fall into the deepest depression of my life
