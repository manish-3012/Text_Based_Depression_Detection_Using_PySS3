Egotistical?About two years ago, I was in a really horrible point in my life. My parents told me that they had given up on me and my future as a person, I was depressed, my grades fell and stayed down, my sister was missing, and I was receiving threats from my crazy ex girlfriend who was trying to falsely accuse me of assaulting her. 
While I was deeply depressed and emotionally drained, I never really saw suicide as a viable option for me. (Also important; I was starting to convert from a Catholic to an agnostic atheist) I thought that, any kind of existence, even if it is rife with anxiety attacks coupled with schizophrenic episodes, was better than no existence at all. 
I don't know how or why I came to that conclusion (I was on a laundry list of meds for my anxiety and heads) but it deterred me enough to begin building a sort of quasi-superiority complex. I began to consider myself more valuable to society than my peers because of my experiences with schizophrenia, and because if that, I got to the point where when I considered suicide, I actually thought that I would be depriving the world of a treasure. I didn't derive any comfort in this, I still trudged through my battles, legal and otherwise, and eventually I came out on the other side more empathetic and even a little confident. The day I graduated was the first time in years I felt good about myself, and truly happy. 
So I don't know. Is a little megalomania good for a person at risk? I'd like to hear your thoughts and opinions.
