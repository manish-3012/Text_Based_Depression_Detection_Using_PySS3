I dont know anymore.I am a second year student in University. I used to think I was going to be successful, get a job in capital markets, be wealthy, be popular, travel the world. Now I'm a mediocre son, on the verge of losing my scholarship, have 0 friends to support me and just rot on the computer watching porn and surfing the web. I am a useless person who had potential. I don't think I want to kill myself, but I wouldn't complain if I died.
