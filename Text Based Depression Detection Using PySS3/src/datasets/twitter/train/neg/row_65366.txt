My Life: A DisasterHi. I'm 38, single female, living with a disability. I have not been able to find work or keep any sort of career going my entire adult life. I was a Christian, out of desperation, but the fact that God does nothing to help helpless people seems to invalidate the entire idea.

Anyways, I'm ready to quit. I've been to more therapists than I can count. Even CBT doesn't work. To top everything off, I was the victim of violent crime recently, and the cops told me I was lying about the whole thing. Even my doctor of 15 years doesn't believe me.

Since the ordeal, my family has deserted me. Apparently the $7500 in debt I've had to contend with over the past 8 weeks since kissing my home has made me completely "unsupportable" - physically or emotionally.

I have tried very hard to be a decent, moral person in this life. But I see no way out, except killing myself. 

Anyways, I just thought I'd vent. I'd say good luck to everyone, but there's no luck to be found.

Enjoy the shits-storm.
