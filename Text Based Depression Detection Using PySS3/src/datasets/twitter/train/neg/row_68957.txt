I'm sick of being lonelyI'm in my early 30s now and never knew any women that were attracted to me. I've gathered that women absolutely hate me.

I am subhuman in their eyes. I am worthless scum that's worse than every murderer, child molester or rapist that's found someone to love them.

And now it's too late. No woman would ever want a man my age with so little experience. The lack of experience and affection has made me so fucked up I'll never be able to have a relationship.

I just want to die and I know women want me dead too. I'm everything they hate. I never see any women speak well of any traits I have and I constantly see them insulting people with traits that I do have (ugly, bald, small dick etc). The world will be a better place for everyone if I kill myself. I have zero hope things can ever get better, I give up.
