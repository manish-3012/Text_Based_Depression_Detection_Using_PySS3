I hope it makes her think about me in some way everyday for the rest of her life.I've posted here many times with the same problem and it hasn't gotten better. I've tried therapy. We actually got really close for a while but she always told me it wasn't gonna last. We work together. She's my boss. And today I tried talking to her and she ignored me. I see her on her phone so I text her and she ignores that too. I live in an apartment with her brother. He happens to be my best friend. It has turned into such a big mess I can't control it and today its gotten to be worse than ever. My title says it all but shes probably gonna get over it within a few days. I'm gonna do it though. My life is shit anyways. And this just made it worse. This is an all time low. I'm sitting across from her as we speak. We carpooled here too. I might just take my keys walk out and drive home and do it... And somehow thinking about it is calming me down. Like freeing my spirit.
