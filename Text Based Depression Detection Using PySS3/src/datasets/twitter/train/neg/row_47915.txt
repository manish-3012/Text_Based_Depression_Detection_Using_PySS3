Why can't my head stop?Hey, my name is Chelsea and I am 18 years old. People would say I should be the happiest in life rn and that I should enjoy, but I don't really... I have been seeing a therapist for months now and it helps a little but not enough. Things still go wrong an I still get anxiety attacks in public, just like yesterday... my head can't stop thinking I get crazy and it needs to stop. Is this the only way? Should I say my goodbyes?
