Well, it happenedMy roommate/landlord wants my fiance and I put by the end of the week even though I paid rent and $150 for utilities. Utilities aren't even due yet but she doesn't want us "racking up her electric bill for next month". So now I don't have any idea of where I'm going to go, I don't know how to do this and my entire life is falling apart.
