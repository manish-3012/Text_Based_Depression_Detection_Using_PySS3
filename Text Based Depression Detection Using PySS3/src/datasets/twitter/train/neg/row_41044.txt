There is no turning backHey guys. Just a little background. 

When i was 19 i got arrested for having a little over an ounce of marijuana and was charged with a felony. My lawyer got me probation before judgment and not long after that i took out loans to go to a four year school. Figured it was time to get my shit together. 

 Got a good degree, only to find out that i'm basically unhireable due to my (not even guilty) felony. Pretty much every job interview goes the same, i impress in the interview only to have my background check fuck me in the ass. Already tried to get it expunged, its been 6 years since my initial arrest, my judge told me i would have to wait another 2 years before trying again. 

Well, i've had a rather large life insurance policy for some time now (more than enough to bury me as well as pay off my student loans), it will pay out for suicide after two years of the date i signed it up. I've completely ruined my credit trying to manage paying off my loans as well as the other bills i have and honestly i'm fucking tired of feeling like such a piece of shit. I dont think i can survive another two years of this, and am patiently eyeing up that two year date of the insurance policy to take care of everything. 

Thanks for reading and goodbye fellow redditors
