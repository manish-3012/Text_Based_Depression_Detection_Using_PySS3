was going to wait until Christmasbut whatâ€™s the point? 
I posted here a bit ago, but then thought maybe I should wait and not ruin the holidays for my parents. 
That thought is gone. Iâ€™m ready to leave. 
Once Iâ€™m gone, my boyfriend can move on. I know heâ€™s dying to. My parents can pursue their goals without their mentally sick daughter weighing on them. My dog can have a proper owner. A happy owner. 

Iâ€™m scared, but once itâ€™s done itâ€™s done. I just need to bite the bullet. Iâ€™m sorry to my pup and my parents. I need to just do this so I can escape this hell. I guess Iâ€™m sorry to my boyfriend too, heâ€™ll have to find me soon. 

Peace and love you guys, wherever you are out there, meet you on the other side.
