Need some adviceIm 18yo male, unsuccessful in everything, ugly, have no friends, im not smart, i never had a real relationship and all i do the whole day is skip uni, sleep and hate myself and everyone else except my mom and brother. Idk how to feel about my dad as he cheated on my mom a week ago. My grandpa died recently aswell. I never get invited anywhere and im insecure and not able to build healthy relationships to others.
Im filled with hatred and i lost faith in humanity and love.
The only joy i get is abusing drugs until i go unconscious.

So my question is, if i should be leaving a letter for my family when i commit suicide.
And if i should tell my crush that i love her.
I probably shouldnt tell her but it feels wrong to never say it.
