Options are dwindlingMy health is failing (brittle diabetic, one bout of congestive heart failure, possible cancer diagnosis), the one person that I can depend on isn't speaking to me because I misinterpreted something that she said that I reacted poorly to.

I'm getting tired of fighting this, and I have a ready means of ending my life (massive insulin overdose); so I guess the question is why can't I seem to screw up the courage to end my misery and remove the burden that I've become from other's lives?
