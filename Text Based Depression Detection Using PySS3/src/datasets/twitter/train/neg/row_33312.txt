I've run out of optionsI can't do this shit anymore. I've suffered from mental illness for years now (BPD, BiPolar and anorexia) and over the past 4 years my psychosis has gotten to the point where it's out of control. I constantly hear and see things that terrify me. I've got a therapist I see regularly plus I've seen numerous psychiatrists and tried loads of different medications and none of it helps. I'm just getting worse. Even psych teams are telling me they don't know what else to do. 
I've had suicide attempts in the past and recently I've been staying alive out of guilt the guilt of upsetting my mother, but I just don't think I can keep this up much longer. I don't think I'll ever be better.
