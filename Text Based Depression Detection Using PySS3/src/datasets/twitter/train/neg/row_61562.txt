I'm eating myself to death.For the last four years I've been suicidal. I've done nothing substantial with my life. I graduated high school, never moved onto college like my peers. I have a boyfriend, but I feel like I can't make any moves with him. I have a job that pays decent money. I still don't know how to drive.

I'm female, but I'm fat. I don't know how much I weigh, but I'm scared to look. Probably somewhere in the 250 range. I don't have joint pain or anything, and I haven't been diagnosed with diabetes, but I'm almost certain I have it. All sorts of awful medical conditions run in the family. I don't eat anything substantial. All I eat is fast food and hot pockets.

Thing is, I just don't give a shit. I don't care if I die. I have depression, and I just want to kill myself. Nobody wants to look at a fat chick anyway. I have an anxiety disorder, so I'm too much of a chicken shit to kill myself. I wish I could. I can't even cry about this to get it out. 
I'm scared of death. What if it hurts? What if its the worst pain I'll ever feel? What happens when you die, will I go to hell because I'm not a Christian? I don't expect answers to any of these questions, but I'm just so afraid.

I don't feel human. My own friends have told me that 'I'm not a girl'. I feel like everything I do I fuck up. I'm not motivated to do anything because I don't care about my own life, and digging myself out of this hole seems impossible. 

I'm tired of my own indifference. But I just don't care to solve any of it. I'm just waiting for my clock to tick down to zero so I can go to the next life and hope my odds are a little better. I can't commit suicide, but... God. I wish I could. I want to get help at the same time, but I don't care enough to. Some days are good, and I don't think about it. But then there's days like these I wish I could end everything. 

Sorry for the long post. There's a lot on my mind.
