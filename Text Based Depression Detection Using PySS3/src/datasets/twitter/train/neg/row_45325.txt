Iâ€™m not normally suicidal.Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t know if this is appropriate for this sub. I woke up today and just felt immensely sad and I began weeping. No one is awake for me to talk to about this but I had a brief thought of â€œwould I finally get the attention I craved if I die?â€ And I just started crying more at the thought. Iâ€™m a coward, unable to face my problems. I canâ€™t do it, because it would be selfish. But in life I just constantly feel sad without her.
