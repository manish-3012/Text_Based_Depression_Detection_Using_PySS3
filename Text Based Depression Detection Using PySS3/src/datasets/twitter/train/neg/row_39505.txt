I keep coming back to this idea that this is my inevitable end.Thereâ€™s a part of me that suffers so much. Itâ€™s like a cancer, spreading through and killing everything good in me.

Iâ€™m so scared of dying.

I want to believe Iâ€™m better than this. 

I want to believe I can make it.

Each day Iâ€™m getting more comfortable with the idea of not being here.
