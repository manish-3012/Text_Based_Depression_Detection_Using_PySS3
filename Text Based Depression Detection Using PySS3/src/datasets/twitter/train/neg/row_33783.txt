My life, A Clawing Struggle, Closure.I, R.A.B, will end my life soon. I have thought about this many a time, and even tried twice, but this time I will be successful. I have lived with depression for almost 7 years now. Depression has sat with me through the most amazing moments of my life, and my worst. Watching waiting for a weak moment. I am human, I am weak. I don't have siblings, my friends are mediocre, and my girlfriend doesn't understand the idea of depression. I've come from nothing, no father to speak of. Just a straight white male college student with nothing left to want but happiness. Please talk me out of this. Otherwise good luck to you all, enjoy life to its true potential and to your full potential, because though humanity is beautiful, this world is beautiful, you are beautiful, it won't last. None of it will. I love you mom, I love you Shannon, be strong for me. I am so fucking sorry.
