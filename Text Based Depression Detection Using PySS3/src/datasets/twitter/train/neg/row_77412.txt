Living with an alcoholic parent.I'm tired of fearing for my own safety. I'm tired of never knowing if my mother will be sober tonight, or if she'll get piss drunk and pass out on the floor again. I'm tired of walking on eggshells in my own fucking home. I want it to end but I don't know how to get away. I love her too much to report her and I'm too young to move out. No one would believe me anyway. I just want to kill myself so it'll all be over.
