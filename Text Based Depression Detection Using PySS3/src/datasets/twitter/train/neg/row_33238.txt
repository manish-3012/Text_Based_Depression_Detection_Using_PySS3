Goodbye Reddit, see you all in the next lifeI'm done, I can't continue, this life isn't worth living. 

It doesn't get easier no matter how many times you say it, sometimes your path gets chosen for you and nothing can change that. 

I hope my next life will be better than this one.

I've got two backpacks strapped to my legs filled with rocks and bricks, I'll be jumping into the river Tyne if anyone wants to find my body, I'd rather you'd just leave me there honestly, if you do drag me out bury me in nature please, under a tree would be nice, once that gets lots of sunshine. 

It's freezing right now so hopefully it won't take too long. 

I'm at peace, I'm ready to go in.

I've got quite a bit of wine for the trip, my plan is to blackout as hard as I can before I go in, should hopefully make this a bit better. 

This is goodbye Reddit, I'm thankful for your help but there was nothing you could do to save me, don't blame yourself, this is my choice. 

I just want to see my family again, I'm ready to go see them.  

I hope you can understand. 

I love you all, see you when I see you.

Andrew.
