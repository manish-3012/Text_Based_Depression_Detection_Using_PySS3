I just tried to kill myself, and failed...I figured I'm giving life another go.**I am not a troll, I just had to write this somewhere, anywhere**

**I am not going to kill myself...again, not now**

So, my life has been aimless for close to 10 years now, when I graduated high school. I've been living in countries with free health care, free education, fine learning establishments, have lovely and supportive parents and a great brother.
I got caught up in the student partying, and the not-so-partying internet world. I failed my studies, tried another major, tried another university in another country, did my military service in the mean time (came out sergeant with honours).
...but every time I found something to occupy my brain with, I'd eventually revert to my quasi-antisocial lonesome self, browsing the internet aimlessly.
Not that I didn't accomplish futile things on the internet. I managed to crawl my way up from mere poster to head admin of (what used to be) a prominent internet forum, with tens of thousands of users.
Still...pfft, internet...all the lulz and fails and wins can't give a man's life meaning.

If I sound somewhat cavalier about the whole thing is that, strangely, although I am not a happy person, I'm not really that depressed either. I know some really depressed people, and it's a sad sight. I wish them nothing but the best recovery.
I just noticed that I'd stopped even trying. I've given up on all my friends, they gradually faded away (moving to other countries doesn't help, and facebook is a joke for "staying in touch"), was eventually too lazy to make new ones, didn't pursue any jobs, let my university ID expire, I did nothing but ...be.

And in my book, just "being" is not life. it's not even existence, as far as many philosophers are concerned.
What kept me alive for the most part was fear of death (duh), but more importantly the love I have for and from my parents and my brother, who is for all intents and purposes my best friend. It's just wrong and selfish to kill yourself. I knew that, yet I decided to not care anymore, and proceed with the grim deed.




...ramble ramble ramble

 [The following is a bit graphic, it's my experience of trying to kill mysef, be warned. it's no /r/spacedicks, but it's still about death and how I tried doing it to myself.]


Aaaaaanyways, skipping ahead, I knew my brother was coming to visit me tomorrow, so the timing was right for me to not leave too smelly a corpse for him to find. I planned this for weeks.
I cleaned my flat from bottom up, made all kinds of paperwork for my eventual demise, deleted the questionable parts from my porn folder, and sharpened my big knife.

I opened up all my windows, to let the stench of my rotting carcass out, listened one last time to Albinoni's addagio  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMbvcp480Y4 ), and went to my bathroom where my blood splatter wouldn't cause too much damage.
...I tried stabbing myself through the heart...but just couldn't do it...my delusions of manliness crashed down...and I'd played this scene over in my head so many times...
Well, no matter, I thought about my alternate solutions.
Hanging...yes...that seems painless enough.
Poetic justice, I'd hang myself with an ethernet cord. I looked up on youtube how to make a proper hangman's noose, and proceeded to hang myself from my bedroom doorframe (it has a bar for pull-ups and such).

I made a nice knot, tightened the noose a bit, exhaled so I'd die quicker, kicked the stool from underneath me.

...

I wake up, I see shapes, horrible noises, makes no sense, I faintly feel my whole body convulsing. My reptilian brain is sending signals to my body to wake up, to not die.

whoah, this is a weird dream, where am I?
FUCK! I FAILED! FUCK! An ethernet cable is not as sturdy as it looks.

FUCK IT!

I dind't remember any pain, I felt like I blacked out within seconds. My life didn't flash before my eyes, I just blacked out, and had completely jumbled sounds and shapes in my mind for a few seconds when I woke up.
It's not the lack of oxygen to my lungs that's supposed to kill me, it's cutting off blood circulation to the brain.

Still not entirely recovered, my throat a bit sore (no, really, just a bit), I take a nice, thick microphone cable, and try again.
FUCK IT! I'm going to be dead soon, I'll just cut it to length so I can do the knot properly, it's not like I'm going to need it later on.

...

AGAIN! FUCK!

The cable snapped, again. I'm bloody 80kg/160lbs/several pebbles...this should not be happening.
Also, I felt a bulge in my rectum, like I was about to soil myself...I guess that myth is confirmed, then.

Well...two and a half tries...damn this thing...I give up...
Yes, I gave up on killing myself today, because I'm incompetent.

But hey, you know what? I'm alive. I figured that since I, like anyone else, is slightly unsure about actually killing your/him/her-self...life won. In my slight oxygen-deprived state, I even figured, hey, maybe there's some kind of higher power that stopped me, made me fail.

Ho boy, what a way to be...born again, from who-gives-a-shit-atheist, to spiritual man...but that didn't last.

I go outside for a walk, go buy a new phone SIM card to replace the one I destroyed...for some reason because I was suicidal...
I call my brother, I hate talking on the phone, so I'll see him tomorrow, and tell him everything: My attempt at what many languages refer to as self-murder. My lies, my failed life I've been trying to hide. So that ought to help...that ought to give me a kick in the butt I need, instead of the noose around my neck which was just a terribly stupid idea.

Also, a few minutes later, I received an email, a job offer for a 5 month contract. Well fuck me. Life is looking up again, and I didn't do anything to deserve such kindness.




moral of the story: I have no idea...I tried to kill myelf, and failed, and found...not meaning to my life but a glimmer of hope, it was not my time to go.

I should probably have typed all of this into notepad and delete it, and be done with it. But well...internet, if you care, here's my story so far, and it looks like it's going to continue for a while longer.
