Today made me realize how it was better off I was never born at all. Better yet, to have never exist to begin with.I am always shunned wherever I am. Either online or in real life. Even the times when I meet people totally new and try my best to be nice, I always apparently, ALWAYS have this affect that people get repelled from talking to me. My Highschool life sucked because Iâ€™m mixed heritage where Iâ€™m at and people just have all sorts of reasons to hate me. (Basically I look too pale and Goth too so that offended most.) I was always abused emotionally in relationships because people at some point just want to act like the dominant one to me. My home life you can guess sucks too as I literally live like a refugee and have one side of the family thatâ€™s like Stockholm Syndrome and one side that are religious toxics. Iâ€™m currently 25 and honestly canâ€™t sleep these past few days and this pandemic is just making my financial prospects worse. Oh ya! I also donâ€™t have a degree because my familyâ€™s an ass even before I was born. Literally donâ€™t have enough to shift out or have some sort of independent power.
Again, I feel like I shouldâ€™ve never existed to begin with because if I didnâ€™t exist, I know my absence would not affect anything.
