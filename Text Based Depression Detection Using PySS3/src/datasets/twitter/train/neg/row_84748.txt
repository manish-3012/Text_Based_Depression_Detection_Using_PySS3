I may have to make a very hard decision in the coming weeksI genuinely hope I donâ€™t have to make this decision, but it may be coming. 

Would you rather your family gets ruined financially (lose house, rely on family, etc.) but get to see you again someday, or would you guarantee they are provided for and receive enough to pay off the house or live anywhere they want to, but theyâ€™ll never see you again?
