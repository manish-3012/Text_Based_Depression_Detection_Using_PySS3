I donâ€™t want to participate anymoreI donâ€™t want to participate in my life anymore.

Thereâ€™s nothing I want. Theres nothing that makes me happy or that Iâ€™m looking forward to.

I donâ€™t have a job, I dropped out of college, I donâ€™t have any real life friends. I do have a few online gaming friends, and I also have a dog and two cats. All I do all day every day is sit at home and play Minecraft. And sometimes I canâ€™t even manage that because I feel so exhausted for no reason, so I just lay in my bed and watch YouTube videos. 

Iâ€™m too anxious to leave the house or even just order a pizza to my house. Iâ€™m totally dependent on my parents, who I still live with at 23. Iâ€™m such a huge disappointment to them and I feel awful about it. Theyâ€™re always mad at me and they think Iâ€™m just being lazy and pathetic. 

So I want to just opt out now. Iâ€™ve had enough with life like this. Im fine with leaving now. To be completely honest, I donâ€™t even really know why Iâ€™m posting this here. I think there might still be a part of me that wants to stay... but why?
