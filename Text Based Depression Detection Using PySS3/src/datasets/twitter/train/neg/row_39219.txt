DoneHey everybody
My name is rob i am 20 years old.
I had an extremly rough birth born 24 weeks premature.
I had heart attacks brain injuries and othr complications.
Today this means my brain is not functioning properly.
I have ADD extreme anxiety constant migraines and sjogrens syndrome and am always in extreme pain my muscles hurt so much every day i can barely move my eyes constantly burn.
Also have severe myopia so when i put on glasses i look like crap and everybody laughs at me .
My gf that i loved more then anything broke up whith me for no reason today and i am broken beyond repair.
I am dying without her.
I tried killing myself by overdosing on my sleep medicating but woke up a day later puking , so icnt even do that right.
Please give me a reason to live i cant see it anymore.
This agony just wont stop!!!
