Not doing another yearLike what's the point. I have no job, I have no girlfriend, it's new years eve everyone else in my house is partying and I'm crying in my room. Nobody cares, nobody wants to be around the sad guy so fuck it. They don't have to be anymore.

I'm going to wait until they are asleep and then drink everything they didn't and take all the pills I can find. I'm fucking done, it doesn't get better and no one can help me.

Happy fucking new years.
