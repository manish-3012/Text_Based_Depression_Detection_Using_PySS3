HelpPlease read this, it would mean a lot to me. I'm a 15 year old girl from Europe.        
I started seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist two months ago, when they said they wanted to give me a diagnosis and medicines. Two months later they still haven't. Every time I see them they tell me they are "thinking about it", but I can't take this anymore. On Saturday I'm going to kill myself. Tomorrow is the last time I will see my psychiatrist, today I saw the therapist but she didn't help me at all. Tomorrow is the last chance she has to make me feel a little bit better, or at least to tell me when I will. I don't want to die, I really don't, but I have no other choice. I'm sorry.         
            
Tomorrow I will tell her that I have a plan and a date, and to please give me a reason to live. Because I don't want to die, but it's stronger than me. I'm so anxious right now. Please if you have any advice on what or how to tell her, or just a couple of kind words, it could save my life. Thank you in advance &lt;3
