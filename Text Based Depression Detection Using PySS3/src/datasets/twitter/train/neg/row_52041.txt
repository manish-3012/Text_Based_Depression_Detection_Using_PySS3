what do you do when...a bright day turns into a dark room?
or your family forgets about you?
or when you isolate so much you forgot how to connect?
or when people call you weak because you were addicted to drugs? 
and you try to be part of communities and you seek every treatment possible but nothing ever seems to work?
or when you're supposed to be a man and you've been sexually assaulted and resources or direction for people like you are scant to non existent?
or when you've been beaten up so much that you have virtually no self esteem?
or when, no matter how much you speak up for other people and other causes, you get shit on?
or when the thought of "confidence" disturbs you?
or when you feel like you've experienced almost every terrible issue imaginable?

violence, police, trauma, illness, medication, abuse, infection. 
racism, homophobia, sexism, self-hatred, doubt, abandonment.
time to go.

"But everyone has problems. Be a man. Suck it up. Get over it. Accept inferiority. Let them ignore you. You're better off alone. Just let the pain in."
