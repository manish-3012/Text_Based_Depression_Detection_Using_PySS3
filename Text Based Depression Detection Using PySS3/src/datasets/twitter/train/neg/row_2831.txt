failed suicide attemptalmost a full month ago, everything had just become too much for me to handle. schoolwork was piling up, my self esteem was at an all time low, and i just really didn't feel like living anymore. i tried to slit it vertically but i was too squeamish and afraid of the pain. i had no rope to hang myself or any idea of where i could hang from. so i settled with taking melatonin and taking a bath with the water up to my chin, hoping i'd slump down, drown and die in my sleep. i know it sounds stupid (and it was). i left a note for each person i loved and just a general note for police or whoever found my body. i did end up falling asleep but i didn't die. my mom had come home and woken me up and was demanding to know what i was trying to do. i told her basically everything about how i wanted to die and how i felt trapped. she just yelled at me and called me selfish and how i was ungrateful for the life i had. she told my dad and i got yelled at again by him. i think she told my grandparents as well. my parents took away my phone until now and when they gave it back they told me i better not pull a stunt like that again or else my punishment would be worse. i can't help but wish i had died that day. i feel worse than i did before and i don't know what to do. i'm scared of failing again but i don't want to be alive anymore.
