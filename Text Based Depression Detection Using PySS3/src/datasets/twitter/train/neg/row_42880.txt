Just need to write down some stuff. ThanksI dont have a big reason for my thoughts, but a combination of little things and then some. But the entire outlook on my future just fucking sucks. I go to school, i go to work, i go home, i sleep. Repeat. But this all leads me to a glass half empty mindset. Like with all good things in life, a bad thing will happen in the future. No matter how one looks at it, thats the way it is. But my problem is that i have lost all thoughts on what is a good thing and what is a bad thing. (I dont feel happiness or sadness much at all) i cant recall the last time ive had a genuine laugh or have something or someone im emotionally invested in. It almost feels like why live if im unable to feel. My dad said to me( and i quote): â€œYou have two arms and two legs. Why arenâ€™t you happyâ€. When i first heard that i didnt know how to respond other than silence. I kept asking myself, â€œis it that easyâ€™ or â€˜what am i doing wrong?â€ This also lead me down the path of why cant i be happy when there are people out there in a worse situation than me. Everything going through my head just leads back to the point of why arent you happy. This is pretty much a rant of nonsense and my therapist and parents are still clinging on to the fact that im this way because of their divorce(im not. I could honestly care less) But just in writing this it felt alright being able to put this out to all of you. So I indirectly thank you.
