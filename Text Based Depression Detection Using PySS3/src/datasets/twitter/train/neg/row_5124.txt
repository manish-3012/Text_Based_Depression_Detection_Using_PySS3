I want to give up so bad.I've been trying so long and so hard to be positive and to try and change my life for the better. Nothing works it always fails because of something outside of my control. I know all of my friends hate me, my family is ashamed of me and I don't deserve to be happy.

I've never been wanted, I was literally a mistake, and with my medical problems I've been a very expensive mistake that drove my parents apart. It's my fault. I selfsabotage my own chances at things because I know I don't deserve them. When I open up to people they just abandon me because I'm way too annoying and I don't offer anything good enough for them to stay for. I'm just a worthless mess who shouldn't have been born in the first place.

I can't do this anymore. I need it to be over, I sit here and just cry myself to sleep every night and I know everyone will be better off once I'm gone.
