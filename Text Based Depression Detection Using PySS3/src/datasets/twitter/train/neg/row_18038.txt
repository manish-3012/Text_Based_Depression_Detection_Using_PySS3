I attempted to take a whole bottle of pills to end myself.A few nights ago I attempted to take a whole bottle of pills along with a bunch of Meletonin to help me fall asleep so I wouldn't feel any pain as I was going to die from overdosing. I only took two Meletonin because I was too scared to take the whole bottle of pills. The two Meletonin that I took only left me extremely tired for the past few days, but I just slept it off whenever I got home from school. I didn't tell any of my friends and family members because I didn't want them to think that I was just seeking attention. I was also scared that I would be sent to a mental hospital or be put on suicide watch for a few days. I don't know what to do anymore. I still wish that I could've just ended it when I had the chance to.
