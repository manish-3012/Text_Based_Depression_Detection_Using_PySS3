How to not give up, when life is all shit?I feel such a sadness every day, today i tried to jump in front of the car, but he stopped, its my first atempt of trying to harm myself. Negative thoughts build up every day in me and shit i dont wanna live no more. 
I have no social life, no interests and i spend all of my time working and studying im burned out and i see no way of getting out of this crap but just end my life. Such a worthless shit like me is just useless entity that wastes space and resources.
