im so stressedI am a 15 year old, and I constantly think about my future. But, how do I do it if no one is willing to help me. My parents don't care about me mentally, and think I'm being just an emotional teenager. I overdosed once and was out of it vomitting the whole day without them noticing. What do I do? I want to have a future, and some friends that could understand would be nice.
