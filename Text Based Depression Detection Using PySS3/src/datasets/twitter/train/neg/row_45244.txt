I don't see the point in staying aliveI don't understand why I suffer for a non existent future. I know nothing will work out for me (just like always) I'll spend the rest of my life clenching pill bottles alone in some flat. the only thing I want is something I can't have bc I'm socially inept. at this point I'm looking for a reason to stay here, I don't want to kill myself, I just regret being born and wouldn't mind if I didn't wake up tomorrow. somebody please say or do something.
