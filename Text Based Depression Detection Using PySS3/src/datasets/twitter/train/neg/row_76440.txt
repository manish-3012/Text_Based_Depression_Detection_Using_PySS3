please someone talk to meiâ€™m having a panic attack induced from a nightmare about my ex bf, i havenâ€™t slept in about 2 years i have nightmares about him and other traumas in my life, iâ€™m about to turn 18 and with that i see the ability to turn my life around, but right now iâ€™m hyperventilating and holding a razor to my neck, my cards are dealt horribly and i ruined my own life by not trying in school, mom and dad are dead and my adopted parents hate me and tried to kick me out but the police said they had to wait until iâ€™m 18, iâ€™m so tired of being a burden and unloveable, everyone says iâ€™m to young to make this decision but iâ€™ve been suicidal since 3rd grade and i havenâ€™t exhausted every other option but i donâ€™t care i just want to sleep iâ€™m uselesss and unloveable whatâ€™s the point of suffering also no one is stopping me everyone around me says ok
