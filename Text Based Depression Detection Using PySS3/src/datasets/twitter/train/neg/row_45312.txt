i used to make myself hang on for things like tv shows, but at this point i donâ€™t even care about any of it.my favourite tv show is preacher. i connect to the characters, i rewatch episodes constantly, i write fanfiction about the characters, and i always say that i am as good as dead when the show is on hiatus.

it currently is on hiatus, but dear god i couldnâ€™t care less about the new season. i just want to be gone so i can stop invading peopleâ€™s lives and ruining everything. 

this dumb, garbage show isnâ€™t worth sticking around for.

sorry for venting. have a great weekend, everyone. â¤ï¸
