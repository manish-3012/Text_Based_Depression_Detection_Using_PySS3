I wish I could just leaveIâ€™m just lost now. I donâ€™t see why Iâ€™m still here. I want to end it, and would have if it werenâ€™t for my family. They try so hard. My mom wants me to succeed, my dad sees me succeeding in the future, and my younger brother looks up to me. I canâ€™t live up to that. I canâ€™t do any of that. All I can do is be pulled along by society until I break and disappear. My friends donâ€™t give a shit, they donâ€™t want to hang out. People only hit me up for alcohol. I thought buying a fake would help me get invited and hang out with people, but all itâ€™s done is show me how little I mean to anyone. Iâ€™m no better than anyone else with a 21+ ID with nothing better to do. Iâ€™m average at everything and good at nothing but singing, but who the fuck cares about artists? I canâ€™t even do that on my own, I need people to support me there. Iâ€™m an average student, struggling between tests, and I donâ€™t find joy in any of it. Iâ€™m not happy, but I donâ€™t deserve to be happy. I feel shitty of how successful my friends are with women when Iâ€™m not, and then I feel shitty because I care about that.

This is a long time coming. I tried to commit suicide last over a year ago and I let someone talk me out of it, someone who I then went on to try and date who then left me high and dry a week before prom. Last year one of my New Yearâ€™s resolutions was to successfully kill myself. I didnâ€™t do it. I should have. Iâ€™ll go through phases, sometimes up to a couple of weeks, where I feel like everything is okay and I forget why Iâ€™m depressed, and then all of a sudden itâ€™ll all come crashing down on me. 

Iâ€™m scared of killing myself but it seems like the best option. Not to give away anything about who I am, but my city is known for high schoolers taking their lives. I see where theyâ€™re coming from. Itâ€™s not school, it's not parents, it's just life. It just makes more sense to kill myself like these other students did and never have to deal with this anymore. 

I donâ€™t really care if any of you read this, because I probably will be too weak to actually do anything, but I just needed to tell someone. Sorry for the rambling train of thought.
