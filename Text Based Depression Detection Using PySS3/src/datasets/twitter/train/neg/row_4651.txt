I don't wanna be here no more, but I'm a coward.I've been snapping at everyone I know, including my therapist. I left everyone. They fucking take my problems as bullshit so i can just shut up. They don't wanna help despite what they say. If you are gonna keep saying "oHhHhH, iTs jUsT rEaL lIfe!!!!!!!!!! dOoO tHe sHiT!!!!!!!!!" then you are a fucking asshole. You don't know my fucking problems. Things may be easier for you, when it isn't for me. It's hard to get up in the morning and do my basic daily shit. It's hard to work. It's hard to eat. It's hard to fucking do anything here. Everything I say or do, I get fucking screamed at. Does anyone at this point care? No.  


But here is the stupid problem. I'm too much of a wuss to cut myself out of this world. I don't want the pain. I don't want to see my loved one be sad. I don't want the fucking guilt. I don't want any of this. Yet I don't want to live.  


If I hear anyone and I mean ANYONE say I have it better than them I'm going ballistic. I fucking hate that sentence. It makes me want to kill myself more because no one fucking cares.  


Thank you, and goodnight.
