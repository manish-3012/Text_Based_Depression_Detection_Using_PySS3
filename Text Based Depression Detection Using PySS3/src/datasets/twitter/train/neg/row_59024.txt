I just want to give upmy boyfriend and i got in a huge fight today. he did something to betray my trust and i ended up self harming (mostly cutting) and it was the deepest I'd done in a really long time. i really wanted to just go as deep as I could but didnt want my mother or him to have to clean it if I died or whatever. I was on the bathroom floor when i did it and there was a puddle of blood on the floor almost a foot wide (I bleed a lot) after about an hour of being in there my boyfriend unlocked the door from the outside and came in, when he saw the blood he immediately started crying and hugging me and saying "no, no, no" over and over. he didnt calm down until i let him know i was fine and didnt cut extremely deep. it hurt seeing him react like that but at the same time felt nice because at least he was actually showing he cared. i know that sounds awful of me. things are just really bad right now
