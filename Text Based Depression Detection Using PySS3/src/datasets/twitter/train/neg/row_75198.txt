Maybe this time will be different.Basically I have been an addict. Got my self clean. Shit happened that caused me to get clean.


Was using drugs to forgot about her. Got to the point where it was a new thing every Saturday. It was a rough 6 months. 

I'm clean now  but it came with a cost. Basically I have a big debt. Going to start working and studying for the next 8 months where none of my money will go to my pocket. Really craving at this time. Sometimes when the train passes by I think how calming and quick it'll be. Looking at high buildings I think how smooth and fun the fall will be knowing that it's just one quick splash. Playing with my knives I think how fun It'd be to cut but not like the old times but really cut. 

Tried to contact her again. She didn't even bother and I felt like nothing. 

I live alone. People around me keep saying how other people have it worst than me. I'm living my life. I'm stressing about my problems. I'm stressing about my debts. I'm stressing about working 8 hours a day for the next 8 months to pay a 2k debt. I'm not in their seats and neither are they. People care about me but I don't care about anything or myself anymore. 

At least the anti depressants did something for a couple of days but now they don't do anything. 


Maybe jumping in front of the train is better after all. Maybe I really hit my peak of where I will feel the happiest and its just shit from here on forward. 

I'm 21 years old and honestly I always used to say I'll die before my twenties. I guess I was close enough.
