Not suicidal but,I threw my life away and I think about that a lot. 

I became a stripper to pay for school and I did what weâ€™re shouldnâ€™t do and I let the money get to me. I quit making payments on my loan &amp; it became too late &amp; I defaulted on the loan &amp; wasnâ€™t allowed entry back to school till 24. Iâ€™m 25 &amp; still donâ€™t have my degree. I could be 25 finishing up my masters degree right now. 

Iâ€™m so upset I didnâ€™t take my life more seriously. This seriously haunts me every day. I knew I would be haunted so I donâ€™t know why I continued with my reckless behavior.
