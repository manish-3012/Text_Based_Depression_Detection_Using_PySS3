Iâ€™ve been feeling weird recentlyI donâ€™t even know what to say. I just feel empty. I feel like thereâ€™s lots of stuff I want to do in my life and do in the future but it just feels like itâ€™s not even worth doing. I feel like when I go out and do the things I wanna do itâ€™s never as good as I thought it was gonna be. I feel like thatâ€™s how my entire life is going to be. Nothing is very good. Everything good ends as soon as it begins. Iâ€™ve seen a lot of people die in my life and itâ€™s just like whatâ€™s the point. Iâ€™ve never even considered suicide but Iâ€™m starting to fear myself and what I could do in an impulse. Some guy in a group chat sent a video of a guy blowing off his head with a shotgun and I had thoughts like â€œI have a shotgun just downstairs, I could do that and be gone in an instantâ€ and it scares me. I feel scared to have guns in my house because I know in an instant I could kill myself. I want these thoughts to be gone and I want to feel normal. Life isnâ€™t even that bad but everything is just bland and I scare myself.
