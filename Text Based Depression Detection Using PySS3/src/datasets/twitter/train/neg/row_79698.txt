I can't cope anymore.I don't want to waste anyone's time, but my mom has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember, she always tells me that I won't amount to anything if I don't get off the damn computer, and I know that, I spend most of my time reading or learning Spanish anyways.  But she does not give two shits about me or my happiness, all she cares about are my grades.  My dad can't do anything about it and won't even talk to her about rehab.  It's all I can do to not break down in the middle of class, and I just can't cope with it anymore.
