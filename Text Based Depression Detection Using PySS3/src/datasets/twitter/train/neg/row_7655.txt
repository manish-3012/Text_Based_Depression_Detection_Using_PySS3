Donâ€™t know how many more nights I can take.Too tired to get into details but my girlfriend was my world and made me happy for the first time I can remember. I fucked it up and now she wonâ€™t talk to me and cut all of our ties off. Iâ€™m stuck in this shitty waiting game where I hope I gave her enough space to want to work things out again. Every night I have to calm myself down and I usually stay up late because its the only time I can ever hope for peace of mind. The days are a hell every single second and sheâ€™s probably already off fucking another guy. I miss her and her sweet words. Every night I think about killing myself and itâ€™s getting harder to say no.
