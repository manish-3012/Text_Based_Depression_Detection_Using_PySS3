I don't understand how people have the strength and will power to kill themselvesI'm writing this just after writing my suicide note and I just tried to hang myself with my belt on the door. I was so very close, my adrenaline shot up, I was locked in place and I guess my survival instinct took over. Before I could kick the bin over that I was standing on, I started panicking and somehow managed to force the door open my yanking on the belt.

I put everything away again and now here I am, having to suffer through life because I'm unable to make myself die.

I don't know how people can do it. I'm sure the only way I could do it is if I had a gun as it would be super quick and very little can go wrong. Living in England pretty much makes that an impossibility though.
