feeling weird and sadI've been having intrusive thoughts re-enter my mind and it's disturbing. Last night was horrible. I've been sleeping about 4-5 hours most days, usually falling asleep at 3am. The days I get 7-8+ hrs, I still feel exhausted. It's 8am, and I remember 6 hours ago around 2am I had waves of emotions just hitting me, one after another.

The waves hit harder each time I kept trying to suppress an emotion. I'd recognize the instant moment I was getting upset or very emotional. Then I would end up fighting myself at a war inside my head. Each wave, my cries would slowly intensify and become louder. I did this thing where I shook my head (like when someone nods "No") to stop myself from letting any tears leak. And then at some point I think I just got too tired and passed out because I can't remember what happened right before I slept.

The image of myself losing it. Hurting myself and people who care about me. I kept hearing a voice shouting and screaming, it terrified me. I would keep repeating "Man dying sounds really good right now." I always imagine my death as something that happens instantly. Like falling from a high distance, getting hit by a car or getting shot in the chest. 

And I do this other thing where I keep replaying these death scenarios. Oddly, sometimes there's a sensation of relief of happiness visualizing these thoughts. It's fucked up, and I wish I knew why this was all happening. I don't plan on acting, but the intrusive thoughts really hit hard yesterday...
