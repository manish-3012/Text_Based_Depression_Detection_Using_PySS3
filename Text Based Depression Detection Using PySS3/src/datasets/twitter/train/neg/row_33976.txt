If you've attempted before please help me out by answering thisI think it's common that me and other posters here have been thinking about suicide for a long time. I am wondering what factors/feelings are present just before you attempted. I think I am very sure that whatever life I have ahead will not be pleasent. I feel like I am showing up for work at a job where I'm not going to get paid. I feel like I'm still going around the monopoly board with $5 left. I am asking to be hit at blackjack when I am way past 21. I want to know how close I am.
