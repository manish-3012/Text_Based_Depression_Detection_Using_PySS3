I deserve to feel this wayI'm beyond saving. I'm a typical prat. Nobody likes me and for good reason. I'm a judgemental, crude, all-around unpleasant character. Fucking hate the degenerates I'm forced to hang around with. Fucking hate that I think of them as degenerates. I deserve to feel this way. I wish I wasn't so fucking cowardly. How I would love to be released from this prison.
