I really hate myself.I don't expect anybody to read this or to respond. I just really want to write down how I feel because there's nobody I can talk to.
 
I'm estranged from my father. All my life I've done nothing but try to get his approval and support, even when he divorced and moved far away from us. Life at home sucks a mean dick. We went from upper middle class to a small income and my mother has no idea how to budget or how to manage finance.
 
We're living with the three of us, mother brother and me, and it's just generally bad. We have really good moments and it feels great but the majority is just really bad. I admit I can get really angry at times. That contributes to it.
 
Sometimes I just want to kill myself, just to step out. It'd be easier. I take pride in knowing people would grief. School hasn't been fabulous, I have great grades and a couple of nice friends but it's nothing I can open up to. 
 
I feel like a whiny little bitch but I just had to write this. I took a nice big sleeping pill and I'll check in again tomorrow.
