I want to live. I really do.It's numb. Really numb. I don't think I've felt really good or really bad for a really long time. Just the dread. It's gotten so bad that I just have to imagine my life as some sick on-going game where I just stay alive to have another wave of numbness after another and see how long I can last.

If I knew nobody and didn't have these cursed moral ties to people that care about me, I'd hop on a chair, tie a noose around my neck, start a fire below me, and then shoot myself just to be safe. I've imagined this several times. 

I've reached out for therapy, but my therapist is jackshit. They've even told other people about things I've said, something I'm not happy at all with.

My family around me does care about me, but they're too caught up in their own stuff to care about getting me help. **My dad gets TWO therapists.** 

I just wish I could die forever. Sure, heaven would be nice, but it'd be so nice to just stop existing, or if I could just remove myself from this plane of existence. I have tried getting help. I have tried to reach out.

I'm an ugly, disgusting worthless little bug, and I can't even do the things I love because even though **I HAVE THE MONEY,** my family is too lazy to actually go to the store with me to go get supplies (god forbid I go alone for like 5-10 minutes to get some clay). 

Please, anything would help. I feel cold to the bone every day. Icecream has stopped helping.

Sorry if my post seems garbled. I probably made a few mistakes but I couldn't proofread it if I wanted to.
