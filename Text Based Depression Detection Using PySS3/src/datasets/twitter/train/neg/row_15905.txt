Iâ€™m 13 and I think iâ€™m really gonna do it.Iâ€™m pretty young, I know a lot of you will probably think that Iâ€™m exaggerating or that I have a lot to live for but Iâ€™ve had it. I just canâ€™t anymore. When I was 11 I was raped and everyday those memories haunt me. I feel so much guilt and shame I let it happen. I feel so sick to my stomach every day. My brother watched it happen and didnâ€™t help (he actually told me it was sexy) . Waking up every day is agony. I let myself fall time and time again into abusive relationships where I let people lie and manipulate and be terribly cruel to me because I need some sort of distraction in my life from the flashbacks and panic attacks and PTSD attacks every single day. The most random thing will happen and iâ€™m back to that day, with the old man iâ€™ve never even met in my life and will probably never see again. Itâ€™s like he didnâ€™t even care that he just completely ruined my life . Like it was no big deal. Iâ€™m just so tired, I donâ€™t even see a point in living. Nobody seems likr theyâ€™d be upset. People always tell me iâ€™m nice and that everybody at school likes me , but they always follow it up with that iâ€™m annoying and boring. I havenâ€™t spoken my emotions to anyone in years. This is the first time iâ€™m reaching out I guess. Iâ€™ve fooled everyone so good into believeing my life is perfection I actually won the happiest student award. Itâ€™s caused me problems where now when I try to dare open up people get mad â€œhow can you be upset? your life is perfect!â€ when itâ€™s not. I think itâ€™d be almost funny, like the most perfect form of irony if i were to kill myself. Could you imagine? Happiest student award died from suicide? 

I guess iâ€™m just asking if thereâ€™s even any reason to go on honestly. I donâ€™t think so. I think iâ€™m done.
