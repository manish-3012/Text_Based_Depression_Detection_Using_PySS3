Hey yâ€™allItâ€™s me again. I bet youâ€™re all like â€œjust do it already and stop talking about itâ€ and I hear you. I tried giving life a chance, but life simply wonâ€™t cut me a break. Now Iâ€™m expected to leave my home and move away because of my abusive older brother. You read that right, I didnâ€™t do shit and now Iâ€™m fucking being punished. Weâ€™re all moving to hide from him. Iâ€™ve been saying heâ€™s toxic for years, but as soon as my mom says it NOW itâ€™s serious. Not when I couldnâ€™t get a wink of sleep after a hard day, not when I was exhausted and had to go home and â€œrelaxâ€ to the sound of yelling, and arguing and breaking shit. If this isnâ€™t a sign, I donâ€™t know what is. I donâ€™t want to be saved or even want a solution. I guess Iâ€™m just lonely and find solace in a few strangers pretending they give a fuck about me
