Exhausted from trying to get betterI've been trying so hard this year to get help at different places with different medications and it hasn't worked. I'm almost 34 and spent 50 days inpatient this year and did ECT which was so much harder than I thought it would be and entirely unhelpful. I saw people really change with ECT but not me. I've been on almost 20 medications in 11 years and seen so many therapists and psychiatrists. The point is I have been actively trying to get better. It feels like a lot of wasted effort.

There are only so many times you can be open and honest with medical professionals and yet not really feel you're getting a little better. I am exhausted from trying. I feel like I have failed. I'm moving soon and honestly I'm throwing out a lot of stuff and trying to pay off medical bills so my husband has less to deal with when I'm gone. I'm trapped in a bad situation and I feel ugly and useless. I just don't see myself making it to the end of the year.
