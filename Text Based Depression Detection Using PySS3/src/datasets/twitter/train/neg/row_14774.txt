So, my turn again?Hello

Since joining, Iâ€™ve tried to be very active. Especially with posts that havenâ€™t a reply yet. Part of me feels that the way to help yourself is to help others, and only those that have gone through mental health issues are in a position to  truly understand. 

Tonight though, I sit here in the couch.  Crying. Drinking beer. Downing benzoâ€™s. Smoking pot. And I know I could keep going and just......not wake up. 

Sober, Iâ€™d never do it. Right now, itâ€™s hard to focus, or simply count how much Iâ€™ve had. 

 Bipolar for 20+.  Divorced after 16y together and only 6 months married. Recently acquired DUI. Thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m coming from.
