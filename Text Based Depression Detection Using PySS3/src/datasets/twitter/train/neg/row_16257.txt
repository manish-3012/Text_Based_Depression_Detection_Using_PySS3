I'm worried.So I have been with this amazing person for ew months now and I know her from a year and within these months she has told me about a lot of things that she went through as a kid and as an teenager. They do Include some of the most disgusting things that could happen to a person. She has been sexually assaulted has been thrown into a study course she doesn't want and has been under a lot of pressure. 
She had been dealing with this for quite some time usual nightmare and sleepless nights sudden breakdowns. 
Looking at her all like this it break me I have cried in front of her and when she's not around feeling sad that I'm not able to do anything. 
I try my level best to make her happy and do things for her. 
But lately it's been very severe the amount of nightmares her urge to harm herself right now my whole life revolves around her I meet her everyday try to conform her give her everything she deserves. 
I don't know what else to do so that this goes away. 
Help me.
