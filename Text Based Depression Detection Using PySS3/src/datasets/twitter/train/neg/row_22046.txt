I.. don't know what to do.I'm almost 30, I have a beautiful 16 month old daughter, a lovable, smart, funny wife, family, friends etc.. I haven't been able to keep a job my whole life, although I try my hardest. My depression doesnt let me. It doesn't let me sleep, It doesn't let me smile. It doesn't let me eat. I've seeked help before but got hit was the classic "you're young" (i was 23) so that got me angry. 

All I want to do everyday is cry. Just sob in the dark and scream. I wish there was a sure fire way that I could just.. "disappear" without repercussions. But part of this inner battle is me being aware that i would ruin my daughters life forever if I did. I don't know what I can do. I don't know what to do. I'm hurting so f*cking much. Im crying writing this... I'm sorry if i bothered any of you.
