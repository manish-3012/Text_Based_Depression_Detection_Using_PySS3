I want to burn every bridge.I want to burn every bridge, every friendship, every relationship, and any other reason someone would care for me.

I want to become a vile person that people will rejoice when I take my own life. 

The current problem is too many people would miss me. So, my idea is if everyone hates me then it will make my passing easier.

I realize I will have to go against my moral code of ethics, and have to lie, cheat, and steal. However I am more than willing to do this and beyound if it would mean I could kill myself in piece. 

I have wanted nothing more in life than to die for 22 years (give or take a month) i am in therapy, see a psychologist, and still have a handful of people that cafe for me.

My second goal is now to make people who would give me the world, and make them never want to hear my name again. 

Being in the mental health system for over 2 decades the only skill I have acquired is to convince peope that I am not going to do it. When in reality I am just not doing it now. 

With multiple attempts under my belt I have decided the next method to test my luck. I've had 3 close calls, and doctors can't explain why I lived. Except for the Bull shit "it's not your time", "life has a purpose for you" or "you are not alone."

I want to be alone forever for eternity. 

My purpose is to die, as all that are born are cursed with dying

I Don't want friends.
I Donâ€™t want to be saved.
I want the option to did.


My body. My choice.
