It will all be okay when I am goneI am not happy. I don't even remember the last time I was happy. Was I ever happy?? No, I don't think so. I have some days that are better than others, but that's it. That is not enough. Not enough to keep me going. My body hurts. All the time. I'm tired of hurting. And I'm tired of thinking these thoughts and feeling these feelings, and...and..and...everything. I am just done with it. Therapy, meds...sigh...so tired of all of it. Tonight, I just want to close my eyes and never open them again. The people around here will understand. They see it in my eyes, my face. They ask why I am so tired, so sad. They won't be surprised. It will be okay.
