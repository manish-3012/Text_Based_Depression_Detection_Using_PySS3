DoneI can't do this. I can't keep going like this and no one fucking cares. I hate everything and I have no passion anymore. I just want to die. I don't care how I do it, I have so many ideas, I just want to have the courage to do it. My husband leaves for work tomorrow and it just seems like the best time to do it.
