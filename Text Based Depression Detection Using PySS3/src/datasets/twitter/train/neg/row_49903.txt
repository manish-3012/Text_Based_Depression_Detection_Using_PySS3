Just make the pain stopItâ€™s been a rough year. My wife left me and Iâ€™m now divorced, then about 3 months later one of my dogs died (my dogs mean a lot to me), Iâ€™ve lost my job, and now Iâ€™ve seen that my ex is dating someone pretty steady. 

The only thing thatâ€™s keeping me going is my 2.5 year old son. Heâ€™s pretty non-verbal (heâ€™s in speech therapy) but heâ€™s the most loveable and empathetic person I know. He reminds me of myself at his age. This makes it even worse for me, let me explain why. 

Iâ€™m depressed a lot lately, and I put on the good smile like I have my whole life and people fall for it. I donâ€™t want people to worry about me and I bottle up the depression so nobody has to worry about me. People tell me that Iâ€™m one of the happiest people they know.

Now for some reason, my son can read me like a book. He can tell when Iâ€™m depressed, even when Iâ€™m smiling and playing with him. Iâ€™ll feel it hit, and heâ€™ll come over and say â€œok dadaâ€ and hug me while patting my back. I donâ€™t want to use him like my mother used me to feel better, it damaged me and I refuse to damage my son like that. He is more important to me than anything. He climbs on my lap and pulls my arms around him and refuses to let me take my arms from being around him. 

If I commit suicide, it would hurt him beyond belief. I donâ€™t want him to think that I didnâ€™t love him enough to stay, but if I do stay heâ€™ll see through me and Iâ€™ll hurt him anyhow. Iâ€™m damned if I do and damned if I donâ€™t. 

I was thinking that maybe making it look like an accident would fix that. He wouldnâ€™t remember me but he also wouldnâ€™t think I left him purposely. I would hurt him, but hopefully not damage him as much as if he knew I committed suicide. 

I do have plans on how to do it. Iâ€™m scared and in pain, so much pain. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m waiting for or even why Iâ€™m writing this. Iâ€™m sorry for the long post.
