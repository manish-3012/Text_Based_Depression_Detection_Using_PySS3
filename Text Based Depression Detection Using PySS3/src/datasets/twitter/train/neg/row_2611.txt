Day 10 of spending one hour a night trying to convince myself to kill myselfNot going well as I'm still here obviously. It's a lot harder to hold a gun to your head for an extended period of time then I thought.

So now what I do is pull up a chair in front of a mirror and sit there holding the gun. I normally start off just talking into the mirror about all of the reasons that I am a complete piece of shit and deserve to die. It was starting to feel a little bit practiced so I've really been trying to go through and explain to myself why I am such a failure and a fuckup.

I usually move on to all of my failed attempts of bettering myself, past and present and why I will never succeed at getting better.

It's difficult but I think over time I will wear myself down. If I have time left over I will hold the gun to my head or just visualize shooting myself.

In a fucked up way I feel the best when I am putting myself down during these sessions. It feels good to tell myself that I'm a piece of shit and that I deserve to die.
