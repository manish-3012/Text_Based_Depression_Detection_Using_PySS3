Trying to find a reason to staySo just to keep things simple, Iâ€™ve been suicidal for all my adult life. I attempted roughly 10 years ago and failed. I then swore I would wait it out til I was 30, and now Iâ€™m 31.

I have no friends or family to speak of. I work essentially by myself 10 hours a day, 7 days a week. If my mother found out I killed myself, likely weeks after the incident sheâ€™d likely be more inconvenienced than upset, and thatâ€™s the only person it would really affect.

So I guess at this point Iâ€™m just trying to figure out why I should stay.


Edit: wow, thanks for all the downvotes and rude messages. Really helps
