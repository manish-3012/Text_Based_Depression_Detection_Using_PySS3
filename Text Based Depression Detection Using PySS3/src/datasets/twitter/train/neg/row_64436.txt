HopelessCan't leave home due to anxiety, psychiatrist abandoned me and it is impossible where I live to get a new one, hospital denies me admission because they think i'm an attention seeker..

What point is there? At this point, I need to be in the hospital to get better. My anxiety controls my life and the depression and anger is crazy.
