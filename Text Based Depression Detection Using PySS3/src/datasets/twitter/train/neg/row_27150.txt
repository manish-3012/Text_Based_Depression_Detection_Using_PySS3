Just can't keep building myself up then dropping down and feeling like thisHey all, anyone else tired of motivating themselves, feeling like you've finally learnt to overcome this thing and are ready to move forward in life but then something happens and you are back having these thoughts?

Yeh well I was having a lot of anxiety as a kid but it's when I hit 20 and started balding that's when it really began. And there has been on and off peaks were it's crippled me from leaving my room.

Something so stupid as hair which I have tried drugs to bring my hopes up then didn't work. Tried seeing a therapist for a year feeling really good, dropped lots of addictions like gaming and porn and finally ready to move on with life - but now I am on exchange and these thoughts ave returned. I even got this SMP procedure but I still have a way of thinking about my head ... it's like I just don't want to let go of this pain.

And it feels like I will never let go so what's the point, right? My personal fixation is with hair but can anyone else feel the same with building/improving yourself then falling back down to square 1 and feels like you start again?
