Do you just feel worthless? Like utter shit and nothing will get better?I'm sure that the majority of people in this subreddit has either posted here before and now comes to help... or honestly, you're just here to help.   


First, I want to say thank you to everyone who has been around for a while. You guys might be part of the reason I'm still here and if you are then you might remember when I came here a year ago. I was suicidal after just being diagnosed with Crohn's disease and thought my whole life was over. I felt as though nothing was left, I felt like I was a good person and I was being punished and many of you chimed in, so, thank you. 

It was this subreddit who helped me stay strong, people here are full of love and experience. I was in a dark state, so please if you're feeling down, post here in Suicide Watch, let your feelings flow, be raw. There are people who will be here to help with advice and you can always call the suicide hotline: Call 1-800-273-8255   


You're never alone even if you feel like it, I promise.
