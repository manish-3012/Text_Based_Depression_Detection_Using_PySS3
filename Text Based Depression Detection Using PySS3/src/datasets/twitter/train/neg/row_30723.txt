I am having troubleToday, for the third time in my life, I have to admit that depression has won over myself.  on sunday i tried to kill myself. Hang myself but the piece that i was hanging from, it broke. Scared, i called my gf, when she came and saw what was happening, she got scared and left me. i can't do this anymore, i can't stop thinking that i ruined my life and i don't know what will be of me. tried to contact friends but they rejected me, scared that they couldnt help. my best friend ignored me, left me on seen. i have nobody and i miss her
