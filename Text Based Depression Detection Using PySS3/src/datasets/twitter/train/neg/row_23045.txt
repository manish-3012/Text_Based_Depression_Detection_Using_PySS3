this is my goodbye for gavinthis was always my favorite part of the day.
you're napping, always ends up with one of your arms around your head, the sunlight shinning on you through the blinds... you just look so peaceful and pure and beautiful.. 
i truly love you gavin reece.
with all the heart i have left.
you're my best friend
my soul mate
i'm sorry for every mistake i've made with you; and i hope you can forgive me for the way i was in the start of this.
i'm sorry for the stress, the arguments and the lies. it wasn't to ever hurt you, or be unfaithful.. nothing like that.. from the second you kissed me and just stared into my eyes i knew i loved you gavin.
more than i thought i ever could love another person
the past week or so, when you fall asleep, i've been staying up and crying.. i am such a burden, an embarrassment idk
i hope you can find someone pure gavin
someone who won't change you for the worse, and make it all harder for you.
i hope your life gets simpler, more quiet.
i hope you pass and get your license..
i hope you never remove my name tattood on your leg, at least i hope it won't be out of hatred or a new girlfriend..
i love you gavin reece.
i won't stop loving you.
please don't forget me.
