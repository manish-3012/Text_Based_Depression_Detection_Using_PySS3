Overwhelmed...First of all, I have suffered from clinical depression my whole life, but lately it's been getting serious. I sit in class and at work wondering what would happen if I were to die. Would anyone care? It seems like nobody would. From stupid decisions that I have made, family members resent me, I have lost all my close friends, the only ones I could really trust to talk to and get help from. 

I'm overwhelmed with work, school, and other important things. I have gotten about 20 hours of sleep in the last 3 weeks. I can't handle it anymore but there's no way out of it.

I can't keep trying to convince everyone I'm fine when inside I have become nothing. I feel worthless, and all the pain and turmoil I'm going through doesn't seem worth it.
