Having trouble helping suicidal siblingI recently discovered my younger sibling is suicidal. You would have never known. I spoke to him once about it, but didn't mention he was suicidal, just said I cared for their mental health. But I don't know how to get myself to speak about it again and it is bothering me 24-7. People who are suicidal, does somebody reaching out help a lot? how should I go about it without making them feel forced to share anything, or without making them feel like their "cover" is blown? I'm sick to my stomach over how hard it is for me to simply check up on someone I love but I feel like I am bothering them and will make things worse? Can that be true? Thank you for any advice.
