RANT I THINKcall me an attention whore for posting here often but idc its the best place

i'm tired of this shit.... tired of being tired and now im motivated to do something

i know i have to do something but im scared i'll survive and also before you think 'oh no go ask for help go therapy' bullshit you better dont because my situation is shit and i cant fix it its unfixable i cant do shit

omg its so scary to think about surviving because of my friends and familys reaction not sadness bccuz i dont care about them anymore i just dont want them to laugh at me because they hate people who commit suicide
