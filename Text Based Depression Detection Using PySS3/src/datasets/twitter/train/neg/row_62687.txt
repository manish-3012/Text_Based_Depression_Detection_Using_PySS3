Can't work up the courageThis is my first time ever posting on Reddit so I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong. I've been suicidal for 5 years now (with varying levels of intensity) but in the last few days I've had more close calls than I've had in all the years I've felt this way. The trouble is I've never been able to work up the courage to just do it. I've got the means, I've got a plan, I've got a note, but I just can't go through with it. 

I should clarify, I'm not here looking for help on getting the courage to do it. I already know I'm too scared too, but I also can't bring myself to get help. I've had too many fruitless attempts at getting help. Is there anyone else on here living in or who has lived in this limbo that maybe has tips on keeping yourself alive?
