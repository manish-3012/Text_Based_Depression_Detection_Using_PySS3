Suicidal thoughts for being different?I donâ€™t relate to what people say in general.  Why did my life experiences have to be an outlier? 

I wish I was a commoner. Wouldnâ€™t life be so much more happier if I was just like everyone else? I canâ€™t share my feelings and opinions, since most of society wouldnâ€™t understand. 

Pm support is appreciated.
