I think I'm ready to die ?!I guess everyone though about suicide before, and I did too, but today was the first day I felt no emotion connected to it. 

I usually felt sad or overwhelmed or like everything's just 'too much'. But I've been thinking lately and I've always had this 'waiting room' vibe to my life. Studying didn't really do anything for me, it never felt like I was achieving anything or that there was a purpose to what I'm doing, it mostly annoyed me and felt like I was just passing time. I'm currently studying English and we mostly write 'research' papers on ridiculous topics like 'rap song lyrics and their deeper meaning'. I mean I get it but it seems so unnecessary and pointless to rephrase what other people said about things that could or can't be connected to the topic. 

Working part time just annoys me as well, even though I really like my coworkers and it's a nice environment. Still nothing really gets to me and it all seems like time and life's passing and I just don't belong in it. When I had these thoughts before I was mostly sad, but now I feel content about it. I've tried so many things, so many therapists, prescribed drugs and even a mental institution (after suicide attempt), but it seems a bit pointless and a waste of time. I feel like I lost myself on the way somewhere, I was a very excited and happy person once. I wanted a big family and a house with a dog and all the stupid stereotypical things. I thought about doing something about it, trying to get what I once wanted. But I would feel terrible if I'd bring a child into this, what if I'd still be this way, what if my child knew? I don't want to be selfish.

Now my BF left for university and I sat down with my laptop and suddenly it hit me, I could hang myself. And I felt nothing, I wasn't scared or sad, I was content and I felt nothing. 

I've never felt this way about it, maybe this means I'm finally ready to die?
