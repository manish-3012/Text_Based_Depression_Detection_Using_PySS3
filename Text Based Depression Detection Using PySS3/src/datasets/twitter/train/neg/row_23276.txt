Tried to kill myself today but I was weakI don't even know if someone will read it or not, but I need to vent somewhere. Today I tried to hang myself but when I started to feel pain, I stopped. I was weak and I want to try again but I don't have the strength for that, I don't think it'll work.

I feel so alone and want to end it, but I feel bad for my mom and dad and baby sister, I don't know what to do
