I think I've finally hit "rock bottom"I've been taking more of my meds than I should have the past week or so. My parents found out cause I've been in a bad depression/crying all the time. I don't think I'm going to be able to get any help, meds to help me through this - my mom just told me my punishment is to suffer through the next 2 weeks without the pills that I now really  really need so badly. I want to disappear. I'd end it all right now if not for knowing how much that would completely break my loved ones hearts - my mom would probably try to kill herself too.. They tell me they don't hate me, but I hate myself enough for 1000 people.. I feel like the worst person ever to exist. I'm going to just try staying out of the way and not bother anyone by locking myself in my room.
