goodbyemy boyfriend checked into the hospital friday night and the last thing he told me was when he gets out, heâ€™s killing himself. 

I begged him to take me with him and he told me no and hung up, I havenâ€™t spoken to him since. 

I called the hospital today and they told me he was discharged, his phone is off, and I canâ€™t get ahold of his brother. 

Iâ€™m a mess. this world is not worth living in without him. Iâ€™ve never loved someone like this before. I canâ€™t take it. 

he didnâ€™t even say goodbye.
