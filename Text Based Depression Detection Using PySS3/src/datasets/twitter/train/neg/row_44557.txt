Every day is a struggleSometimes I feel like the weight of my anxiety, depression, bpd, shitty behavior, regrets and loneliness actually make it hard to breathe. I feel physically exhausted. I need a break so badly but it doesnâ€™t let up, I canâ€™t enjoy time with people because I feel too guilty and I isolate myself which definitely makes it worse. Help please.
