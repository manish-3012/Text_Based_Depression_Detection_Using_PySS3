Havenâ€™t self harmed in a while but feeling very actively suicidal.I donâ€™t really wanna elaborate too much but last December I attempted suicide and survived them a bunch of other shit happened that almost killed me. For example I got in a bus crash one week, the next week my bus barely missed a train then COVID happened. I pretended to recover but I donâ€™t think I have. I have a lot of past trauma that Iâ€™m dealing with (feel free to read my previous posts and comments about it) , and Iâ€™m still living with the same person who caused the trauma. Plus Iâ€™m failing all my classes, and I really want to go to college. Especially an Ivy League one but I donâ€™t have the money for that so Iâ€™d need a scholarship and Iâ€™ve already failed 2 1/2 years of high school. Even though I have an IQ of 128 and am told Iâ€™m smart, Iâ€™m obviously not applying myself and my mental health is really getting in the way. I also found out I have a dangerous, possibly fatal heart condition. Im living way below the poverty line so I have a job however thatâ€™s affecting my health but Iâ€™ll be stuck in this house, more poor than I already I am, if I donâ€™t have it. I feel trapped and broken. And Iâ€™m trying to hide it, but Iâ€™m one of the few people that knows Iâ€™m not okay. Or maybe I am/was okay but Iâ€™m so used to being not okay that I self-sabotage. Idk but Iâ€™m really suicidal and need someone to talk to. Thank you so much. â¤ï¸
