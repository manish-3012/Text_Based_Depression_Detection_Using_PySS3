How to prepare to dieWhat are some things I should take care of before leaving. Obviously wiping my computers and stuff like that, throwing away and giving away a bunch of things. I plan to sign my car title to a friend as well. I don't think I'm going to bother with writing a note because most people know I've been really depressed for a long time and think it's a joke, and why would they care anyways really. I'm not looking for reasons why I shouldn't do it, or how life will get better or any other lies like that. Just ways to make the end of my life less of an annoyance than it already is for those around me.
