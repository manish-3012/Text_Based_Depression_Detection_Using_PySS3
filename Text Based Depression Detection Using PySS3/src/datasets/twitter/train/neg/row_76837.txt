They just don't know how lucky they are I wish we could trade lives for 2 weeksI hate my life I'm a short unattractive male and always wish I had better social I've made so many stupid decisions That still effect me to this day like the most recent one when I didn't take school seriously and didn't get things done early now I'm sitting in classes with freshman not in advanced classes so no luck getting into the colleges I want to go to straight out of high school and 85% of the reason I hate being short and unattractive is because I feel like I'm missing out everybody always says it enjoy it while it last but I'll never enjoy being young or old the girls at my school are so good looking not even joking but that's probably because it's texas I doubt they'd ever give a guy like me a chance so and honestly It's just women it's my whole life that's the problem I just wish I wasn't so much of a pussy if I wasn't I'd be able to kill myself with a knife or jump off something I'm waiting until i get old enough to get a gun because I know all it takes  is thoughts like these and I'll surely do it now that I'm confident in That's all I had to say Wish me deathâœŒðŸ½ðŸ¤¯ âš°ï¸
