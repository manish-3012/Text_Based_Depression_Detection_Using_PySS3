Being trapped on EarthI hate it when someone says that I survived my suicide attempts because I have a purpose, or when I'm told that if I wanted to be dead, I would be dead. Thing is, I desperately tried to end my life using any means I had available to me. I don't care to live anymore. 

While I was inpatient at a psychward, my family said that I had 2 weeks to move out of the house. They don't want to come home and have a dead daughter. Thing is, being alone is the last thing I need. I planned to end it once I had my own place. Guess I don't have many days left... I wrote a suicide contract thinking they would let me stay. It didn't help. I regret doing it now. Just want this pain to be over with. I'm tired of this life and I hate feeling like I'm trapped on Earth.
