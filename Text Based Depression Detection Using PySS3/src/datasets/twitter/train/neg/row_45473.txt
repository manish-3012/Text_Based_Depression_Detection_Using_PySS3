SOS.I feel like I don't deserve to feel what I'm feeling at the moment. I've got loving parents, friends who care a great deal about me, and many hobbies. I haven't been doing well at school and I can't seem to understand why I simply cannot focus and aim to achieve good grades. Maybe it's because I'm from a pretty competitive country and everyone is constantly fighting to outdo each other in terms of everything (e.g. academics, sports) and I'm quite a lazy person, so I don't work as hard as others. Of course, there are other factors like me giving up because no matter how hard I worked in the past, I still received very average results. I feel that I shouldn't be so ungrateful because I'm so blessed and throwing everything away would be so immature of me. Despite everything, I feel so empty and unhappy inside...I love so many people and it breaks my heart to think about how they would feel if I actually do the deed. But the thought of jumping seems so easy and enticing now, especially since school is starting in a couple of days and I really do not want to deal with that now, but I feel so shitty about how I'm acting. Am I really a greedy and ungrateful brat? After all the sacrifices everyone has made for me...also, I'm really worried about my family because they believed that I was okay after a huge meltdown back in September. I feel like a huge burden, and I really can't take this anymore. That's why I'm planning to do it tonight...sorry guys...and thank you
