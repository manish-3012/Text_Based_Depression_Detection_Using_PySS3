I was made wrong.Iâ€™m beginning to think I was made wrong, nothing about me makes sense I am in so much emotional pain that no one should be forced to deal with. Do to the emotional Hell Iâ€™ve been in I missed out on most of my life and have become bitter and resentful of most people. I question why a loving God would allow such a being to exist, I am just so tired of this turmoil and want peace or just nothing.
