I just can't..I have been depressed basically my whole life, the bullying didn't help one bit. I am 20, I have a daughter who's 6 months old. I love her to death. She's my world. I'm still dealing with my post Partum depression and I just recently quit my job because I don't trust anyone to watch her other than My fiancÃ©e. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. Nothing helps, I also have anxiety so that's an add on bonus. My fiancÃ©e gets mad and I feel like it's my fault. Honestly I feel like we are growing apart. I feel like he doesn't want me anymore. I don't have anyone to talk about this to. If I tell my fiancÃ©e he just gets upset. I just can't. I feel like I'm not good anymore but I look into my daughters eyes and I cry. I can't leave her. I can't stay here. I'm stuck. I'm scared to even commit suicide. I honestly want to live. I'm just really depressed.
