Possibly just destroyed any chance of success and happiness in my lifeI got a 60 on my 2nd biochemistry exam. How is this even happening. I studied a lot for that test and actually felt confident. I'm fucking intelligent as hell and managed to get a mother fucking 33 on my mcat. I should not be having trouble with this. Now I have a C in the class and have to do really well on the 3rd exam otherwise I'm fucked. I'll end up with a C, destroy my already borderline GPA, and get rejected from med school. I don't fucking deserve this but whatevs, there goes any hope I had for a life. Yeah I know that shit happens but I already went through it in undergrad and improved my GPA dramatically towards the end and did spectacularly in grad school.I'm supposed to be better than this now but I've just shown these schools that nothing has changed and that I'm still subpar as a student. And if it doesn't work out, nothing is open. I have a masters from a shit school and little to really impress with other than some shitty publications. I just have to focus entirely on the 3rd exam and hope to the fucking heavens that I get an A, so I can come out of this class with a B, which would instead screw me over just a bit. I can't deal with this fucking failure. Thank god I have a wine bottle to calm myself down and not get into a depression.
