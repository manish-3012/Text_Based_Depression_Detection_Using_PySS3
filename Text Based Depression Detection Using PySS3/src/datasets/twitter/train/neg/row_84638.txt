Please talk to me.Things just refuse to work out for me. My life completely fell apart 4 years ago, and it hadn't been going well for a few years before that. I moved in with my parents almost 2 years ago and I'm in my mid-thirties. I went from being able to take care of myself and make progress toward the life I wanted, but now I am completely helpless. I just got off the phone with my brother who has been a raging jerk to me for the last month or so (well, more than usual). I confronted him about his behavior and he just blew me off. I don't know anyone in my area (and frankly don't want to because I'm afraid of how they'll treat me). I can't get a job even though I'm well educated and have plenty of job experience. I've been trying for the last three days to spark a discussion here on Reddit on some of the subs I usually go on, and nothing. Just short, throw away comments and nothing to engage with.

Please just talk to me.
