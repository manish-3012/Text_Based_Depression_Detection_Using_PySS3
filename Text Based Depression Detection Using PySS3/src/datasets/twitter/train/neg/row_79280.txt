Getting abused by my girlfriendI was sent here from another sub so here's the same op

I don't have a desire or purpose anymore. My hobbies don't fulfill and even my dream since birth pretty much doesn't have any more allure.

My friends tell me how ugly and shit I am. They told me to go through with it when I was 16 but I was too afraid so was institutionalized instead when I told my parents. Now they continue to give me that idea, and my girlfriend does too.

She keeps hitting me or yelling at me when I forget something or do something wrong even though I have a lot of stress between working and being a math major so I sometimes forget to get the right stuff from the store. Last time she threw a knife at me and made me cry because I forgot to get her new tampons on the way home from a 16 hour day.

She keeps telling me how shit I am as a person whenever I do these mistakes and it pushes me to cry almost every night. I try to work hard and be a good bf but I can't necessarily always keep everything in mind and deal with everything that's on my plate.

Clearly I am worthless and these people want me to go, so I will. I just want to know how I can minimize their suffering in the aftermath.


I don't really know what to do, I cried to some of my friends about the situation and they all just called me a pussy and laughed at me so I'm very alone.
