drunk alone every nighti thought leaving home would be the hard part but living with myself is the real fucking battle.
i cannot love and be loved. the hate and the pain consumes me i canâ€™t escape the pain, even with all the money wasted on drugs i canâ€™t escape the pain. my existence is shrouded in guilt and shame. and iâ€™m all alone. all alone trying to run away from myself. all alone. i hope i die a slow, painful death, with no one by my side. i was only ever meant to be a sad story
