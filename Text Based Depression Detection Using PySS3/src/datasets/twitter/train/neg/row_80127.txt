I feel aloneWhile I was in the car coming back from my internship today, my mom asked me "are you happy" I said "why"? She said "You never look happy" then she told me "stop taking things so seriously" "to laugh, and try to smile and be happy" I just answered her "okay". But I don't know how to be happy. I don't want to take the time to give my entire life bio, but my life has been surrounded by toxic, negative people for a while, including my family. My mind is stuck with the assumption that everyone in the world is like this, so I have no hope of a better life. I don't know how to feel, I feel numb and alone. I don't want to be like this forever. I feel like I will.
