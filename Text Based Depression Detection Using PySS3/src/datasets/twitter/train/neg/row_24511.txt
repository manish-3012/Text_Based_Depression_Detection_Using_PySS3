Advice neededI've been more depressed than usual these last two years and managed to alienate all my friends behaving like a selfish asshole. 
I'm trying to find a way to to apologize for and explain my awful mood without telling anyone that I'm thinking about suicide all the time. I just want people to think I'm normal.

In the past I managed to keep up a cheerful facade but I don't have the strength anymore. Any advice would appreciated. Thanks
