Can I just talk to someone?I have been depressed for years now...bullied in school(still am even in high school), abused by my parents which have a super short temper, and excluded in school.  I always have thoughts like, "Why not just end it" and others which usually make me break out crying usually when i am alone, but when i'm at school i just put my head down and try to stop.  
I just dont understand why i feel this way and i want it to stop, because i have felt down and depressed for years.  I just want to talk to someone who knows what im trying to say, i just always feel sad and thoughts of suicide subconsciously go though my head
