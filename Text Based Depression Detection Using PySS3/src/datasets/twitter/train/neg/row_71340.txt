Constantly thinking of suicide. Sorry for rambling.Iâ€™m always thinking about killing my self. Every day these thoughts are on my mind, like a song stuck in my head. But my life is good right now, things have gotten better.. so why am I still so miserable? Am I just incapable of being happy? Iâ€™m missing so much fuckin school, everyone there talks about me behind my back. No joke. Iâ€™m a fucking outcast, even the people I trusted left after they found out about my mental illnesses. I really just want to kill myself. The only place I felt safe was in the mental hospital and I canâ€™t even afford that anymore. Iâ€™m on so much pills, but it all still hurts.. Iâ€™m constantly breaking into tears. All my suicide attempts failed and I canâ€™t talk about it to anyone except to strangers on the internet. 

I think Iâ€™m just broken.
