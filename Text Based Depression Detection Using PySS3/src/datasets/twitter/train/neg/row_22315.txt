Please Help MeBack again on this subreddit again, and I need help. I've been feeling suicidal for 2 years and tried to take my own life twice, and I'm thinking of trying again very soon. I have no meaning in my life, nothing I do will ever matter or be remembered no matter how much I try. I've come to you, my peers, because I feel most comfortable amongst my own kind. I know other people have much better reasons than I do but still, I need your help.
