Can't be with the girl I love, ready to end itShe's perfect for me. We are literally the same in almost every way. The first time we hung out we stayed up until 6AM talking. As someone who is lonely and depressed without many friends, I was smitten. She's had problems in her life too that we can relate on, something that is really hard for me to with anyone else. She's into nerdy stuff, while also being into outdoorsy things, motorcycles, and art/poetry. On top of her being a perfect match for me, she's incredibly beautiful and attractive, way out of my league. Despite all this, she says she has feelings for me. So why am I making this post? She's married and we both agreed it's best to just not see each as a result. 

I went to a gun store the other day to look at handguns. It takes 20 minutes to walk out with a gun, a weapon capable of ending this pain. I never drink, but the past two days in a row I've gotten wasted at work so that I don't have to go home and cry. I just sat in my car for 30 minutes in complete agony, screaming in pain. I've been depressed and suicidal most of my life and I've never felt this bad. 

I'm ready to die.
