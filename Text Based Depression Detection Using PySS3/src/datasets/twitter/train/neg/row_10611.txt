No Idea why I feel this way right now, but I don't want to live anymore.Hello there.

There's no need to worry that I actually wanna kill myself, I just feel like I have nothing left to live anymore.

I had a date last night with a lovely girl that lifes 2 hours away from me. To get to her, would cost me about 120 bucks, and I don't have that kind of money laying around here... this depresses me, because I really like her, but that's not the main issue here.

I'm unemployed since I left school in 2004, mainly because I didn't want to work, or didn't get the chance to do so. I hated everyone in my early teens and 20's, and I didn't want to get abused like I was in school.

In school, I got bullied by at least 4 People every day for 4 years, and this messed me up big time.
There was nothing done against this, people didn't have the same mentality as they do now, and now I'm damaged.

I tried to seek out help, but I seem really happy when i'm around people, and I am, but there are no people left in my life, except my mother, who hates every girl I get with, or try to be with, and pressures me into working, and If I get an offer, she refuses to give me money for the train/bus or whatever I need to get there.

I got no RL friends left, I never really had any friends, and I feel alone and terrible.. I don't have anyone to talk about anymore, and It kills me from the inside out...

The next thing is, that my mother abuses me too, she forces to steal food and other things for her benefit, because I have no income.. This is really hard to talk about, and I never told anyone this before.

I feel like someone is stealing my soul, and I just wanna end it before it's too late.
