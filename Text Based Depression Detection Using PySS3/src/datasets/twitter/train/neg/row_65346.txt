I see all the sadness in here...and all I can think is that it sounds like an upgrade to the sheer apathy I feel about everything. I just don't care about anything. I can easily (...probably) get work, but don't want to, I don't care about feeling good, or happy, or secure; I don't care about friends (though I have a couple that I haven't yet ghosted still), and I barely care about family.

I don't get any of it.
