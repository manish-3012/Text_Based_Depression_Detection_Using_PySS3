I took a drive this eveningToday was not the best day. I had gone into work only to have (from what I can tell) a severe anxiety attack that I ended up fainting from. My best friend got a promotion in front of me, while I didnâ€™t even get set up an interview because I need to â€œbe a better personâ€. I donâ€™t have a girlfriend or anybody I feel like I can go to about how I feel. I sometimes really want to die and chug on pills until I canâ€™t breath any longer. Iâ€™m a fucking mess.

I went to drive tonight because sitting at the apartment was only making my head worse. The drive didnâ€™t help and I just wanted to drive off the road. I wanted a cop to stop me just so I could tell them I want help. I want someone to care, but I also want this pain to stop.
