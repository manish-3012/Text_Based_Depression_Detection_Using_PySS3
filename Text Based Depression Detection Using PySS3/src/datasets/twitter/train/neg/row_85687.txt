I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m feelingThrowaway because yeah. 

Backstory is that Iâ€™m long distance with my boyfriend, and head over heels for this boy. We plan to spend our entire lives together. We both know the feelings mutual and that we could never be happier than we are with one another. Heâ€™s the absolute light of my life

We both struggle with mental health, although I talk to him about it more than he does with me. Heâ€™s not used to opening up, although heâ€™s gotten a lot better at it over the past year. 

Sometimes, he needs his space alone, and I get that. I really do. However, itâ€™s now been a day and a half since I heard from him. And before he left, he didnâ€™t tell me he just needed space or some timeâ€”he said â€œidk why you think of me of so perfect or good or specialâ€ and that was it

And now Iâ€™m so fucking worried and donâ€™t know how to handle myself. 

Part of me is telling myself to relax and that Iâ€™m sure heâ€™s okay and just needs time or space or a day or two to calm his mind down, but the other part of me is so so scared about if he might do something to harm himself

And now my anxiety is off the charts and I donâ€™t know how to handle it and i havenâ€™t hurt myself yet but I keep feeling the urge to and Iâ€™m so fucking scared you guys
