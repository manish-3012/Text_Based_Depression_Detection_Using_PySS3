Everything has gone wrong and nobody is here for meI'm 16 years old. Today, my life has a 90% chance of ending. I live with my father (to whom I am completely dependent) and his abusive, manipulative, terrible girlfriend who has ruined both of our lives and continually likes to put me through hell. She's stolen all of his money and has driven him to drink. When he's drunk, he's passed out 95% of the time and yelling the other 5%. He's never violent but he's the only thing I have and he's gone when he's drunk. I know his girlfriend will try to get him thrown on the streets, and she's called the police and a social worker twice already. I can't call the social worker because she'll send me to foster care (which is the only thing that would make me more miserable than I am now) and I have no options left. I have nothing to live for, my father is drinking himself to death and there's nothing left for me. My only support is across the country and, since his girlfriend has stolen all of his money, we can't get out of this situation.

I have the means to painlessly and quickly end my life. There's no way out for me, but I at least want to have some human interaction before I go. I'm sorry, that sounds horribly selfish, but I've been nothing but a selfish loser since day one anyway so it's not anything new.
