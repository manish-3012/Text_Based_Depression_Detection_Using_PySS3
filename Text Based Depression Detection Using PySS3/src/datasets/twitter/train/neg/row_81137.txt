Sing me to sleep.I'm tired and I want to go to bed.

I don't want to grow old.  I don't want to ever be 50.  
Or 40.  Or even fucking 30.

I'm in a constant state of being unable to do anything.  I cant find a decent job.  I can't go back to school.  I don't even know what the fuck I would study anyway.  I had my heart set on a music career.  That's never going to happen, I'm learning.

I have a sizable online following.  I plan on releasing one more album...if I can somehow manage to record it.  Maybe I'll hop in my car and do one more tour.  That's all I want.  Then I'll throw myself off a bridge.

Problem is, I can't even write anymore.  Every song I write is about death.

Death used to be so scary.  But now, I can sit down and close my eyes and turn off my thoughts and almost imagine the serenity of nonexistence.  No more worries.  No more stress.  No more fear.  

Silence.

I have an amazing man.  Things were so perfect.  Now he has to deal with my unresolvable depression.  He shouldn't have to.  

One more go around and then I'm gone.  
I've come to terms with my fate and I'm fine with it.
