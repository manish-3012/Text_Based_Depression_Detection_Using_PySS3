I don't have a future. [Tw: rape, incest]Hello. I'm not really sure why I'm posting here. I've tried reaching out for help and getting connected with resources, but with no luck.

I was raped and abused by my sibling for a decade (ages 5-15) and never received counseling because I felt like my life was in danger. I'm trying to speak to a therapist about what happened and get connected with resources. I've done the first part (speaking to a therapist) but I haven't had any luck with the second part. I'm not sure what I really need as far as resources, but I just want to stop feeling like I have to kill myself all the time. I'm tormented by flashbacks and the only way I can get them to stop is by thinking about killing myself. 

Please if anyone has any ideas that could help, I really could use some.
