I donâ€™t know what to doMy friend wants to kill herself... I donâ€™t know what to do... Iâ€™m slowly giving up... please anyone help me... sheâ€™s been verbal abused by her parents and she never told me what happened at her old school but by the way she says it, it sounds like hell... she doesnâ€™t want hugs because it â€˜remindsâ€™ her of what happened at her old school. Iâ€™m running of things to say, Iâ€™m getting desperate please, anyone. I donâ€™t want her to die. She cuts herself. Sheâ€™s 12 please anyone...
