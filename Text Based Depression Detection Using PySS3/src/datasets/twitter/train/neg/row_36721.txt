What is your biggest fear after death? Mine is hell.I would say the #1 reason I haven't successfully killed myself yet is my fear of hell.

I don't necessarily believe hell is a real place, in fact I would consider myself an atheist of all things, but the fact that millions of other people have, for thousands of years, makes me wonder. 

I'm afraid of hell more than I am afraid of any suffering I am forced to endure on Earth because I know that all of the social rejection and endless hours spent alone as my body breaks down and decays over the years is nothing compared to the thought of true eternal torture.

Nothing compares to that.

On the other hand, I don't want to go to heaven because I'm afraid to suffer. I don't want to go to heaven **either**.

If God is the one who put us here, then God is the one who is allowing us to be tortured. Therefore, God is evil too.

If you have read Paradise Lost by John Milton he suggests that God and Satan both have armies of angels awaiting a second battle for the throne of God. (The first one Lucifer and his fellow rebel angels lost and were sent to hell for it.) 

In the meantime, the truly evil go to Satan, swelling his ranks of warriors, and the good go to heaven, becoming God's soldiers.

I don't want to be a soldier.

For either of them.

I don't want to hear the words God or Satan ever after I am dead.

It's so boring.

There are so many more religions out there with their own colorful pantheons, that I just can't believe in the Christian concept of the after life. 

But here I am. I was raised in a Christian community, and I will never be able to shake this fear of Hell.

What is your biggest supernatural fear regarding an after life?
