I'm confident in finishing the job tonight.Note Im 17. I've drank 2 bottles of wine tonight so apologies for the sloppy grammar. In 2016, I don't remember the month, I jumped off the Manhattan bridge. I was so confident it would kill me but no, collapsed lung, fractured rib and shattered tail bone. 6 months wheel chair bound and I had to learn how to walk again. After all that healing I was put in a mental hospital for 2 months just to come home and get "if anyone has been to a treatment center you'd understand the term" gooned to Newport academy. 3 months of refusing  to work I was sent to a RTC in NC. Maybe 6 months in I tried killing myself again just so I can leave the damn place. Put into another hospital and went to wilderness. Wilderness was the greatest thing to happen to me a long time. After completing wilderness I was sent back to the RTC in NC and eventually completed it. After 2 years of being in treatment I went home and back to school in late 2018. 

I was doing so good until last year of December. Depression hit me like a truck and I completely gave up on school. My parents who are so supportive and have dealt with my shit for years eventually just gave in and have been letting me stay at home doing absolutely nothing in hopes of me getting my GED. I know that won't happen. I met this wonderful girl online whom I love so much. I haven't had that much love for someone in years. I'm not worth a single cent in this world. if anyone know what I've done in my life you'd hate me. I don't deserve a painless death. I'm gonna swallow hundreds and hundreds of Tylenol and ibuprofen. If I throw up im gonna take more. My liver is going to shutdown and I will suffer because I deserve it. Before I do any of that I will be carving the 7 deadly sins into my body because I've done all of those. I already have Greed carved in my leg. Don't bother convincing me to stay or any of that shit. I don't even know why I shared this but I felt like I should.
