A weird feelingHi, I'm a young guy a junior in high school. I have just gotten out of the suicidal phase and I have a semicolon tattoo (stand against suicide ya know) and that is minimal backstory. I care for all I don't want suicide to be something that anyone comes too. But a guy I barely knew shot himself and my stomach is in knots idk why I feel bad or why this makes me feel like throwing up I didn't know him i sat with him at lunch we always joked he was cool not someone id known for any long amount of time but just the fact I knew him and no one knows who is suicidal always the happiest one it just feels like some weird fucked  up dream though and my question is, is it right for me to be feeling this bad about the guy when I was nowhere near as close to him as everyone else was?
