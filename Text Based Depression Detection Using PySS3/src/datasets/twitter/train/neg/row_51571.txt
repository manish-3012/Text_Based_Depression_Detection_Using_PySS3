Life is just a fucking slogIâ€™ve (22M) been depressed for almost a decade and had suicidal thoughts the last 3 years. I hate my life because the work I do in college isnâ€™t rewarding and itâ€™s all to get a job to survive and consume products until you forget youâ€™re miserable. Its all a big joke
