22 and wouldn't botter to get hit by a car3 years ago, I injured my knee while getting up on a beach (torn meniscus). The surgery (meniscus repair) didn't work, but it took a year for doctors to acknowledge, because it didn't appeared on the MRI. I had to get a second second last January where I learn it got worst (torn meniscus and cartilage defect). Because I had to compensate with my other leg, now both my knee are hurting and swelling if I stand. I am currently waiting for an MRI for my other knee. I cant go out, I used to do a lot of sports and I don't know if its gonna be possible anymore. I am beginning law school at a good uni in September, which is kind of my dream. I got involved in my student gov, models and stuff, had good job based on merit and some of my uni work could possibly be published in scientific journals. Still,  I feel like the best days of my life are behind me. Since I cant do much except staying home, doing my PT, school stuff and swim. More and more, I am thinking that ending my life soon wouldn't be that bad as my knee problems seems to get worst. Literally, I feel like my life quality is only gonna go downhill from here.  Help
