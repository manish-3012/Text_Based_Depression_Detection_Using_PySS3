I'm not suicidal, im just lonelyI have no friends, no real friends... It's always me who talk to them first. Never the other way around. I distance myself from them for a goos few weeks now. Guess who messaged me? Nobody. I never had a special someone. That's why im here. I have nobody to talk to about my problems. 

My parents, my father always calls me lazy, idiot, a mess. I had a dream to be a pilot. This is what he says about it "that face? Pilot?". I am now studying aircraft engineering. It's not going well. My first semester was solid then corona hit. My second semester was on online classes and it's fucked. I understood nothing. Im stressed. I want to postpone my studies but my father refused.(costs him money, why spend on your kid when you can buy 10k watches?!)  he blamed me for my performance. He's right tho. I started sleeping less during thw night, more during the day. Play games so i can forget who i am. Stay in my room as long as i could. What do my parents say about this? They tell me im lazy, stupid, a mess, a failure. Compared me to my siblings, to their friends childrens. 

I burst into tears every time i locked my doors before "sleep". I don't want to wake up and get out of bed. I play games to forget my pain. I don't think i deserve anything. I guess my dad is right, i am a failure. I always think that somewhere down the road, i might kill myself. It saddens me even more that i have this thoughts. I don't want to die like that. 

TLDR : I'm a failure, im sad and lonely.
