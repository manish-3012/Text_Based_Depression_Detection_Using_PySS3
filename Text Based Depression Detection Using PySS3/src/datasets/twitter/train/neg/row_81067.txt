I wish I could get helpIt's not from lack of trying, I was abused growing up and it's made me reclusive to the point I get panic attacks around streamers, I can't go out, I don't have money or insurance I can't talk to anybody and when I almost killed myself they sent me to a place that was supposed to help with everything but they did nothing and I Don't know where to go or who to ask I don't want to die I just want somebody to diagnose me so I can get the help I need
