Struggling with suicidal thoughtsI know that self diagnosed depression is one of the most obnoxious things to talk about, however, I've never really had the guts to come out and tell my parents that I've struggled with depression for about 4 years now (16 atm). Depression runs in the family quite a lot, in fact even my brother has struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. I never really wanted to tell my parents about it mainly because I felt like they may feel like failures as parents if both of their kids are depressed. (Ik it sounds dumb when I explain it like that, but it's really hard to explain) I would just keep going as I have been for a while now, but the thing is that I've been having extremely suicidal thoughts over the last week and they've only been getting worse, I've told friends, and they tell me the usual BS about "Oh you're so special! Please don't do it!" and "You have so much to live for!" I know that they can only do so much, but it just seems so legitimate. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but these ones are different, it's hard to explain exactly, but the main difference is that I'm not mad at anybody, and not particularly sad, but just kind of deflated and feel like I have nothing to gain from life anymore, it may seem weird but I've actually gotten into Christianity lately quite a bit, but the thought of leaving this world and going to heaven gives me much more comfort than anything else really. I'm not sure how to tell my parents about this and I'm very nervous to see how they react, any help is appreciated.
