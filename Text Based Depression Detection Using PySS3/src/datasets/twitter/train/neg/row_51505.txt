I turned 16 last weekI'm female. I turned 16 last week. I am in the middle of an asperger's diagnosis. I have anxiety disorder and am constantly miserable. I used to starve myself. I just generally hate myself.  I honestly have never really been happy. My parents never new how to deal with a kid with autism, which led me to be an absolute handful. I have never been able to make friends properly and am completely useless in social situations. I have no real friends at the moment. I spoke to my mum about how i felt about three or four years ago and i have been in therapy twice. I self harm and drink. I started cutting age 10, now i cut and burn myself. 

I have so much going for me: I'm planning to go to Oxford or Cambridge after college, but the idea of being stuck studying for years more just seems so dull. I definitely enjoy what i want to do but everything just seems so dull. Plus i've just been doing worse and worse in my subjects to the point where im not really considered that smart a lot of the time, or maybe i just dont see myself as good at anything.  I just dont really fancy being alive anymore. I dont really enjoy anything.  Video games are fun but i get bored so easily. I enjoy playing instruments, but again i get bored easily. I come home from school every day wanting to die. 

Ive been suicidal for about four years. Ive had a serious plan to kill myself for a year. I think this year is when im going to finally do it. My plan is to steal a bottle of alcohol, buy some rope,  cycle up to the woods near my town, down as much alcohol as i can, then hang myself. I want to do it soon but i doubt i will.
