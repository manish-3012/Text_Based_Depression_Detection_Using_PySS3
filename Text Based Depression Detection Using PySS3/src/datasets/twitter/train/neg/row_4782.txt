I'm having a rough time.Tdlr : transgender and completely abandoned by my friends.

I came out about a year ago, at first my friends were really supportive. We would go to the mall buy make up , etc.  Lately however I'm lucky if I can even get someone to respond to a messenger post. I work incredibly hard at my job, 55-. 60 hours a week as an assistant manager only to get yelled at the next day by manager for not doing enough. I suffer most night struggling to lawyer myself out of just ending it. But lately the arguments for continuing to go on for another day are falling flat. I zero friends seemingly and a job I hate.
