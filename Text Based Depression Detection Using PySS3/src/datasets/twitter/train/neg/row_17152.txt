driving at high speed into something  

I want to drive into a bridge abutment. Iâ€™ve been studying them and ideal locations. In northern climates, Iâ€™ve noticed that they surround them entirely with guard rails under the bridge. That is probably due to slippery roads, snow, etc. But in the southern climates, they donâ€™t do this. There will be guard rails sort of parallel to the highway. But in the median they are exposed. You can drive between them and hit the structure head on. Iâ€™ve found some where the grass in the median is flat and thereâ€™s a good straight part of the highway to build up speed. Iâ€™m going to do it on a dry night. I donâ€™t want the grass to be wet. You would slip around before getting to the target. I'm also going to do it at 3am when no one else is on the road. Donâ€™t want to hurt other drivers. I am going to keep my eyes open. First off you need to see to make it all the way to the target and going maybe 100 mph by my estimation. Then I just want to see it all just before it happens. I want to feel my body go limp and just start propelling forward to the steering wheel. I want to feel my body, mind, and soul just separate. I want to experience the full violence. This thought just brings peace to me.
