Itâ€™s only a matter of time. Only thing holding me back is my family.Nothing ever seems to go right for me. I try to be a good person and a nice guy to my friends and family but always end up getting dumped on. People have been messing with me and talking shit to me for as long as I can remember and it gets so fucking old. Iâ€™m the guy in the friend group that everyone gangs up on while I already have enough personal issues that I deal with all day everyday that are depressing enough. My mom is shoving going to college down my throat and that is completely overwhelming as itâ€™s so expensive and I also have very bad anxiety. 

Nothing in my life really seems to matter anymore as Iâ€™m confident I will end up hanging myself someday. Just wish I wasnâ€™t an only child for my parents sake.
