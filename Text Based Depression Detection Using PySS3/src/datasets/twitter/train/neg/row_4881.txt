I am grateful for you guys.I have long been posting many ridiculous threads here seeking help from you guys. I have mostly disregarded the comments, because my obsession is with the attention I get from posting. I know it's a horrible thing to say, but it's true. I have only ever wanted attention from you guys. And I have to apologize for abusing your kindness like that.

Tonight that ends. I have drank 7 16oz beers so far and taken 18 extra-strength Tylenol. I am dying. I can feel it.

I appreciate everything you guys have said to me. I truly hope that people will come here and choose to save themselves after your acts of kindness. Thank you, r/SuicideWatch. You helped me when I didn't deserve it. You encouraged me when no one else would. My death is not a reflection of your failure - it proves how much everyone here cares about every anonymous life. Mine just happened to be a failure.

Please don't stop doing what you are doing. It is important. You people save lives by being compassionate and understanding. Good night, everyone.
