What determines if you get a response?I am in crisis. I have been living in crisis, actually. Why is it that no one cares unless you scream "I'm gonna effing kill myself now, bye!"

Crisis lines, busy. Chat forums, nobody cares. I hate this needy little monster than I am becoming, but WTF?!?

Nothing I do gets any kind of response. Nobody gives a shit. I'm going to just kill myself.
