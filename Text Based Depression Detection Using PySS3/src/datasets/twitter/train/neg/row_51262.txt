What do I say?I recently found out that a close friend of mine attempted suicide, and I know that they will be out of the hospital soon. When I see them again, I really don't know what to say. I know that I should be there for them if they need any help, but I don't know how to treat them when I next see them.

This is the first time I have been confronted with suicide, and it has been such a shock, but I really don't know what to say or think because my mind is a mess.

What do I do.
