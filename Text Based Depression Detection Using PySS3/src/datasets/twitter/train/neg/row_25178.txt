I cannot do it anymore.Mine is a life replete with failure, squandered opportunity, and melancholy. I also cannot think coherently and cogently. Sleep is unavailing. I am becoming ever more bereft of desire and ambition. I cannot relate to people - including, however paradoxically, myself even. I do not feel free or autonomous.  I feel inadequate, disoriented, confused, and unknowing. Hate, disappointment, and hopelessness are other common emotions for me. I am a bad person.The Brooklyn Bridge is merely two train-rides away from me. This weekend, I may very well meet my end in the East River. I am tired of perseverating.
