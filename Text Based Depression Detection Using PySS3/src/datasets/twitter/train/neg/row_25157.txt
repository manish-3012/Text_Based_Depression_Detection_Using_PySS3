Do you ever get so depressed and jumbled and longing to say so much, that you donâ€™t know what to say at all? Thereâ€™s so much I wish I could say but I donâ€™t know how and itâ€™s pointless anyway.Itâ€™s not worth the effort to try to articulate. Nothing will change in this universe until I die. I have no control over anything. I am a passenger watching a terrible movie and feeing all the good and all the bad. Eventually itâ€™ll get worse and worse and then Iâ€™ll die, how enthralling. I hate god and I hate this existence I have been placed into. The only good things in my life are my wife, cats, food, warmth, plants, and video games. I donâ€™t think anyone understands me IRL, Iâ€™m so tired of everything. I hate working and I hate that this reality is set up this way.
