Still don't have a reason not to.I still have sleep apnea that resists treatment.  I am tired, worn out, EXHAUSTED everyday.  I have no job and will be evicted in a few days.  I am 49 years old.  Contrary to what is often claimed by suicide prevention, it doesn't get better, not this.  My only hope is death.
