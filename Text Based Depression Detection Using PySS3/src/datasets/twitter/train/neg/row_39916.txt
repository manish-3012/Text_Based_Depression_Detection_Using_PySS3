An unconventional attemptI wanted the nightmare to end, but I didn't want to be seen as selfish for killing myself. I didn't want my parents wondering where they went wrong, or what they could have done, thinking it was their fault.

I stopped taking my medication.

I've been on blood thinners for almost 15 years now since I had a DVT in my left leg. When things got dark I would occasionally think it would be easy to just swallow the whole bottle and bleed out. About a year ago, I realized there might be a better way. 

I stopped taking my meds. When I was first put on them I was told that there was a 90% chance I'd get another blood clot in the future. I figured a clot would go to my brain or my lung and It'd look like an accident, maybe even in my sleep. "Maybe he forgot to take it for a few days?" They'd say. Sure enough, after a couple of months I started to have shortness of breath, pain when taking a deep breath, and back pain. 

I didn't equate this to a blood clot right away because it wasn't how I was expecting it to happen or how it felt. I didn't know how it was supposed to feel. My parents could tell I was in pain and barely breathing. I couldn't sit properly, and I was breathing in very short shallow breaths. They insisted on taking me to emergency, and I agreed to go.

I'll never forget the look on my mom's face when I told her they found a blood clot in my lung. How I could have easily died. She'll never know I did it to myself, I could never bring myself to tell her. That would hurt her too much. 

I'm still as depressed as before, probably even more so now. I never really *wanted* to die, but every moment of every day is both physical and mental agony. I still don't know what to do. I'm young and living with a debilitating physical illness which has only ever gotten worse. There is no, "it gets better," me. All I see in my future is decades of anguish.
