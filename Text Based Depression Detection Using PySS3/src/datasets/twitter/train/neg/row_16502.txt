LonelyI lost everything Friday. I don't know if I should end my life right now. I feel like self harming but I don't want to let my best friend down. But obviously she doesn't care. That's why she left me right?? I don't know what to do anymore. I constantly feel empty, alone, scared, depressed, and suicidal. So to you all I want to ask for help, I don't know how to get better or to change. But right now suicide seems like the only way out to get better but I'm honestly scared of death. So in a last ditch chance to get better. This is my first post and I'm kinda nervous, So... Hi, would you like to be my friend?
