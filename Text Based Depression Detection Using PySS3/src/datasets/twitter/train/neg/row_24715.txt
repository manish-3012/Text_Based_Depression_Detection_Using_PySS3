How common are suicidal thoughts?I've done some searches, but could find nothing meaningful? I'm just curious as to what percentage of the population experiences suicidal thoughts? Is this common (and only a smaller amount of people act on it) or is it just relatively smaller?

I apologize if this is the wrong place to post.
