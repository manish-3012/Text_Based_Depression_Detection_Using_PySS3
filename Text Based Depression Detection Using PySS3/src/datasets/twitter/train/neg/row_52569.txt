The feeling is backDonâ€™t have the energy to write this in an engaging way but if anyone takes the time to read this, thank you.

Iâ€™m 28 years old. From age 12-23 I was suicidal until I got help and slowly learned how to function. I was on disability for 5 years for agoraphobia and ptsd.

I got a job and Iâ€™ve held it down for almost 3 years, managed to get off SSI. I got promoted to a higher manager position but after a year I had to step down because it was too much. I feel like a decent worker but my job is going nowhere. The money I make is barely enough to pay for where I live. Even after 3 years I make barely more than an entry level employee.

Today I accidentally missed my shift for the first time in a long time. My coworkers blew up my phone and are pissed/worried but I havenâ€™t replied to anyone. I feel nothing about it but sadness and shame. Iâ€™m also so exhausted. At the same time I donâ€™t know if I can handle looking for another job. I just feel like a fraud and a loser who canâ€™t handle being in the work force. I donâ€™t want to let anyone down. This job has represented stability for me for a long time

I have no family where I live. My whole family is on the opposite side of the country from me. Last year my dad suffered a heart attack that was almost fatal and lost his short term memory. Sometimes I want to go back to my family, but Iâ€™ve lived away from them for 6 years. Iâ€™m afraid that if I went back I would regress back to being as fucked up as I used to be.

Iâ€™m tired of trying to function every day in a life thatâ€™s going nowhere. Iâ€™m haunted by memories of my past and fear. Iâ€™m very lonely and donâ€™t know who to turn to. My sister is autistic and sometimes I think I might be too because Iâ€™ve always struggled with basic life things 

I just feel like a damaged person. I was in and out of mental institutions while I was on disability, I never want to go back to that. If my mom wasnâ€™t around I would probably go back to drugs but sheâ€™s the one person I really donâ€™t want to hurt like that. If she wasnâ€™t around I would consider suicide again. For now Iâ€™m just biding my time hoping I donâ€™t make people hate me :(
