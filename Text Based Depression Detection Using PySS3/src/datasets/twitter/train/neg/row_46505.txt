Fml.Why do the people I love the most make me feel worthless? My own family hates having me around, my mum never gives me a break, my sister couldnâ€™t give a shit if I was dead. I just wanna disappear, maybe forever. Iâ€™m done, Iâ€™m craving that rope around my neck. I honestly think Iâ€™m at the end of my road, nothing will ever get better.
