I donâ€™t want to live for 60 more years.I have this thing where whenever Iâ€™m one with nature, I remind myself that Iâ€™m 16 and Ive gone through so much already and that I donâ€™t want to be here another 60 years having to endure what life throws at me. I just donâ€™t want to be here plain and simple. I donâ€™t want to eat, go out, talk to anybody, pursue a career, etc. Iâ€™d rather just meet my fate sooner than later. I have an issue accepting that my life is real. I suffer from derealization/depersonalization disorder so when I say I feel like nothing around me is real I really truly mean it. I feel numb to everything around me. I feel like Iâ€™m just one with the hurdles of sheep living in this world we didnâ€™t ask to get put in. I donâ€™t know what mentality to have anymore.
