I'm so very selfish.I don't know why, but I thought things would get better after I talked to my family about my depression. Instead, now I see that they have to live with the weight of knowing I want to die. The only thing keeping me from stabbing myself in the chest is the knowledge that I'll make my family's lives worse, and I feel so completely selfish for even contemplating it. But it's the closest I feel to peace, so I'm really conflicted. Am I a bad person for even wanting this?
