I refuse to wake up in 30 years and still hate my existence.Iâ€™m glad I realized the fantasy people call life is nothing but death. And Iâ€™m glad I realized how pointless everything is at such a young age. I feel privileged to be in the mindset of eliminating myself. My hesitations are slowly fading and my plans are slowly unfolding. Very soon Iâ€™ll be another statistic. I fear dying but I also despise living. We will see which one of those passions outweighs the other.
