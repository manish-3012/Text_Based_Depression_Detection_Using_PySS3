I want to slip away quietly into the night and erase any memory i existedI am feeling low, i don't know what else to do right now. I had to delete my other account cause there was too much personal information on there so i thought i could be identified. I just need to be seen at the moment, for how i really feel. I have an exam this week i am not studying for. It's tomorrow, after i started seeing someone my life has gotten a little hard cause i have more responsibility. I don't think i want kids, i don't see how i will be able to take the pressure. I am reckless careless and the only thing that keeps me in check is work, i am studying to get a better job but it's going to take another year to get there. I find myself thinking, no one needs me, whats the point anymore, if i just fell away or ran away and disappeared things would be better. I know this would kill my family though and i don't want to leave them with pain, i wish i could just slip away quietly into the night and be forgotten.
