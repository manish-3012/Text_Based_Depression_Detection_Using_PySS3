I feel completely overwhelmed and trappedI'm 29 and studying to be an electrical engineer, I have a lovely fiance and we're financial stable with our own place, I have my own car, I'm employed as a math tutor as well and I'm healthy. I feel like I have this great life and don't/can't appreciate or enjoy any of it. 

I love the idea of being an engineer, and it's something I've wanted to do for a very long time, but good God do I fucking hate at least half the people I go to school with and I fucking hate how boring and repetitive the work is. I'm tired of instructors who barely speak english and can't even write an assignment without copious spelling errors and professors who couldn't give less of a shit about the students. I'm tired of feeling mediocre and stupid (I have a 2.7 GPA). I walked out of my last modern physics test with the worst grade in the class, and even then it was an improvement in score over the previous exam. When do I actually get to do something interesting for a fucking change? 

I've already dumped $25k into student debt and even if I did quit, I have no idea what I would do with my life. I've never thought of myself as doing really anything else. I'm so frustrated and angry and just overwhelmed by sheer **Despair** all I want to do is take my favorite pistol and put it in my mouth and just end this bullshit. I hate my life, I'm tired of not being able to enjoy or take any pride in my work, I'm tired of feeling like I can't relate to anyone or talk about my problems. I'm tired of feeling like a complainer who should just shut his mouth. 

I'm just tired. So tired. I'm under a mountain and I have no idea what I'm doing or where I'm going.
