I just...need emotional supportMy girlfriend of 3 months just broke up with me today at 4am. It turns out that after all we've been through, all the countless "I love you"s said to each other, was just a facade. She really did try and make it work but she just doesn't love me the same. But here I am, I got a job so we could eventually move in together down the line and now I'm just supposed to go to sleep, wake up and do that tomorrow like nothing happened? The one time I let myself loose and love someone they end up shattering my heart and my future plans...please...help the pain stop
