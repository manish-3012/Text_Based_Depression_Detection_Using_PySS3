I think i might kill myself tomorrow and i dont know what to doMaybe this is just a final cry for help, but i feel like I'm going to kill myself tomorrow. I keep thinking about it and i have it planned out. Im going to be really honest here and say that i dont want to die, i just want this pain to end. I'm torn between keeping myself self alive for the sake of my family and finally giving up. I want to give up so fucking bad. I dont know what to do. Maybe i should tell someone, but im afraid they'll make me go to the hospital again.

Im at the end of my rope. I've been trying so hard to get better with my depression/anxiety but nothing seems to work. I wake up every morning crying, and I'm still haunted by my past. There's something broken inside of me. It's been that way since i was a child. I'm only 21. Still young yet so ready to die. Inside I'm still a scared lonely kid. Im lost and i dont know what to do anymore.
