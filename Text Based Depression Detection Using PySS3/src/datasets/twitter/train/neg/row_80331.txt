I donâ€™t want to be in pain anymoreI donâ€™t actually want to die, but two years ago I suddenly began dealing with 24/7 chronic pain that is ruining my life. I have seen countless doctors and underwent countless invasive, painful treatments that didnâ€™t work. My conditions are supposed to be treatable, but for whatever reason nothing takes the edge off of mine. Iâ€™m only 24 and I canâ€™t live like this. Iâ€™m supposed to go in for another painful procedure tomorrow, but Iâ€™m so tired. I went from going on distance runs daily to it hurting to move. Iâ€™m so desperate to not being in pain anymore, but I donâ€™t know how to go through with it.
