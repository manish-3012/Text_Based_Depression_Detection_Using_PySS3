I want to kill myself right now but I'm so afraidAs the title suggest, I'm done, I have absolutely nothing to live for. I've had a good life, I've seen a lot of things, travelled the world, been in a loving relationship that's sadly is over now. I've tried overdosing before but the ambulance came before I died. I want to die right now, so badly, but I'm so afraid. I'm scared of the pain. I'm scared what's going to happen after. I don't believe in heaven or hell, but what if? I have my noose ready, tied it to my balcony. Im scared. Scared of failing but also scared of dying, even tho I've accepted it's my only option, it's the only thing I want now. Someone please help me not be afraid anymore.
