I need some advice pleaseHi

I'm 19 and feel absolutely horrible. I want to die everyday and I can't stand myself. I'm terrified of everything including college, people, and the entire future. I feel like my goals are impossible to achieve and I hate myself. Is there anything that I can do to improve my life So I don't have to kill myself.
