I really really wanna kill myself, but not fail in trying to do so for the fifth timeIâ€™ve literally been laughing for hours about how shitty me and my life are. I would try to change but honestly I just stopped caring for happiness or different-ness awhile ago. I just feel so apathetic about everything and I crave death so much. Iâ€™ve hurt my body so much that I feel like a barely living corpse. I wish I could just send a pray that would be answered from some God that could take me out of this misery. Why why why do I have to stay here another second.
