What to do when the anger grows?I have collected so much anger and frustration i can literally feel it tearing my chest apart. 
I can't even sit still when those waves of fear roll over me of dying alone.  Never feel what it'slike been takingcare of. A kiss, a good morning. I'm not a bad person and I've never hurt anyone. I want to make people laught. 
I don't know what to do or what is happening:(
