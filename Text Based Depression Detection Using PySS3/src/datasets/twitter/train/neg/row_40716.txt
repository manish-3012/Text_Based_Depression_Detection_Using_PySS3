Tired of being a stateless and invisible.I am a 21 years old guy from South America (I would rather to not say from which country), i have been an inmigrant in Spain for many years. My mom brought me here as a kid after a life of misery in her home country. 

Here i am, stateless. My home country will not give a new passport without my birth certificate and Spain will not grant me assylum. I am an ilegal inmigrant living in small room with my mom. We can barely pay the rent and survive, sometimes we can only afford having 2 meals a day. As i walk down the street fear has taken its toll on me. If im lucky i could pass as a local since my skin is fairly white but  not for long. When i talk to people they spot my foreign accent and start asking questions. Cannot trust anyone. Been arrested twice, once by Guardia civil and second time by Policia Nacional after being caught selling replica clothing in downtown Madrid, reason of my arrest: living in Spain without proper authorization. Ive een beaten up and bullied by xenophobic police officers and as well robbed many times by local Spanish pickpocketers, as an inmigrant i cannot even report these thieves to the authorities. Time to end this suffering and kill myself. Please go ahead and shit on me and chant against ilegal inmigration.
