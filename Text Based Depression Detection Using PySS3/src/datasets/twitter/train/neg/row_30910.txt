A friend saidParaphrased: "If you wanted to commit suicide how would you best preserve your donate-able organs"?

We were drunk, but I saw his eyes... He's wasn't completely joking, but not completely joking either. I want to do my best to help/alliveate  how he feels... regardless of how severe, be it verbal or practical help. He's definitely hurting. His "guards" have been up since highschool and he didn't let them down for no good reason.

I know about, and will take action to ensure, free (tax paid social security) and professional help if I deem it necessary.

Can you give me personal/social/friendly advice that would asses (sp?) him and possible also help him meanwhile?
