I should have expected it.I really thought i might make it. I had finally left those thoughts behind. It's been 4years and 5months since I last cut. Until today that is. My husband of eleven years fell in love with another girl. I should have expected it. I knew deep down that I'd never be enough. I knew he could find someone better. I shouldn't have let him convince me otherwise.

So the end is creeping up. I know where, I know when, I know how. It's just a matter of waiting til he is safe first.
