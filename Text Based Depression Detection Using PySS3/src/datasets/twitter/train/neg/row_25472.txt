I can't keep doing thisI'm 17 and I've dropped out of highschool. I havent had a single friend in the past 6 months. I have bpd and I'm autistic and I can't find a job. I've been trying to work and get money for months now and I can't do it. I can't live in a world where the stress of making money is just going to be enough to kill me on its own. I cannot wait until I finally end it all and this can be over.
