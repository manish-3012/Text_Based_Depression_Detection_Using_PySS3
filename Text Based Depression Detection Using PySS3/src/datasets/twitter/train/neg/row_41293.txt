Keep trying or?I'm in my early 20's, I was taught from a young age that if you find a woman and babies are had, you dont run away. You are a man and you have to provide for your own children. Well almost six years ago I found the woman. She cheated on me. MANY MANY months later we made up I got her pregnant. Fast forward- my twin sons are two. I just want to know...if I killed myself today would they (my sons) remember me? We have an excellent relationship. I love them with all of my heart. And I know they love me.. whatever love means to a child. I Just miss my family so damn much and I dont see a time when we'll be a family again. Their mom's moved on I guess even though, new guy is a complete dud. But I figure, if she's happy with new guy, then why stick around? Why make my kids have two dads? That's not fun for them, and to me it's not worth the hurt of watching them be a 'family'. Let me know if there is any scientific evidence indicating when a child's memory truly begins to cultivate events, people, places, things, etc., and store them internally. I'd like to know. I may follow through with this regardless. I dont know. The world's going to shit anyway right? Have fun raising my kids new guy... ya fuckin cuck
