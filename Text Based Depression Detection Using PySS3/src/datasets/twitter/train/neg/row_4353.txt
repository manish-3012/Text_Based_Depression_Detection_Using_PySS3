Just donâ€™t kill you self for 4-6 weeks......then we should have a spot open for mental health treatment to not kill yourself. 

Ugh. Iâ€™m so frustrated. Iâ€™ve been struggling hard for about 6 months as Iâ€™ve been getting deeper into trauma therapy. I had an attempt in September.

I finally said straight out to my therapists, â€œIâ€™m not ok. I need help. It hurts really bad and I want to kill myself to make it stop hurting.â€

They helped me find a partial hospitalization program (ideal, so I can continue to do trauma work with my therapist). Theyâ€™ll have an opening in 4-6 weeks. :â€™(

Thereâ€™s no other mental health treatment options around me, expect for the ER where I would get 3-5 days to â€œstabilizeâ€. Healthcare system is terrible in the US.
