Sometimes, I wish no one cared about me.This is really an ignorant thing to say but then I could just leave. 
I don't know what I'm hoping from this post, I just have noone I can open up to. 
Everything would be better if I'd go. 
My boyfriend could continue enjoying his life. I can't open up to him because he would be thinking I am not serious or I am overreacting. But the thoughts I have are not overreacting. 
My school makes me feel like shit, teachers and students make me want to drown and I feel like shit for my mom paying this school to torture me every day.
My mom would be better off without me. Of course, she loves me, but I just want her to be happy and healthy and I think with me, she'd have a lot less problems. 
I just bother everyone around me and I feel so sorry for taking up that much room. 
If my boyfriend breaks up with me, I don't know what will hold me here. As long as I am in his company, I don't even have these thoughts, but left alone they come back. 
I just really don't know what to tell you guys.
I hate my home life, I hate it, when my boyfriend treats me like shit and I hate my school more than everything. I don't see any future in my life, especially without my boyfriend, because then I would be completely alone, since I've lost all my friends.
