I think my online friend may have committed suicideShe hasn't been online on our favorite game for weeks or snapchat. Perhaps im overreacting but she has talked about being suicidal before but i guess i never took her seriously. Her last message to me seemed strange but i just brushed it off. I asked some of her friends if they know if she is alright and they replied saying that she had acted weird last time they played together. Maybe im overreacting but i just wanna know if she is ok. I only know her full name and the country she lives in but nothing more. How do I know if she is ok??
