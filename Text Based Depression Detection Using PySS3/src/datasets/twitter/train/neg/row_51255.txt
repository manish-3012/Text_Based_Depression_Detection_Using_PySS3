For over 2 years, no matter how much I try, nothing works.My first suicide attempt was a little over 2 years ago.  Throughout those 2 years that have passed, I have tried many things, meds, therapy, complete abandonment of social media, different outlooks on life, etc. Nowadays I live pretty healthy, I drink lots of water, eat good food, workout frequently, and I get a lof of social time, but none of it has made a change. Everything I try has failed, and I think I am just hard wired to feel depresses. Maybe some people are destined for death.
