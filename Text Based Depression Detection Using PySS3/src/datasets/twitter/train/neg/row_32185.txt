I've tried...it doesn't workI've actually done it. I've accomplished everything in my life I thought would make me happy. Getting good friends? Check. Girlfriend? Check. Good grades? Check. I even ate right and exersiced to the point where I can now run 6 kilometers in half an hour. I've kicked everything off of my list of things I was sure would make me happy, but I still feel empty. Numb. Cold. Tired. What happened to my friends? They stopped hanging out with me and I've pushed them away, destroying my relations. Girlfriend couldn't really keep up with my depression. I was dragging her down. Nobody loves me, and I'm not sure I want anyone to. At this point, if I can't fill the void by getting my dream career (military), I'm just going to fucking do it. I don't feel anything, and i just want to break down in someone's arms and cry. Or at least talk. But I can't. And I won't. I'll never get the chance.
