Depressed, Suicidal, Meds Don't Work And Psych Ward Almost killed me...I'm not sure what to do, don't know how to live. Psychotherapy is shit for me. Tried, 5 antidepressants of all classes for months, none work. Benzos help but docs won't give me because v"it's too addictive, even though I have severe anxiety too. 

The psych ward fuck me up on antipsychotics, and I'm not diagnosed with anything psychotic. I almost died there, even my family was worried that I looked worse there than home.

Don't know what to do, it's either I buy rope and hang myself, or maybe I'll try cocaine. Maybe it might help me to live.

I don't have have anyone left. Friends abandoned me since they knew I was in the psych ward. And even friends I made in the psych ward stopped contacting me.

That's all. Thanks if you read this far.

It's either I buy rope
