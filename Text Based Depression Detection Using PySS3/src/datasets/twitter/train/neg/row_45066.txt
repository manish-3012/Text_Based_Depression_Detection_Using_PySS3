Screw God.I was raised to believe in God and to follow in his footsteps. I believed it my whole upbringing, and still am not sure whether or not there really is a God. But if there is, fuck him. Everyone says that he is my creator and he knows me personally and loves me like a daughter. But I could never imagine putting someone I love through the torment that is constantly in my head. If he actually is real, I don't want any part of it. My life has been hell. No matter how much I prayed and how much I obeyed, my life was still dreadful and I'm finished with it. 

It has crossed my mind that maybe, if there is a God, he made me this way so I could understand other peoples feelings and be able to help them. That makes me feel a little better about the situation because I truly do love to help people and have helped many. But why must I go through all this torment? It continues to get worse no matter how my life is going. 

I have always had huge dreams of traveling and changing peoples lives, and there is still a part of me that wants that, but I can't hold down a job, therefore, I have no money to travel. I feel so trapped.

 Also, the religion I was raised in believes that there is a life after this one and the time on this earth is so very short. Thinking about that takes away my urge to travel and try to enjoy the life that I have on this earth. I have fucked up so many other things in my life, would it really be that big of a deal if I just left this earth and went on to whatever afterlife there is, if there even is one? 

Easter it is.
