Idk what to sayIâ€™m sat here crying my eyes out. Not able to open up.  I know people care. But I canâ€™t stand life anymore. Iâ€™ve had my note written for almost a month. Iâ€™ve just added to it and I think itâ€™s ok. Iâ€™ve researched the antifreeze stats. Know how much to have.  Just giving up. All I want is for this one person to reach out. To tell me how much I mean to the specific person. But she wonâ€™t. So idk if Iâ€™m making it or not. But tbh Iâ€™m just trying to time it nicely. 
Thatâ€™s all I gotta say I think
