I'm scared to write this. But I'm scared of my thoughtsI'm worse then a sexual harraser. My best friend completely lied to me. She left me. She told me I was special.  That I was her best friend.  That I was her favourite person to talk to. Now.  Now I'm just no one. She fell for a sexual harraser.  A criminal.  Somone who sexualy abused women and her.  She kept it a secret from me for months. She slowly stopped to talk to me. And now.  Nothing. I told her,  how I felt, I told her how he was a bad person,  who committed felonies.  She didn't care.  She liked the freedom he represented. 

I never win.  I'm sick of it. She was my best friend.  And she chose some one who sexualy harrased over me. I feel like a cry baby,  someone who's entitled.  I feel like one of those crazy ex boyfriends. But she lied to me and led me on for months. Even now,  after I told her everything,  all she says is "I can't please everyone".  Yes you can. I'm your ONLY friend. Other than the sexual harraser I'm the ONLY person you've talked to for 2 years. You just don't give a crap

The thought goes through my head all the time. I feel like going down to buy a big bottle of sleeping pills and ending it. I probably won't, because I'm to afraid of it not working and having to deal with my parents and family. But I can't be in my own thoughts anymore.  Every moment I think of it.  I'm just so sick of never being good enough.  Ever.  For anyone. I'm just never good enough.  Ever!  I'm never good enough!!  I'm never!!!!
