I don't even knowI've been to hell and back many times. Each time has dragged me down further than the last. You know what the funny thing is.. nobody knows my full life story. So all the people that say fuck you to me whenever I'm not in the mood to fake it for them, I just imagine if they only knew. I've helped so many people for years, but in return, there's nobody for me to turn to when I'm losing it. I've faked it for long enough. I don't know, this may just be a rant I need to get off my chest, but sometimes I'm on the edge of just losing my shit. All I can say is, I've been to hell and back too many times to count, and in my journeys, I didn't see any angels.
