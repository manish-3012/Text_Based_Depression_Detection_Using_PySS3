Just pouring my heart out.I'm sick of being alive. Its nothing my existence means nothing. The only people who would be affected if I kill myself are my parents. I suck at pretty much everything. I'm learning something I hate cause I'm unqualified to actually learn what I love. I have no friends. Never had a best friend. Been single for 20 years. No one has ever been interested in me like that. I'm repeating the same day for god knows how long. I wake up, shower, eat, online classes, watch something and then go to bed. I've tried so hard to make friends and stuff. It never works out. I just want to end it man. I cant even cry anymore. Theres this empty feeling. Like this emptiness in my chest. I feel it all the fucking time. Theres no excitement. Some people never get a good life I guess. It sucks to know that you never truly meant anything to anyone. If my parents weren't here i would do it. If they weren't I could do it and no one would even notice.
