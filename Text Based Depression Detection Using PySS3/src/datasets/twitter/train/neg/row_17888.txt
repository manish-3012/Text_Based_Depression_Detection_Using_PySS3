I've never been able to see a future for myself.I'm an 19 year old, female university student. I've had these thoughts since grade 6 and have been in school counseling since with no avail and discontinued counseling since leaving high school and I am not on any medication.
I am absolutely dumbfounded by seniors who manage to live past 70, or people who can live into their 30s even. There was not once a time in my life where I saw myself having a regular life, as I could not possibly picture myself in a future where I exist. I'm just tired, of everything. I'm tired of living for my parents, I'm tired of attending classes, I'm tired of not being able to sleep, I'm just mentally and physically exhausted and have been since grade 6. I guess I just want someone who has felt like this before to talk to..
