Just feel tiredI never usually post but honestly I just feel alone and want people to talk to. I just feel tired. Tired of crying at nights and then tired of feeling hollow and numb in the mornings. My closest friend stopped talking to me; he needed a break from me from what Iâ€™ve said. Iâ€™ve said sorry multiple times and texted him but he hasnâ€™t responded. Iâ€™m just tired of trying so much. He honestly was the only reason I am living. And now heâ€™s no longer my friend and I dread to be alone. Iâ€™m afraid to suffer like this forever or just end up doing it. But Iâ€™m still so afraid to do that either. Iâ€™ve just been making marks on my body just so I can feel something (that jolt of pain reminds me that Iâ€™m alive). But Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m tired of acting like my â€œother selfâ€ when Iâ€™m around people. I act how I expect I act when around people. I just wanna give up. I donâ€™t want to die or lose my friends but it feels like theyâ€™ve given up and are tired of me. I know itâ€™s unfair for me to put it onto them, wanting to be alive. But it happened and without them I have no life. I tried communicating with my best friend but heâ€™s still on his break and shut me out. I just am so tired of crying and being numb and then crying again when something, a trigger realizes that either they are happy anyway without me or that I just donâ€™t want to die. They will be happy that Iâ€™m gone anyway. They donâ€™t need a friend like me who also is like this. 

Sorry for the ramblings and the stream of consciousness.
