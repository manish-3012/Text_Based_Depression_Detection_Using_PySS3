How do I shut my head up?Hi, not talking around it for long. First of all there's little risk I'll do something or so I guess.

I am starting haloperidol tomorrow morning because pharmacies didn't have it today. I had an emergency psych appointment today after trying on Friday and having to wait the whole weekend and that really was torture.

Now my head didn't exactly shut up and neither did the pressure go away and idk the suicidal part of myself is quite loud and it's close to unbearable and idk what to do about it. It almost feels like it knows it might be made to shut up soon so it's going as hard as it can.

I have many reasons to go but also some to stay but I'm somewhat afraid to, like, lose this slight illusion of control and not know what I'm doing anymore. I mean I lost someone to suicide and I can't inflict this pain on the ones I love but fuck it is unbearable..

I'm bipolar, ultradian cycling. Also maybe experiencing psychotic symptoms. This is hell. Everything beyond can just be better. It is evening. Tomorrow 9am I get the pills and hope they will calm me the heck down and I won't react in a paradox way.
