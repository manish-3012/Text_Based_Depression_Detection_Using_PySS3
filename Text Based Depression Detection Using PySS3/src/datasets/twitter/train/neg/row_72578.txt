i'll be gone soonmy lease on life is up. i'm tired of giving myself extensions even though my life keeps getting worse. i should've died years ago given these circumstances.

i've been saving my antidepressants for this moment.. hopefully it's enough. i think it will be.

i'm not sure if i'll make it to heaven but i hope if god is real he'll let me in. i don't want to go to hell when life on earth has been this bad.

i'm snuggled up with my dog and i'm ready to drift to sleep and not wake up. if all goes well i won't be checked on until much later in the afternoon tomorrow.

i know it doesn't make sense for me to post this and leave but it's comforting me. so thanks for letting me share this.

goodnight everyone.
