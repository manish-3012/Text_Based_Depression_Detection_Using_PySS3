I want to stab myself in the chest right now.Pain. Struggle. I probably wonâ€™t do it for real, but I sure have tried punching my chest so hard hoping I get knocked out and die. 

Sucks when your feelings are never validated, toxic asian parents always think they know whatâ€™s best for you, I just wish I was never born, or die soon. I just want to stab my fkg chest right now, or I could do it on the roof where nobody will be able to find my body for quite some time.

Sorry if thereâ€™s no context for this, Iâ€™m too disappointed and angry to explain. Things never go my way because according to my parents, I can never do things right, and their ways are the best ways. Iâ€™m just so tired. Tired of not being validated, tired of being manipulated, tired of existing. I just really donâ€™t want to live anymore please end this. Iâ€™ll chicken out trying to kms but I also really donâ€™t want to live anymore.

Sorry have to let it out like this, Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry.
