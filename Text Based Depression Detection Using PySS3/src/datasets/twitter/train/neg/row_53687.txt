Hey I'm newBeen thinking ab killing myself at school Tbh. I can just lock myself in a stall and take a bunch of pills and no one will be able to stop me. My parents won't  there so that's another bonus. And if for whatever reason I change my mind I'm near a hospital. I've already got my note and getting the pills shouldn't be an issue. I was originally going to shoot myself but I haven't worked out a plan good enough to get away with it and not get caught. And I've had thoughts of cutting my wrists but I just can't bring myself to do that. I've never attempted before and the thought scares me. But it's more so the thought of waking up in hospital than actually dying. I feel like the only thing stopping me is my friends at the moment. I love them so much. I want to talk to them ab all this shit but I tell myself they wouldn't want to hear it and they have enough going on already. The thought of them finding me dead or in a drugged up state scares me alot. I don't want them to suffer because I was too selfish. I used to like thinking of my future as a kid but now I just see nothing. I can't imagine myself Alive. If not soon it will be next year when I'm in a different city for boarding school.part of me doesn't want to die but that part of me is growing weaker everyday. 

Anyway for now I think I'm safe. I'll probably delete this later
