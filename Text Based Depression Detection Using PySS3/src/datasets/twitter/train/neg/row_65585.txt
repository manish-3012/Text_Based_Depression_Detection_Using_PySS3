The 8th grade girl I nanny for tried to commit suicide on Sunday. Can anyone offer insight as to what and what not to say?Little back story- I have been the nanny almost a year. 8th grade girl, very pretty, very fortunate on paper- vacations, gets whatever, no money problems, etc. Her parents are divorced and she has expressed her dad is an alcoholic before, but she only spends every other weekend there. He enables her alot- lets her drink, generally acts like he doesn't care. Mom is the strict one, tries very hard and is involved and always there for her. Recently, she has started drinking, trying drugs, having sex all at 13- and she always tells me immediately afterwards. (usually gets caught so I never have to tell the mom myself, wouldn't want to break her trust)

She is an only child and I come from a large family, so I try and advise her like a sister would. I listen, never make her feel bad/ degrade her for what she did etc. Just try and give sound advice with a general theme of you're too young, smart, and pretty etc. She already had a therapist, and is currently undergoing treatment. Can anyone with experience in this area offer any advice to me, just as to things you hated hearing, liked hearing, or made you feel comfortable and not embarrassed?

TL;DR Girl I nanny for attempted suicide. What are things I should and should not say/ do to help? Is like a little sister to me. 

Edit: They do not use reddit or know my reddit name, but I will most likely delete this not long after anyways.
