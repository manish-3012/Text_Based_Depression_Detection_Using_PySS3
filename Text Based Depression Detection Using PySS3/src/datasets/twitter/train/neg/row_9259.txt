The Gun Never LiesThere was this scene in [Man of Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emL9GGweB0I). Where, in his case, at his lowest point, he pulls the trigger and the bullet doesn't detonate. A light primer strike. His character says later, a bullet never lies. 

I shoot. Quite a bit. A logical man doesn't buy a $1,500 pistol, tricked out in every way to compete at the pinnacle of his ability... and throw it all away by turning that finely tuned piece of precision engineering on himself. 

Something to note about the CZ-75 / P 01 design, is it passed the Czech reliability requirements, and then blew them away. 

**Czech REQUIREMENTS**

Must be able to complete the following without failure:

* 4000 dry firings
* 3000 De-cockings
* Operator level disassembly 1350 times with out ware or damage to components.
* Complete disassembly 150 times
* 100% interchangeability, any number of pistols randomly selected, disassembled, parts mixed and reassembled with no failures of any kind including loss of accuracy.

**Safety requirements:**

* 1.5 meter (4.9â€) drop test, this is done 54 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked. Dropping the pistol on the butt, the muzzle, back of the slide, sides of the gun, top of the slide, in essence, any angle that you could drop the gun from. This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.

* 3 meter drop (9.8â€) 5 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked, This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.

* After these tests are complete the gun must fire without service. 


The factory contracted an independent lab to do additional testing on guns that previously passed the drop tests.

**These pistol were dropped an additional 352 times without failure.**

**The pistol must also complete an environmental conditions test**

* This means cold, heat, dust/sand and mud. 

* The pistol must fire after being frozen for 24 hours at â€“35C (-36F). 

* The pistol must fire after being heated for 24 hours at 70C (126F) 

* The pistol must fire after being submerged in mud, sand and combinations including being stripped of oil then completing the sand and mud tests again.

**Service life:**

* The service life requirement from the Czech police was 15,000 rounds of +P ammo. 

* The pistol will exceed 30,000 rounds with ball 9mm.

**Reliability:**

The reliability requirements for the P-01 pistol are 99.8%, thatâ€™s a .2% failure rate. This equals 20 stoppages in 10,000 rounds or 500 â€œMean Rounds Between Failureâ€ (MRBF) **During testing, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired, this is a .05% failure rate, a MRBF rate of 2142 rounds**! Over 4 times the minimum acceptable requirement. 
The U.S. Army MRBF requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols with 115 grain Ball ammunition.


All this was to say, when I loaded a magazine of 10 bullets into the magazine, mostly out of habit, as production division shooters are limited to 10 rounds, I did so intentionally. Carefully. 

Thousands of reloads. Thousands of draws from a holster. Thousands of hours dry firing, tuning muscle memory and mechanics. Hundreds of thousands of bullets fired. 

This was just one more A zone shot. Nothing to it. 

Chamber one. Do a brass check. Safety on. Holster

I even set the buzzer. Random delay, par time 1.3 seconds. Figure why give myself a chance to second guess myself, and just let instinct take over. Beat the clock. 

BEEP!

Right hand moves down to the gun and finds the grip. Left hand moves instinctively to my chest, awaiting a freestyle grip I never intended to use today. My right thumb flipping off the left safety as the gun pulls out of the molded kydex holster. The gip is good. Solid. High on the beaver tail. 

Instinct has me bringing the gun up to face a target, moving to meet my support hand. it takes a moment. Only 2 tenths of a second, but I force the gun to the target. Finger has begun to slowly squeeze the trigger rearward, all pre-travel gone. 2 lbs is all it takes in single action. The hammer dropped. Clunk. 

BEEEP! 

I never expected to hear the par time buzzer. I checked the round, no firing pin mark. The hammer was stopped halfway. I stripped the gun. There is some play in the sear cage. It was a repeatable error with the right grip on the right safety. 

The gun never lies. 

Not today.
