All i wanted out of life is friends and to go outside without a problem. I hate living.Im so disappointed in myself and life. Its so fucking meaningless for me. I have no friends. My best friend who was my only friend has ignored me for a week straight and im so alone. I have absolutely no one now. I cant go outside of my house without breaking down. Its been a long slow decline but rock bottom is coming up soon. Ive done medication, therapy, tried to make friends (and failed), joining new clubs. Nothing worked. I give up. Im 17 and Have been depressed for as long as I can remember. I know its not gonna get better. I donâ€™t know what else to do but give up. I have no reason to keep going. No material objects cab make up for the loveless lonely life im living. I want this to end already. Ill never get to love to nyc because of my anxiety. Ill never get to open my own business and become an artist with galleries. My mental illness has over taken my mind. Nothing helps not even alcohol or drugs. Ive tried psychedelics to help me and it ended with me having a breakdown for hours and hours. Its all been darkness. Instead of suffering more might as well end it now. I dont see a reason to go on. I hate being alive its just painful.
