I hate everyone...Everywhere i turn, people smiling during their daily routine or a happy couple kissing on a street corner. I cant stand it. I hate looking in mirrors, i hate to see that fat, miserable excuse for a human being staring back at me. All i really want is for some one to actually care. A relationship where someone cares about me. And i have tried. So many times. But nope, fuck you, you miserable piece. Shot down, every fucking time. But its not like you can lame them. I wouldnt want to talk to me either. So i have accepted my lonliness as a fact. I just try to pull myself through this motonous life of mine but lately i just cant. Im getting out, one way or an other.
