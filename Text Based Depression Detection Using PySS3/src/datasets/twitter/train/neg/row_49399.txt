I actually want to get better sometimesIâ€™ve been fighting for about 11 years now.  I donâ€™t know what keeps me going sometimes.  I am trying to get a second degree to do something I love so this leaves me with shitty insurance and seeing the school counselor?

Is it possible they can even help me or will she lock me up?  Iâ€™m not suicidal currently so I donâ€™t think she can but she probably doesnâ€™t know what the hell she signed up for..
