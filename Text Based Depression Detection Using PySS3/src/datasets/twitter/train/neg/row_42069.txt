Doesn't have a friend in the world (not going to kill myself, just want to talk.)Everyone in my high school that i socialize with hates me because I've made some horrible social choices that make me look like a creeper, but I am desperate for anyone to contact me outside of school or even talk to me, period.

I try to have an actual conversation with people, usually beginning with small talk, but it ether leads nowhere or someone steals the conversation from me, and I'm flat out ignored.

If someone starts talking about someone or it's about themselves, they usually push me away, saying it's "girl talk" or "I wouldn't understand" and ask me to leave. It makes me feel like i'm the fucking plague and as a result it makes me feel like a loser that knows nothing about anyone. No one seems to enjoy talking to me at all. I usually have to acknowledge a person before they acknowledge me.

No one is concerned about where I am or what I am doing tonight or where I am going.

No one ever asks me how I'm doing, or what I'm doing, invites me anywhere, or even says hello when I enter a room or goodbye when I leave.

I can't join in any conversation that anyone has, because I know nothing about what they're talking about  (this thing called #YOLO #SWUG, for example) and I would contribute nothing to the conversation. On occasion I can chime in, but I contribute nothing and they usually ignore me.

I have no one in my phone contacts. No one to call.

**tldr: No one pays attention to me at all and everyone ignores me because I 'creep out people' but I just want someone to talk to. Honest to God, I try my best, but it all fizzles. This is not a self-confidence issue, THIS IS A FACT.**
