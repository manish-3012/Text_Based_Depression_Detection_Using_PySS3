no one wants me alivemy best friend blocked me on everything. i have no idea why and she wont even tell me. i texted her once recently and i dont even think that sent through. All of my other friends are annoyed with me, and most of them are also friends with her so i dont want to ruin their friendships by talking about it. i have a couple good online friends but im scared that its conditional. my parents kinda care about me but they get really angry whenever i talk to them and i know i only make their lives more difficult. the only one im sure will miss me is my dog but hes getting old and im terrified of seeing his health failing. 

i dont know what to do. i have no future. ive been with her through everything and shes the reason im alive today and i dont know what that means with her gone. im manipulative but i dont want to be and i dont know how to stop. the only reason i havent offed myself yet is bc im too much of a pussy to do it but i know thats selfish when i could make everyones lives better by doing it. i need someone to help me along with it and if not i need a damn good reason to stay.
