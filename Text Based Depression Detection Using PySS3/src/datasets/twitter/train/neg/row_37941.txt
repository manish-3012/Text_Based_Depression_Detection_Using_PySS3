My regrets have destroyed meCan't stop thinking about what I could've been and it's pretty much destroying my mind and life. Nothing brings any happiness, normally I'd either exercise, listen to music or just play video games, but now it's all just meh. I knew
It was getting bad when I couldn't even play Zelda without thinking about the past. I'm thinking about seeing a therapist but I feel as though medication and talking won't really help. Due to my self loathing it's had an impact on my overall life as I've become a lot more bitter and fallen into the trap of depression. I don't really want to tell my parents because they'll say I'm just asking for attention and my family members would see me as weak. Also have been thinking about ending my life maybe after the world cup, so I'll get to see England bottle one last time. So yeah not really sure why I'm posting on here just wondering if any one else either feels the same or could give advice.
