I just lost my best friend.. I can't take it anymore..I just lost one of my best friends.. She was everything to me. She was my closest friend. Closer than anyone could've ever been. I don't talk to my family, so friends is all I have. We used to date but things didnt work out, so we decided to be friends. She was depressed and I promised her I will take care of her and help her get through it. However, I had a depression of my own. I tried to kill myself four months ago and it didnt work and I made her blamed herself. We argued a lot lately and I accidentally said harsh things I didn't mean it at all. She doesnt believe me or trust me anymore. We just argued and I had to leave before I said anymore things I don't mean. The last message I saw before I left was "It was nice knowing you." I think I lost her for sure this time.. I cant take it.. Even though she's a friend I still love her. I feel like this world is really unfair.. I might go for another attempt.. I cant stop crying..
