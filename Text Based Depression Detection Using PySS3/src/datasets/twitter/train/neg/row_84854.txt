Explicit Instagram Message (OCD)Before reading, an OCD is an obsessive compulsive disorder. I have obessesive thoughts that I repeat several times a day. 


So I have this vague memory were I though I sended someone an explicit sexual message via Instagram dm.( and deleted it afterwards so I Wonâ€™t recalI it back. I panicked and thought that I might have actually send it on the 19th of december and afterwards deleted it. I didnâ€™t hear anything about the message in the meantime. (Might have not sended it (ocd) ) So I decided the best way to know if I actually did it, is to send another message to him but this time in full consisentcy of myself doing it. With (screenshots). So I did that an got back a normal reaction. Whe had a short converstation, but nothing about the first message was mentioned. Still to this day Iâ€™m panicking that he has kept it secret and I actually did send something. This memory has been repeated in my head over a 500+ times so I donâ€™t have an actual clear vision anymore that devides my memory from reality. How does this sound to you and do you guys think about it?
