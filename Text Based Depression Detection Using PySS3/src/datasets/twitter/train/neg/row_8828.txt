Internet friend stating they intend to kill themself - What do I do?Called Suicide hotline, they're a fucking joke. More concerned with filling out their call center forms than actually giving advice. 

I know her home number, address, and parents names.  Should I call her parents? Can I call 911 and get transferred to their area from multiple states away?

She's not responding anymore to text.
