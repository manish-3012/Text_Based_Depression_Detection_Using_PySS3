Don't do anything except go on computer all dayI have panic disorder, chronic physical symptoms and agoraphobia. I currently haven't left my house in almost a year. I spend my days in bed on the computer. I have no one I talk to in person or online, so I generally just lurk on different forums or watch videos. I'm bored and i'm exhausted. I can't do it anymore.
