I wish I was brave enough to do itI think about dying all the time but I'm just not strong enough to do it. My life is meaningless. I contribute nothing to life and only make life harder on the people I love. I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up. In the last three years I've lost my mom and my dad within a week of each other for completely different reasons, lost my grandmother, got into a life changing car accident that has left me so anxious that I nearly have panic attacks in vehicles, lost my job and haven't been able to find one since. I just don't see any reason to keep going but I can't find it in myself to go through with it.
