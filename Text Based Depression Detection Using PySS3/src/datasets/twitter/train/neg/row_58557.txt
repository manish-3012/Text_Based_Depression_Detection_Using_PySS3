Need advice on how to open upHow the hell am I supposed to tell my family about my suicidal thoughts so that I can get some help. I'm young so I need their financial support for therapy and all that but I just can't imagine telling them about my problems, especially since I would seem like a little bitch for complaining about this shit since I haven't had a hard life at all. Also things would probably never be the same if they knew I felt this way and I would feel awkward as hell with them knowing this. I feel like even a therapist would tell me to stop being a pussy if I were to open up. Just need some advice.
