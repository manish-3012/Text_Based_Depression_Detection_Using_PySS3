What if I died on my abuserâ€™s birthday?As Friday comes closer, I cannot stop thinking about him and everything he put me through for the past three years. He was someone I looked up to and loved so much. He was my mentor, my college professor, my speech coach, and a role model to me. We donâ€™t have many of those in the gay community so to have one in real time meant everything to me. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide so many times over the years because of him, and all I want to do on Friday is talk to him and wish him a happy birthday because I still love him and I miss him every fucking day and I hate myself so much for it.
