Why am I obsessed with suicide?For some reason my mind keeps trying to get me to kill myself. I know it's irrational but I just can't stop it. It's like my mind wants me to stop being me, for all of my worries to go away and be a new person I guess. I feel as though I just shouldn't be here in this reality and I need to escape. Like death will grant me release. I have no desire for anything else. Just dying. Please tell me what's wrong.
