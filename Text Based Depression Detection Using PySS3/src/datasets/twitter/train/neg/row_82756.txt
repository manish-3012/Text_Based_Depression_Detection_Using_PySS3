Whatâ€™s the easiest solution?I (F24) am French. My boyfriend (M29) lives in the US... 
I am currently in grad school but Iâ€™m lost... Iâ€™m thinking of dropping off and maybe find a job here in France to save money and spend time with my family... 
I was supposed to join my boyfriend in 1.5 years, after I finish grad school.. but everything has changed now that I want to quit... so he wants me to come live with him, and he got really upset that I wanted to stay in France for a year... 
I want to spend time with my family as the plan is for me to live in the US forever with my boyfriend... 
Anyway, so Iâ€™m lost, I donâ€™t know what to do with my life, I donâ€™t know who I want to be, and the worse is that whatever choice I make people get upset: if I stay in France for a year my boyfriend is sad and upset and he thinks I donâ€™t love him... and if I go the US now, my family is going to be really sad... 
So Iâ€™m having thoughts about ending it all... if I am not here anymore, no one can be disappointed by my choices ...
