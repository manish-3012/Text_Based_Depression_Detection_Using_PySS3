Thinking about getting help, have some questionsMy suicidal thoughts have worsened a lot over the past few weeks and while I still feel like I don't want to commit suicide the temptation is constantly there and I am becoming increasingly concerned that I might do it in a moment of weakness. I've already had one close call and would like to avoid another.

I think I might finally be ready to try to get some help for my depression but I've a few questions/concerns first. 

1) How would I even go about trying to get myself checked into a hospital? I don't want to wait for a doctor's appointment but I also think it would be incredibly awkward for a perfectly (physically) healthy person to just walk into an ER and try to convince them that I need help.

2) If I was admitted to the hospital, is it possible to keep it completely secret from everybody (family, employers etc.)? I am 24 and still live with my parents but I don't want them or anybody else in my family to know about my depression. I am staying at somebody else's house for the next week so I was thinking maybe this would be  a good chance for me to go to the hospital without anybody noticing, assuming I'm not in there for any more than a few days.

3) What would/could it cost, if anything (I live in Canada by the way)? I've got no money right now so I wouldn't be able to pay any charges.

Sorry if these are dumb questions. I haven't even seen a doctor since I was a little kid so I'm completely clueless about how any of this works. Any information or advice anybody can give me would be greatly appreciated.
