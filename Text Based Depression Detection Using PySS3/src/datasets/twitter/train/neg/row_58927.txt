I canâ€™t be bothered with life anymoreI genuinely canâ€™t be bothered to keep going. My mum took me to the hospital last night because I took too many sleeping tablets but they sent me home this morning. Iâ€™ve struggled with my mental health since I was 11 and I honestly canâ€™t wait until I have the guts to kill myself. I feel guilty because my mum tries so hard to help me but no matter what anyone says or does I just want to die. I have gained so much weight, have a weird skin condition all over my arms and Iâ€™m covered in scars and stretch marks so I am disgusting psychically as well as mentally. So done with this bullshit
