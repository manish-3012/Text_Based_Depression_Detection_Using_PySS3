Iâ€™ve been feeling very suicidal the past monthI feel like I donâ€™t have anybody to tell this, so Iâ€™m posting it here. I donâ€™t have a plan, but I have images flash through my mind constantly. I just really donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Itâ€™s so exhausting and nothing I do seems to stick. I feel like a piece of garbage and want to throw myself out. I feel like Iâ€™ve put so much work into managing my illnesses that I donâ€™t even know what the point is anymore. I still canâ€™t hold a job, my closest friends are just not emotionally available, and my marriage is sinking to what it was before. Youâ€™d think with aging and all the therapy that I wouldnâ€™t let these be problems. No matter what, I feel so empty and alone. I hate the gripping feeling of wanting to do ANYTHING to escape. I like to believe I am strong enough to not do injustice to myself again but boy is it gnawing...
