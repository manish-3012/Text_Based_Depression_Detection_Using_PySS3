I'm hoping someone could help me.I've struggled with depression for the past 6 years. I've never taken any meds because I didn't want to get hooked on them; my mothers a drug addict and I didn't want to become like her. My depression has gotten worse lately and its gotten to the point of me having suicidal, and even homicidal thoughts. Homicidal thoughts about my family, my grandparents, who have taken care of me for most of my life. I know I could and would never hurt them, but these thoughts are scaring me. 

The past two days have gotten really bad, a lot of family issues. There was an incident that happened yesterday and I feel as if I cannot go home. I'm currently at an ex's house with his mother. 

I needed to vent, and I have a question. If I go to the emergency room of my local hospital, and tell them I am thinking about harming myself, how are they going to help me? I feel like the world is crashing down around me and its time to give up. 

TL;DR: having suicidal and homicidal thoughts. How will the local emergency room help me if I go to them saying I want to harm myself?
