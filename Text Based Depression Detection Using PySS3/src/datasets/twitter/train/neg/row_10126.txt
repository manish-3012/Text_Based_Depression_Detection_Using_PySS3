I would have been a mom next week and the thought is absolutely killing me right now.I would have been a mom around now. Ten days from today if I'm being precise, but I had a miscarriage at a little past three months. It's been so long now but it doesn't stop hurting honestly. I can still remember what it was like the night it happened and God do I wish it hadn't happened. I wish none of it had happened. I feel so fucking horrible inside. I just want to die. I want to stop hurting so much. I can't end it though. I don't have it in me to try again. I know how to do it this time but I don't have it in me to do it. I'm fairly certain one of my attempts was what caused the miscarriage but I'm never going to know and I honestly don't want to know for sure that I did that unknowingly. I just wish I'd die tomorrow. I wish I'd get shoved onto the tracks or that a car would hit me. I wish I'd get mauled by dog or that my  pacemaker would shut off and that I'd die. Literally any death would be better than the feeling I have in my chest again. I just needed to vent. I'll be here in the morning if anyone responds to this. I just needed to say something to someone because I have no one right now.
