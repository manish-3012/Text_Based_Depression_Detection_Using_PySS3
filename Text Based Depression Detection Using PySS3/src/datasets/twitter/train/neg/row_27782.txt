feeling completely alonehi, i'm 18 years old and i don't want to be alive anymore. i live in an abusive household where my father is my abuser and with a mother who desperately wants to save him. i don't know if this will put anything into context, but i'm hispanic, so in our culture family is the most important thing so she makes me feel bad for hating him and not wanting him in my life. before anyone asks: i'm from the united states, so yes, hypothetically i can leave with no trouble, but the problem is, i'm financially dependent on my parents and they pay for my online art school. also, i live in the middle of nowhere in new jersey (to put this in perspective, we don't have our own police department), and my house has security cameras on the outside, an alarm system that alerts my parents's phones whenever a door opens, and doorbell cameras. 

i didn't think i would live this long so i never really planned ahead in my life. i want to go to art school but i'm not good enough for it. i'll never make it there. i took a year off out of high school to figure things out but it's only made me worse because i've had to be around my parents more. i can't take this anymore. i have so many pills right in my room with me and it would just be so easy. i suffer from really bad pain so i have 800mg ibuprofen tabs and all i need to do is take 5 of them and i'll overdose. i'm completely and utterly alone. my father is a piece of shit, my mother wants him to get "better" despite basically causing my mental illness (i have bpd which only comes from trauma), and everyone else in this fucking family thinks of me as a second thought.

i'm so tired. i feel so alone. i can't do this anymore.
