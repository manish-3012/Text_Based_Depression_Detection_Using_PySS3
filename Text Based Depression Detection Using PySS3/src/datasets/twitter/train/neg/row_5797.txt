My grades are actually killing me.If there is an E on my fourth quarter report card, that is it, it is over. I'm going to kill myself. I don't know how but I will find a way. Overdose seems the most appealing way. I need to make my parents happy. This is my only motivation to keep on living. I do not want to be a disappointment to my parents. Neither of them went to college, both of them are immigrants coming from Latin American countries and they do all that they can to make sure I can have a good education  and live happy.  I know they love me, but I know I am a disappointment.  They want their first child to be successful, but how will I be successful  if I am failing 3 classes and there are only 3 weeks left of freshmen year?  Exactly. I may be blowing things out of proportion but I don't care. Please respond if you have ever felt this way. Grades shouldn't make any child feel this way. I need help.

Te amo, Mami y Papi.
