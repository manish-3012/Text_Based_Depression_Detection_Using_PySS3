"You can talk to me" "Tell me if you feel bad"Yeah, until I actually feel bad or need to talk, then they start avoiding me for days at a time. Fuck people. All I wanted was someone to give the slightest fuck about how I felt, but instead they ignore and avoid me. I'm done doing thing for people and being nice to them. I'm just going to be as mean and evil as they are. Fuck people, fuck friends, and fuck family. I just wanna die.
