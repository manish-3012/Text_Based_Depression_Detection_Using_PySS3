Killing myself is all I have.Recently all I think about is killing myself. I don't care about how it will affect the people around me, the only thing keeping me from it is method. I recently lost the only person I had for support because I couldn't handle seeing him with other people, I've lost my drive to be a good student and I have nothing else in my life.
