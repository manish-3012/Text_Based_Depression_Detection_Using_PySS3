I realized I'm the problemFor a long time I thought my suicidal thoughts were caused by others. That it wasn't my fault how everything happened. But now I realize that I'm  the problem. There isn't ANYONE who really likes me except for my mom and grandparents. I always wondered why, but now I know. I'm a horrible human being. Please kill me
