Not sure my reason to live is enough anymoreMy partner of 5 years and I just went from lovers to best friends (their choice, not mine).  They can no longer trust me as I have made very bad choices in the past (I cheated).  I understand their viewpoint entirely.  And while I am still madly in love with them, I don't know how to go on.  

By some miracle after I cheated we were still together and were trying to work through it.  Honor and trust are paramount to me, and I know that by cheating I have destroyed both of those things.  I'm a cheater.  I immediately regretted it and once I came to my senses, killing myself was the only option.  But I thought about my partner.  I didn't want to make them sad.  I figured maybe I can regain a shred of honor by living for them, to make them smile, and living to punish myself for what I did.

But I'm not sure I can keep going anymore.  I was barely able to keep going before, and I thought things were on the mend, but I was wrong.

My partner deserves the world, and I can no longer give them that.  I want to be here as their best friend, but I can't make them happy and give them trust like a loving relationship can.  Like we used to have.

I don't know what to do.  I don't think I can soldier on anymore.  I could never bear the sight of them with someone else, even though I know they would be happier.  I just can't do it anymore.   I'm a scumbag honorless piece of shit for cheating, I deserve to die anyways.
