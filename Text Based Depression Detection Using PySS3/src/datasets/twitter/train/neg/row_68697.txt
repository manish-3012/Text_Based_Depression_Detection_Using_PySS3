I can't stop thinking about suicideIt feels like its always my "way out" and my brain hyper focuses on it so much. I was diagnosed earlier this year with BPD and I feel I've just got worse and worse.

 I constantly think about ending it all but I know its not right and I shouldn't do it, that it would hurt too many people. Yet I lay awake at night crying my eyes out constantly thinking about how life isn't worth it.

 I'm lost and don't know what to do. One day I fear the feeling will get too much and I will simply do it.
