I'm thinking bout killing myselfHey guys, cheers from Chile, I'm new here, I'm 18 yo.
I have been really depressed for a bunch of years, I can't find happiness and when I do, I feel like I don't deserve it, that I deserve only to be miserable the whole time, I don't know why is this, I can't find any motivation to do anything. I've been thinking about killing myself since I was 8yo, I've tried multiple times, but it doesn't work. The feeling it's getting bigger lately, I don't know what to do, I really want to do it, but when I think about my parents and my sister, I become a real coward. Some people told me to see a psychologist, but I don't want to. Any advices? what should I do? how can I stop thinking about my family?

Thanks for reading, and sorry for my poor english.
