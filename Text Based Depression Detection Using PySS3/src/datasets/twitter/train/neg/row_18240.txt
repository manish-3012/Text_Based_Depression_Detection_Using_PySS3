I need some help.For the past several months, I've been heavily contemplating suicide. It's always been a problem for me, but it's only recently that I've started to act on it. I found out that my girlfriend of four years has been cheating and lying for the past three months, and she's left me for the sneaky cunt of a boyfriend she's got. I've cut just now, as I have virtually every night since the breakup, and so there's a razor easily available. There's a well tied noose under my bed as well. I can't express with words alone how deeply I want to die. I've tried so damn hard to find a reason to live in something- be it friends or family- but all I feel is apathy. No amount of urging will ever get me to call a hotline or anything. I just want someone to have heard the reason why after I've gone.

Cheers.
