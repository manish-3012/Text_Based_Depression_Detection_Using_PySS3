I feel like I'm going insane.Last night I got really high and as I was coming down I started thinking really negatively about my personality and finally went to sleep. Woke up this morning feeling like I wasn't myself, had cluttered thoughts, and have had a migraine all day to top it off. I can't stop thinking about it, and I keep thinking I have schizophrenia (my great grandfather had it so it's unlikely, but I know marijuana can trigger it), Depersonaliztion, depresesion, etc. and just not wanting to live like this. Please help me.
