Another day, another reason to kill myself.Read an anti-LGBT post on the front page today and just figured fuck it I'm not wanted so why should I stay around? Just wanting to leave it all behind. I don't want to grow old enough to have a ton of responsibilities. I can't even handle life without them. I'm useless. I'm only gonna get worse.
