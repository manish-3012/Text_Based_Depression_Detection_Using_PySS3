I donâ€™t know what to sayFirst : Sorry for English and  typing on mobile.  
Iâ€™m not even sure why I post here, I donâ€™t really want help but maybe somewhere in my brain remain a spark of self-preservation. 
I want peace, I crave serenity, I want the pain to end and for that I only see one way and itâ€™s an IV of potassium...
I know i sound like a coward. By all standard I should be happy, i have everything that a 27yo could ask, from well paid job to loving wife, everything I work so hard to gain donâ€™t mean anything for me right now and I canâ€™t find pleasure in any of things that once meant the world to me.

. Even if I know I should work on my problems, i donâ€™t feel like I could ever get my head out of water, iâ€™m so tired of making useless efforts... 
I feel like each day is only procrastinating with death and now Iâ€™m so tired. 
I canâ€™t even write what I feel, I canâ€™t put word on it... I want to ask for support but this urge of dying is so strong it doesnâ€™t let me.  Iâ€™m just so tired of life...
