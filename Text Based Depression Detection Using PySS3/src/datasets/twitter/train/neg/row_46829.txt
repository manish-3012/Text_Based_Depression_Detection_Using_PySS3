I can't take it anymore....I'm crying... I have a box cutter next to me and nothing to lose...

I can't move on.... I'm troubled by my shame and guilt. I can't endure any more second of this.

I hate myself so much... I don't want to wake up again and be inside this mind.

I've failed everyone... I'm so sorry...

I don't want to die but I feel like I have to.
