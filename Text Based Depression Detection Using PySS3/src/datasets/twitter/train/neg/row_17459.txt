I don't know if I want to die, I just want someone to help me.I got totally rejected by my best friend. I think I'd be able to deal if we had a huge falling out, but because she just just ghosted me I can't deal with it. I really need to know what I did wrong or what her problem is. My mental health was already very fragile, and this has been a huge tipping point for me. I feel like I can't trust anyone. 

I broke my 3 week self-isolation away from everyone else (online, of course), because I thought it would "do me good" to talk to people, but I regret it instantly because I keep doubting that they actually want to talk to me and that everyone will get bored of me. I've posted a ton of pics on insta and fb so that people will like them, but I'm checking every 5 mins to see how many likes I have and those that don't have enough likes I worry that they're crap and I should remove them. 

I'm such a fucking mess. I'm on a waiting list for help with BPD, but until that comes through I really can't cope. I have nothing left to give and I'm just expected to continue.
