I've decided.So... My name's David and I'm 17 and I've decided yesterday that I'll kill myself before the end of the year. 
Today I remembered about this subreddit and I thought I might as well give it a try. 
Here's a tl;dr of my story:
Everything started when I moved in the middle of the elementary school, I was 11yo, I had changed the school and all the kids were harassing me in like all the posible ways. Mostly beating me up. One year later my father was killed with a knife. Then same happend in junior high school (that's what google translate tells me, I'm from Poland and here we have gimnazjum). And now I'm in high school and this time I haven't moved but I'm still being bullied all the time. For the longest time I didn't have any friend or even a buddy. I had a girlfriend once. She just used all the money that I had and then simply left me giving me some stupid reason. There were also few other thing, but that's not that important. And to top it off, my mother just got back to her old boyfriend who is just an alcoholic and is beating me from time to time. 
And so I decided to kill myself. Hopefully before the end of the year. 
Also, this is my first post on Reddit and I am not a native english speaker...
