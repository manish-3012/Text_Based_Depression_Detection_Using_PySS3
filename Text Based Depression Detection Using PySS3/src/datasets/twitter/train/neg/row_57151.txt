If I lose my freedom, Iâ€™m done with life.I might go to jail today, if that happens Iâ€™ll just kill myself before or in jail. I got charged with breach of trust and minor possession of weed. The breach of trust was over some gas money and with the weed I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Iâ€™ve already made up my mind, Iâ€™ve been in jail twice on separate occasions for only a day but those days almost drove me insane. So in the end Iâ€™d rather die then have my freedom taken, Iâ€™ve been trying to improve my life with little luck so no other options so..o well.

Edit: didnâ€™t go to jail, Iâ€™m getting a lawyer and moving on, hopefully things will improve.
