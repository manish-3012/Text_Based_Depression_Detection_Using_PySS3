I'm confused as to why I haven't done it yetI have all the reasons to do it; and I have no reasons to live. I kill myself in my head, in every viable method, thousands of times every day. I plan over and over for every variance. What angle? What caliber? How thick shall the rope be? From what height? What time of day? Do I leave a note? Handwritten? Emailed? etc. etc...

I'm miserable, but I don't ever execute these plans; I distract myself from reality by becoming Nietzsche's last man, seeking nothing but entertainment, and sleeping for 15+ hours at a time. **I then make a post like this even though nothing ever comes of it and I'm backed into the same corner soon enough.** 

Surely, this is hell and I am being punished; that is why I'm unable to kill myself even though it's the right -- nay, the only thing left to do.
