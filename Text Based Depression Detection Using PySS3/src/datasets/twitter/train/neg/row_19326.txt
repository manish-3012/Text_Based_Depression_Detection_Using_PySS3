Im trans and I canâ€™t wait to kill myselfGod I hate myself so much. Im trans and living with dysphoria is fucking hell on earth. Itâ€™s been 5 years of bs and im done. Iâ€™m gonna get disowned when I come out so Iâ€™ll lose everything, so what is the point. I wish conversion therapy worked, bc I wouldâ€™ve done it long ago. I wish every day that I could be normal and Iâ€™m not. Im just so tired and I think every day how I canâ€™t wait to die. I think Iâ€™m gonna do it November 1st, but I donâ€™t know how. Nothing matters and I donâ€™t care about anything anymore.
