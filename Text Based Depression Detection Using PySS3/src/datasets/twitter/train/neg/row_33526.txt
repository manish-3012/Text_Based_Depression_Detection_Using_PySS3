How people manage to survive their depressive attacks?For the last 8 years I pray for death most nights. I get really dissappointed when I wake up in the morning because I survived another day. I hate the fact that I am alive. This feeling comes and goes. But it comes back everytime. I want my life to come to an end but I am afraid of doing it myself. I plan on committing suicide but I get coldfeet everytime because I am afraid of the physical pain it will cause me. Maybe this means I really dont want to die, maybe this is a call for help I dont know. But right now I am crying and praying for a quick death at this moment. I dont know how to get past through this.
