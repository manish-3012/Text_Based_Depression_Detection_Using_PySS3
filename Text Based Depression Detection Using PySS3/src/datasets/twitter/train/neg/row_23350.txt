I only think of 2 things, the girl that means the world to me, and me leaving this world.Everyday, I think about her and I can't stop. I know we'll never ever be something more, and I think of the other boys she talks to, and it makes me feel worthless. I am worthless, I have no purpose, and I just want to die.
