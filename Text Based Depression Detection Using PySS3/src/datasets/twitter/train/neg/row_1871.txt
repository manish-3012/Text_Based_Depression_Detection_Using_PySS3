I told my counselor I self-harmed yesterdayI sent him journal entries I wrote while I was doing it and having heavy suicidal ideations. He hasnâ€™t read it yet and I am very nervous. I tried to balance it out by writing that I am feeling better a couple of hours later and that I am not a threat to myself, but I still wonder if todayâ€™s the day Iâ€™m gonna get involuntarily hospitalised.
