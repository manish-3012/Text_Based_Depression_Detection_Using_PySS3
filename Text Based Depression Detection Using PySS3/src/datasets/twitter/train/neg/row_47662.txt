NOW is the time to start something but, don't know how.I dropped out of the bachelor degree I was supposed to start this year because I couldn't stand being so far from home for the next four years and I couldn't find any job to help me pay my bills. Call me a coward if you want. Anyway, I think that now is the best time to start something new, but I just don't know how. Fo sure, I don't want to go back at my mom's home. It's about time, I start to live by myself, that's why I'm in Montreal for now, looking for jobs as a graphic designer._x000D_
I don't know what to expect, I already sent a few resumes but I'm not even sure if it will work and I really need to get something more than just minimum wage. Anyway, I understand these things are all part of the frustrations we all have sometimes in life. Don't know why, but I think I just need to talk about it. I still have interest for a jobs related to helping relationship, I just don't know how I will get to the point where I can find something in this area. I was ready to do a bachelor degree in social working, but I freaked out as I said earlier. So, right now, I'm just trying to make sense of the mess I created, trying to find a job which will provide enough money to get a small apartment and then, maybe I'll be able to do part time studying.
