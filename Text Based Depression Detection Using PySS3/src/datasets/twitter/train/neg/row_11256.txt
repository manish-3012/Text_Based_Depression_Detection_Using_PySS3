I can't walk and I'm going to be homeless.Trans, no family, no friends, now my foot is broken too. I'm on crutches. I was supposed to start work tomorrow and they fired me over the phone just now. The place housing me requires me to have a job, it's the only handicap accessible homeless facility for people under 21 that's LGBT friendly (trans, need medication).

Unemployed, uninsured, can't walk, and starting next week I'll be homeless. I want to kill myself but I can't even leave to do it. My life is over.
