Staring at the noose I just tied. Is it really the only way out?I feel like a prisoner trapped inside my own mind. I'm not sure what's keeping me from doing it at this point. Usually it's just the "what-ifs" and my curiosity wondering what else life may have in store. But lately, I've just been feeling so empty and life has been so grey. I haven't felt joy in anything, everything I eat tastes bland, everything I smell is faint, and all I *want* to do is sleep.

I've been seeing a therapist for a few months, and while it helped a bit for a while, here I am, still feeling nothing. I don't understand why. I'm relatively intelligent, somewhat attractive and fit, have plenty of hobbies/interests, am kind and caring, and I have a good, challenging career that I just earned a promotion in. Why do I still feel like a complete failure though? Why does it feel like I inevitably ruin everything good in my life?

I feel so alone in this world. I don't think anyone truly cares about me anymore. I don't want to feel like this forever, and it doesn't seem like there is an end in sight. Right now, my [cat](http://imgur.com/a/E6HEAfQ) sleeping next to me is the only thing that brings me comfort, but I think I'll finally be ready to go soon. I'm just so tired of living as this hollow shell of a person and I'm slowly slipping into insanity.
