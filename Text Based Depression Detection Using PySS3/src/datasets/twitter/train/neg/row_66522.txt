just helpHi everyone I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m asking for here and I donâ€™t know what if Iâ€™ll get what I need here but I just want someone to help me. Iâ€™m 15 years old and the past year for me has been complete shit. I lost friends they all moved, I got so depressed and started to cut myself, then I started to drink a little, then I started doing other drugs. Then my family found out and now theyâ€™re fucking ashamed of me. My grades are dropping, Iâ€™m not even able to focus anymore. The guy thatâ€™s my therapist thatâ€™s supposed to be helping me just makes me want to die even more. Iâ€™m not going to do anything for this world, thereâ€™s no reason for me to even be here anymore.
