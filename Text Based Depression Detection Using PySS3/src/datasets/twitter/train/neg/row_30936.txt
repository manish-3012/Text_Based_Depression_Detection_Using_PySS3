Done being a little bitch, at least I'm afraid to dieI'm fucking 20 and I'm a fucking no friends, no life, loser virgin beta fuck. My dad told me to feel ashamed I still have pride to keep living like I am. He has money I take advantage of and manipulate to get more by gone in and out of rehab back to back for the fuck of it, pretending like I still don't use h every single day but I have since I was 16. I got serious in the game, for my standards, last semester when my friend pimped me out, got me so high I went with it even though I'm not gay but whatever I made a lot of money for both of us. He's fat and I work out whatever we score and I sell a half oz of H that night I made from being a boy toy bitch. My dealing got me kicked out of school 3 weeks ago. Now just sitting out my house arrest. I have until June 7th, but I can't do anything but polytechnic school if I want any lucrative future or keep dealing. It's surreal how my life turned into a living hell before i could catch a breath. If I officially sign my organs off to charity maybe I don't go to hell since I also started believing in Jesus when things got tougher so he undertpstands I'm using him to cope like I would use a pill and that's ok apparently.
