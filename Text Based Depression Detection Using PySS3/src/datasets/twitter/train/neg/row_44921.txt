ILL KILL MYSELF VERY SOON, LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO WOOOOOHOOOOOOOIOOOOOOOOOF*ck this sh*t I'm not going all through this suffering, I ain't a slave to study on college and work my a$$ off on a job just to pay my rent and buy food monthly, this is a slavery, I'm out , sh*t im suffering, I f*cking deserve death , YES, I deserve death, I deserve to get rid from all the this suffering, last time I set a suicide date I actually felt happy for the first time in my life. The world will never change, everyone will stick to their own belief about life and will keep judging others about why we are wrong or they are wrong and so on...

THE WORLD IS A BIG F*CKING MEME.
