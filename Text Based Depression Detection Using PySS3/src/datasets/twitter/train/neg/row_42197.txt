There's no point in living if I'm transMy therapists both told me that I'm probably not trans, but I'm afraid that I'm wrong.  I've seen things that are cute and I see the girl inside me.  It isn't normal for a man to notice something cute or to feel happy seeing the girl I'm sure is the girl inside me.  I'll take her with me.  It makes me feel good to think of her being happy and I hate the anger I felt toward her.  I can't deal with this.

My girlfriend told me she will break up with me if I'm trans.  I would like to save her from making that decision.  I'll have no reason to live if that happens.  I don't want to be trans.
