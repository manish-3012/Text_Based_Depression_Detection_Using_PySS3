Can't do it anymore.I'm an alcoholic worthless piece of shit and a burden to everyone. I simply can't do it anymore. I want to be done with it all, but the thought of actually killing myself is terrifying. I don't know what I'm even trying to say here other than I have no fucking clue what to do anymore. I just want an easy way out.
