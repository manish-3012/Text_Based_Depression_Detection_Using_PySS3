My friends just tried suiciding. What should I do to help her?So I was looking at Instagram Stories and I saw her in the hospital wanting someone to talk becouse he was bored. I send her a message to know what did happen to her, and she answered she just had tried to suicide by consuming too much pills. She's only 15. She has problems with bullying, will repeat this year in school, her father suicided when she was young... She's clearly bad, but I want to help her. We only know that me and her best friend, what should we do?
