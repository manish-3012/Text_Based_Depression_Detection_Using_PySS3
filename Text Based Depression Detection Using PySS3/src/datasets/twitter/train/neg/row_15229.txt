so tired of being tired. so tired of the fight.I have three grown children. Two sons and the youngest is my daughter. She was 24 when she passed away. She and I were so close to one another all of our lives. My sons are amazing young men and I love them dearly. I have 6 grandchildren who are my world as well. Yet with all of the beauty of my children I feel so lost and alone, so angry and bitter. I feel my daughter's life was stolen from her and I was left in a state of loss and brokenheartedness. My joy moments are temporary. They are when I see my sons and grandchildren and then I delve deep into despair and feel like everything in life is one big lie! I fight to be happy but I don't think that is possible anymore. How can it be? I don't understand how I can ever be happy. I don't even have an idea of what that would look like or how to get it and worse than all of that the truth of the matter is I don't believe I should be happy because when I think of being happy I feel like I've done wrong. I'm so lost and each day I look for the end. I'm not sure why I wrote on here. I was looking for "happiness sites" what for I don't know! I guess there's a hope inside of me that somewhere, somehow I could feel the fullness of joy again. How does a parent really live a good life after the tragic loss of their child!
