I don't know where else to go.I don't even know what to say. No matter what changes in my life, the only constant problem is me. Therapy has not helped, in fact, it has only opened my eyes to how screwed up I actually am. I was just diagnosed with some form of attachment disorder, and although the therapy for it should work, I don't even want to try. My relationship with myself is the worst one of all. I have thought of, and attempted already once before, but as the days end is coming, I'm hoping to not make it home.
