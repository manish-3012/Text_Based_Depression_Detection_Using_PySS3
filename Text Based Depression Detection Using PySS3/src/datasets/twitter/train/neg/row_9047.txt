I just wrote the note for my parentsI'm not pulling the metaphorical trigger quite yet, but I am ready to, and I wanted to make sure that I had my note written by that point so that I could explain somewhat to my parents why I did what I did.  I'm posting it here so that anybody who has any advice that could help me has an opportunity to present it before I finally end it all.

"Mom and Dad,

I am writing this while I still have the mental faculties to do it.  I don't necessarily know if I am going to kill myself today or tomorrow or next week or at all.  Thus, I did not necessarily write this note on the day that you found it.  Instead, I am keeping it with me as a precaution, since when I decide to pull the metaphorical trigger, I want to make sure that you at least have somewhat of an explanation, which should hopefully gain you some closure.

First and foremost, I am so sorry that I decided to be so selfish.  Mom, I know I promised you that I would not kill myself while you were alive, but the guilt of the pain my death would cause was no longer powerful enough to combat the pain and grief that I have been dealing with.  I was to the point where I was simply biding my time until you died so I had the clearance to kill myself, and eventually the waiting itself was too painful.

Secondly, this is not your fault.  The two of you were fantastic parents.  I know you would be there for me in my every need, but eventually, I needed to stop being taken care of by my parents.  Unfortunately, no one else including myself could fill that role.  I needed an ally to walk with me, not eternal caretakers.  I needed something that you simply could not give me.

My relationships are disastrous.  I am sick of feeling like a leech to all my friends, so scared of pushing them away that I push them away.  I am sick of being rejected by one person after another.  While I have multiple friends for whom I would drop everything and stand by their side for weeks if they were in need or in danger, I clearly don't have any friends that are willing to do the same for me.  No one knows how to deal with a suicidal friend.  Everything I've heard to this point is â€œcall this number to talk to someone,â€ â€œtalk to your therapist,â€ â€œdon't be alone.â€  However, nobody is willing to stand by me.  Basically, every one of my friends wants me to get help in that â€œI'll pray for youâ€ manner.  They want me to get help, but they don't want to be the one actually standing by my side.

The fact that I can't get a woman that I have any interest in to even give me a chance coupled with the fact that I don't have any friends who are willing to get in the trenches with me and help drag me out is just proof to me that I am hopeless with relationships.  I get hurt each time.

I'm sick of getting up off the metaphorical mat and getting knocked down again.  Each time I like a girl and give myself hope she'll give me a second thought only to have her turn me down hurts so badly.  Each time I am up in the middle of the night aching for an ally only to realize I have no one to turn to aches so deeply.  Every time I get my hopes up and stand up, I get knocked back down.  Well, I don't want to get knocked down again.  I don't want to get up off the mat.  I want to throw in the towel and not subject myself to any more blows.

I simply don't have the energy to endure any more blows while waiting until my death won't hurt you.  I pray you'll forgive me.  I know this will hurt you forever, and I wish I were less self-absorbed so that I would take that into account, but I am simply in too much pain to deal with it any more.  I love you guys, and I am sorry that it had to end this way."

If you want any more information about me, I posted yesterday as well.

Edit: I know just like my last post, I posted and then didn't respond to answers.  The issue is that I am posting late at night when the loneliness is at its worst and I am exhausted.  Since good answers typically take time to come, I end up falling asleep.  Then I get up and feel better in the morning, not great, but at least not at my wit's end.  I also end up going to work, and thus I don't have a lot of time to respond.  Just know that I am reading everything you guys are writing and I really appreciate the encouragement.
