Work related burnout and suicidal thoughts?I'm happy, I'm married, I have a nice two bedroom apartment, I have a game room (basically a man cave), I'm furthering my education and I'm doing well. Things are good. In another year I can probably start a family but there is this god damn fucking voice, going "whats it matter, sure the book is good but you can just close it and not have to deal with any of this bullshit". I hate working. I hate waking up every morning, having to leave the house, and do literally anything. It's one thing when its going to classes, I enjoy that, learning/etc. But my experiment? It has me literally wanting to fucking off myself because I'm so god damn tired of doing it. I'm tired of coming in on holidays, I'm tired of dealing with my emotional problems and mental crap (I'm autistic, ocd and have severe ADHD).

It feels weird being happy and having suicidal thoughts. I know it'll end. I'll move onto something else, but this burnout is still there nonetheless and I don't know what to do.
