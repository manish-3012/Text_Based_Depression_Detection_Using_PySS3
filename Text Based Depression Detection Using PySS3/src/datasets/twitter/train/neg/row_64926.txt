Just some last ramblings from a ghost.Well I've set a date and picked a method. I've even got a plan on how my body will be found. I've ghosted everyone in my life in preparation it's been a few weeks now since then.

It's funny when I ghosted out I held a false hope that some one would attempt to contact me but I knew deep down that I was lying to myself. I've lived my whole life as a tool for others to use no personality or anything I was just what ever someone wanted me to be. 

I got so sick of being used as a wallet by someone that I cut them out of my life. Biggest mistake ever tools don't have thoughts or feelings and as a result I was abandoned by everyone else. They said I was rude and that I shouldn't of removed that friend from my life. 

The last two people I had who I really connected with are sick of me even though they care they can't deal with their own issues and help me. I hope they don't feel any guilt I've made it as hard as I can for them to not hear any news it's better this way. I care for them a lot honestly they where the first people to show me that I'm human. 

A few days from now I won't exist but that's ok with me I've accepted my fate it's one I have picked and lead myself too.
