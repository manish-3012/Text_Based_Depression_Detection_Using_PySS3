What is lifeWhatâ€™s the fucking point of anything? Iâ€™m way behind in school compared to others my age. My fiancÃ© has depression too which Iâ€™m not upset about but they refuse to do anything about it and wonâ€™t talk to anyone. Which. I get it. Weâ€™ve all been there. But if you say you want a new job fucking do it. You can do that shit from your phone. Get the fucking degree you need. You need a basic fucking class. They belittle all of my opinions. If I try to stand up for my beliefs Iâ€™m â€œnot listeningâ€ and â€œshutting down everything they sayâ€. My car is totaled and I canâ€™t afford a new one up to my parents guidelines. Whatâ€™s the fucking point anymore. Iâ€™m fucking done. Third times the charm.
