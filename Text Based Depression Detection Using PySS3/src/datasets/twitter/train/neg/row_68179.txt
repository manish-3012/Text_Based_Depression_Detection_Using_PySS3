This endsDear me,

After last night, Iâ€™m done attempting to take my own life. I denied what I did to myself but have to face and admit it. I tried, have been trying and Iâ€™m done. 

I want to live. I deserve to live. I deserve happiness. 
With Love,
me




Dear everyone who traumatized me and who made me lose faith that Iâ€™m a good person,
Fuck you.  I am a good person despite what you all did to me. Iâ€™m not broken, never was. You made me believe I was less than shit. Fuck you and rot in hell. You donâ€™t deserve happiness or me. 
Sincerely, 
me



Dear future me,
How are you love? Living your best life? How many adventures have you had?! I bet even MORE people came after your beautiful life didnâ€™t they? Bad people donâ€™t disappear, and they hunt the good like you. I hope you had the ammo to defeat them. I hope you fight.... I hope you give them hell. Donâ€™t hold back your fury on those assholes. I hope you laugh in their face when they assume that you are vulnerable prey. You will suffer more abuse, itâ€™s likely. At least you know now, what theyâ€™re are after, they can never take or break. You are not weak. I love you. I canâ€™t wait to be you. 
Best regards, 
You
