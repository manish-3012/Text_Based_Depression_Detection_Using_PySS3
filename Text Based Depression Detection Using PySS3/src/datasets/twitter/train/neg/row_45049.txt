Im lost. I dont know what to do. The rolling thoughts in my head are kill myself or run away. Ive walked out of 3 jobs in 1 month, i have another one starting soon but i just cant do it. I cant face the music, im not good enough. Not at this point in my life. I need to go on sick, but i feel ashamed to. My family loves me but i know im a disapointment, even if they tell me im not. I dont want to -not work- but i cant cope with the job hopping from one shit thing to another or jumping into something i actually have zero confidence or knowledge about. Im so lost and in pain, i feel pathetic because everyone i know is just getting on with it all or doing really well. I want to hurt myself but i dont want my partner to see, because knowing hes hurt by me doing that just makes me want to do it more. In my mind im planing an escape, some way to kill myself or some way i can run away safely with no one knowing how to find me for a while. I dont want to die and i dont want to run away but thats whats in my head. Its not me, i dont know me. But thats not me.
