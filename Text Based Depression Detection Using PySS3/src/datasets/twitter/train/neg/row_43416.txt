I feel as if I made the wrong choicesBearing in mind Iâ€™m not older than 16, I feel as if I have made all the wrong choices in life. I feel as if the friend group I chose to put myself in was wrong because they ended up just ghosting me, I feel as if all the actions I do are wrong, because everything I do seems to get me in trouble. I wish there was a way to just go back in time and try and make things better, or I think in a few months time Iâ€™ll have to get a piece of paper and start making amends for the foreseeable future I see myself having, which everyone probably already knows.
