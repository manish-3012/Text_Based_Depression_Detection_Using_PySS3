I feel so emptyI've loved all I had to love and lost.
I gave everything but I don't have shit.
I have all the things I need and nothing I want. I'm not even sure what it is that I want.

Everything I touch turns to shit.

Nobody wants me.

I'm chained to this mortal coil by a thin bond of guilt and fear.

God, let me be loved. Let people feel how I feel for them... I'm so alone.

I have nothing inside me. My moods are out of control. I go from optimistic to suicidal in a matter of hours. I'm at my wits end.

I'm so frustrated. I'm tired of living like this. Tired of living. 

I'm to scared to act on it... But I can't get it off my mind. Blood slowly leaving my body. Sight fading. Peace at last.
