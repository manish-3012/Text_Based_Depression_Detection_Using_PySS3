My friend went and told people i was depressed and suicidalYeah literally the title basically I had ended venting it was freaking her out cause she was on drugs and shit and honestly I probably shouldn't care cause she was really out of it but I really do like i went from about to kms to about kill them like what the hell that is my business and it wasnt even just about me being depressed it was a whole conversation about cutting me being suicidal and mentally ill and shit idk i am literally just venting like its such fucking bs too I could make a whole other post about this but I swear everyone just wants to be a hero they don't actually give one about helping anyone like this is the same friend who knows im depressed and suicidal all the time and constantly cancells on me when I have nobody else but then actually tries to say they would walk miles back to where I live to make sure im okay they can't even be arsed to walk across the street to see me hell they don't even put in any effort until im close to topping myself just exactly my point I dont know if this post belongs in this sub rn because im more pissed than wanting to kms but idk thoughts i guess?
