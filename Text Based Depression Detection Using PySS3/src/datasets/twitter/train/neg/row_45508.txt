Just a rantI had relapse in February due to drama, lies, and my anxiety and depression 

Then covid hit and now I am starting to relapse again and I hate it so much. I try to keep myself busy by working out, eating healthy, walks, school work, friends and everything but since covid I have felt this heavy cloud on me just draining myself out these past few months. I want to be happy I do so badly but I feel so small in this world and none of my friends check up on me and never texted me or anything so I ended up deleting social media and I thought it would be helpfully but instead I feel alone with my thoughts and I want to cry. My ex and I keep getting into fights. I am confused about myself and I hate my body so much and I hate being here and I know that I shouldn't because everything happens for a reason but I just have the feeling to cry and I want to cry but there is no tears or anything and its killing me inside because I am helping everybody around me but no one person has asked me if I am okay
