The pain will all be gone.I just make new scars, i will carry this shit for the rest of my life, so i might as well make it a short trip, right?

Sure, everyone will be sad, angry, and in pain, but in due time, they will inderstand that i, in fact, found peace. It is not anybody's fault but mine, i kept quiet until it was too late, and now all i do is make people worry.

I don't know when i'll finally decide to do it, but i have a noose tied for a while, i just need to find a good place and rewrite my note.

In less than 15 seconds, all of life's troubles will just... flow away, in 5 or so minutes, life itself will follow as i sleep.

The only ones who i fear i will truly hurt are my parents, i am their only child. I am sorry i have destroyed all that you have worked so hard to create. I have made sure to be all smiles and laughes around you so you won't worry, but you have no idea i am dying inside, Mom. Dad, i know you think depression is a feeling that can be solved by manning up and getting over it, but it's not that simple. i will never tell you that, because you may blame yourself. 

To my friends and other family: i'm sorry, i hope you aren't too effected by this, i stopped talking to most of you because i wanted to make this as soft of a blow as possible. To those of you i never did cut off, you know why i did this, and i want you all to get help, all of you, because i know some of the shit you deal with. Don't end up like me.

I loved you all.
See you soon, M, my love.

It's just a matter of time.
