its not even worth it anymore.I'm just a failure, I see it every day I can't ever get anything done and whenever I do its always shitty. I just want the constant stress to end its killing me. The only reason I haven't followed through on the bad thoughts is just because of how fucking lazy and apathetic I am I just want everything to end. Everyone tells me im going to have a shit future and that im a fucking failure so whats even the fucking point at this point. they all say oh what reason do you have to be stressed why are you stressed you have it easy. i cant fucking take it anymore they act like im fucking out of my mind its like im in a fucking movie or something. I just want it all to end.
