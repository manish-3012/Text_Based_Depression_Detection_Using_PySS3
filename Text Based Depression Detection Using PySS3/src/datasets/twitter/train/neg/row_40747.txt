Iâ€™ll always be aloneI think Iâ€™m about done. Iâ€™ve been going through the worst two weeks of my entire life. Being dumped and attacked by the only person I thought cared was just the icing on the cake. I canâ€™t do this shit anymore. I donâ€™t understand what everyone else has that I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t understand why I canâ€™t just be loved. Iâ€™m only 16 and my life has been a joke the whole damn ride through. My dad didnâ€™t want me, my friends didnâ€™t want me, and now he doesnâ€™t want me. He said heâ€™d always be here for me. I always try my best for people. Itâ€™s never enough. No one ever listens. I think I just want to be fucking done.
