Nihilism and fear of deathI'm afraid of death, and I now believe there's no afterlife. When you die you're gone, your memories are erased. I don't see the point in life if we all die. Panic attacks for 6 days, extreme depression. Doctors take months. Only thing that makes sense is get it over with. I know that doesn't make much sense to people but death is going to destroy all life so get it over with no more being afraid.
