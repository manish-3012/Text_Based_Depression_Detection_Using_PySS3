Is overdosing a good way out?I won't bore you with the details, just looking for a way to calmly end the torture. I don't want to shoot myself, jump, drown, cut etc. and failure is not an option. I can of course do those things in worst case scenario..but while I figure this out:

I've never used opioids outside of legitimate prescriptions and often don't even finish those. If I could acquire potent opioids, heroin maybe, could I painlessly pass?
