I wish i had the balls to do itMy life has been so awful since Iâ€™m a little kid and the few times i get to experience love i feel like the happiest person alive but all the time is stripped away from by the person who gave it in the first place, i have gotten tattoos to i what i think is repress my pain but it only gets worse with time, i always try to be the best i can for people but it seems like itâ€™s never enough for anybody, i remember having the best feeling in the world when i hugged my previous partner but now i only wish i had to balls to kill myself and end this mess that is my life, i hate my job, i hate my school, i hate my economic situation, i hate my family and their need to remind me what a piece of shit i am, i hate that i cant do what i want with my own life, i hate my alcohol addiction, i hate the diet i have to follow to look somewhat good, i hate that all my partners use me as their toy and then they leave me with this huge emptiness.
I been suicidal since Iâ€™m 9 years old but i never had the balls to do it, i wish i has the balls though.
