I am alone and want to disappearNot sure what to title or write here. I donâ€™t feel right, Iâ€™m lonely, Iâ€™m alone, Iâ€™m bored of this life. Iâ€™m too chicken to kill myself but man I want to so bad. My last request is to just talk to someone maybe or Iâ€™m not. Maybe this wasnâ€™t the place to go but maybe itâ€™ll turn out alright. Thereâ€™s a glimpse of hope but I am hopeless. Iâ€™m sorry.
