I found out thet my ex/friend tried to commit suicide and I don't know what to doI'm halfway across the country and I don't know what I can do to help. I still very much care about her as a friend and I don't know what to do to help. I sent a text saying "I talked to X like you said. I'm not good in situations like this but if you ever want or need to talk about anything I'm here anytime" what else can I do. I don't know her current address or have her parents numbers either. Please let me know what I can do!
