Finally happy againIve been feeling suicidal for sometime now using drugs to make me happy and having someone to care about really changes the game. 

I've never felt like this before! I've always been socially anxious and never had a girl friend or kissed or had sex or even talked to a girl. But there's something about them that is powerful and sort of tranqualizing at the same time. So i went out with a mate and he said he was bringing his girlfriend and another girl who is her friend so me being me intimidated by girls because it's an unreliable outcome decided to back down. But something in me decided that maybe it would be a good opportunity to talk (without xanax or other drugs). So we meet up and it was awkward at first she was looking at me a lot and i knew she liked me a lot in the way she looked at me, yea this girl wasn't a model by any standards. But as i later find out the way to a girls heart isn't through a quick shag...

So i got home and we started to text and she says she like me and she wants to meet up with me again tomorrow, so i agree because i also like her and tell her that i like her and my heart starts to melt. Is this what it feels like for someone to like you unconditionally. This feels like the strongest opiode anyone could imagine. We are due to meet up tomorrow and hopefully for the Forse-able future. Maybe this girl can change me for the good. Maybe it won't last for ever and we eventually split up, but that's only going to increase my speaking abilities with the opposite sex. I just am not sure where to from here now. I'm feeling good but a matter of time before this feeling will disappear? I'm not sure what to expect?
