I started my suicide note today.I'm not even sure how I started thinking about it, but I did. When I got home from work, I got a full page and like, a third of the back side written. I considered getting someone anon to proof read it - for some reason I feel like it should sound professional, like a two weeks notice.

I owe them that much. 


I don't even know how I want to go out yet, but this seems like the type of thing that shouldn't be hastily written at the last second. 


I'm sorry if this seems like an edgy or trollish post because of how...I don't know...'matter-of-fact' it sounds. I can't really express my emotions or its gets all muddied.
