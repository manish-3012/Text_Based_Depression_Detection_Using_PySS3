I need help. (x-post from r/trees)I am 17 years old, and have been a smoker for the past 2 years. There have been some great times and I wholeheartedly support Marijuana usage. But, I think I lack the maturity to use it. I have been caught by my parents 6 times now, each time my parents have gotten more angry. I usually stop smoking for a week after I'm caught but I keep getting sucked back into it. I can't stop and I have realized I have a problem (psychological dependence). I have not spoken to my parents in the past 6 hours or so and sometime in those past 6 hours they found my stash. They are asleep now, and currently I feel like killing myself. I want to commit suicide right now and it is taking me a long time to write this because I can't stop crying (I know 17 year old guys aren't supposed to cry but I can't help it). I just need advice, help, reassurance, something and I didn't know where else to turn. Please someone help. I just can't handle how bad my parents must feel right now and the fact that they are most likely going to send me to rehab. I feel like my life is over and I can never make it up to my parents. I fucked up and I feel like I deserve to die.

TL;DR Parents caught me again and I feel like committing suicide. Please help.
