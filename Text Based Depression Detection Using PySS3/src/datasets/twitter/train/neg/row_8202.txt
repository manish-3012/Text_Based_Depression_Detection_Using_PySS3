I don't think I'll make it through this yearHonestly I don't know how I'll make it another year let alone month. Everything sucks and this year got off to a horrible start. Last year and before was so rough so I don't even know how I'm going to make it through this year unless things magically get better which they won't. I don't know, I just feel like this is my time.
