I lost the one person who made everything okI've struggled with my mental health for many years now. Really struggled. I have severe depression and anxiety and I have been treated for trauma. Anyway. I had a best friend. He was the most wonderful, kind, generous, amazing, beautiful soul. He was perfect. In January our relationship turned romantic. I fell in love with him. But there was a third person in our relationship, my mental illness. I'm an awful person. I'm not saying this for sympathy, I'm genuinely awful. I got so angry at him for no reason, I caused unnecessary arguments. I let my own insecurities get the better of me. He's left now. I'm not surprised. I think I'll go to sleep now. I wish I told him I loved him.
