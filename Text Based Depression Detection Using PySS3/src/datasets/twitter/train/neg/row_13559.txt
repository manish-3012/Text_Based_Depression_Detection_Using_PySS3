Wanting it to end.I dont understand why I'm here. What's my purpose? I dont want to live. There's no hope. Born and raised a Christian they say to never take your life, but what am I to do if that's the only way out? Out of this hell hole. I don't have a lot of friends. I'm a coward. Unlike my siblings, I'm terrified to talk. I rather be cooped up in my room. At least thats what I thought. I hate my parents. They make me feel worthless. Wait, not my mom, its only my dad. He makes me feel worthless. I'm so done. I don't understand why I'm here. There's no purpose in my life. What do I do? Every door is locked except one. The door where everything ends. Its so tempting that I just want to. I just want to reach. I just want to jump down a building. It'll be over soon. And then I'll be gone from here. Anywhere but here is fine. I want leave and there's only one way. One fucking way.
