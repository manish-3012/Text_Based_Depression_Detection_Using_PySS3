PSA: We've tweaked the sidebar, and cleaned up a bit in /r/SWResources. What do you think?Hi SW!

In response to your feedback, we have rearranged the sidebar to make the information in /r/SWResources more prominent.  

We're also relocated [the metanoia "Read This First" link](http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/) so [a new post with some other selected online resources](http://redd.it/1c3p3z).  It's a great message, but it's (necessarily!) a general one.  Since we are advising the community to respond personally to our OPs rather than posting generic helpful or inspiriational messages, we thought that the way we were presenting the metanoia piece was a bit inconsistent with our own guidelines.

I've revised the [risk assessment](http://redd.it/1c7nqf) and [hotline FAQs](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/1c7ntr/suicide_hotline_faqs/) posts also.  These were actually posted on my behalf before I was a mod by someone who's since left and they still said "posted by \[Deleted\]" which doesn't exactly inspire confidence!  I've taken the opportunity to change the emphasis to reflect what I've learned about the concerns of our typical OPs in the last couple of years.  

We've also clarified the guidelines, to explicitly advise against taking conversations to PM too quickly.  

Let us know your thoughts, please!
