I want it more than EVER!I had all planned, i was going to kill myself in my birthday. I know it is kind of a ClichÃ©, the loop, death comes in the same day that i was brought to life - with some years of difference, of course. 25 to be exact, quarter of century. Long enough to understand how life can be wonderful and horrible. I can't stand living with myself. I hate me more than everything else.

The plan was to grab my grandfather that passed away this year, an Hyundai Pony from 1993 (curious), drive it to a mountain some km north of where i live and crash it all the way down in some tight curve, again a ClichÃ©. But this how i planned to die, neither less the plan failed, I failed, once more. I chicken out and was able to follow it.

Today my life is crashing, collapsing all over me again, I say i can hold, bear it a little longer, but i can't! I just want to follow the fucking plan and once in my life don't fuck it up! just go trough it and desapear forever! I jusn't can't handle it anymore!
