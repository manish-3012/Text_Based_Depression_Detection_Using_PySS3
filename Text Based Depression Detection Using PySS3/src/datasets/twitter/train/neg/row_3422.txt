Too much stress not copingI dont even know where to start here except i cant cope with the worlds shit anymore i wish i could just disappear

 ive had so much shit goin on at work i have my manager whos temper is like a fucking yo-yo threatening to cut my shifts for finishing work early i was already 20 mins past the end of my shift and i asked if there was anything he wanted me to do before i left he said go do run in the freezer (about 30 mins to an hour of extra work)
I already 
 my partner waiting out front for me so i let her know i had to stay back a little went up to the freezer and realised there were no more runs left to pick so i went back down let him know and asked if there was anything else he wanted me to do. He said no and that i was free to leave. Then after i sign out he starts going off asking what time i started i told him i was rostered on for the 430-1130pm shift it was already midnight at this point and he starts going on that if i keep finishing early it will be my shifts he cuts back during the slow period.

One of my coworkers has been talking shit behind my back and doing anything he can to try get me in trouble 

And then because i vented to my partner about what had been going on at work she made a facebook post which my older brother saw i got him a job at work because i thought becoming a parent had made him change i wanted to give him the opportunity to make something of his life insteaf of selling drugs for a living he saw the post and took offence to it so now my work environment is even more hostile

My partner foesnt understand how im feeling at all im not coping i feel like shit and more often than not lately ive wanted to kill myself she just goes on that she hates mopey people and i need to stop moping about all i want is a cuddle and to be told its gunna be okay 

Ive got my partner trying to bring my crack whore mother back into my life shes chosen drugs over me more times than i can count  


Just nothing seems to be going right lately its all just too much i want it all to end i want to kill myseld but what will that do to my partner and my son but the world seems hopeless i dont know what to do anymore im not strong enough to keep fighting
