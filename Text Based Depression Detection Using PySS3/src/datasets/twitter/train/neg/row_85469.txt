How do you go on when you arnt ok?I have been in individual therapy and group therapy since last August and my depression and suicidal ideation is worse than it has ever been since I brought a knife to school with the intention to kill myself 8 years ago. I canâ€™t help but feel that I should just disappear. Like Iâ€™m somehow burdening everyone just by being in proximity to them. I have had intrusive thoughts of suicide ranging from drinking household cleaner to jumping off the top of the school parking garage. And it feels like every day Iâ€™m inching closer to taking it from a thought to an action. Today I stood at the top of the parking garage and actually leaned over the edge. 

  I have seen my therapist 2 times in the last two days and I have another meeting on Tuesday. But Iâ€™m not sure I can live that long. I feel like I should check myself into a hospital. But if I missed even two days of work or school my life would be so totally fucked since I would lose my job and not be able to afford rent, and I would mis two midterms and have to drop out of the graduate program I finally made it into. 

  I just donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want anyone to have to deal with the mess of me killing myself. But the idea of living even two more days just feels so impossible.
