No one cares if you don't die youngI'm going to kill myself eventually. Why hold off until I'm older and no one cares. I'm 19. I'll be 20 later this year. If I wait much longer then I won't even be remembered as a tragedy. Its selfish I know, but people who are dying are allowed to be selfish sometimes.

I've been depressed since I can remember. Nothing caused it. Or if something did I don't remember it. No therapist has ever even remotely helped. I've been put into therapy against my will and gone into it voluntarily, but somehow no one takes it seriously that my life has a doomsday counter on it. No one cares if you want to die. They only care if you actually do it. Depression isnt enough anymore. I dont have a list of diagnoses but the one I have is fatal.
