Need some help or somethingI'm sitting in a restaurant right now totally alone thinking about the fact that as of Tuesday I don't have a place to live yet. I have several apps in places but I don't have a definitive location set yet. I've been depressed for several years and recently a girl I was casually seeing up and stopped talking to me. It's a pretty dark place for me right now and while most would say my life is decent I can't help but want to go home and slit my wrists. I need some moral support right now.
