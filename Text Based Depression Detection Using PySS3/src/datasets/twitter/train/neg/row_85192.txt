I feel like shitI hate myself so much right now. I hate everything that my life is. I'm fucking stuck and I can't do anything about it. I can't keep a job for more than a year for about a million reasons. I just want to do enough drugs to make me forget and feel good for a change. I just want to die. If I had a gun or enough pills I would just fucking end it right now. I don't care if it's selfish or stupid, I'm tired of this, tired of doing the same bullshit over and over, tired of getting fucked, tired of not being able to make something of myself. I'm about to be a 30 year old loser of the first fucking degree. 

I can't write, I can't do anything right, I'm just a piece of shit fuckup with no future and no real friends. I just want something to go right in my life for once, I just want one day or week where I can say everything was fine and really mean it.

I'm pissed because I made no damn money at work today. Just like yesterday, and last week, and last month. I'm so in debt I'll never get out, and I have virtually no support network (unless a needy brother counts as support). 

Everytime I think about what I want to do and where I want to go, I come back to wanting to end it. I don't see a future where I don't feel this way, and at this point, I can don't remember a past where I didn't feel like this to some degree or another.
