Unworthy of life.This isnâ€™t the first time I've posted here, I think I'm far to fucked up to go on.

I donâ€™t think I can go on much longer. Fighting has never been a good attribute of mine, I have always have been very passive, loving person. I fear conflict of any kind, whether it is with myself or another person. I feel a weak person, I have dealt with depression many times and Iâ€™ve never wanted to give up like this before.

I just got out of the hospital a few weeks back, I made friends and I tried to get help. I really wanted to get help and tried my hardest. I was discharged a day early after 8 days. I didnâ€™t feel too different going out of the mental health unit. A week later I was on another downward spiral. I havenâ€™t even gone back to work yet, I donâ€™t even think I can go back to work with my anxiety and depression the way it is.

Iâ€™m not sure what is causing this, my life is not that bad. My family loves me dearly and are very supportive. I have great friends and they are always there for me. I have so many things that are good in my life and I have no idea why I am not happy. I often wonder if I am ungrateful.

I donâ€™t know where the next turn will take me, where my life will go. I feel as if Iâ€™m losing hope. Iâ€™m afraid to tell too many people about how Iâ€™ve been feeling because someone told me: â€œIs that all you ever talk about?â€ I have one friend who will listen to everything I say, but she is as clueless as I am.

I feel bad about what Iâ€™m about to do to everyone, but I donâ€™t know what else I can do besides give up. I donâ€™t want to hurt my mom, but I feel as if I have no choice. I canâ€™t cope anymore.

Iâ€™ve tried distracting myself, medication, therapy, talking to friends, being more socialiable and nothing has helped. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I hate being a burden on my family and friends.  I hate being that person who is pitied and felt sorry for. Things would be easier if I was never born. I deserve this because I am not worthy of life.

I donâ€™t know how I would do this. Perhaps hanging myself would be good way because I have a rope left over from work or I could just take a bunch of pills.

Hopefully the fear of death and the guilt I feel now will be quelled with the peace of the void.

I have a long suicide note to write.
