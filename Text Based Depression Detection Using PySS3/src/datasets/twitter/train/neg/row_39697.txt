My trauma occurred three years ago almost to the day and I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore.I left work early yesterday after breaking down before the store even opened. I got all my pills together, researched and calculated dosages to verify I had a lethal dose. I do. I called out of work today to go to my momâ€™s house so I wasnâ€™t alone because Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to take the pills. Iâ€™m back at my apartment I live alone at and Iâ€™m so tempted to take them. Iâ€™m conflicted because I have so many people who love me and I donâ€™t want to hurt them.
