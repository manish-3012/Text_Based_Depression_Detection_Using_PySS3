I'm tired of living for othersI don't want to hurt anyone. I don't want the people I love to feel any pain. But it's been going on for so long. Isn't 30 years of suffering enough? Am I not allowed to rest? I am so sick of being trapped in this male body. I just wish I could be me. But the world doesn't want that. So I bend. And I do what the world wants me to do. But I am tired. I might as well have been dead for 30 years. This is not living. What's the point of being alive if I can't live. Maybe if I would have acted sooner. But I'm many years too late. I don't see a future anymore. I just want the suffering to end. Can't I be selfish for once?
