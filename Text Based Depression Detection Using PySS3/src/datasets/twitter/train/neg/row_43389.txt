37 days ago, I posted on this very subreddit that I wanted to kill myself. Later that day, I said I got better. Today?I shouldnâ€™t have to live. I donâ€™t want to live. 

I donâ€™t see why I should be allowed to see the light of day, to be able to play a video game, or to talk to someone.. everything I do now makes me feel guilt.

I shouldnâ€™t have to be the one to talk down suicidal people.. the mental damage it does to me knowing that I stopped someone from taking their life makes me feel responsible.. and guilty.
The emotions I have to deal with everyday.. the lies that I hear everyday.. the fact that I tried to be perfect and it didnâ€™t work... the damage it does to me mentally.. it hurts so much.

I canâ€™t even convince myself to not look at a knife, razor, etc... I canâ€™t stop shaking.
Thereâ€™s no point in me living. So what if Iâ€™ve made people feel better, so what if people like me.. it doesnâ€™t matter in the end game.

I wish I didnâ€™t have to be like this.. Iâ€™m one of out 7.422 billion people, mind you, only 13 years old, whom has gone through so much pain, betrayals, etc.

All of this is too much for me. And all I ever wish for now is to end this pain.
