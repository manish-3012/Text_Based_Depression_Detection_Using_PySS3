Here I am again.Me and my mother in crippling debt...threatening to take away all of our stuff and our home with a final notice. So many years..all the bad memories, good memories. I'm a shut in, I don't go outside unless it's to see my therapist. Been off medicine for a long time. Tried to commit twice. First with a knife that got me a criminal record and the second in a different country with pills. Didn't even have enough time to swallow. Pathetic right?

And here I am...cutting, thinking about killing myself. Except the last time I cut...I didn't have an actual razor blade. Now I do. It's much worse. Yet the burn feels good after the cut, it barely feels like a cut until after it opens up. I'm sorry. I deserve this probably. And this doesn't look like..anything new I suppose. I'm so useless. Can't even help her.
