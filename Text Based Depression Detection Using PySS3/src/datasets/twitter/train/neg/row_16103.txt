Goodbye Deb.I quit my job last September because it was killing me. That was my first mistake.

For a while I was fine. Made some great friends online and started looking for a new job. One by one each of those friends moved on, lost a bunch to a big argument about another of my friends and things went downhill from there. In the end, I landed myself with a single friend. A really really good friend, but just one none the less.

Last month her husband was diagnosed with cancer and I spent every waking moment trying to help her get through to his surgery that was last week. The surgery went fine and he is recovering well (they have yet to confirm that it was indeed cancer, but they removed the thyroid successfully regardless) but the problem is.. That time I spent taking care of her took its toll on me. She is still super emotional with everything that has been going on in her life and I broke last week and started feeling suicidal. The problem is.. I told her. And she cried about it. A lot... To the point where her husband has forbidden her to talk to me anymore. I wasn't in any place to handle that news and I am ashamed to say I didn't handle it well, especially considering the last time this happened (see my previous posts) but now I am left with no job, no money, no friends.. And I just miss her so much already. I don't know how I can go on.
