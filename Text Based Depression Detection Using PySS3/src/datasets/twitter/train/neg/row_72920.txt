I managed to lose over 50,000 in the span of 3 monthsGave myself a heavy gambling addiction since everything else in my life is terrible.  I lost around 25000 that my parent had for me in a savings account and 25000 that I earned through my job.  I hate my job and the coworkers, and I'm probably going to get laid off/fired soon because I suck at it.  I have no friends and spend all day playing league of legends.  I don't talk to my family at all anymore.  I'm around 7-8000 in debt at 23 to high interest credit cards. 

This is just me signing off.  I wanted someone to hear me out before I left.
