Iâ€™m at my lowest pointMy girlfriend and I took a step back and it tore my heart out. I hadnâ€™t worked for 2 months due to a shoulder issue. This really came between us. 

No matter how many times I try to reach out she rejects me and says she isnâ€™t ready. I respect her feelings and what she wants but sometimes I just feel like we will never work things out. She means the world to me and I canâ€™t see a future without her. Sheâ€™s the only person who has ever understood me and I donâ€™t want to move on. 

Most of the time I sit here and contemplate ending everything. I pretty much have zero friends, left my friend group due to live changes, and I donâ€™t get along well with my family. It feels like the easiest thing to do. 

I donâ€™t know what I intend on getting from this post, but it does feel good to type this out and get it off my chest.
