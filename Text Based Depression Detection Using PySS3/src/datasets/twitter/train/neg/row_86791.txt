suicidal thoughts are sneaking back into my headlong story short, I've been depressed since I was 12, hid it for years until i could't take it anymore and tried to end my life a year and a half ago. I got somewhat better, but now i feel depressed again. I keep thinking of suicide and have been really close to doing it. holding high doses of lethal chemicals in my hand, ready to drink it. a click away from stopping my heart with a 9,000V transformers i have. today i was crying in the bus because i really can't bare being alive. i'm so lonely. one of my coping skills is drinking, even though i dont like it because if i chose to live it will affect my developing brain. i dont know what to do, every time i attemt it i get closer and closer to succeeding. i feel so much pain inside of me. i really wish i wouldnt have survived the first time, then i wouldnt have to worry about anything anymore.
