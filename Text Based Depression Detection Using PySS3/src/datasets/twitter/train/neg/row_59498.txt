Has life actually changed for any of you?I'm 23. I've been on and off suicidal since I was 12. So was my aunt, she had 2 girls though and so did the right thing by hanging on. My sister is suicidal too. I'd really love to believe life could get better, but, I just don't believe it will. Have any of you actually got over being suicidal and moved on to loving your life?
