I dont know how much longer I can take itI go to a high school in LA and I usually get alright grades (Bs and Cs) and my mom has never been satisfied with them, calling me retarded, idiot, dumbass etc. I have been able to put up with that for years and I never minded because I knew I would go to college soon and never have to speak with her again. But in some bs coding class I took last semester I failed the final and ended with a D in that semester (in my school that is a fail that requires remediation). The reason this D is so bad is that I now have to go to summer school which means I can't get a job which my dad wanted for me. When he found out about the grade he beat the fuck out of me and now no one in my house talks to me or acknowledges me. My dad has been, one of my only support systems and now he changed his mind about me. I dont have many friends either so I really have no one to talk to so one of my only options is suicide. this is pointless
