I really want to diemy boyfriend has brain cancer and he told me he isnt likely to survive. weve both have had terrible lives and then we found eachother and made eachother happy and we bring out the bestin eachother and now this. I don't have any close friends and the one friend I did have, got a girlfriend that doesn't like me so hes avoiding me. My family is abusive. I have no support and I feel so alone. I can't stop crying, I can't beleive this has happened to my boyfriend. We are so young and we want to be together and this is happening. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to deal except cry. Sometimes i feel likethe only reason why i cant kill myself is because my boyfriend would be disapointed if I killed myself but it just hurts and I don't know what to do. I really just want to die.
