I feel like I will never amount to anything and my life is going in no direction.Out of uni with a degree, stuck in a horrid low paying job. A partner that never seems to be there or want to spend time with me. I feel ugly and fat and like I repel people constantly. I feel guilty about being jealous of my best friend. Who has since graduation has had countless related jobs but still seems to bitch and moan about it without any thoughts for anyone else. And now is going on a date with one of my friends and throwing that around too, whilst I'm stuck here like a worthless piece of shit who can't even get a pet rabbit to like me or think I'm worthwhile.

I'm at a loss of what to do. And I lack motivation to get better. I just want to give up now.
