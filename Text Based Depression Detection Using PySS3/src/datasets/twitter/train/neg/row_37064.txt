Im 30. My life keeps repeating im done. I want to dieI'm sitting here in my car in the condo complex I used to live where my fiance kicked me out today. I want to die no way around it I've had failed relationships, failed jobs, I've been poor my whole life, I have a messed up family. I am so tired of being me and who I am I cannot take it anymore for the first time in my life I lived chittum Italy want to die.  I have nothing to live for I've lost everything I've had over and over again and I never seem to learn my lesson I fall back into the same patterns the same routines I can't do it. I just can't do it anymore this is the final straw I'm homeless I have no money I have no will to carry on I want to die. nobody can convince me anything or any other reality is better I'm so over it I have nothing I've had nothing for 30 years of my life and I want nothing more than to never wake up again.
