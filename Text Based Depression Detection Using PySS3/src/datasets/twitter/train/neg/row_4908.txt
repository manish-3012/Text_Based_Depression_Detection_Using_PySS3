Believe it or not, the plan isnâ€™t always your own.I took over 450 mg of adderall one night hoping it would enough, but it wasnâ€™t. After 10 min of comtemplation i decided to take the pills, and actually found my peace. Some of us are always going to struggle with this, but the second i woke up the next day and realized i was here, i understood why you shouldnt take your life from the ones that love you. It is so fucking hard to believe you are worth it, that you donâ€™t understand the good you do. Everyday now I ask myself, how can I become better? 6 months ago I only wanted to forget. I really hope everyone can understand that in your worst moment all it takes is one conversation. Within one moment of courage and self love, you understand why youâ€™re here. Hope this helped.
