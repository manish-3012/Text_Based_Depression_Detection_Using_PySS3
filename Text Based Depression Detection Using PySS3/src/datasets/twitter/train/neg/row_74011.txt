Nothing makes me happy anymoreFor the last few weeks I have had trouble finding ways to make me happy. Anything I do just makes me sad, even the things I love, sports, video games, hanging out with friends. I have fun in the moment but the second itâ€™s over I just fall into this complete sadness where I donâ€™t want to do anything. I fell like my life is worthless, Iâ€™m a burden on my parents with my low marks in school, Iâ€™m just a fat idiot with no future, and even thoughts of suicide. So I came here to ask what I should do?
