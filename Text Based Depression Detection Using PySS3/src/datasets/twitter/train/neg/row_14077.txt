Can anyone help me?Im 14, ive taken multiple tests online as i cannot get actual real-life therapy due to my anxiety of asking my parents, and theyve openly said that they dont believe in mental illness. I cant confirm it but i have multiple disorders that i have symptoms of, General Anxiety, Social Anxiety, Agoraphobia, Major Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and a couple others that I do not think i have. 

I keep thinking about suicide, how, when,where, and why i should do it buti really really dont want to die. My friends are encouraging me but they're not helping at all..

I have problems everywhere, with school, home, and friends. Its a wonder how i can still put on a happy face. Im reaching out so please, if you can. Give me some advice.
