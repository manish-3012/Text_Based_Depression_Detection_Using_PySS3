Scheduled my first therapy session and I doubt Iâ€™ll even make itIâ€™ve been thinking about suicide every day for probably 7 months now. Thereâ€™s no point in living like this anymore, this weekend may finally be it. 

1-2 people may be sad at first, but eventually theyâ€™ll forget about me and their life will go on as normal.  My landlord will rent out the apartment again, Iâ€™ll be replaced at work, and the Earth will keep spinning.  So why am I even sticking around?

Hopefully goodbye
