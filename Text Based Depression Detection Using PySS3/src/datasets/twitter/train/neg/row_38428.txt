Iâ€™m so tired of fighting my own thoughts.Iâ€™ve gotten into the habit of not talking about myself. I go out of my way to make sure there are as few mentions of the words â€œIâ€ and â€œmeâ€ in the messages I send to people. 

I am not allowed to kill myself right now. People are dying and everyone is quarantined- to kill myself would devastate my loved ones who just want me to be okay. My family is the only reason Iâ€™m around. They deserve better than a failure of a daughter like me and I know theyâ€™re disappointed but I tell myself theyâ€™re worth staying alive for because Iâ€™m sure not.

Living with myself is hell. I just want it to end
