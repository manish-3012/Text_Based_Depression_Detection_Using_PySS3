Lonely. My self motivation post (xpost from /r/lonely)My entire life I have been alone, separated from the rest of humanity... all for being different? Sure, I have had friends, I have had girlfriends, but no one ever stood by me, everyone went away in the end. I cry for help but no one answers, it is a constant, endless suffering, depression, anxiety, loneliness, jealousy.. all these complex emotions I don't even understand are tearing me limb from limb, slowly chipping away at what is left of my happiness. Sure, I may be young, but I still have emotions, I still feel pain, everyone I have tried to turn to, every time I try to get help I get treated like an outcast, a monster.

Each day the pain worsens, I become more lonely, and it doesn't matter who I am with, or how many people are around me. There has only ever been one person who I never felt the slightest bit of loneliness around, that one special girl, and she turned on me, like everyone else and left, lied to me, broke my trust, destroyed every last bit of hope for happiness I had left.

Everyone see's me as happy, no one understands how I feel, I may be physically young, but if you could see what goes on inside my head, you would understand, everything is so complex and confusing, my mind is like a tangled mess of wires, everything feels so chaotic and messy, it never ends. Every day I proceed to live out my life in my desolate, lonely room, pushing forward and just trying to get by. I hope one day for this suffering to end, I just want to be happy... is that so much to ask?

One day I will come back to see this, to see how bad it was and show myself, things can get better. I will beat this, I will keep living. I will keep fighting.
