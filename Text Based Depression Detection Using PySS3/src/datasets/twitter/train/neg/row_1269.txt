itâ€™s been 4 years, iâ€™ve never asked for help from anyone. this is what i think iâ€™m gonna send to my pops.â€œhey dad, i need help. iâ€™ve been stuck in a depression for awhile but recently iâ€™ve been in a really dark spot. it seems like i often feel this way during the winter, and thatâ€™s why i always failed at school during this time of year. i couldnâ€™t get myself out of bed today and i donâ€™t really know what to do, as iâ€™m older now and i have real responsibilities, when before, i would usually just let it pass. i would appreciate if this was just kept between you and me. â€œ

i donâ€™t really know how to tell him, so this was all i could come up with. 

this is the most effort i can give. iâ€™m surprised iâ€™ve gotten this far honestly.
