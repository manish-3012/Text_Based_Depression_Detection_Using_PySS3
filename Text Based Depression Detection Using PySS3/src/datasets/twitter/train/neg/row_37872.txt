Giving upI've been contemplating suicide for almost a decade now, thinking about it over and over again, in a rational and logical manner, trying to find another way out... Yet I see no optional route. No way out. Some say suicide is selfish, or cowardly... maybe. But when it really comes down to it - it's my life, isn't it? If I don't want it, shouldn't I be allowed to end it? 

Edit - about 3-4 hours after original post (less inebriated). This is something I've wanted to at least talk to someone about for many years... If it had been a family member or professional... I would never have told them how I really feel because of the consequences. It was difficult for me to make a post even anonymously online... So thank you for responding. It means a lot to me. I really want to respond to all you kind people, but I'm about to pass out, so I'll get back to you. To the ones of you that genuinely do care... I wish you all the best &lt;3
