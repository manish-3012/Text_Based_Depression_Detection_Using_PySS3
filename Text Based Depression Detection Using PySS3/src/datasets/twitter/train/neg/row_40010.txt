Going to...I'm going to work even though I'm not rosterd on for today's shift! ðŸ˜œ going to take coffee at the mall listen to some tunes and hang around at work to keep me out of the house where the verbal and emotional abuse is happening because if I stay I'm going to loose it ðŸ˜” how are ways that others cope here?  Has anyone found a psychologist to talk to helpful? Or do they just make it worse.
