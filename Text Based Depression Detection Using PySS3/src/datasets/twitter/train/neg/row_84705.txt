I dont even know what's wrong myselfI just want to end it, ive been stuck with this in mind for about 4 years. It will just never go. Ive had up and downs but today we are monday and i wish i could end it. But as always, i dont have anything in the immediat to do so. How do y'all have motivation to live in such a fucked world. The only thing that comes to my mind are families. But you know what ? Fuck em too. Society is a failure and so am i. I wish i could give my time left on earth to someone who can actually achieve something or atleast want too. Someone who deserve that time here. I hope one day suicide will be a supported option.
