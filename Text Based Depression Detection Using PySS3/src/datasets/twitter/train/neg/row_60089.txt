2 years ago, I was suffering from deep depression, with daily suicidal thoughts. In the past few months, I've made myself a future. There is hope. Always.I came to this subreddit a few times before, begging for help. On the verge of doing the irreversible. 

If you are reading this right now, there will be brighter times. It may not seem like it now, it may seem like the entire weight of every planet is upon you. People love you, we love you here on this subreddit, and we need you to stay. So do your friends(yes you do have some) and many other people that you're unaware of how you've positively effected.

I've decided to change my career, move to another city that I have a lot of friends in, go to school, and start a new job. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Just believe.
