I think I want to die but too many tho he are holding me back, which I've got to be somewhat grateful forI'm turning 16 today, I have a loving family, some friends, were financially stable and can afford some luxuries, and I know I'm not useless. Im very fortunate. As grateful as I am for all of these, at the same time I'm a mess who can't help but want to disappear into s place of constant content mindsets or even the nothingness of death. Death scares me but the ironic thing is I'm enough of a coward to want to die. I don't think I have clinical depression or any major disability, but my lack of self image, lack of talent or drive and over ubandsnce of mediocrity and self loathing is getting to me.
Again, I'm not going to end my life. I can't imagine putting that pain on my family, no matter how useless I feel.  In lazy clothes at home on my birthday with only my little sister. I haven't told my girlfriend it's my birthday and my friends don't remember, at least not enough to send me a message . Every relationship I have deteriorates because of me for the most part.

Posting this might get some weight off my chest for now which I'm happy for. People out there and here have it worse than me, and while I know it's a matter of perspective and issues vary from person to person, I can't help but feel awful. I'm going to keep on wearing a smile for those I care about and try to hang onto the good points and hope that I find a purpose or talent or something 

Sorry for the rant 
Have a good day guys
