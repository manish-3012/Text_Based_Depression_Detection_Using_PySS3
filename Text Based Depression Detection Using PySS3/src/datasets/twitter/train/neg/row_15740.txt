My friend was once suicidal but has been stable for a while, but every few months her psycho ex-boyfriend calls and reports her as a suicide threat. Yesterday the cops took her to intake, again. Is there any way to prevent this?She is getting really sick of the harassment.  She already has a restraining order out on him, he calls anonymously or under a false name.  Is there anything she can do?  And if there's a better place to post this, tell me and I'll close it so as not to clutter an important subreddit.

Thanks!
