I'm going to get some helium at the end of the month, when I get paid.I started a new job on the 1st of this month. It's an okay job, but it doesn't pay much more than minimum wage.

I know that I should be happy for the simple fact that I have a job in the first place, but I'm not.

Well, I am happy in as much as at the end of the month, I'll be able to afford some helium, so that I can end my pathetic existence.
