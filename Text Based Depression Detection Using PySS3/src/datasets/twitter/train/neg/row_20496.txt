Not looking for help. Just sharing a last thought, and sorry I sound crazy...I'm a Christian, and this is a really weird thing for me... I used to tell myself in better days that no matter what, I'd use my last breath to say that God is good. I'm not trying to witness to anybody or offer anything. You can clearly see, I'm as messed up as anyone else on here. I'm not preaching a message. But my life isn't ending the way it should, and I just wanted to say it somehow. I wanted to say that God is good. I believe that even now. It's the rest of the world that's fucked up, not Him.
