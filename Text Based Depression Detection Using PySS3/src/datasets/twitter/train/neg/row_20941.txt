FailureI hate myself so much. I wish I had the courage to die but I don't. After dropping out of school at 17 I have done NOTHING for 10 years and now live paycheck to paycheck for $10 an hour. I have $16 after paying December rent. I can't get over wasting my youth. I have no relationships, no career path, and no idea what I am supposed to do to help myself. I am a joke to my family and family's friends who see my as the lazy man child I am
