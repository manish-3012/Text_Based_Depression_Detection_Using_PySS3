Today is the day I was supposed to die.2 years ago, I promised myself that if in 2 years my life hadn't improved, I would kill myself. Those 2 years where truly horrible, especially the winters. 

I still don't work, I'm still afraid to go outside or talk to people. I still can't pay my bills and I still don't know what to do with my life.

I hope that today is the dawn of me trying new things and not taking life so seriously. 

Anyway, happy 27th birthday to me.
