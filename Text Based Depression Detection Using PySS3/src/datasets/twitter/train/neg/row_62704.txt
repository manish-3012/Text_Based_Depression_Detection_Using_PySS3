3/24/17 - i lost my purpose in life. Not sure how much longer i can deal with living in hellBefore my rant/cry out for help?
Im going to start making daily journal entries to see if im getting any better or not. This was recommended by my friend. I hope i dont have to end my life but if things get bad enough, ill do it

I really just want to talk to some people today. I think that'll make me feel better

I started off as just a semi depressed teenager going through some tough times, we all experience this. However, nothing got "better" for me. It kept on getting worse, school and home became a real life nightmare, contributing constant anxiety and depression, eventually leading to these sucidal thoughts. 

If you stay consistent in your life, you are more likely to be better off in life. The only thing my life that was consistent was my suicidal thoughts, along with depression and anxiety. I havent gone more than a week without really considering suicide. Every day im always depressed and down, and life oftens looks to me like a white room without any doors or windows, any opportunities or chances at getting out of my personal hellhole. I get a really severe/bad anxiety attack only once every few weeks, but when it comes, i go full fetal position for multiple hours without moving and sobbing uncontrollably. My heart beating goes up like crazy, i cant control my breathing or thoughts. My panic attacks just makes me unable to make sense of the already fucked up world around me. 

Like i previously stated in my past post, the only reason i really havent killed myself yet is my friends. I love them so much and hope they never have to deal with anything like i have to every day. 

I still have a will to live, but i think i lost my purpose in life. I dont know what my purpose in life is anymore.
