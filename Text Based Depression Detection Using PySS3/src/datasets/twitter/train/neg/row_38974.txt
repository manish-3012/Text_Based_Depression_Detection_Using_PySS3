Feel like suicide is the only way to get other people to realise how sick I am mentallyI know I probably look okay from the outside but almost every night I have some kind of suicidal ideation in my brain or some kind of suicidal thought. But I feel like I'm not allowed to phone a crisis line or tell my therapist because I feel like that's admitting to my own failure and that I'm clearly unable to cope with my mental health without the aid of someone else. When I'm at my worst and most irrational i am absolutely positive that everyone around me must think that i'm faking my illness or that I'm not struggling as much as I'm saying I am. It's shit and exhausting enough having a mental illness, let alone feeling like you always have to prove how sick you are to other people just so they believe you
