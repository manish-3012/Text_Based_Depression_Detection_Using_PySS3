So very sad and lost lately 25/f no friends or familyI feel like robot, waking up each day. Going to work, and coming home to get high or drunk because I cant stand my empty personal life.

It used to thrive. 

I only once thought life was worth ending it, but now I think more so and yet I lack the motivation to take action....
