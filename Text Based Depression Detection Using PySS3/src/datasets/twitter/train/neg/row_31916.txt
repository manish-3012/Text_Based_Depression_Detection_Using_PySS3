I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to live with constant painI have abdominal pain that will not go away no matter what medicine or treatment. I was told the latest diagnosis is â€˜functional painâ€™ which is basically what it sounds like. I have to function through my debilitating pain.


I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Every time I come home from an appointment my stepdad makes a point to ask what the new theory is, and ask me why I continue going to doctors. â€œSecond theory and you still want another? Why donâ€™t you just listen? Says something.â€ Is almost verbatim from him.


I keep going to doctors because I donâ€™t want to hear Iâ€™m just going to be in pain the rest of my life. I donâ€™t want to be miserable when maybe, if I see the right doctor, theyâ€™ll listen and find this rare disease that explains everything and is cursed easily. 


I donâ€™t want to die. I donâ€™t want to be gone forever. I have so much to live for. But right now I can barely see past tomorrow. Itâ€™s just constant pain. Mental and physical. I donâ€™t want to live a life where I canâ€™t walk three steps without the muscles in my legs seizing and I collapse. I donâ€™t want to live when all that happens is another doctor tells me Iâ€™m faking. Or another nurse looks at me with doubt in her eyes. Another resident just saying it constipation even when an x-ray shows Iâ€™m clear. I donâ€™t want to live in pain and apparently the only way is to die.


I just want it all to stop. I want the pain to stop. The flashbacks to stop. The offhand comments about my eating to stop. The comments from my stepdad. I just want silence.
