Looking forward to killing myselfI lost most of my money gambling, but I have a bit left. I'm going to try and work things out with my ex, and if it doesn't work, I first have some loose ends to tie up. In a few weeks, when I'm ready, and when I've planned out the method, I'm going to have some fun gambling with the last bit of my money. Become rich, or blow it all :) Then I'll kill myself. One little thing to look forward to.
