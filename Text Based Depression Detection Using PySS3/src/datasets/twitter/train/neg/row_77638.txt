I canâ€™t keep going like thisIâ€™ve told myself that I will stay alive just to reach my goal weight. That if I havenâ€™t lost anything this week then Iâ€™ll off myself. If I have, Iâ€™ll keep going until I reach that weight goal.

But my patience is wearing thin.. I just canâ€™t keep doing this. 
Iâ€™m not good for anything. I canâ€™t even save my friends from hurting themselves. 
It shows that I donâ€™t matter, that Iâ€™m not worth living for. 

I know Iâ€™m on borrowed time. 
Itâ€™s just a matter of when now. 

I donâ€™t even know why I posted here.
