What is wrong with me?Noone likes me.Nobody wants to talk to me.**nobody**.Is it because I just have a emotionless face? Noone want to be friends with me.Everyone just wants to get as far away as possible.Every day I try to live but the people here make me think I should just end it. I've been alone since my birth.
