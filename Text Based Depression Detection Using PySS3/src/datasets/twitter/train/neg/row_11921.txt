I just don't know what to do anymore..I don't want to live anymore because I know that I'll never really be happy. The only times in my life that I've felt any real ppositive feelings is when I've been with certain girls. I fall in love too hard and easily, and I know this is a problem, but I can't help it. Now I have no one, and I don't believe that I'll ever be able to be loved. I certainly don't love myself, and I never will. I'm a stupid and worthless sack of shit, and my only hope is that someone will deal with it, but it isn't fair. Nobody should have to deal with me just so I may be happy because I only make people unhappy. I have this effect on people where I tend to unknowingly make people sad.  Everybody who has ever known me gets progressively more unhappy in their own lives the longer they know and interact with me, and everyone who stops interacting with me tend to be happier. I'm a contagious plague of sadness with no hope for my own improvement, so it seems I have two options.. either kill myself or completely isolate myself away from everyone for their own good, but that does nothing for myself. 

Tl;dr My happiness is only achievable through others, and I only seem to ruin other's lives, making it unworthy for others to be there. So for the good of anyone I should die.
