Why do I try? Why am I here? I'm just a screw up anyways.I have no friends anymore. The last person I cared about completely stopped wanting anything to do with me because I snapped and had a bad emotional breakdown on them a couple days ago. I just want them to be my best friend again. They said they weren't gonna go. They said they wouldn't get mad at me. We were so close. We were friends since 7th grade. Idk what to do with any of it. I apologized a trillion times, but it does nothing if they don't trust that you aren't gonna hurt them again. I swear I do this to myself as a weird way of self harm. Anytime I have anyone I could even remotely call a best friend I just ruin everything between them. Idk why. I don't feel like i consciously do it. It just happens. It never seems to happen with people I could consider normal friends. 

I need an explanation on why I do this. Is it just so I make myself cry for days and so i can call myself names for days? Everyone I talk to just says I'm paranoid. Is it because I'm paranoid? If I don't have anyone to get out of the house with my mental health drops down significantly to the point of isolation from everything. To the point I don't want to talk to anyone or have any connection with anything outside of my room.
