I'm homeless in a month and I won't make it. I have tried for months to find a job in this city and no matter how hard I try, how many places I apply for I just can't make it work. I always showed up to interviews well dressed, groomed, spoke politely..I did everything you are supposed to do and nothing ever worked. I won't make it if I am forced to be homeless, Reddit. I've spent the last 3 nights talking on the phone with the suicide hotline because I truly do want to live, but I know that I will never make it if I am forced to live on the streets.

So..I'm going to take things into my own hands. Thank you for being here with me for the years that I enjoyed Reddit.
