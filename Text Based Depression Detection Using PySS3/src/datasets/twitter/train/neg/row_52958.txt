I feel like I donâ€™t have any place in this world..Today has been rough. Iâ€™ve struggled for years due to my narcissistic parents, being bullied, and experiencing a childhood sexual assault. Iâ€™ve carried about the scars from my past for years and Iâ€™ve never been able to move past any of it. Iâ€™ve started therapy recently but I feel like Iâ€™m too broken to even attempt to get help. Iâ€™ve struggled with speaking up, being assertive, setting boundaries, and trusting people for the majority of my life and just donâ€™t see how I could be of any value to the world. I have no self confidence, self esteem, or self worth. I feel so stupid, immature, and incompetent compared to my friends, coworkers, and other people around me. People can tell that I have no self confidence because they constantly tell me what to do at work. I seriously donâ€™t try to not do things: Iâ€™m just so used to being ignored, having no one take an interest in me or my thoughts, and never having anyone believe in me. Itâ€™s just so hard... would the world be better off without me? I compare myself so much the everyone at work and I feel so lost :(
