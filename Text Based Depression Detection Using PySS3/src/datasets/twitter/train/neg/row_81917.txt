I giveI am pathetic and I always have been. I have watched my life slip away... Man, Iâ€™ve probably slept through so much of it. I am a bad person. I lash out for no reason and I donâ€™t even understand myself. Iâ€™m going to die soon and I think that I welcome it. Everyone around me would probably think Iâ€™m joking, itâ€™s honestly kind of hilarious. I have joked about it for so long.

I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone though. Iâ€™m scared that people will feel responsible, but they shouldnâ€™t. No one did this to me, itâ€™s just how it is.

Itâ€™s so crazy... I have always been that person that tries to talk someone out of doing something, never thought itâ€™d be me.
