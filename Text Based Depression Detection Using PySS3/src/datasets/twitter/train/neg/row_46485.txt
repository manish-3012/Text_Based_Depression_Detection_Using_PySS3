I just feel kind of lost and broken, even when I shouldn't.Hey SW, I've been here a few times to counsel and I might have posted once, I can't remember.

Looking back, I was pretty depressed in middle school, I'm not sure that I entirely realized it at the time.  In the last couple years, I feel like I've been putting the pieces together: high school career ended well, good college, more confident in myself as a person etc.  And I'm only now discovering that I'm not really playing with a complete puzzle.  I just feel like something is missing, and that no matter what I do I can never be really happy.  And maybe nobody gets to finish their puzzle and complete their life, I have no idea really.  I look around and I seem to be ahead of a lot of people and maybe they're faking it but they don't seem to mind as much.  There are plenty of times when I feel content: with friends, when I have something to work on etc but it's almost just like putting a bandage on an infected wound, it's still there.

I'm not going to do anything too drastic like take my life in the near future, but I think I might still be on a bad path.  I considered cutting for the first time in a few months and I know that it's considered an unhealthy way to manage your emotions, but when I've tried it in the past it's sort of helped bring me back to reality and think more simplistically like an animal with needs and instincts and less like a human generating firstworldproblems for himself.  I think I need that perspective one way or another.  Working out and eating also provide that to an extent.
