Iâ€™m losing itEveryday I have multiple thoughts of just wanting to kill myself. I always think itâ€™s the only way to have people pay attention to me. Itâ€™s the only way to get attention. I just want someone to pay attention to me.  Itâ€™s awful to be lonely and thatâ€™s all I feel. I have friends but why do I feel they hate me and that they donâ€™t want me anymore. I just want to be free from myself.
