ImprovementAfter going inpatient twice within months of each other, nearly losing my closest friend completely, and having to hear my mom cry which is the absolute worst thing to me, I'm finally making improvement I think. I've been going to TMS therapy for two weeks and it's already helped a bit, plus having people support me and me not being afraid to ask for help. I also understand what made me so bad before and why I was so angry all the time. I'm doing better. It took years but I'm finally starting to reach the light I feel.
