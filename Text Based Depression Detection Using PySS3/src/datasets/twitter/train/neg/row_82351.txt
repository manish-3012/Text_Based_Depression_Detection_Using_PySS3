Nitrous oxide vs Opioid overdoseGreetings,

I see many people inclined to saying that Opioid overdoses are among the best ways to kick the bucket.


One of my favorite vices has always been nmda receptor antagonists(commonly dextromethorphan, ketamine, phencyclidine) and I've found some cases of [health professionals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/2589295/) and [others](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28631111/) using the common anesthesia nitrous oxide to end their life, I'm assuming more through oxygen deprivation.


Do you think it would be possible to find a tank large enough depraved of oxygen so as to insure my death ?



Thanks guys, hope you get the help you need.
