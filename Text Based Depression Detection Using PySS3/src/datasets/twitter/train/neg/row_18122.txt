Iâ€™m a criminal.Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for a while but now itâ€™s come to a tipping point. During the summer I made the terrible mistake of touching a friend when she was asleep as she moved my hand to there. So Iâ€™m a sexual assailant now. My cute girlfriend found out today and has broken up with me. All my friends will find out soon and Iâ€™ll have nothing. Soon one of them will call the cops and send me to prison and get kicked out of college. My life is over and Iâ€™m close to finishing it up.
