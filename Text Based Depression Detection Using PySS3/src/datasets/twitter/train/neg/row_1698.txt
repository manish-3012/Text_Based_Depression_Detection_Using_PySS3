I just donâ€™t like living that much (27 yo)Recently over the last maybe 3-4 years I have steadily become more depressed. I remember a time when I liked living when I was younger maybe 19-23 but now... I just donâ€™t care. I want to die

I have some great friends a loving and supporting family, lucrative skills and experience and I should be having a great time right now travelling South America.

But everything I do feels so forced and meaningless

I am so lonely inside myself... cold...

I want to die. I think I will kill myself this year. I just donâ€™t want to live anymore and the thoughts of suicide are coming more often now

I know people will be upset but itâ€™s my life and I donâ€™t like living - I donâ€™t care about being selfish itâ€™s my body.

I research methods every month or so to see how I can do it. The 2 methods I think about are hanging or crashing into a tree

And thatâ€™s it basically

I want to disappear
