I am planning to kill myself this summer on my birthday and am starting to finally accept it.I've had depression and anxiety as long as I can remember. Recently switched to a new medication after the last one not working, that makes at least five that I've tried. At best they only work half of the time, and nothing else I do (exercise, eating right, sleep, talking with friends and family, therapy) seems to do fuck all. 

For years I have contemplated suicide and got very close during a relationship a few years ago. My heart has never healed from the trauma of how it ended, and I honestly can't imagine ever wanting to fall in love again.  I have a girlfriend now but I really don't love her. I'm just too much of a coward to be alone. 

Two weeks before I finally do it (I have the method and location picked out after years of uncertainty) I will be getting rid of my things, quitting my job, and breaking up with my girlfriend. I plan to royally fuck things up so I don't decide to back out. I want there to be nothing left for me to live for.

I still have to write notes to loved ones. I hate to think how this will affect them, but every morning feels like a punch to the gut and it hurts too goddamn much to go on. I have no hope left for the future. 

I have been asked probably a dozen times if I am feeling suicidal (by therapists and others) and if I have a plan to kill myself, and I always lie or simply say that I have "suicidal thoughts" but no plan. Technically that was true: I didn't have one plan, I had lots of plans. But now I've settled on one. 

I really wish I had the courage to tell someone how I feel, but I don't want to end up in the hospital, further in debt because of medical bills and have everyone thinking I'm fucking crazy. I'm really glad I got to tell someone out there in the world though, and I really appreciate any of you who have taken the time to read this. It means a lot.
