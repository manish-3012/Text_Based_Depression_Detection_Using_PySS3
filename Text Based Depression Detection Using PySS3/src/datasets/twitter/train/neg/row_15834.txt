i can't take it anymoreeverything in my life went downhill, I have nobody and I feel like I'll never have a future I can't take it anymore and I'm only 14 I don't think I should feel this pain at 14. this is all happening just 3 days before my bday

idk if this is a sub where I could vent but I just wanna know that I'm not alone
