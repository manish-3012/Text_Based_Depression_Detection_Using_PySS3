I can't cope please helpSo I'm bi and 13 and i just cant cope my mum hates me and my parents are going to disown me when they find out im bi (they've made it clear that religion is over family). My classmates are mocking me because I accidently swore loudly in class so the teacher took me out of the class. My grandma who basically raised me when i was really young is terminally ill and dying. My friend nearly killed herself 2 weeks ago. I have some kind of mental illness so i already feel suicidal and deppresed. I think im going through another deppriesive episode and i cant deal with another one because i nearly killed myself last time and this time it's worse. I don't know what to do because my mum also gaslights me i think and if i tell her this shell just say I'm being selfish and making her and my dad worry and last time/the only time I ever told her I was suicidal she said I was selfish and it was my fault Satan decided to test my "faith" because I must have an easy target. I don't know how to cope please help my parent are gonna disown me any way so I should just kill myself to save my mum the hassle of cutting me off.
