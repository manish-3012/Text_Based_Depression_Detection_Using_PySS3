Iâ€™ve been suffering from depression for a while but I just found out that Iâ€™ve been expelled for something I didnâ€™t do.My friends, everyone I once knew, gone in a flash. My future is out the window as well. My parents are probably going to be extremely disappointed with me. So Iâ€™m going to do it. Tonight Iâ€™m going to drink Purell and take some benzos and finally put my life of disappointment to sleep, for one last time. Itâ€™s been a fun ride but this is too much.
