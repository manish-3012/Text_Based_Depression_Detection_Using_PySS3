I'm lostI feel like shit I genuinely dont know what to do anymore. My whole life took a different turn I dont know what to do I genuinely do. I want to just forget about everything.  I keep reliving the memories my mind is constantly remembering it.6 years I'm not improving six years of constant r*pe it's manifesting me. I thought my life couldnt get any worse but someone I trusted someone I saw being close was accused of being a r*pist. I wanted to believe it wasnt true I messege them but no response. It hurts it really does I'm still unsure of that situation but it carries so much weight. Deep down I wonder if I just waited longer would they respond back I dont know. I try to stay away from s*x from anything remotely sexual but it comes back. My horny ex keeps trying to hit me up. My trauma is manifesting me I'm isolating myself from people more often. It's hard it's hard to deal with all. I don't know if I'm made for this life. I'm too sensitive, naive, and a mess I hate myself and every moment I'm on my bed i can't help but cry i feel so alone i feel alone i feel alone I feel this whole world out to get me I dont know anymore. I just know my urges been strong. Keep having thoughts of ending it all I don't care anymore about the consequences. If my family just ughhh wth I just wanted to live my life normally but I cant I can't I cant. Why is it whenever I find my peace I feel like I'm improving I feel like I'm just becoming a functional. I'm not cut for this I just want a way out if death was so easy I would've just done it right away.
