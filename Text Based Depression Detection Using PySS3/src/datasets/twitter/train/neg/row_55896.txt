Lets think about the worstSo. I kill myself. On a day, everyone will know about it. Some will cry, some will be sad, some will be just disappointed. But all of them will realize that this dude killed himself because he couldnt handle it anymore. Everyone who knows me will be sad at school about a week. My classmates will recover after two weeks. It will take about a month to recover for a guy who Im sitting with. My best friend should be fine in a month. When the summer comes he will be completely fine. He has a lot of other friends and he sometimes will think that I could be with him, maybe he would wish he had an opportunity to stop me. My family. Half of the year for my brother and dad. And a year for my mum. Church and its community will help her. When I hid my birthday from everyone my bff said that I dont know how to enjoy the life. He is right. I only see bad and negative. As im writing this im heavily considering if its worth it. I could end it tomorrow. My misery that lasted 6 months could be ended. But is it really that bad? Not sure. Help
