Struggle with post-concussion syndrome and as a result want to end my lifeIâ€™ve had PCS for over 3 years and recently in August started to slowly recover at a faster pace. I started driving again, wasnâ€™t really sensitive to sound unless I was tired, anxiety was much lower, I was motivated, I had goals, and just really started to feel better. 

And then I hit my head in late October at my moms friends house that I knew was dangerous but she still forced me to go there. Not even that hard but hard enough to bring back some symptoms. Seems like I may be declining too because Iâ€™m more sensitive to sound that I remember being. I dont want to believe I hit my head and want to blame it on using my phone more but I just donâ€™t know. 

I told myself everyday you canâ€™t kill yourself because youâ€™re going to get better or something will com out to help and then bam not even health for a couple months. I hate my mother for this. Sheâ€™s abusive and doesnâ€™t even care Iâ€™m sick again and thatâ€™s no responsibility for me getting hurt. 

I feel defeated and donâ€™t know where to go from here. Itâ€™s less likely that Iâ€™ll recover from this because Iâ€™ve been hurt so many times. I just want a life
