I just want to kill myself over the most trivial shitOf I course I want to kill myself because in general I just kind of hate my life, but I keep noticing that little things sincerely make me want to jump off a bridge. It can be the tiniest shit ever, and I'll just be like "oh, I'll just fucking kill myself." It's not even in a meme way, it's this sincere yearning to kill myself after for example clicking the wrong app on my phone, dropping something, not getting fast enough responses from people even when I know they have a life so it shouldn't be such a big deal, something insignificant going differently than how I thought it would. I honestly lose sleep over pondering what's wrong with me, cause there's so much and I don't know how to fix any of it. I want to feel purposeful, like my life actually has some meaning to it instead of just waking up for school, coming home, going to bed and repeating. I'm just a straight up fucking mess, not the cute type, the unstable type
