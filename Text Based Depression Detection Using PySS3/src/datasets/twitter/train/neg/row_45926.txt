I Am Always Called Namessince i was 10 9 years ago i was always being called a liar... Even today and my beat friend actually left me when I said it he didn't fucking believe me i can't take it anymore.... it hurts my emotions ive failed my friends and family all i am is a waste of fucking space.... i tried to get hit earlier.... i decided im just gonna OD... i am afraid of living because im always hurt.... i have nothing left in this world besides my friend killed herself... i may be dead soon but if not I'll let you know. thanks. ~Sincerely Michaela
