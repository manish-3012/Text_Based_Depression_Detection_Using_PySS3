Iâ€™ve made up my mindIm pretty sure that soon Iâ€™ll be gone. I just wanted to say that I hope every lost soul here looking for comfort finds happiness even if it is in small fleeting moments. You ARE worthy of life, no matter how much youâ€™ve been abused, unloved, abandoned, no matter what horrible things you tell yourself and no matter how evil this world seems, it is possible to climb out of this pit you are in and find what makes you happy. Even if you are so depressed you canâ€™t shower for weeks or get out of bed I hope for at least one day you can smile at your favorite pet snuggling up to you, I hope you smile when you beat your favorite video game or find a small hobby that gives you joy. I hope you can find joy in small fleeting moments, enough to keep going for even a minute more.
