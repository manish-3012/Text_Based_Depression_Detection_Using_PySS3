I want to die I'm so tired I've been in pain for so long.I said to my therapist to give me a fucking solution or a thing to do cause don't know what to try anymore and he didn't know himself. Apparently he said to my mom that he has seen young people in depression for even longer than I have been. It's been years. I can't take it
