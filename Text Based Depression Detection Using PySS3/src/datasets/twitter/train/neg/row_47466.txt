I think tomorrow is the day.I keep on postponing killing myself.  I keep on trying to find a reason to stay.  Like procrastinating on my own suicide. I tell myself "If this person  reaches out I'll give it another try" or "If I reach out for help and they listen to me". None of those things have happened. I think tomorrow is the day I finally go. I wish I had done it sooner because now I'll go feeling abandoned and being mad at those who I used to love whereas before I just felt lonely and burdensome.  I'm not sure why I'm writing this but I have to tell someone. I'm sorry for doing this to my family but I just can't anymore.
