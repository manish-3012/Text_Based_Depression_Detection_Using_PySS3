I am getting pretty worried for my safety.I tried to hang myself 2 weeks ago, failed unfortunately, and nothing has improved.   
I have PTSD, BPD, Severe Depressional episodes and I have psychotic episodes.    
My PTSD and BPD are actually OK... I have the odd symptoms every now and again but that's fine.   
Its the other 2 that are kicking my ass.  
I'm in the midst of another psychotic episode, and my brain has just completey given up trying to fight it.    
I WANT to fight it, but I just can't, I don't have it in me anymore.     
I honestly think I'm going to try it again in the next couple of days... My partner is working splits... I have 3 hours to try it.    
I need to find a way to barricade the bathroom door, because when he finds that note, he will try breaking it down.  
It seems too hopeless.   
If I'm going to like this for the rest of my life, there is no point in me suffering through mental illness for the next 60 years or so.  
Its just pointless, I'm just barely surviving as it is... I'm sorry
