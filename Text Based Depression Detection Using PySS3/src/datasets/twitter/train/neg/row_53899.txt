Please respondI've been through heartbreak and depression and anxiety and today I has a taste of all the together. Or rather I was drowned in the combination. I have been sad about a breakup for 2 months now. I loved her and she abandoned me because of my depression. She didn't even want to be friends she just left. I was crying about it and my parents started yelling at me today about how I should man up and move on and it's all my fault . How she's happy so I should be happy without her. They even threatened to take my new Germany shepherd pup away. I'm messed up right now and I feel so empty and alone. What do I do , fucking hell fuck fuck fuck fuck
