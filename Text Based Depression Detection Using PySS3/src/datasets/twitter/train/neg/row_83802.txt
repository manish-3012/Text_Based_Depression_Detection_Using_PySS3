I can't go on.I'm sitting here staring at my .45. Trying to keep from putting it in my mouth, I keep thinking how 5 lbs of pressure, and it's all over.  
  I'm tired of being tired. Of hating myself. I live like a hermit. I go to work and come home to cower in my 800 sq. ft. Apartment because I can't stand to be in the world anymore.
  I'm sick of being such a piece of shit. I'm tired of crying at the drop of a hat. Things That used to rouse my spirits no longer work.
  I'm so broken. It's been almost 5 years since I've been intimate with anyone. Now I can't even maintain platonic relationships. I'm lonely,but I don't know how to be around people anymore.
  I have reached a point where i resent the few friends I haven't alienated yet for wasting their time with me. So I don't want to hurt them, but I can't do this any longer. No one I know will read this, but I still want to apologize for everything. It will be better once I work up the nerve to do this. To anyone else who reads this I'm sorry for wasting your time too.
