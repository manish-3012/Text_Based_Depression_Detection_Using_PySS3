At a dead endLately when I think about jumping off a building I feel relieved. Maybe it means that I really should kill myself. I've always thought that I'd have so much success because I thought I had long-term goals but really I'm just stressed as fuck.  After my ex broke up with me 8 years ago, I've been wrecked. I thought girls would love me because I'm funny but I try too hard and struggling with social anxiety. Yes. I'm in therapy. Thanks for listening or whatever. I always complain.
