I quit my jobAnd dropped my dog off at my moms house. It's not even part of a plan, I'm just too depressed to get out of bed. Couldn't even take the dog out. But the pain is too much, even in my warm bed with the tv on, I can't stop the pain. It's driving me insane, I would do anything to make it stop. If this was physical pain id be on a morphine drip right now.
