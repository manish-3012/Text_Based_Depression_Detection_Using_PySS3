I'm not going to kill myself but I want to die every day (follow up)Hi everybody. I just want you all to know that I am doing much better now. Life is finally starting to look colorful again, and I'm realizing that the break up was such a blessing - I would have been miserable with her. I ignored so many red flags, as one who is "in love" would. A small example: I would clean up her entire apartment, just for her to come back and yell at me for not doing the laundry; it's things like that I should've paid attention to, but luckily I don't even have to anymore. I know what I'm worth now, and if we were face to face, I would be able to walk away with confidence. I'm truly happy again, and I just want to thank everybody who was here to help me through this.

- For those of you who don't know, my fiancee left me without much of a word or real reason.

tl;dr My fiancee left, and I felt awful. But now I'm so much better.
