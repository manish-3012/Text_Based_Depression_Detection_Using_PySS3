Is true peace only attainable after death?I can't escape from suffering and I'm too weak to take it without flinching any longer. I'm starting to crumble under the pressure.

No matter what, there are plenty of things I can do little about. Like having to go to a job and deal with tiredness and unfairness. Like dealing with relatives whom I didn't choose and from whom I can't escape. Health is starting to be a bother as I get older. Frustration from the impossibility of realizing dreams and desires. Living in a country that leaves a lot to be desired.

And more importantly: an overall feel of emptyness. I feel like fixing the above wouldn't help much.

It's like Buddha and Krishna said: earthly life is inevitable suffering, therefore seek enlightenment.

I feel like the only place I can get some rest is God. And I wish I could just reach the state. I can't. I feel abandonned. I feel I can't overcome the gravity of negativity of this world for it is too strong. I try to follow spiritual teachings, and the minute I find some shining in the darkness, something undesired happens â€“ as if taunting me "you thought this is all? now take that! we'll see if you really got the lessons!" It's so tiresome.

Now I am thinking that these limitations mostly have to do with having a body. Without a body I won't need a job. I won't be tied to places and people don't like. Physical health is not applicable there. Etc.

Do I need to first let go of the body if I am to find lasting peace? I'm so tired from all these vicissitudes of life. I'm fed up with humanness. 

I'm thinking of suicide way too much lately. I sometimes hold a knife to my chest and imagining pressing on. Or looking down from the window, picturing myself falling down. Or thinking of getting drugs and getting it over with. Etc. Can't live like that anymore...
