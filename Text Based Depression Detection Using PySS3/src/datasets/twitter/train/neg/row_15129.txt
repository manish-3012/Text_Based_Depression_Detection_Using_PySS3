Worst day in a long time.Probably going to get kicked out of my home, lose my car and my cat, cant afford to attend school anymore and cant get financial aid, and now my girlfriend (the one person who makes me smile) is probably going to leave me.

About to go to my medicine cabinet and see how many pills I can shove down my throat before I pass out and die. Been a long time coming and today may be the breaking point.
