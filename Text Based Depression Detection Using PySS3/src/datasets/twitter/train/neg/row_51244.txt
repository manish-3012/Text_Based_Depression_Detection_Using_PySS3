he said i hurt them, i have no other choicemy husband told me i am different. he told me i am not the same person. i know that im not. i am not happy. but it has been a long time. and the only reason that i have even remotely appeared happy is because i have been pretending, for the sake of him, and my kids...but i just *can't* do it anymore. i told him that. he says he wants *me* back. this **is** me. this is who **I** am. what if this is as good as it gets? i don't feel joy. i don't feel happiness. i dont smile. i dont laugh. its not to hurt people. its not intentional. i just...dont enjoy life. i dont want to be alive. i **do** try. i really do. i go to therapy. i take my meds, but i am so tired. he says he doesn't know how much more he can take because this is hurting him and the kids. :'( i can't do that. i dont want to do that, but what if this doesnt get better? this has gone on too long and **i am tired**. i just want to go. i don't want to hurt them anymore. he's at work now. he told me i disappoint him. so it wont be a shock to him to die...
