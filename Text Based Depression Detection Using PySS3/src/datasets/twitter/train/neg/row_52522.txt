I'm lostHello,

I'm 24 and still have yet to graduate college. Today I left maybe the 8th or 9th part-time job I've had. I've never lasted more than a month at any job. 

This is all my fault. I fluff up my resume to seem like I'm better then I really am. The person on that resume is not me in reality. I'm a mess. I can't handle my emotions. I'm a loser.

I'm having suicidal thoughts. I have had three attempts before. I don't think that I can put my family and friends through that pain again. A lot of times what stops me is the pain it will cause. I also can't do that to my boyfriend. I think he deserves better and I want him to be with someone who has their shit together and can at least function like a normal human being.

I want to kill myself because I have no income of my own and at this rate never will. I suck up my parents money. I'm basically just existing, and have been doing that the past four years. I feel like I'm never really going to change. I can trick myself into believing that I have, but deep down I'm this complete failure. I had a lot of hope when I got this job and now that I've ruined yet another one I don't know where to go. A lot of this is my fault. I'm just stuck now.

I'm stuck. It would be so easy for me to kill myself if I didn't have people who care about me. I'm staying alive for them right now. I'm angry that that's the reason why I'm still alive. But I love them too much.
