So bored and lonely I want to dieI'm so bored and lonely that I want to kill myself. I have nothing to do, nothing to look forward to. I've tried to take up hobbies and just lost interest, I've been doing this my entire life since I was a child. There is nothing I can do. I do not have friends I can reach out to or spend time with (I'm not exxagerating. I have no friends at all) and I do not feel close enough to my family to spend time with them. I lost interest in things I had an interest in and up until now the only thing stopping me from ending it were my dogs. Now I don't even care about that. What can I do? I just want to be alone and do nothing, but I don't want to be alone and I want to do something. Does this even make sense?
