It's the little things in life that make me want to kill myselfThe sound of the birds in the morning. It reminds me how much I love the night and how opposite I am of most people.

The fact that the laws of physics are always actively working against you. If you drop something it breaks. Nothing lasts. When you get in your car your clothing gets caught on the door. It rips. Now you look like shit before work.

Nothing works the way you want. You have to just be content with less. I fucking hate people. I fucking hate myself. 

Most people are soo fucking annoying. They don't realize that nobody gives a shit about what they have to say. At my job, I'm paid to care. outside just fuck off. 

life sucks
