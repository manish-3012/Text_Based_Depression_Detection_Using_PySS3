Feeling so so emptyI donâ€™t know but I felt the need to write these things down here, Iâ€™m really not at a good point in life right now. I feel really bad again. Itâ€™s getting worse. People say things get better but I find it so hard to believe recently with all the bad things happening. I wish I would have hope but day after day I just hate everything even more. Itâ€™s endless. People who mean a lot to me and try so hard for me to make me happy, Iâ€™m cold and distant and I hate it but I find it so hard to show any affection. I donâ€™t deserve such amazing people. It makes me feel so much worse when someone treats you ever so well. Instead, I sit at home, I cry all the time, I canâ€™t sleep, my self confidence is non existent at this point, I feel very lost. My life is like this routine I canâ€™t get out of, i really want to change but I donâ€™t know how
