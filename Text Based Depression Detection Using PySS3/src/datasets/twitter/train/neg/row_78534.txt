I just want it to endVent. 

I'm so tired of life. I'm not even angry or upset with people or circumstances anymore. I just want it to stop. I can't ever do anything right. I try and I try and I try, and it's never good enough. Not for my dad, not for my sister, not for my bf, and certainly not for my mom. They would be so much better off without me. - Mom wouldn't have to spend thousands of dollars for my college. She could go travel like she's always wanted to but never been able to because of me. 
-My sister wouldn't have to mother me and take care of me anymore. 
-Dad wouldn't have to be disappointed in me anymore. 
-My bf wouldn't have to deal with me anymore either, he could go do what he wants and not have to worry about me. 
Everyone would be better off without me in the way. And I couldn't hurt anyone anymore. I just want it to end.
