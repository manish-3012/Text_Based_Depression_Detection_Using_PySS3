I donâ€™t care anymoreI canâ€™t deal with stress anymore. I canâ€™t deal with being me. Why even be alive if youâ€™re not exceptional or great? Or even happy. So many are better at so much than I am. Iâ€™m worthless. I donâ€™t care, and neither does anyone else. Oh, theyâ€™ll say they care. But empathy doesnâ€™t exist. Itâ€™s just an act we all put on because we are worried about how things affect us. I donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore, and the only thing I feel besides sadness is pure rage and hate. I donâ€™t even care about my dog; heâ€™s a nuisance. My friends are a nuisance. And I detest my family; theyâ€™ve done nothing wrong except have the arrogance to create me. Iâ€™ll delete this soon after I post it. Fuck it.
