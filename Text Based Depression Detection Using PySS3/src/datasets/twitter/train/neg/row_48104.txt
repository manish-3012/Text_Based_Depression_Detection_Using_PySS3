This is something i wrote after a very painfull night.
Itâ€™s kinda long and i use words like fuck or fucking to fill some small gaps. English is not my first language so any feedback on grammar and stuff like that would be helpful. I hope that some of you connects to the text and know that you are not alone! 




Up at night cause nothing is right
No one can help me cause i just lie
Cause i just know that they will make my waste me time 
Trying to sell my shit about how life is right

But they never understand what im going through
Trying to hold on so i dont let the bullet shoot
Then i scream at myself like what the fuck do i do

Pumping myself with drugs is the only tool
So i can finally repair my biggest wound
But im stuck here bleeding like a fool


Cause the meds didnt help 
What a suprise
That nothing went right in this holy fucking life
Where are the angels when you are taken by the dark
Is it only me that just want a restart?

I was wronged since birth
There is no question
Whether i should go on or fucking end it

So please dear god hear my last cry
Make my family forget and we will be alright.
