I just had my first dry shotgun in the mouth scenarioI recently reached out to a close family member about a potential bipolar personality disorder that I think I have (she happens to be successfully recovering/ dealing with bipolar disorder  rock star).  I'm not looking for attention. I'm tired of our culture and my broken family and my lonely struggling independence. My mom has it. I'm 30 now and I see signs.
