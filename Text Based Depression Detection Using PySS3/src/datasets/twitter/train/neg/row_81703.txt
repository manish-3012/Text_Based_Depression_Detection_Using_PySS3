SuicidalIâ€™m slowly saving pills and going to crunch them up into a deadly cocktail for me. Iâ€™m tired of life, tired of trying, tired of my illness being a burden to everyone around me. I seriously am better off dead. I have no partner, no full time job, no kids, nothing to life for really......watching myself age. Life is kind of cruel.
