It's calling...There's a railway bridge over a rushing river not far from me.  It calls out to me.  I dream, no, fantasize of jumping from it.  I fight the call, but it's so soothing and promises me nought but quiet rest, if only I do this.

My battle may not last much longer, for the call grows strong in every otherwise quiet moment.
