I want to kill myself every single day. I'm in middle school. Please help.I've been thinking extreme suicidal thoughts since I was in fifth grade. Even back in first grade I was thinking of ways to kill myself, even having to hold myself back from jumping off the bridge into the creek, even if I didn't know why at the time. It feels like the end of the world when someone so much as gets slightly angry at me. I have no reason to live and no redeeming qualities. Somebody please help. I don't know how much lomger I can go on. I'm only still here because I'm a coward and I don't want to inconvenience my theater group by killing one of their lead actors. I don't know what to do.
