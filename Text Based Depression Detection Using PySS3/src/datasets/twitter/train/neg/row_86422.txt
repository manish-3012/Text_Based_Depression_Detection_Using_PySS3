First time considering in a long time, and the most seriouslyI don't even know where to start. Been the most depressed I've been in a while and maybe ever for more than a week now, been getting there for months. Crying all the time. Debt. Shitty job, can't catch up. My cat is really sick and I can't afford the vet bills. Car needs work. Living in a government supported apartment and feel worthless. Low self esteem, can feel eating disorder come back. Missed my wisdom tooth appointment and am constantly nauseous and uncomfortable. Haven't been able to sleep for months. Sleeping pills don't do much. Want to take all of them and slip away. Want to make sure someone will take care of the cat for me. Feel hopeless and giving up. I even scheduled an emergency therapy appointment but my therapist wasn't available. The person I got scheduled with told me I need to accept that my cat might not live very long. Told me my insecurity was going to drive my boyfriend away. Giving up.
