I promised my friend I would hold out until next year, but Iâ€™m really regretting it now.I have one friend. I really do care about her so much, sheâ€™s the only friend I have and Iâ€™d say weâ€™re sorta close. We talked about plans this upcoming holiday season, and I promised her I would stay until after then.

God damn, I regret that. I canâ€™t make it that long. Itâ€™s a harder struggle every day. But...I made a promise. I canâ€™t lie to her like that. I guess I have to stick around, but fuck, man. If it werenâ€™t for that, Iâ€™d be out of here. 

Hereâ€™s hoping I can power through it until then.
