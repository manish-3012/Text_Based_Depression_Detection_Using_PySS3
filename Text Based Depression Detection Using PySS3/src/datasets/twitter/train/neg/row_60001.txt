Shit is just not worth itI just know I didn't bust my ass in school, accumulating all this debt and stress and all kinds of fucked up affects to my mental health to be in damn near poverty, unable to take care of myself. This can not be life. I deprived myself if joy hoping that it will pay off in the future but it hasn't. I guess I'm wrap AF but I don't want to struggle like this. Death has to be a better outcome. We'll see
