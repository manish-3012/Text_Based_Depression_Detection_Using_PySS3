She left meShe was my soul mate. My everything. No one else in this world cares about me period. She saw none of my flaws. She was perfect in every way. I was her forever &amp; always and vice versa. We talked about having kids, getting married. It was me &amp; her vs the world. Now all of a sudden, she loves me but doesnâ€™t want us anymore. All of a sudden Iâ€™m not worth anymore. Iâ€™m nothing. I havenâ€™t eaten in 3 days. Itâ€™s really not worth it without her. She was the only thing in my life I have to look forward to. I canâ€™t ever be with someone else knowing I was with her. She was everything. I might as well end it now. Whatâ€™s the point. I have nothing to look forward to besides texting and hanging out with her all the time. I canâ€™t have that anymore. My life is so shit. Iâ€™m gonna end it all. If I canâ€™t be her everything I donâ€™t wanna be anything.
