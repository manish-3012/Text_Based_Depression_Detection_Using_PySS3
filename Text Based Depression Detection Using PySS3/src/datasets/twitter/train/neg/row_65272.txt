Itâ€™s becoming a struggle to get out of bed in the morning.Iâ€™m in so much emotional pain right now that itâ€™s causing me to severely spiral. Iâ€™m not going to kill myself but the idea of it is extremely appealing. I just want to stop thinking. I want to be a new person. I donâ€™t want myself. Iâ€™m 20 and Iâ€™m barely holding on to the two friends that I have. 

Iâ€™m so tired of going to work and smiling ear to ear as if everything is okay. Iâ€™m tired of college and want to quit every second. I even want to quit my job. I know I canâ€™t do that because I canâ€™t stay in my parents house forever...

I donâ€™t have a car and live in the u.s south, Iâ€™m double fucked. 

I just.

I donâ€™t know.

Iâ€™m scared to see a therapist because I donâ€™t want to be committed. Therapists are supposed to be safe places right? If I tell them Iâ€™ve been suicidal since the fifth grade will they commit me? Canâ€™t I just get the drugs from a psychiatrist and skip the therapy? I donâ€™t want to talk anymore. Iâ€™m as good as a mute.

I feel like Iâ€™m out of options here. My thoughts arenâ€™t coherent - I feel like Iâ€™m getting worse and worse. When exactly will I be in the good days again?
