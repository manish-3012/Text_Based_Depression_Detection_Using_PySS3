I almost killed myself today...I almost killed myself today,
to let all this pain go away.
Today's attempt was different than the past,
As it was almost my last.
I decided to go to jump in the ocean for a swim,
If I went far enough chances to be saved would be slim.
So I swam as far as I could,
This time it will be for good.
I got far, panicked, and tried to swim back,
I was too tired, and started to have an asthma attack.
I started to drown but felt at peace,
I could have been dead, my life finally ceased.
But then I felt a hand, a man pulled me out,
He saved my life, in my mind I cursed him no doubt.
If it wasn't for that jet ski, I would not be suffering,
I'm still in pain, now just recovering.
I just want to die... I just want to die
