Found my daughter's Reddit account and her last post on this sub. I've been working through my grief since she took her own life, and it is hitting me again.I immediately sign up for Reddit and come to this sub. I lost my 16-year-old daughter to suicide 4 months ago. We knew what happened to her and we just don't want to talk much about it. It breaks my heart knowing what she went through. We did everything to help her but couldn't save her. Today her mother and I were looking for some pictures. We realized she probably saved it in her phone. So we decided to charge her phone. Actually we really miss her, we can't accept the fact that she is gone. 
After opened it we saw pop-up notifications on Reddit. I went there and checked it out, so this is where I found my daughter's account
 /u/rebeccadavi .  It has always been logged in. I began to read all her posts that had been written and I can't take it anymore.Â I also see the comments people gave her, which is so kind. As a parent, I can't thank you enough. Thank you so much for the help you gave my daughter. She's gone but she will never be forgotten.
