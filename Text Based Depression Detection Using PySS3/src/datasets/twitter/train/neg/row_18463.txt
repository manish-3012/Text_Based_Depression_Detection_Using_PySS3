Saying 'you're not alone' is stupidThis is the worst piece of advice you could possibly give somebody  


It doesn't ease your thoughts, it trivialises them to the point where you yourself aren't sure if you deserve to feel the way you do, which makes you feel worse. I have seen so many posts on here from people with so many reasons to feel the way they do, so when I hear that I'm 'not alone', I feel fucking stupid because the people who do feel the way I do have some sort of reason  


People who comfort others about suicide stick to a template and it's a fucking stupid template at that, please don't say this to other people
