Will someone talk to me? Please ??Iâ€™ve lost control of everything in my life from my independence, personality, self worth, career to my own health. I donâ€™t even remembered what it feels like to feel even remotely normal or happy or having a desire to live. Everyone I even attempt to talk about it, just tells me â€œyouâ€™ll be good â€ or tries to dodge the topic because itâ€™s so depressing or refuses to acknowledge the severity of my problems. My own parents/friends think Iâ€™m a looser pussy who doesnâ€™t leave the house because heâ€™s just â€œlazy.â€ Like no god dam it I just want to die. Itâ€™s not like my days are spent eating junk food and playing video games theyâ€™re spent in fetal position crying and self loathing. My parents also tell me to â€œstop feeling bad for yourself and grow upâ€ I donâ€™t even know where to start or canâ€™t imagine this feeling of darkness to ever subside. I also am having the worst health problems that Iâ€™ve ever experienced and theyâ€™re so debilitating making it harder to function and making my depression 10x worse. I donâ€™t know why my life has come to this and why I have such an urge to die. It would be so relieving to die but Iâ€™ll never have the balls to do it myself. Iâ€™m so confused to why everyone else is living their lives, in good/normal health  graduating college, getting good jobs and Iâ€™m sitting here like a Fucking old women in hospice. Thereâ€™s short  minute long ,commercial like moments where Iâ€™ll have a burst of energy to take my life back but it always dissipates. Fuck. This is no one way to live and i am complEtely numb and have nothing left to offer to this world let alone myself. Can someone please answer and talk to me this is like the 3rd post that no one has really replied to and I just want to feel acknowledged and maybe talk to someone else going through the same living hell.
