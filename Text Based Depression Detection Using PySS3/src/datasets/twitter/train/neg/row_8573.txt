Seriously considering itI think I'm gonna do it. I cant help but to think it's the only way to end all suffering. Nothing is gonna help. I don't care if I'm being selfish. They'll get over it, they'll move on, I wont be their worry/burden anymore. I'm hardly invested in their lives and they're not even invested in mine at all. No one cares to ask me how I'm doing, what I'm doing, how im feeling. It feels like everything is moving forward and I'm just stagnant. I hate feeling this way. I'm losing my mind. I'm not sure anything is real anymore. I dont remember the last time I felt loved.
