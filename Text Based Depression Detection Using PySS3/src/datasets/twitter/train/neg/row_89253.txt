PermissionMy therapist expressed concern with my "high functioning" depression. I got good grades work a40 hour week and maintain friendships even a relationship for 6years. but i still sometimes hurt myself and freak out over little things not going perfectly.  When i asked why that concerned her, i thought it'd be a good thing considering im not lying in bed crying all day every day. She said that people with high functioning depression are the ones that have successful suicide attempts. They're the ones who fly under the radar and don't get help in time because they seem fine up until it's too late. Somehow my mind took that as permission to continue planning and researching my death. Like what if its to late for me. She basically said she wouldn't be able to stop me if that's what i wanted. And it is. At least i think it is.
