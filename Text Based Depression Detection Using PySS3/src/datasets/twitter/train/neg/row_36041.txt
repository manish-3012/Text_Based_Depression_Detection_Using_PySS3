I need helpI really lost it all.Im 17 and i feel like I lost so much.Im small,skinny 50 kg.I never did something to be proud.I have like 2 friends i go to a school i didnt want to go,i dont have good grades.I feel like all my luck disappeard after i failed to enter a military highschool after that that shit i got testicular torsion and got my right testicle removed.That fucked me up so good.In conclusion im ugly skinny stupid dont have friends and dont have future.The only good thing is that im going to the gym but i dont know if its going to help me.I got fucked by life so many times and im done with this boring shit,i dont want to wake up in this shit of country in my stupid city to see people who talk behind my back like idiots.Im strong person mentaly but sometimes i have some moments when i get so sad and depressed i feel like i need to drink or smoke a cig...
Any tips...
Want to go in the military btw...
