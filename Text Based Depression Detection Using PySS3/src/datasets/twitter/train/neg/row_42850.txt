Anyone.I feel like a huge cry baby, as I've posted this same message multiple times, but everyday it gets more serious. I'm afraid of myself. I've lost all my "friends", the only person I ever trusted to get close to finally told me he cannot be with me and has cut all contact with me, regardless of my attempts to reach out. Every time I go on any form of social media and see him moving on after only a few days after years I want to not wake up even more. I'm an empty shell walking around, and I don't know what I'm suppose to do, and I don't know who to turn to. Every time the sun goes down I become a little more afraid of what will happen.
