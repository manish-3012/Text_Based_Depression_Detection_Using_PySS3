The man I want to marry is breaking my heart and I just can't do this.We have been together for almost four years and I had never been happier in my life than I have been since I met him.  He has helped and encouraged me to improve and grow so much.  He has never insulted me, never yelled at me, and while we've had disagreements we've never *fought*.  There has always been so much love here.

I want to spend the rest of my life with him.  I thought he wanted the same.  He says that he does.

However, he also says that he can't be satisfied sexually with just me.  He wants an open relationship so he can fool around with cis men.  I'm transgender, and it's killing me that he wants the one body part that I don't have more than he wants to be happy with me.

He doesn't believe our relationship is sustainable, and he can't promise he won't one day be tempted to cheat, if he doesn't "have this outlet."  He won't marry me unless I can agree to the open relationship.  I'm a deeply monogamous person and just can't do it.  I can't.

I never believed that anyone could love me; I have multiple sclerosis and am trans, along with a ton of other issues.  He has made me so happy, and I felt so loved and secure, just to learn that he isn't satisfied with me and never will be.  As I always feared, I'm just not good enough.

We're in couples counseling, he wants to make things work somehow, but I can't see any possible solution even though I want nothing more than him.  I hate my body more than ever before.  I hate myself.

I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 20 years.  I believe this was my last chance, and it is failing horribly, and I just don't have it in me to keep trying.
