ControversialHello everyone :) as my title suggests this is a bit of a crazy question and not really typical of my â€˜usualâ€™ self. So basically I normally love life, Iâ€™m very lucky, incredibly lucky. I have no clue how to word this so it will make sense. Has any one seen Terry Pratchetts documentary on â€˜choosing to dieâ€™?! Or seen â€˜Me before youâ€™, or felt like, although they know life can be amazing, it just really bloody isnâ€™t anymore and you KNOW (based on past experiences and knowledge of yourself) that youâ€™ve messed it all up and although youâ€™re not physically disabled you are mentally and you canâ€™t cope with the version of yourself youâ€™ve become? I would literally saw my own arm off to erase all this shit, but thatâ€™s not how it works unfortunately. My recent experiences have made me question the â€˜right to dieâ€™ idea. Trust me, I wouldnâ€™t normally be writing this...we put our beautiful pets to sleep when we deem them to be in too much pain. But we donâ€™t do the same for our fellow human beings?! This is odd to me now and although the arguments against the idea are fairly obvious it still seems cruel to me. We live in a strange world. I donâ€™t want to advocate suicide, I believe in most or at least many cases it is unnecessary and could be treated. But some people are suffering so much, and will do until their body gives up. How can that be ok? I have a lovely Labrador who I love with all my heart, but I would not like to see her in all consuming pain day in day out. Iâ€™d rather have her put to sleep although it would be heart wrenching for me. But as humans, we donâ€™t have this option, we have to either suffer until we die naturally , resort to a DIY death or pay a ludicrous amount of money to visit Dignitas in Switzerland. Iâ€™m interested in peopleâ€™s thoughts on this. Of course I realise there are problems with the idea and that it could easily be abused. So yeah. What do people think?
