What Do I do?I have been having suicidal thoughts for a while. Ever since I was in grade school I would always fantasize about jumping out the class window and dying on landing. I don't have a bad life or anything and I guess that I take a lot of stuff for granted. I have had days where I look at life as something that is really not that necessary. I really don't see having a girlfriend necessary and see sex as something that is really not that big of a deal. I really don't know if I am gay or not, I've had thoughts about both. I've never been like anyone else, I was always the really different kid. While everybody was listening to the same music that their parents listened to in 5th grade, I was the only one who was already listening to Green Day and other bands that they thought were weird. I have friends but I don't really count on them. I hate most of them. I see their friendship with me as nothing more than something that just goes on at school. Anyways, I really don't want to do this anymore and everyday I contemplate about suicide more and more. Most of you probably stopped reading this but it's okay. I just needed to let everything out and if someone is willing to help please do. Give me something to look forward to. I have nothing right now. I really want to live but every very redundant day is giving me a reason not to. Suicide or keep on living. Help me decide.
