I am very close to killing myselfI donâ€™t want anyone to try and convince me otherwise. Iâ€™ve read a lot of posts and almost always the responses start off with how â€œyouâ€™ve got so much to live forâ€ without acknowledging that the OP is genuinely in a very bad situation.

To put it simply I am beyond fucked. To start off I have absolutely no friends. I have barely spoken or seen anyone in person for months. I have barely gotten out of bed for the past month. I am long term unemployed. I am 25. I have never been able to hold down a job. I spent New Years Eve alone. For the past who knows how many years. I spent my birthday alone. 

I finally got a very prestigious internship last summer which I had to quit because my social anxiety was so bad. So that bridge is burned. There is no way I will get a job at that organisation after quitting the internship. 

Iâ€™ve gone to school to study computer programming but my social anxiety is so bad I canâ€™t stand working in an office with colleagues sitting by me all day. I literally feel paralyzed like I canâ€™t move. Iâ€™m supposed to finish school this year but I canâ€™t do it. I have to take a â€˜people skillsâ€™ class where they talk about dealing with â€˜difficult peopleâ€™. I canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m going to either fail or drop out. Or kill myself, which is looking more and more attractive every day.

No job history. No experience. No degree. 25. Itâ€™s over. I honestly want to be dead but I donâ€™t want to experience dying mainly because I think it will be painful but there are just no other options for me at this point. Although from the research Iâ€™ve done overdosing on opioids should be pretty painless.

I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m bothering to write this. Maybe a small part of me thinks my family might find this when Iâ€™m gone and it might give them some insight into why. 

If you are actually reading this I donâ€™t know why, Iâ€™m probably not going to read the replies. 

I honestly think if I get through this it will be a miracle. I donâ€™t think I will.
