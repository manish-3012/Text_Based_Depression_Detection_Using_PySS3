There are no downsidesI feel like suicide is actually a good solution. Why live through everything if you can just stop? Why force yourself to play a game you don't want to when you can just turn-off the computer? I've been deeply thinking about it for a long time and there is no argument against it. "X or y would be sad" you wouldn't be there to see it. You don't need to care. X and y won't exist anymore since you won't. "think of all the good in life" wow, that really helps except it comes with down sides. Does killing yourself have down sides? No, none. You'll just sleep and not wake up. You won't exist. Then nothing else will. I have not yet found an argument. It's, hard but it's the truth. There's no downsides to suicide. Can anyone help me with this?
