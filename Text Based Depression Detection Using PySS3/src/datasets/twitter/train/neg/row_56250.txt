Recovered from a real low in my life. [Followup story, full of happiness]Hello Guys. I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcdcx/i_am_emotionally_dying_on_the_inside/) some weeks ago (lost my login). Since then, I had a real major burnout (some of you saw it coming). Massive headaches which only went away through absurd high medication (opiates, and crazy that they gave this hardcore stuff to me, a borderline suicidal person). I was on sick leave for 3 weeks.

That's when I realized it can't go on like this anymore. I started physio therapy and mediacl strength training (Kieser, you might know it). 

I was feeling much better from these actions alone. But the best part happened two days ago: I finally quit my old job! 

I'm in the comfortable position to have something else in the pipeline already (a very cool web agency recruited me because they think I'm good). Their support gave me strength.

But the most important part is that I'll finally be able to pursue my dreams, and the guys in the new office are going to help me with that. 

You can't imagine how happy I feel right now. 

I was on the edge to ending my own life, just a few months ago. And now those mad feelings are gone, completely. I don't even know this guy anymore.

So if you ever think about exiting: Fuck it. If I could climb out of this valley, so can you. 

And it was very much easier than I initially thought.

Trust yourself. You can do it.
