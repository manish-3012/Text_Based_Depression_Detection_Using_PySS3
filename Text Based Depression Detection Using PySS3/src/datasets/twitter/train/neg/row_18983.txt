I am already less than dead.I just talked to my parents about a recent arrest for marijuana possession.  I need a lawyer, which is going to cost them a lot of money they don't have.  In fact, since i failed out of college, and haven't found work, that's pretty much all I am now, a waste of my parent's time, effort, and money.  The recent arrest means it will now be nearly impossible to get a job, and I'm in thousands of dollars debt if I do. 

 Despite above average intelligence and natural athletic ability, I have never had a single successful venture in my entire life.  No awards, academic, athletic, or otherwise.  No plan I have ever made has ever worked out.  I have nothing in my life to be proud of, and nothing that would look good on a resume, only worsening my employment sitution.  I apparently have a lot of potential, I have been told that my entire life, but I seem unable to get anywhere near it, and I'm moving in the wrong direction.  Besides that, I have never had any kind of meaningful relationship, and absolutely no intimacy.  I appear to be unable to connect with fellow humans in a deep, lasting way.

I have no confidence or self-esteem, and never have.  I can't talk to women because I see myself as so undesirable that any advance made by me would be unforgivably rude.  

After talking to my parents about the arrest, my mother asked if I had anything to say.  All I could think is that I wish I was dead, but I can't say that to her, so I stayed silent.  I have secretly wished for death for years now, but thoughts of putting it to myself popped up over the last year or so, and now I can't stop it.  When I'm driving, all I can see is my  car jumping a guard rail and toppling down a cliff.  When I'm eating, I just want to take the knife and open my veins.  I'm sorry I bothered you; this post was extremely self indulgent, almost every sentence started with "I."  Thank you for your time.
