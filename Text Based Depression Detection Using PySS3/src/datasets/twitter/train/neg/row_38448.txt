I just want some help or adviceHello.

I've been having an especially rough year, and it's really gotten to me and I don't know what to do or how to feel anymore about anything.  

To give a summary, I just graduated from HS and am 18.  About one year ago, I started dating someone who could be very toxic to me and sometimes abusive.  I found out that they were cheating on me.  I still really care about them regardless of what they did, so what they said in the past and what they did I forgave but it still hurt me and hurts me a lot.  Around the same time, my mom cheated on my dad, and I'm now just scared to enter into relationships.  I also feel very alone a lot.  I don't have a ton of friends, and I typically don't text anyone on a daily basis.  I tried taking friends' advice in past which was to try things like dating sites in hopes that someone might make me happy, but all it's done is make me feel more alone.  I've done things like swipe right on everyone on Tinder for weeks and get no matches.  It makes me feel like I look or sound repulsive.  I just don't know.  Every day, I cry at some point or another, and I just am not happy anymore.  I often get thoughts of suicide and have already done things like self harm which I stopped because it doesn't do anything except make me feel like I did to myself what I deserved.  On top of all that, my parents have been pushing me to get a job, but I haven't been able to at all.  I've applied to over 20 places, most of which were fast food and others being retail but only got an interview at one, Home Depot, who found someone before my interview.



I just want help.  I don't want to feel sad all the time.  I don't like crying everyday.  I just want to be happy.  I don't want to reach my limit and do something that I could regret or not even get a chance to regret in the future.  Thanks for reading.
