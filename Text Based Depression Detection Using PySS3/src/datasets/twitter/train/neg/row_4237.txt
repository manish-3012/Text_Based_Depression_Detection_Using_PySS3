I'm done with the loneliness and repetitionI'm not gonna sit here and say, my life sucks, wah I never get what I want, etc. But I just need to talk about this because might as well post it publically when no one that I'm friends with gives a crap. so pretty much, I thought that getting a job would help distract me from my depression but I think it got worse. First off I'm extremely lonely, there's a girl I'm interested in but I know for sure that even if I were to confess how I felt to her, it wouldn't work out because I'm a garbage human, I've been seriously lonely for a long time and the only time I've ever had a S/O was in high school, but then again she had autism so she most likely didn't care about me romantically. Then there was the other attempt I had at telling someone how I felt, and she though said that she loved me, left me to rot afterwards. So you can see where I'm getting at with being tired of being lonely all of the damn time. There's that, and there's also that I'm an artist, and that's been dragging me down lately too, since I keep drawing but I never get better despite everyone telling me to practice and practice, well gee, nothing is getting better so it OBVIOUSLY ISN'T WORKING!
I'm just sick of it, I don't even see a point in wanting to keep on living anymore because of my depression eating me away everyday. I know I sound bitchy and whiny, but I just want out, I might buy myself a gun if I have to just to end it. Or maybe jump off the tallest bridge here in my city
