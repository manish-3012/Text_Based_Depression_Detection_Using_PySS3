13th December, 2017- the day.So I've decided. 13th December is the day, and 20 years of pain will finally come to an end. 

I'm just so tired, now. I'm always tired. My mind is constantly ravaged by thoughts about how I've managed to destroy my life so greatly. 

I feel terribly for my parents. It will destroy them. But I can't go on like this any longer. I am a complete failure. I'm not good at doing anything. I constantly hurt people around me by letting them down. I will let them down one final time, and that will be the end of it.

Early morning on 13th December, I will clear out my dorm room. I'll wear my favourite sweater- a woolen one in shades of red. I'll roll a joint of some fine marijuana and smoke it while I listen to Nujabes. I'll rake in the beauty of winter morning in North India. And I shall bid you all adieu. I am at peace.
