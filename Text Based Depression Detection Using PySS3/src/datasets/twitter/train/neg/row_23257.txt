Why do you help suicidal people?Why would a society help suicidal people? Why do you think they want to kill themselves in the first place? It's hypocritical that people are pushed to the edge and then encouraged to not jump by the same system. I'm adult enough to know that people aren't separated in good vs bad. We're all in the grey zone, and I don't think that any of us should have the power over someone else's will or should limit their possibilities. Maybe if it wasn't the case in the first place, there wouldn't be suicidal people? Crazy thought right.
