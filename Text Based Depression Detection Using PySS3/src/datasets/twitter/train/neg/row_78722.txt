canâ€™t kill myselfbeen wanting to die for a long time and pretty much just because iâ€™m really fucking lonely and my â€œfriendsâ€ donâ€™t actually like me (aside from one that i wonâ€™t see ever again after i transfer schools and move to a different city) but not that i care bc iâ€™m in the friend zone with her anyways. every fucking day i go to fucking school and do the same fucking bullshit over and over again. at one point my family knew and i was signed up for some shitty therapy and had to make a phone call to give them info about myself but i was to pussy to do it just like everything else, and just told my family i was feeling better. i literally get stuck in bed trying to think of reasons to get up in the morning, and why i shouldnâ€™t just fucking end it. only reason iâ€™m not killing myself yet is bc maybe i can get a gf/bestfriend at the high school iâ€™m going to.

tldr iâ€™m not killing myself yet bc i might get a stroke of luck and meet people who donâ€™t pretend to like me so i donâ€™t kill myself
