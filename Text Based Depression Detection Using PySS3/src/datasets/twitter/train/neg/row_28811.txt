I want to end it tomorrow but I need to find a place to rehome my cat..I wasn't planning on getting a cat at all. My friend saved a cat that was being abused by another family and she was taking care of him for a while but her apartment doesn't allow more than 2 cats so she handed him to me to take care of him and foster him. Because of the crappy job I had,I was able to get him vaccinated and she got him neutered before giving him to me but now that I lost my job and won't be able to keep up with vet bills, I cannot give him the life he deserves. I am living with my parents and they seem to constantly have a hate/love relationship with him and constantly threaten me that they are going to take him to a shelter just because I am struggling to find a job. I can't take their fucking criticism and threats anymore. I constantly think of killing them and myself but I feel it is best to just end it tomorrow. I have no will to fucking live when I didn't get the option to choose and was forced to be put on this godforsaken dying planet for my own parents selfishness of wanting children. People on here have been calling me an asshole because I took in a cat when I ''shouldn't have'' or when I was  ''planning to just give him away anyways". I wasn't planning on getting a cat and I NEVER planned to give him away but I didn't want my friend to give him to a shelter so he would get euthanized. I was cleaning up after him every day, playing with him, got him vaccinated, bought him toys but that still isn't enough to ''prove I am making smth of myself".
