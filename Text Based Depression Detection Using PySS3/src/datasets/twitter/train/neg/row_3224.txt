this is really long and self deprecatingwhy do I have to be alive for other people when I for myself donâ€™t want to be here, I canâ€™t do it because Iâ€™m worried about hurting my family, no one else cares about me and Iâ€™m not sure my family even does. I question everything everyday. i canâ€™t stop ruining everything I touch or come in contact with I canâ€™t stop fucking things up so whatâ€™s the point anymore? I canâ€™t deal with anything even when itâ€™s my fault I canâ€™t deal with the world or having to be a human being. I canâ€™t control my anxiety and it makes me impulsive and I unblocked the person I cheated on my boyfriend with because we were fighting and he kept telling me to do it so I did, and now everythingâ€™s even more fucked than it was before. I canâ€™t stop panic lying everytime I get caught in something even the tiniest things my first reaction is to lie about it, I never used to be like this and I donâ€™t know why I am now. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me and yâ€™all are probably just gonna tell me itâ€™s my fault and to grow up and get over myself and to that I know. I want to die and Iâ€™ve been staring at my bupropion and tizanidine all day but canâ€™t find the courage to just take them and end it, i think about self harm every single day but I just canâ€™t do it I have no purpose to my life and I never will, no one will ever love me because I keep fucking it up and with the one person that I love and who loves me so much. I believe heâ€™s my soulmate, weâ€™re almost exactly alike down to we both peel out slim jims. He doesnâ€™t even believe me when I say it to him anymore and he doesnâ€™t want me anymore even though Iâ€™m madly in love with him. I canâ€™t stop self destructing, I canâ€™t let myself be happy. I guess Iâ€™ve just grown to hate myself so much that I canâ€™t stop making myself feel like shit. I can barely even take care of myself or keep my room clean. Iâ€™m sick of everything.
