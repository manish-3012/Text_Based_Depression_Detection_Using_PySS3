Help. I'm so lost.I feel so helpless despite the fact that I'm so young. I just need someone to tell me that they genuinely care.

My mother crossed the line from discipline to abuse. My family also doesn't realize how much I want to die, and how anxiety and depression works.

My mind is destroying itself. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I've been thinking more and more about killing myself and I don't know if there is anything worth living for as stupid as it sounds. Please. I am begging you. I just need some hope.
