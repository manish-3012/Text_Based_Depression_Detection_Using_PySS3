HEY GUYS - I'M DEALING WITH SO MUCH PAINI wanna keep this short and sweet. A, Nobody loves me B, my family abandoned me C, I'll never recover from the greatest and final heartbreak of my life. D, I haven't seen her in 18 mos., E. I am so fucking lonely, I am chatting with randoms on Reddit hoping for a connection that will NEVER actually happen. Everything was left hanging, like an open wound, and every day is one day closer to that one day that I just make the "vital" decision. I said I'd keep it short cuz, who will care? you know what I mean? I need a friend, I'm around guys all the time I don't even remember what a girl is like - what ARE girls, women? And, I just - nope. i wanna nope the fuck out of this, the way my body hurts - everything. she gonna contact me one day - and I won't know how to handle it. i'd rather move on
