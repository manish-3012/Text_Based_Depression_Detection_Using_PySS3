I don't think I was meant to existI hate being alive. I hate being so lonely but then feeling lonelier when I'm with other people. I hate my body for how disconnected I feel from it. I hate that I exist, I don't want to be here and it's not that I wish I was someone else but I really don't want to be me. I'm angry all the time but can't put it into words. I just turned twenty and it feels like the last bit of any ambition I may have had shriveled up and died inside me. I don't understand how a living creature can feel this way and not have it mean that it's mistake, shouldn't instinct make me want to live. Why do I feel like I'm rotting from the inside
