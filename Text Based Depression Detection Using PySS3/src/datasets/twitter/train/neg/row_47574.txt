Iâ€™m exhaustedI feel like I canâ€™t talk about my thoughts with anyone anymore because they all think Iâ€™ve â€œmade progress.â€ If I tell anything to my therapist then itâ€™s â€œjust the anxiety talking.â€

I feel like if I take one step forward I then take two steps back. 

I feel like although Iâ€™m on the cusp of finally starting my life I donâ€™t really know what the point is or if I should even try.

I feel like I canâ€™t vent on social media because I have a significant following and I donâ€™t want anyone to get upset or triggered by me talking about suicide.

Iâ€™ve never (intentionally) self harmed because Iâ€™m too cowardly but then I feel worse because Iâ€™m cowardly and only want to do it more.

I have no irl friends and the online friends I do have I keep at a distance because I feel like they all actually hate me or only tolerate talking to me or want me gone.

I feel like Iâ€™m so deeply broken and no matter what I do to fix myself I just shatter even more.

I feel like my meds arenâ€™t doing anything anymore, nor the dr visits or the therapy.

Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m just so tired. Iâ€™m exhausted. Every night I cry before bed and Iâ€™m tired of hiding it. I wish I could just disappear.
