Iâ€™m a disappointment to my family...Iâ€™m not really sure what else to say... Iâ€™ve never had a gf or anything close to that, Iâ€™m embarrassingly socially awkward, I donâ€™t have any friends, im ugly, Iâ€™m bad at sports and Iâ€™m doing badly in school.

My parents are incredibly disappointed in me and it hurts. They try to mask it and say they love me and that theyâ€™re proud of me, but Iâ€™ve heard them talking to each other about me and itâ€™s not positive.

I donâ€™t know where to move on in my life at this point...
