I'm not suicidal, but I really need to be heardOnce a month I can get someone into a climbing gym with me, and can get anyone in for free if they haven't been there before. I don't think I've actually used it a single time. I've invited people and we've agreed to make plans in the future, but they never happen. And then there's the plus ones I get from DJing, which I haven't even been able to give away since Jackie and I broke up. 

It is so disheartening that I can't even get people to spend time with me doing something for free.

I just feel so distant from people, even the ones who tell me that they enjoy my company.

I go to a wedding and I'm struck with the fact that if I were to get married, I have *zero* candidates for best man. The people I'm closest too would probably not consider themselves close to me at all. 

I don't understand how people make friends. I go to social events and people make these connections and I just.... don't.
