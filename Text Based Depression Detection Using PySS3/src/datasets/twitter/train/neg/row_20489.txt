I have made my decision and damn it feels goodThis summer, i will drown myself and make it look like an accident. People simply think i went swimming and drowned. I feel calm and happy about this decision. Yes, drowning might feel crappy at first but i have heard it can feel good after the panic phase. 
I don't have to suffer or endure...
