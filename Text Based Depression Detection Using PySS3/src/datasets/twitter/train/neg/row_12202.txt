I can't even imagine feeling better. I've been suicidal almost a year. Or, down, I should say. The other day, I cleaned my room after moving home for the summer and I felt awesome. I felt really, really happy. The next day was downhill, and today even lower. 

I don't know what it is. In school I have absolutely nobody, and at home at least I have my parents and my own room and more comforts, but I feel bad. 

It's not even how I feel that gets me the worst. And I feel like there is no happiness at all, and I feel the future will just be humdrum holding on. 

Which is weird, because the other day I didn't ask myself these questions, but I felt awesome. 

Now, even if I imagine a world where I have friends, and every other ideal thing, I can't see feeling better. It just hurts to think about someone doing something for me or something and just being completely unaffected, like I am operating outside of normal reality.


I don't know if I will kill myself. On the one hand, I hurt and feel bad and see no reason to put off death. But on the other hand, I feel like I can resist this, and there *must* be some reason everyone isn't throwing themselves off bridges. 


I often think about what it means to have something feel you better. Why does one event affect you differently. It makes you feel better, but to what end? Why would it? 

EDIT: Before someone would suggest it: I am not bipolar. Being in a good mood doesn't equate to a manic episode.
