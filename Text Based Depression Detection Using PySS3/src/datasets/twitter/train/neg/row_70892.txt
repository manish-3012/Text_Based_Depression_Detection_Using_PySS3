I found out on facebook that my sister got married and my whole family was there.They all lied to me about what they were doing.  And when I got upset about it my other sister sent me hundreds of text messages about what a horrible person I am.  So that's it I'm done.  They want me gone I'm gone.  I hope eventually they feel guilty about what they did to me.
