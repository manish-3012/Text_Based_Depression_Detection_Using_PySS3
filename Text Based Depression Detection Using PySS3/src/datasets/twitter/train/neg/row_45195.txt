I am so tired and in so much painI am 19 years old and I am depressed since I was 13 years old. I had to go through really bad things in my life and I still have traumas to this day. I have tried to kill myself when I was 15/16 years old and I have cut myself for years now. 

It was better this year, nice friends and everything went right and I stopped cutting. I started my own company but it is not going super well.

But now these past few days have been exhausting...

Nobody wants to celebrate the new year with me tomorrow. Everyone made plans without me. This is the most alone that I have ever felt and I just feel like I donâ€™t want to do this anymore.

I am so sad right now and I really think about just ending it all so I can just sleep forever. I am sooo tired of all the pain I had to go though and stil go through. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore it is just too much, I canâ€™t take it anymore
