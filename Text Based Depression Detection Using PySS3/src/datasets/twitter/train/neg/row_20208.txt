What do I do (URGENT)Please don't tell me to go away or see a psychiatris/doctor or anything like that.

I really can't take it,
I keep having all these thoughts in mind that I can't control, I can'tdeal with this any more.
Its so much these thoughts come at me anytime and its increasing, even when typign this.
They're so much that i don't know who I am anymore that start having personilites as they mix in with my thoughts. Some of them mock me and control me in my actions its too much. Yes I mean it that some of them control me like my actual body. they want to see me in pain, but don't want to me to die as its like the fun is over for them. Do you know what its like having others that just want to see you hurt but not kill yourself. In a sense I guess this won't bring me to suicide, as these thoughts won't let me buts it too much.

Please I don't say doctor or anything I asked other subreddits i got answers that said that.

I tried telling others but they just look at me weridly.
One way to control these I found is repeatldly hitting myself in the head but thats obviously not a good solution, but it does ease things.
