Is having no interest in addressing my carelessness (which will surely the end in my death) the same as having suicidal thoughts?I am a careless person. I could not tell you how many times I have narrowly escaped death due to inattention simply because of luck. Every time I drive I feel like my control over the car is tenuous at best, I often find myself veering into oncoming traffic only to realise just in time, and I've been in a serious car accident (entirely my fault) only to come out completely unscathed.

At work I've had dangerous machinery fall within inches of head, I've received electric shocks which should have stopped my heart, but didn't. I could go on. I jay walk all the time, and I think I have it figured, but there's often a bus or something in my blind spot, and yet I've never been touched. Each time something like this happens (almost daily, if not a few times a week), I say I will be more careful, but I never am. Am I subconsciously trying to kill myself? I really don't want to die but I don't find myself doing anything to stop it happening.
