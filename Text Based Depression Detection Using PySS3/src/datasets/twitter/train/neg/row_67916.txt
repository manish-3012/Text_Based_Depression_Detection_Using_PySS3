DoneI wish i would just die. Nothing works. Iâ€™m hiding in my closet right now crying. Iâ€™ve tried calling hotlines, nothing helps. Usually I can barely speak. My life is painful every single day. I was assaulted and the police didnt believe me. My friends dont listen to me anymore. I cant find a full time job and I can barely pay my bills. I hate who I am. I have been trying so hard for so long to deal with these things, but it wont work. Iâ€™m so worthless. Everyone tells me.
