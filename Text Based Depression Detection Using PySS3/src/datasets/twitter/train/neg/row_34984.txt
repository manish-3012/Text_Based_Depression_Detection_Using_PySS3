i canâ€™t do iti canâ€™t keep going.

i canâ€™t keep doing this. i really thought my depression and anxiety were getting better, but iâ€™ve only been doing worse and worse. everyone says that i seem like iâ€™m getting better, but itâ€™s the exact opposite. the one thing thatâ€™s been keeping me alive has been my best friend, but iâ€™m afraid he wants nothing to do with me now. my mental health issues are out of control, my medication isnâ€™t doing a thing for me nor is my therapist. i have nobody to confide in because i either donâ€™t want to bother anyone or i donâ€™t trust them. i have no friends besides the one because i have no idea how to socialize. the worst part is that i donâ€™t even know if i really want to die, it just feels like the only way out at this point.

on top of all of this, iâ€™m a trans man. my dysphoria is only getting worse. my parents refuse to support me and are trying to brainwash me into thinking iâ€™m a girl. itâ€™s hell being referred to as a girl every single day. itâ€™s hell when even the people youâ€™re out to who say they support you donâ€™t make the effort to use the correct name or pronouns.

my only question is why this had to be me. why couldnâ€™t i have been normal. itâ€™s not fair. was i put on this earth just to be sad for a few years and then die? in the end, iâ€™m going nowhere with my life. iâ€™m not fit to wall equally among everyone else. iâ€™m less than human. i donâ€™t deserve it.

all i want is to not be so alone, but i suppose thatâ€™s too much to ask. i just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. itâ€™s tiring. iâ€™m done.
