Ever feel like a fraud?So I like to help people through their suicidal thoughts. I really do. But sometimes when helping people I feel like a fraud knowing one day sooner than later, I'm going to end my own life. I always say in my head that I'm helping those who are going through a rough period in their lives and that it will get better for them. I truly believe that. I just don't believe I'm ever going to get better. I kinda know better for myself. This has been something I've lived with forever, what's the point in lying to myself.
