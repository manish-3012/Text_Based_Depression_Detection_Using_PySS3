Im not doing okayI dont know what to do. I just feel so hopeless. I feel pathetic that im writing a reddit post and crying about it but i just cant keep doing this. 

Every time i try to get better or attempt to turn my life back around i get pulled back down. Its like im running on a treadmill going nowhere. 

I know suicide is not the answer, and i know deep down i dont want to die but i just feel as if there is nothing left for me. 

Im afraid im going to hurt myself. And i know how incredibly selfish all of this is but i just dont know any more.

Im writing this on a throwaway account. Im a teenager in the uk and initially i thought that lockdown was the best thing for my mental health but i now see that im really not okay anymore. Im no longer making progress. 

This doesnt even make any sense. There is no point to this post. Im just very confused and need some help.
