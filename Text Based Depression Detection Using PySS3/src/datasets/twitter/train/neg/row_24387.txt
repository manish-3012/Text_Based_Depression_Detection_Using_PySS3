My inferiority complex towards my boyfriend gives me suicidal thoughtsCross-posted from r/relationships where it was deleted to avoid harmful trolls

I've always had self esteem issues due to my abusive family and repeated school failures. I am feeling super inferior to everybody in general and I'm very anxious. 


Anyway, I've been with my boyfriend for a bit less than a year now. He's absolutely amazing on every aspect, he's the most caring I ever knew. He accepts all of my insecurities, listens to my worries and always does his best to reassure me, a real treasure. Besides that, he's confident, attractive, extrovert, popular, and a very talented musician - basically he has all the qualities I desire. I'm 4 years late in my studies, have no talent, suffer from anxiety and body image issues,... Many things that he never worries about. 


Every time he displays his musical or social talent, instead of feeling inspired by him, I get super jealous. I'm convinced that he's what I'm supposed to become and that I never will because I suck at everything and I'm a failure. Now I've reached a point where I can't even stand hanging out with him because I immediately start comparing him to me and it makes me feel suicidal. I feel like I'm never gonna be as good as him and that I should erase myself because I'm gonna be a failure forever. 

I know my behavior is unhealthy but I'm unable to see my boyfriend as my equal and it makes me more and more depressed each time. Please help, I don't know what to do. 

I'm very sorry about my bad English, it's not my mother tongue. Thank you for reading !!
