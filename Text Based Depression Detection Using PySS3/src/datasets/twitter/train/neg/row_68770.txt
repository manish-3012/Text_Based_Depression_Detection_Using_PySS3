I don't think I really want to die...But I absolutely do not want to keep living.  I don't like it.  It's been really bad.  Life has just sucked.  I don't want to do this for another 40+ years.   I've been in therapy pretty much my whole life.  I have tried every medication under the sun.  Now I'm just written off as "treatment resistant"   Seriously?!   So you're saying there's no hope?    Awesome.   I don't want to kill myself, but if someone tried to kill me I would not fight it off again.
