Is today the dayI wake up every morning usually sad, but manageable. As the day progresses, I regress. I ask myself if today is gonna be the day. I wonder if tomorrow will be better or worse. I wonder if I will continue torturing myself or if I should just end the suffering.

I feel like I am in a deep pit. I can see the sun over me.  I know it's beautiful out there, but I see no way to get there, no way out.
