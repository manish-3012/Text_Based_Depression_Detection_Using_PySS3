Things are much worse than they've ever beenI'd only ever had very mild thoughts before, but these ones are starting to break into my whole life. I freeze up, panic, I start to think it'd be easier if I was alseep, if I couldn't wake up every morning and keep failing to force myself to do things. 

The thing I'm most worried about is that I'm feeling it, now. As I type, I can feel this thick rope around my neck, and it's tugging upwards. There's nothing there. Nothing is really on my neck, but I can feel it, clear as day. Sometimes, I can feel myself falling as if it was reality, but I can't land. I'm just falling, falling, and the noose is pulling. But nothing is there. I'm on the couch, I'm typing on the computer. I'm not falling. But it feels so much like I'm falling to my death.
