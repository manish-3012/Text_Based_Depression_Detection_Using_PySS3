Ready to end it soon..Well Iâ€™m am getting sick and tired of living... I struggle to much and am for real dead inside from all times I have been hurt.

Break down of 2018

Feb I got laid off (no severance n stuff)

I am in process for my dream job in the gov field.. I been in the process for 2yrs. I got passed everything even the psychology exams (I hide my pains well)  then couple weeks ago the med doc of my file tells me I need to reassessed for my learning disability... BUT the cost is coming out of my pocket for this... great a laid off guy getting shitty EI pay I asked around for fee $2-4G. Well fuck me right? So if I donâ€™t do this my file closes!

So a week or two ago I had no choice but to sell my motorcycle this ride was what kept my mind clear n empty from all my pain.. and everyone at home was happy I sold it but I died inside more.

Now few days ago my fiancÃ©e calls me and tells me she doesnâ€™t want to get married anymore.... because Iâ€™m laid off n canâ€™t find a new job, my application with this gov job is going nowhere... because I didnâ€™t beat the shit out of someone who said something inappropriate to her (I had a talk with him since I need to stay on right for my application) but guess what no one believes me....

I have couple assessment interview that I might be able to afford but even if I do it and I fail I will most likely kill myself as I am what everyone thinks I am a loser, a mistake, cold n canâ€™t show love... a person like me donâ€™t deserve to be alive.. 

I already wrote 2 pages of a suicide letter more to come before I am done with it all I just want to know how it feels like to be free!

Sorry for long post and most of this venting!... letâ€™s see how rest of these next few weeks go...
