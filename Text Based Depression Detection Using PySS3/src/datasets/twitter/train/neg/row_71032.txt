you know whatI think it is unfair

Unfair that people can eat whatever they want and not gain weight

Unfair that i am born with this illness and can't live a normal life

Unfair that my brain doesn't function as a normal brain

Unfair that my childhood was shitty and got the blame for everything even if it wasen't me

Unfair that even if i did my homework, i still got sent to the backwall of the class

Unfair that every gymnastic class i was either not picked or picked last.

Unfair that people knew something was wrong but didn't do anything to my illness growing up.

Kinda why i have given up at trying my life.
