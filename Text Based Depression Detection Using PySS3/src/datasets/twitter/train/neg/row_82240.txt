I don't see why I shouldn't just do it tonight24M. Haven't had a relationship last longer than a month in 6 months. Was just recently hopeful about someone who seemed to like me, but it seems they just rejected me as well. Started dating late so my longest steady relationship has been about 5 months so far. I just want to spare myself the pain of growing old and alone at this point (or not meeting anyone until my 30s or 40s).
