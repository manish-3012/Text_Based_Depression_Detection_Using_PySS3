No reason to live.On the outside, it seems like I have a decent life. Supportive parents, a house to live, an allowance from my parents because I don't work. But that doesn't effect how I feel inside. I'm so pissed off at everything. I'm pissed off that my boyfriend can't do the things he says he's going to do. I'm pissed that my friends treat me like shit because that's how I taught them how to treat me. I'm pissed off that everything I do, isn't going to be amounted to anything. I'm never going to find a job. I'm never going to move out, find a spouse, I'm never going to meet real friends. I just want to smoke weed because it's like medicine for me, I smoke after I eat because I get really bad nausea. When I don't have weed I feel terrible. I can't even support this habit. If I can't get a hold of my medicine, I'm going to feel terrible, and this is mainly why I am writing this right now. I just feel so terrible and I want to die. I don't think I can do it, do anything. I'm going to lay in the middle of the street tonight and hope someone runs me over. God doesn't fucking exist.
