My mother is a fucking idiot.22/M. I live on my own but I'm visiting my parents for the weekend.

My dad asked me to go to church with my mom tomorrow. It's what she wanted for her birthday. They both know full well that I'm an atheist. I declined.

My mother and I just had a fight. She told me that she thought me being an atheist was "just a phase". Atheists are immature idiots. She promised me that my grandmother - the only person really keeping me afloat financially - was going to cut me off. She told me that the only cure for depression was god and that **it was my fault for being depressed.**

Fuck her. Fuck her. FUCK HER.

I'm writing my suicide note now. Not doing it tonight. Maybe later, but I'm writing it anyway.
