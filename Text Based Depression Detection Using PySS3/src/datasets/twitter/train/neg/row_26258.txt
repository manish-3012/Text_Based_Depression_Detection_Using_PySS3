I'm struggling again and I didn't think I wouldI'm really down lately. I went through some depression when I was in my teens (I'm in my 20s) and used to be afraid to be alone, but then things picked up as I got to be more social and express myself better. I had dips in time since then but for the most part nothing as dark as that was.

Now it's getting bad again. It seems to crop up if I date someone. I always keep people an arm's length away, and when it seems like I might be getting closer, I start pulling away and then I deal with the breakup and feeling down and spiral again into something dark, sleep a ton, find it hard to exercise or focus on my career or any of the hobbies I like. 

What kind of kept me going in my teens is developing and becoming greatly religious, and now that I'm not anymore I feel even worse. It was motivating and euphoric in a way at first, but now it just gives me less motivation to do anything. I stopped journaling and meditating like I did when I was doing better, and that might be part of it, but now I don't even feel like doing that.

I never really loved a lot of things. All these friends I have that I love seem to have a lot of passion, something they truly love, but I don't even know what that's like. I feel withdrawn and self-involved, and the more I try to give myself away the more I feel rejected, even if I don't think people don't mean it that way. I have a hard time differentiating between feeling used and making people happy and always have. 

I doubt I'll do anything but I'm just really upset that I thought I had gotten past this and it has hit me hard again.
