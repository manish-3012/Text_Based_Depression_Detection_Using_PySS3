Talking to who will listenI didnâ€™t have time to make a throw away.  And maybe this post will help me later. Sometimes I have thoughts about doing something stupid and hurting myself. I try not to think about it and wasting too many resources but sometimes it feels overwhelming. I know I would hurt my mom if I did anything drastic but maybe it helps to write it out. Iâ€™m on the waitlist for the suicide prevention line and I have stuff I may want to talk about. I donâ€™t know if icees justified in being suicidal but I guess thatâ€™s how it works. Itâ€™s not logical I know but sometimes it feels like the only answer. I donâ€™t really know what I want to say but thatâ€™s about it. Iâ€™m sorry
