Is there something wrong with me?Hey Iâ€™m posting here as I think thereâ€™s something wrong with me mentally. 

Well I basically get extreme mood swings, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m depressed suicidal and not optimistic about life, then Iâ€™m happy and very optimistic about life, after that I get really irritable and anything irritates me badly, like for example if somebody said â€˜Heyâ€™ Iâ€™d feel like saying â€˜Fuck off and dieâ€™.  I just wanna hurt people sometimes and have wild fantasies about it. I just wanna hurt myself. I wanna kill myself. I also cry for no reason even when thereâ€™s nothing wrong and I feel happy. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m on about, can anybody give me some advice.
