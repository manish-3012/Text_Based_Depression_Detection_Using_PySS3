Not going to see 2017You can call me another statistic in the silent epidemic of male suicide.  I've been severely depressed for over 4 years now.  Cycled through the medications and got myself into therapy.  Sometimes things look a little better and I can actually see some rays of light poke through the darkness.  A good day or two.  But mostly I sit and cry, a hollow man with no purpose in life.  I tried to do what I thought would make me happy.  Instead it has left me an empty, morally bankrupt degenerate.  A reflection of the decadent society I leave behind.  

I struggle only to not cause more suffering to the ones I love.  But the bonds holding me here fray and grow weaker.  The path I am on is to end before 2017.  This will likely be my final year.  

I suppose it is time to start making amends and prepare.  Time to let go of my things and help my close loved ones.  Make it as easy as possible for everyone.  I only hope that they will understand and not blame themselves.  Thank you for reading.
