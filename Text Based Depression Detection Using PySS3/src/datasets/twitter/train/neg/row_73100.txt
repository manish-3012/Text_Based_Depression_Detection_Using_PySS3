just venting my realityI am a single 44 year old man. 

I sleep on a shitty couch.  In the cheapest apartment I can barely afford.

Itâ€™s always filthy. Too small to keep clean.

I make less than 12k a year. 

I have to beg for my pay every weekend.

I have no real shoes or clothes.

I have no friends, I have no family.  There is no one to talk with.

I have no hope, I have no future. I only share in the lack of money, I am never given anything â€œextraâ€.

I am alone. Not even a pet to keep me comforted. Only a reminder I couldnâ€™t afford to save him.

I am a coward for not ending this life.

Everyday I wake up here, Iâ€™m reminded Iâ€™m a coward.

Coward. Failure.
