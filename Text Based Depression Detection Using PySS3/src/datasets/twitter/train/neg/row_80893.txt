I'm stuck in the same cycle...Forewarning: long rant ahead. 

I've been suicidal and depressed for as long as I can remember. My childhood was shit. I was molested and raped for years. My parents were neglectful and abusive to me and my sister. I somehow graduate high school without killing myself (though I attempted multiple times) but I wish I didn't. 

I thought that once I got to college I could start over. I told myself I'd turn over a new leaf. I moved out. Focused on school and studying a subject I was passionate about. Got into a research program and got paid to do research (which is huge as an undergrad). It all worked for a while but then the same thing happened all over again...

I got overwhelmed, depressed. I have basically no friends or support. I feel so alone. 

This summer I lost all motivation. I got so depressed I couldn't get out of bed. I felt so overwhelmed with all my responsibilities (leading a research lab, attending classes for the undergrad research program, volunteering, etc.) and I just shut down. I ended up getting kicked out of the program because I stopped showing up. I stopped responding to emails from my research professor who's most likely not going to write me a letter of rec for grad school anymore. 

And I'm just... so tired. I want to succeed, I really fucking do. I tried so hard to pick myself up and do better, but the cycle always repeats. I fall apart, fuck up my life, deal with the consequences, start over. 

But I'm tired of starting over. I just want this to be over. The only thing keeping me alive is the idea that my boyfriend would be devastated but idk how long that's going to keep me. I just want to die so badly. I don't want to do this anymore.
