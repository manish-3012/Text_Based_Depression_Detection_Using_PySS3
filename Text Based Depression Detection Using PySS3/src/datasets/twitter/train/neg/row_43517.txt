I think about suicide pretty often lately, something that went away for awhile but is now back.Lately I've started thinking about suicide more than usual. Growing up depressed it was usually on my mind but went away for a few years and now I feel it starting to come back. I feel like i'm holding my loved ones back, I've felt it before as well. How long should I go on living this way? I feel guilty thinking about it because my loved ones are nothing but supportive but I feel it's best sometimes to just move on. I wish it wouldn't be so painful to them but I can't see myself progressing any further than this, I've already let everyone down and just feel like going away.
