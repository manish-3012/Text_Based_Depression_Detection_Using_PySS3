Terrified for my best friend. Someone, please help.I'm not really sure where to start or what to actually say here, but I'll try my best. 

One of my closest friends is suicidal and it scares the shit out of me. It's getting harder and harder for me to be supportive, not because I don't understand or for a lack of empathy, but because they don't seem to want me around anymore. I've reached out and done everything I can at this point but honestly I don't know what to do now. Almost daily now I'm getting messages about suicidal ideation, feelings of worthlessness, numbness, anxiety, and fear. I have been in that position, so I can empathize. I want to drag them out of this hole because they're a really great person that I love so much and care for deeply. They have no access to proper health care or medication so they basically just talk to me and while I offered to be there, it weighs on my heart to feel like I'm their only outlet. 

I've been suicidal before and I've also suffered a loss from suicide as well. I'm not going to sit by idly while my friend is suffering so someone, anyone, please help me. I want to help so desperately but nothing seems to work.
