I don't know what to do..So for the past year or so I've been extremely depressed? I haven't been diagnosed or seen a doctor or anything, so please let me know if it's inappropriate to use the terminology without support. 

Anyways, a few days ago when I was sitting in the shower crying as I normally do I had a thought that's never occurred to me before and it scared me, I'm not sure what to do about it mainly because I want to do it. 

I looked over at the razor blade next to me and I just had an incredible urge to feel pain somewhere other than in my chest and a hollowness in my body. I know it's not right and it's wrong and I've never even thought about hurting myself before but I'm just in so much pain, I don't know what to do. 

I don't have anyone to talk to about how I feel because in the friend that always around to cheer everyone else up and make them laugh. Everyday I just want to be gone but when I think about them and my family, that's what stops me. 

I don't need a reply or anything, I just wanted to get some things off my chest
