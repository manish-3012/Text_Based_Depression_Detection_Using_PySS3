Can someone just talk to me?So I don't know if I am actually what you would call suicidal. I never actually have an urge to kill myself, or feel like it is something that I am about to do, or need to do. It feels like its just the inevitable end to my life. I really don't like myself. No one knows it. One of my best talents is hiding how much pain I'm in from the people who care about me. But I hate myself. I feel like someday I'm just going to make the logical choice that I don't need to be here anymore and just end it. The thought crosses my mind daily. Its not "I should just kill myself." Its more along the lines of "Well it sucks now, but eventually you'll end it and it will be over." 

Does anyone else feel like this? Is this even a problem or should i just suck it up and get over it? I just want someone to talk to. Just to be albe to tell someone that this is how I'm feeling will help, I'm sure. I just want to feel a little bit less alone.
