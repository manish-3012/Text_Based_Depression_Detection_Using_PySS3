Feeling overwhelmed tonight.I feel so overwhelmed and anxious. Fuck. Most days I'm good and feeling alright. Today I feel so fucked again. I took about 5 norco 10 mgs, so I feel mellowed out and sort of have trouble breathing. I feel so sad. I fucking hate running to any drug I can get my hands on to mellow me out. I want to die but I won't kill myself, all this pain that I've gone through would be for nothing. I one day would like to be a spokesman for mental health. I want to start an organization one day called "Fighting Mental Illness With Friends". So many people are hurting inside and wish they all knew they're not alone. I wish I could take everybody's pain away. I will help people one day though. All of this pain wasn't for nothing.
