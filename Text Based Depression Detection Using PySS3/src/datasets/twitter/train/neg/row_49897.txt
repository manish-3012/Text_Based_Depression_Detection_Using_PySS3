dear god it hurtsexisting is too painful. waking up and trying to live normally feels like the mental equivalent of pouring salt into a fresh open wound. i'm so sad to the point i am constantly nauseous or in physical pain. my brain feels like it is infested. i cant do it. i cant do it anymore. im sorry. i'll most likely be dead before or shortly after i turn 18. there is no hope for me.
