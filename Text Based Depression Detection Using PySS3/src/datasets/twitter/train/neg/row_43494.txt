PillI will be leaving tonight. Over the last two years Iâ€™ve overdosed so many times so I canâ€™t swallow a whole bunch of pills, but I found a solution. I crushed all my meds and Iâ€™m going to mix it with my food or put it in my drink and swallow it. Iâ€™m truly sorry. Iâ€™m only alive because of a pulse. I know that so many people in my life are going to be affected tremendously, but they will move on in a couple of months to a year. I know itâ€™s a selfish act, but itâ€™s also selfish to keep someone here who doesnâ€™t want to be. I wanted to create a goodbye video and send it to everyone, but then I will be rescued. I guess I wonâ€™t do that. Everyone will find me when itâ€™s too late. 

To everyone in here who is struggling keep fighting and keep pursuing what you want in your life. Iâ€™ve been battling with my mental health for many years now and I guess my time is up. Life isnâ€™t for everyone so make the most of it while it last. Idk what will happen after I die, but I really hope that it is better than this earth. Matter of fact I hope that there is no life after death, that we are all dead. Take care of yourself and keep at it. Seek help if youâ€™re really in a rot. If you think there is no other solution please get all the help you can before deciding to take your life. 

Iâ€™m tired of fighting and waking up every morning wishing I was dead. First thought when I wake up is why am I still here- final thought of the night I hope I donâ€™t wake up tomorrow. Meds donâ€™t work, shock treatment donâ€™t work ( not doing it again ), therapy doesnâ€™t work, etc. I sought out help, but itâ€™s not enough for a person who is severely suicidal and depressed. At least for me. 

I guess Iâ€™ll be sitting here till my time is up. Have a good life.

Best.
