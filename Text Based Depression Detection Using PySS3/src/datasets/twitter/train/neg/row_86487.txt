Unmedicated and fading.The onset of my mental illness was at the age of 15, and Iâ€™m 24 now. Over the past 9 years Iâ€™ve been through 4 hospitals and countless visits to therapy and doctors. 

Around 2017 I stopped going to the doctors completely. Since then Iâ€™ve mutilated my thighs to shreds, picked up the lovely habit of alcoholism, and Iâ€™ve nailed the coffins shut to every relationship Iâ€™ve ever had (all while avoiding medical treatment and hiding it from my loved ones). Best friends, gone. Family, gone. I havenâ€™t left the house in 3 weeks. The only thing I care deeply for and allow in my company is my fluffy little sweetheart. I look after him more than I look after myself. In fact, this kitty is the only reason Iâ€™ve been getting through my every day. 

Iâ€™ve stopped picking up phone calls and I donâ€™t answer when people knock on my door anymore. Iâ€™ve let everyone I love go. Itâ€™s been months now, to the point where itâ€™d be too strange for me to pick up the phone and dial everyone that used to love me. Thereâ€™s nothing positive to say to them. Iâ€™d hate to ring them up only to tell them I want to die and this could finally be it. They donâ€™t need to carry that burden. 

There is a part of me that doesnâ€™t want to feel this anymore, but I canâ€™t do it by myself. Thereâ€™s no one left to ask for help. 

Itâ€™s so lonely, and Iâ€™m not going to make it out alive someday. Iâ€™ll never feel good enough to allow myself the pleasure of friends, love, and medical treatment. 
Cheers. Bottoms up.
