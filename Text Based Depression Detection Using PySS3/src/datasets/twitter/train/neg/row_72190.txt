A friend of mine just told me that she wants to kill her self - I don't know what to do.Quickly, please help me. 

She's depressed over her last boyfriend (that she gave a second chance at dating, but he broke her heart again). She's had a hard childhood (raped, molested, etc.) and now she just wants to die. I don't know what to tell her besides that I'm there for her.

What should I do?
