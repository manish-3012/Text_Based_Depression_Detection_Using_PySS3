Everyone is so sick of me, and I'm even more sick of myselfPeople cannot stand being around you when you are depressed. They might think that they should, and they might even try, but you know and they know that you are tedious beyond belief. I am irritable and paranoid and lifeless and critical and demanding and no reassurance is ever enough. I'm so fucking scared, and everyone tells me I'm â€œnot at all like yourself but will be soon,â€ but I know I won't be.

The only way to stop this is death.

And I want to kill myself so bad, it's always in the back of my mind.
