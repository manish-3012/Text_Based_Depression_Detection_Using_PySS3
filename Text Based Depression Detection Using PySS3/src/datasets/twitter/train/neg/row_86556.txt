If life is a journey, and the journey will be shit, is it worth it?I'm having a hard time seeing whether or not to live life as a destination or journey.  

My goals in life have been set back by too many years--I've made mistakes.  My goals used to be quite high, but now I merely just want to become financially stable; in order to do that, I will have to jump many obstacles, most of which will make my "journey" not worth it.  

I know I'm being quite general, but I'm trying to relate to people who might be in the same shoes I am.  


I believe the system is corrupt; the rich are selfish bastards who do everything to keep the poor down.  They have an extremely high advantage over the poor, and will always be successful in sustaining a wide gap between the rich and poor.  The perpetuation will only get worse. 


Yes, people have done much more than I have with less.  I probably sound like a little bitch ranting about how sad life is.  It probably sounds like I have a weak mind.  But back to the point, is a life journey worth living if it will be shitty?  What is a good philosophy to living a happy life?  Without being a spiritual bum or some low-life guy who is content with everything.
