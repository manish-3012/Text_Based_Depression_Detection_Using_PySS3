I want to slit my throat and dieI hate my life. I am constantly being blamed for everything. At work everyone hates me. My personal life is pathetic. I just want to end it all. I want to die. I wish life wasn't so hard. I hate myself. I just need to find a knife sharp enough to slit my throat and bleed out. I don't even know why I'm writing this. Writing this is somewhat foolish I guess. People always don't care about you unless you want to end it all and if you tell them that numerous times eventually they'll say you're looking for attention. No one gets me. See you on the other side.
