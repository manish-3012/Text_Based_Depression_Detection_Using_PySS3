i feel as though theres nothing leftim reasonably young, 22, and have attempted suicide twice. i have continually reached out for help to friends, family and doctors but it seems like noone cares. my mother refuses to believe that i am even depressed, something which i have been dealing with since i was 14. 

i recently moved back in with my parents, which has been fucking awful. i quit my degree to come back to care for myself as i could tell i was going very mental, but it hasnt helped at all, as my mother is a mental bitch and my stepdad could care less about me.

over the weekend i saw my ex boyfriend who was the only thing thats kept me going, we havent spoken in 6 months. i told him how vulnerable i was and what was going on, we slept together and now he tells me he "doesnt have time" to deal with my shit.

i genuinely feel like im about to do it again, third time lucky, just get the fuck out of here. i dont even know why im posting on this, i just feel like fucking shit and want to end everything.
