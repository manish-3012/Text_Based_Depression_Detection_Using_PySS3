I feel like i can't go any further, i just can't go on...21 years. For 21 years i've been a burden for my parents, a waste of time, effort and money, in this time i haven't nor i think i could in the future give them anything back, something to make them feel all the trouble was worth it and the only thing i can offer them back is what they gave me, they gave me life and i should return it back to them, ending the burden and removing a huge weight from their shoulders. 

But that isn't the whole reason i'm probably doing this, it's also because i'm an ugly motherfucker, a mental illness bin, a social inept, a friendless loser, a virgin and a useless shit. Honestly i've already given up on getting a girlfriend, i never had one and i'll never have because of my ugliness and shit personality, not even tinder can help me up, i'll never have children, i don't even want to, i don't want to pass down my depression, anxiety, ugly, fucked up immune system genes, no, no child should carry this. I made some friends in high school, how i don't know, but after graduating when my depression got to its worst most abandoned me during my 2 years of recovery that followed, only 3 of them cared enough to send me a facebook message from time to time, but out of this 3, 2 barely speak to me now and 1, who i thought i could trust entirely, stopped talking to me after almost confessing to her that i was going to try to kill myself yesterday, i feel devastated, all i wanted was someone i could talk to, someone to help me. 3 times i've already tried to end it all, yesterday's was the third and as i promised myself the last, the next one, this one has to be the one. 

After what has happened i don't want to go back with my family, i don't want them to see me depressed again, after 2 long anguishing years of attempted recovery, i don't want any more pills and talks with my psychiatrist, i don't want to go every two weeks with a psychologist to tell me what to do and what to don't, i'm tired of all this, i don't want to "get better" again for no reason, i don't want to keep trying to fit in this decaying society, to live in a world going to shit and resisting any change, i'm tired of being myself, i'm tired of not having anything to look forward to, having no plans, no anything, of seeing no light at the end of the tunnel despite my efforts.

Someone please help me, i just want to go back when everything was cheerfulness, when my mother sang me lullabies and i was safe from everything, when i played in the mud carelessly, when ignorance was bliss, when i was happy.
