The ONLY reason I haven't killed myself is because I am not yet convinced that my existence is hurting othersIf I knew that it did, I would end it all immediately as I know that my life is of no benefit to anyone. And if so, so what? Their memories of what I was like would be better for them than actually having to deal with me. I am ugly, fat, lazy, stupid, naive, arrogant, foolish, and useless. I battle an eating disorder every day that is a source of great personal embarrassment. I have nightmares about everyone wanting me dead that just confirm that my own psyche is out to get me. I will never find the love of a woman and at my age it is too late to have women find me attractive.

Bottom line is that I would kill myself if I could be convinced that the planet's net utility would increase without me, as I worthless in every context. The end.
