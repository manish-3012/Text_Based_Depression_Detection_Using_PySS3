I talked to my mom todayNot really about anything special, but she was telling me about how excited she is for Christmas this year. She ordered some vintage decorations off of eBay because she wants to make Christmas feel special this year. I love my mom so much and I donâ€™t want to rip the happy memory away from her. Looks like my deadline had been extended
