Hanging by a thread*Dramatic title in prep for my stupid entry here: check*

Hello, so I can't kill myself, and it's a much worse feeling than forcibly restraining myself. When I first saw a psychiatrist I stupidly told her I would consider committing suicide with an OD. She instructed my parents to hide away all of the medicine. So, I don't have any rope, or the balls to even attempt to bleed out, so by my own stupidity, I'm here to stay, for now. Isn't that just great? Meh. I should go to bed. 

Don't know the response I want from this so just knock yourselves out I guess.
