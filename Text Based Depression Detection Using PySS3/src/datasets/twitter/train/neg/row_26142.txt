â€œSuicidal people are selfishâ€ and other lies people tell themselves.People tend to call suicidal people selfish, but at the same time people like to say â€œlive your life, no oneâ€™s going to live it for you.â€ So as long as I stay alive, my choices and life are mine, but if decide that I want to die, suddenly making my own choices doesnâ€™t apply and Iâ€™m called selfish. 

Sure, dying would affect some people I know. But wouldnâ€™t they be selfish to force me to stay simply because they themselves donâ€™t want to feel sad? Like bruh I feel sad every day, but Iâ€™m the selfish one if I take my life? Yeah, okay.
