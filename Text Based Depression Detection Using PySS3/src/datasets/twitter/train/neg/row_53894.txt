Why? Why me?I just want to vent right now. I wonder why almost all classmates/peers get to live atleast lifes worth living while I'm getting this dysfunctional brain that turns reality into a horror game for me lately. My classmates are worried that their boyfriend/girlfriend might leave them or that they will suck at that next chemistry test. I'm sitting here hoping that those creatures won't kill me and go away again. Odd considering I want to die and want to kill myself because of the intense fear, but those things petrify me. It's really hard seeing normal and happy people, it's just destroys me. Depressed since I was 13 to 14 years old, strongly depressed and somewhat suicidal since the half of 2017. Now 16 years old.

Now I'm just really easy to piss off, strong mood swings, emotionless and getting visual and auditory hallucinations (fucking terrifying humanoid creatures or sometimes just faces in the dark when going to sleep or shadow beings) that startle the shit outta me and making me paranoid and uncomfortable in my own room. I'm so fucking petrified by those. One appeared once under my desk when I sat there and it crawled towards me... I pissed myself. It had pitch black eyes, white skinny body, long sharp nails and huge sharp teeth. Starting to feel like some demons are after me and want to kill me/abduct me. I'm so scared and I'm living in constant fear of those.
Luckly those hallucinations have reduced drastically over last few days. I hope this shit goes away completly or atleast is only caused by depression and not some other neurological/psychological disorder.

**Why me? Or why do people have to endure those psychological/neurological disorders in general? It's so cruel and I just want to die now because of this intense fear**
