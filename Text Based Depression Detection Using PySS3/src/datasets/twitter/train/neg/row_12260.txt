Thought i'd shareI do truly want to go, my current life is absolutely toxic.
I live at home without work in during covid-19.
My folks their relationship is so toxic that sometimes I question if one day my mom will push my father over the edge where he buys a gun and executes everyone or if my father abuses my mother anymore where she murders him in his sleep. She has been wanting a divorce, but he threatens to leave the country if she attempts to divorce him. My father has treated my mother like dirt since i was born, my mother just recently started to stand up for herself, i've even begun standing up for her, but she takes it to the extreme, throwing things at him, hitting him then he hits her back and putting me in a position where i have to intervene which has gotten me hurt numerous times and almost put me in prison. If i had the money I would move out, but I can't even find work. I'm an anti-social type so, moving out to a friends house wouldn't work. My dads side of the family is in the middle east, my mothers side of the family is just as psychotic maybe even more. I'm 27, I don't nearly have enough money to leave, don't have any friends literally, family is a no go, therapy is a no because I don't have money for sessions, so I feel as if my only options are truly suicide.
