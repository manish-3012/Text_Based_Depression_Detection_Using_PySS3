I'm going to die from my eating and I can't stop it.My diet is terrible. It always has been ever since I was a kid. Somehow I stayed dangerously skinny, then normal, and now I'm fat. My eating has only gotten worse, but it was never good. I don't understand why I'm suddenly a fat piece of shit but now I am. I can't change how I eat no matter how hard I try. Even if I don't kill myself sooner, I'm going to die because of my body at a young age. I deserve this for not being able to do anything about it. For being a coward. Everyone else I know can so why can't I. It's so embarrassing and pathetic.
