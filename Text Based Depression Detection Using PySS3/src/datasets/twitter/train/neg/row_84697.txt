Too weak to act on suicidal impulses24F. Diagnosed w/ fibromyalgia, GAD, OCD, social anxiety, PTSD and depression. 10 years of treatment for fibro and 14 years for mental illness. Theyâ€™re mostly treatment resistant and I want to be done fighting.

Iâ€™m too physically and mentally fatigued to carry out certain suicide methods when I get the rare mental impulse. Iâ€™m picky because I want a minimal bloody mess and high odds of success. Also, the hospital is too traumatizing so I refuse to ever go back. It made me worse.

I am running out of money; I canâ€™t work enough to cover my expenses. My fibro inhibits my cognitive abilities so I canâ€™t finish college. I canâ€™t feel enjoyment. I do not have any relationships b/c people overstimulate and exhaust me... everything overstimulates me... life is too intense
I want pain to stop
Brain is turning off. Sleeping pills kicking in finally. If you read this vent, sorry and Thank you. I hope you have happy holidays.
