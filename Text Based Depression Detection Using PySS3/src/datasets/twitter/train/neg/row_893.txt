I think Iâ€™m going to kill myselfI gave birth 3 weeks ago and I cant handle this anymore. Iâ€™m so young and even before the baby I wanted to die. The stress and responsibilities are getting to me and I canâ€™t even fuckinf sleep. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t feel like myself. Iâ€™ve tried talking to my mom and boyfriend and people but I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t know how to explain how I feel to people other than saying I donâ€™t feel like myself and that I feel numb. I want this to end, I need this to end I canâ€™t take it anymore.
