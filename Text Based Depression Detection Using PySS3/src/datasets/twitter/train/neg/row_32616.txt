I dont know why I want to die.I dont know why these thoughts always creep up in my head. When things are good or bad. At the back of my head there's just that voice that tells me it can't get better, it'll only get worse. My anxiety shoots through the roof and I feel sick and nothing helps, i just think about killing myself. I've been on the edge before, with my brothers .38 in my mouth but I didn't do it then. I told myself I was gonna be stronger. But all these years later its just worn me down. I wake up tired, i go to bed exhausted, nothing brings me true happiness. I'm alone, even with all the people who consider me a close friend it just makes me feel guilty because I dont feel that way, i don't know how to be close to them. I dont know how to be close to anyone. My parents, my siblings, i havent dated anyone in years. I spend my whole day being fake until I fall asleep in  bed. I dont want to wake up then. I just wanna slip into unconsciousness and let it last forever.
