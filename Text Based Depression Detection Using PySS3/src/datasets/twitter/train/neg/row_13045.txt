Itâ€™s my life.... isnâ€™t it?Iâ€™ve talked to others about my suicidal feelings recently and something that bugs me is that the responses can almost all be summed up by the phrase â€œYou have no right to kill yourselfâ€. Why? I can choose any number of legal addictions and Iâ€™m within my rights, I can choose any number of ways to ruin myself financially and Iâ€™m within my rights, I can waste my health, youth and talents on any number of pointless ventures and Iâ€™m within my rights, my life can be as painful and meaningless as the day is long and itâ€™s perfectly acceptable but the moment I consider ending my life, my free will is revoked. Itâ€™s my life is it not? Can I not choose wether or not itâ€™s worth living for myself?
Why can others dictate my rights to me in this way? Iâ€™m single and have no kids. I donâ€™t understand why they hit me with that kind of flawed logic. A simple â€œI love you and I need you in my lifeâ€ or â€œMy life is better with you in it, please stay â€œ would mean so much more and makes a lot more sense. I donâ€™t think these people are wrong to try to talk me out of suicide, but being told I donâ€™t have the right only ads frustration to the mix and intensifies the need to act in a â€œIâ€™ll show youâ€ kind of way. 

Thank you for reading.
