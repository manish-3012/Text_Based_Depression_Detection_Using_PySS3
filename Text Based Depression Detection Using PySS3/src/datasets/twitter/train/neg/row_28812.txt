It didnâ€™t workI finally got the courage to try a second time to hang myself. First time, the belt slipped from the hook I hung it on and just dropped me a few seconds after I jumped off the chair. Finally felt like it was the right time again to do it and hung myself. I felt my heartbeat everywhere as I tied and tightened the rope on my throat. I remember it was hard to swallow and a little hard to breathe. The last thing I remember was watching the two fan dangling switches slowly sway as everything went black. I guess the belt slipped again cause I woke up on a box of stuff in my closet, and now everything just aches terribly. I just wish it worked, just something to go right for once. I wanna do it one more time to see if it works, and if not Iâ€™ll move from this method. I donâ€™t want anything anymore.
