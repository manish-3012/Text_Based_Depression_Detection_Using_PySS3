edge of earthlol i feel void, like i want to reach my desired goals but just disregarded. itâ€™s nothing more depressing than having all the tools but not able to complete the project. my mind is going away, i think i am dying right now. i keep hearing wait and be patient, it makes me feel even more gone. love you all bye
