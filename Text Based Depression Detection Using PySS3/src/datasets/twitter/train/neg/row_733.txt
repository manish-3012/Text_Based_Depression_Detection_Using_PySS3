A rant about what a miserable little shit I am.Time drags on forever. I feel dead inside and nothing besides something visceral, like food and masturbation, brings true joy to me. My only parent doesn't understand me and believes I'm just spoiled and that's the internet's fault somehow (that's common for people raised in USSR â€” they treat everone younger and their problems as soft and spoiled). My psychiatrist believes that depression is a teenage fad. I haven't made any friends since I was 12, and it was the only close friend I've ever had. We're parted now. I am truly alone. Entrusive thoughts about self-harm and suicide make cold run down my limbs.

I dream of going somewhere like Iceland, a remote small country where everyone knows each other, but I can't make myself work for it. I have no power left to do anything meaningful, I abandoned my studies and barely go to classes. I would love to hear anything in response, but I know that won't change anything for me, I act like I have no future.
