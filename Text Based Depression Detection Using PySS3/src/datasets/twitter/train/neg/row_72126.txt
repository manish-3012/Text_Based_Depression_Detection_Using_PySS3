I feel like Iâ€™m at peace with itI feel so strangely calm. Maybe Iâ€™m just dissociating but I feel like Iâ€™m in a dream and everything is moving in slow motion. Iâ€™ll either go to the hospital tonight or I wonâ€™t be here tomorrow. Leaning toward the latter. Thank you for trying to help. Iâ€™m just done.
