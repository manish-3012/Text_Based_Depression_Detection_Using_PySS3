I've been thinking about suicice.I've been throwing up blood for about the past 4 months. Finally getting a bit better now only throwing up pussy blood on rare occasions. Wife says she isn't happy being married to me anymore and hasn't been for a long time. Had suicidal since I was about 5. 

  I grew up being physically and mentally abused and the only person that I have ever truly opened up to is my wife but it's still hard some times because of how I grew up and is the main problem she is having with our relationship. She kicked me out Dec. 1 and won't talk to me.

  I don't know what to do anymore it seams like death is the best way out.
