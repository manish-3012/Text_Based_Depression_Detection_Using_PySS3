The urge to simply disappear is so strong right now. I just well actually donâ€™t want to take space on this earth up anymore.I am thinking about getting high as fuck and hopefully passing out, but these thoughts are bloody disturbing. This life i am living doesnâ€™t belong to me at all. Just want to end it. Donâ€™t know what to do. Do not know what the fuck I am supposed to do. 
Please anyone, tell me. 
Why youâ€™re still walking this planet?
My pets wonâ€™t miss me as I donâ€™t have any, my bf doesnâ€™t really care, mom would not be sad and if she did sheâ€™d deserve it.
