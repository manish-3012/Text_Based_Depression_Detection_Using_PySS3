I'm going to overcome my Avpd and agoraphobia to kill myselfAs the title states, I'm going to overcome my AvPD and agoraphobia to buy some rope, travel to another country to see a band and afterwards I'm going to hang myself. I have nothing to live for, so why bother trying. It'll probably be a few months before I can do this, but that gives me some time to prepare and get everything in order. I'm so tired of fighting everyone, the government, myself, the world. It is very clear now, I just wasn't meant to live. The universe has made it painfully obvious.
