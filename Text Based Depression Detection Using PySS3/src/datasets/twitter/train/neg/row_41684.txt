I will absolutely kill myself if my fiancÃ© does.So, my fiancÃ© has bipolar disorder. Sheâ€™s the love of my life and all I want is to help her through her hard times so she can get to the good times. Occasionally she will have really dark thoughts. She is very very good at making sure she reaches out to people about it and always tells me when she has them because she knows it isnâ€™t her and it is her disorder.  She doesnâ€™t want that and she does all she can to avoid it. Itâ€™s been her entire life and sheâ€™s always come out of it. Hereâ€™s the thing... She doesnâ€™t realize this, but I canâ€™t live without her. No... I wonâ€™t live without her. I refuse to.  I am worried to tell her that this fact might make things harder for her, but we promised each other we would always be open with each other about everything, and this is something she made very clear she wants me to be very honest and open with her about (this is because although I do not have bipolar disorder, I have clinical depression and general anxiety disorder and have had suicidal ideation before, almost to the point of actually making plans to, but not quite.) Would telling her this be wrong of me?
