Iâ€™m getting admitted and Iâ€™m terrified.Glad to get help. But I have severe anxiety and panic attacks. So. Iâ€™m anxious as all hell. I hope they donâ€™t keep me too long. I donâ€™t want to get stuck in there. I donâ€™t know what to think. Iâ€™m just so anxious. Especially because Iâ€™ll have to talk in group.
