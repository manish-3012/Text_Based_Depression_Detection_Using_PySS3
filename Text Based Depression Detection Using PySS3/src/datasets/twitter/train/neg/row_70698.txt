I think about suicide every dayEvery day I think about how I could finally feel at peace. My boss wouldn't yell at me over things that aren't my fault, my mom wouldn't constantly put her burdens onto my shoulders, and I wouldn't have to go hungry because I'm so broke. I could finally stop feeling like a failure. Like a nobody. History would forget me anyways. I don't care if it's selfish. It hurts so bad. I don't know how much longer I can take it
