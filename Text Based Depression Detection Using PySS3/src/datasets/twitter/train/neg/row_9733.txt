BirthdaysI didn't think I'd be alive in a year on my last birthday, but here I am. And I have the Flu. My ears have been ringing and painful, my throat hurts when I breathe, and I'm missing class which I'm to old and to far behind to be missing.

I set my birthday to public on FB to see what would happen. Nothing that's what happened. I wanted just one happy birthday that wasn't from my mom or brother. Apparently that's a lot to ask for.

By and large I'm doing better this year than last year. I no longer go straight to suicide when considering my options for any problems. So I guess that's progress, but I'm still unsure if this will be my last birthday.
