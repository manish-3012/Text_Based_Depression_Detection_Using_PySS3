Have no one to go to, my friend who said theyâ€™d help me through this rough time leftIâ€™ve been having mental breakdowns and bad thoughts on the daily for months, but recently about a month ago i started to hurt myself or have others hurt me without them knowing why i wanted to be hurt - they though itâ€™s just a joke. I trusted my friend who honestly helped me a lot but i hit another wall and i crashed and this crash led to my friend saying theyâ€™d be here to help me all the way through left me because iâ€™m too much to maintain â€” iâ€™m thinking of killing myself i have suicidal thoughts on the daily and even thought about jumping in front of a car going fast enough to kill me, i might just slit my wrists or jump off a balcony somewhere. I canâ€™t live life in the past 3 months has been extremely bad and i canâ€™t deal with it anymore, nothing takes my mind off any of the bad anymore and i have nothing to live for
