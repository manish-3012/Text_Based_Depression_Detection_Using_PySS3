called suicide hotline, no response. my life in a nutshell.no response after over ten minutes of waiting listening to crappy music and a robotic voice telling me to wait while iâ€™m connected to someone. my dad promised we would facetime, but he wonâ€™t even read my texts anymore. iâ€™m alone and not even the national suicide prevention hotline will talk to me. iâ€™m in so much pain.
