Feels like no one would miss me.One of my close friends has been ignoring me. It feels like he used me only when he wasn't feeling well. He told me he was just kind of done with me. And this isn't the first time something like this has happened and I'm starting to feel like if I died no one would really care. They got use out of me after all.
