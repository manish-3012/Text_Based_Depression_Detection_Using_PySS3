At a loss.Not at all for words but for a reason. Why do I feel the way I do? Nothing is inherently bad about my existence here. The paths my life draws me down don't gravitate toward any kind of extreme, (or at least not outside what most people would consider "normal" parameters) save for a few outliers. Yet I can't seem to do ANYTHING to silence the cacophony of thoughts screaming inside my head. Just when I think I have managed to quell them, they strike back with a vengeance. I have temporary moments of happiness, sure, but it feels as though it is but a form of stasis for the darkness that ails me. The only true joy I'm able to pull from this life is within the reverie of ceasing to be.

But WHY? Why the FUCK do I feel this way?

I couldn't even stop it if I wanted to. I feel caught in a snare between wanting to take my leave from this mortal coil and remaining tethered to those who I genuinely believe care for me. I feel an obligation to those around me, and to aid in humanity's fight in any way I can, but I despise that feeling to the very core. I feel guilty for just wanting to just finish it and that seems so unfair to me. Isn't it supposed to be my life? My decision? I hold my "own" autonomy, don't I?

I'm sorry for the length but I've been carrying so much for what seems to be so long and what plagues me the most is always the "why".
