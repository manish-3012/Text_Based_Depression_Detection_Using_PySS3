I want to kill myself out of sheer hopelessness when I think about my responsibilitiesI have an important exam in a month, and I haven't studied for shit. This isn't just 'another test'. It's gonna determine where I go in life. There's so much to do, and it's not that I am unable to do it.

I'm just not motivated enough. I waste all of my time and panic at the end of the day. When I see people not as smart as me far ahead in their prep I feel afraid. I just don't care anymore. I'm curious to see where death leads me.

I'm different from most people here. I have an amazing future to look forward to since I got into one of the best colleges in the world (at least in my opinion). I need to ace this one exam for me to get in, but I haven't started. I cant motivate myself. I just wanna end it all. I don't wanna slog to succeed, and I don't want the misery of failure. 

I've lost all hope, and I'd rather die than struggle to do in a month the stuff I put off for a year. It fucking terrifies me and fills me with dread. Every night I sleep, I pray I don't wake up. I'm done with this shit.

I hope I don't do something stupid.
