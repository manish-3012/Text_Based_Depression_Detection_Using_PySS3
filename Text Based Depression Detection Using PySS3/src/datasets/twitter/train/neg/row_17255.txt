I want to kill myself, but I don't want to hurt my familyI wish I could get hit by a car or get involved in any accident which would result in my death. I don't want to be saved, I just want this pain inside of me to end. I don't care about my own life but I don't want my family to feel guilty or sad about me wanting to kill myself. I act happy around them so they don't worry about me, because they have enough problems themselves. My mother told me that seeing me happy helps her getting strength to battle her own problems, but I just can't keep up the fassade much longer. My strength is fading and I hurt so deeply inside, I just don't want to live anymore.
