Iâ€™m living just to keep my dad alive.I was hospitalized a few weeks ago for suicidal ideation when my dad told me that if I killed myself, heâ€™d kill himself too. I never liked my dad all that much since he was pretty toxic but now iâ€™m living out of a moral obligation to keep him alive.

He told me what methods heâ€™d use and everything while I was in the hospital and now his life is just sitting on my shoulders. I dont wanna live just to keep someone else alive, I wanna live because Iâ€™m finally happy.

Thereâ€™s a hole in my chest and it hurts everyday and Iâ€™m never getting out of bed. I have suicidal ideation in the back of my mind everyday. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ever gonna be happy and now Iâ€™m stuck here. Iâ€™m tired.
