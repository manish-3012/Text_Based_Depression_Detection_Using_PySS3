I think its getting thereIm getting super suicidal again for no reason. Don't trust hotlines nor my ultra supportive parent as I know it will pass. My mom tries to analyze too much and its fucking awful because I can't even talk about the issues. Its hormones this, sick that. Its fucking always something. If the family has a history of mental illness maybe it's fucking not those, and instead real, you dumb BITCH.
