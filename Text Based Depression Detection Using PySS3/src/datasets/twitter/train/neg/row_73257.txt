Fed up.I really, really hate my life. I went out tonight. Friends... What fucking friends? They talked to anyone but me, showed an interest to everyone but me. 

They all hate me, they're all as fed up as I am about me still being alive. I am so tired, I keep trying to get better but every step I take only takes me closer to jumping of that bridge I know of. Fuck. I am desperate. And nothing can soothe my pain or dampen the darkness. I hate it.
