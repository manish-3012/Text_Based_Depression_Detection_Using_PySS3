Unsuccessful overdose attemptI donâ€™t know if this is the right place to post this, but Iâ€™m starting to get a little concerned and the health line number just tells you to go to emergency ASAP as soon as they hear intentional OD. 

Sunday night I attempted suicide by ingesting 4g of straight paracetamol as well as minimum 85mg of Temazepam, then about 8-9 hours later took a further 5g of paracetamol. I was dizzy, nauseous and exhausted yesterday (Monday) and today (Tuesday) Iâ€™ve developed a temperature, as well as still feeling unwell. I just want to make sure Iâ€™ll be okay until I can see my psychiatrist tomorrow afternoon. 

Thank you.
