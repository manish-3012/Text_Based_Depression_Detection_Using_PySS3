I want to end everything.Hi,

My name is Angelique, I'm fourteen years old, and I don't know what to do anymore.

My life has been so messed up. I know that is harsh, and I know people have been through much more than me, but I am in **so much pain.** 

I won't go into detail right now, maybe another time, but everything is so hard right now.

I feel like I'm never going to be happy. Ever.

I started cutting at the age of nine, and since then I have done so much to myself, that I'm  not entirely sure who I even am anymore.

I just want to cry, or scream.

I want to fall asleep and never wake up.

I know that I am just an annoying, worthless child, who's girlfriend secretly hates her, and who can't do anything right.

I don't want to be here, but I'm not sure if I want to die.

Dying is such a terrifying thought to me, or, I guess, sad. 

The fact that one I am dead, I am dead, is horrible. I don't want to hurt my parents, because deep down I know it would break them to pieces, but, I'm not sure what to do anymore.

I am on medication, and I go to therapy regularly, but it isn't doing anything anymore.

I am the worst I have been in a while, and I'm not sure what to do,

I know this is stupid, and you probably don't care, but I needed to post this somewhere.

I am truly sorry.
