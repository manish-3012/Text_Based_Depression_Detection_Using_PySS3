Canâ€™t seem to get happyMy girlfriend recently left me because I wasnâ€™t what she was looking for and I got cheated on in my two relationships before that. My dad left me 3 years ago and tried to file a lawsuit against for â€œharassmentâ€. My mom calls me worthless and a waste of space in the house. I have zero friends. Iâ€™m lost in my life and donâ€™t know where to go. Iâ€™ve been thinking about ending my life and I used to be scared of what came after but not anymore.
