What do you do when it doesn't get any better?Every single day since about 6th grade I've thought about and wanted to kill myself. After two attempts and being in the hospital for a while both times, and then being in an inpatient facility for a little bit, I went into therapy and put on lamotrigine. I was put on a couple other medications before that, but they didnt work or just made me feel worse.

I don't really know how long I want to be around when every single day is filled with how I want to die so much, but I don't want to put my family through that. It just makes me feel even worse about having those thoughts. I stopped self harming myself a couple years ago, but I've had the urge to start again the past month or so. I'm just so lost as to what I'm supposed to do, since these thoughts and feelings aren't going anywhere and they've been here for almost a decade now
