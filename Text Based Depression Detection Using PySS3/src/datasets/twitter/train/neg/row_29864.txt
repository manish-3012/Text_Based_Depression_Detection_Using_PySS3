how to get help if you can't tell parentsI'm a teenager and I'm so fucking sick of being sad. I can't do anything without being interrupted by thoughts about how much I want to kill myself. I don't have friends to distract me anymore, so I just spend every free second thinking about killing myself and the second I have the motivation to do so I probably will. The thought of talking to my parents or even other adults about it makes me feel like throwing up or passing out. I feel optionless.
