No Change.I always feel so alone to the point Iâ€™m just used to it, Iâ€™m always on my bed thinking about running away or attempting suicide for the 4th time. There hasnâ€™t been a day where I never consider suicide since 13 or 12. Everyday. Should it be today? Should it be right now? My mind feel like darkness has swallowed it all. Pitch black and white eye vision... food doesnâ€™t taste yummy anymore, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m a different person or something...

I avoid things that might remind me of friendships or relationships... I always end up crying my eyes out for reminding me of those experiences, I never want to feel those emotions again. I donâ€™t want a human close to me... I am a nothing more than a horrible person, being alone is the best thing for me
