24 electroconvulsive therapy procedures (Shock Therapy) and 35 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation sessions later....Wish someone would do a story on me. I am absolutely hideous, ugly, and atrocious. Suicide is not a impulse decision, my mind has been made up as for I have been contemplating suicide for 11years now. I tried overdosing and suicide by cop. Involuntarily admitted to the psych ward 3 times so I am not longer able to purchase a firearm. I am conformed to a more barbaric nobly guaranteed method of suicide. I no longer have friends and I lost my best friend from my mental exhaustion. The girl I had a crush on friend zoned me and is engaged. Iâ€™m an afterthought. I am a burden, I am a liability, a pathetic worthless virgin piece of shit loser. I am not good at anything, I have no purpose, Iâ€™ve got no reasons to stay. Everyday, day by day, Iâ€™ve been building up courage to finally commit suicide via setting myself on fire then hanging myself. Perhaps Iâ€™ll livestream it. I hope to have a closed casket so no one will ever have to see my ugly face again. I donâ€™t plan on turning 23 this year.
