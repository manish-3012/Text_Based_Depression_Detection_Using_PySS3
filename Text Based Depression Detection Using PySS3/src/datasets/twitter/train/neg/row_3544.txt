Ever combat fear of the future with â€œitâ€™s okay because Iâ€™ll kill myselfâ€Lately Iâ€™ve been so worried about how bad my life will be. Iâ€™m 17 and donâ€™t have a penny to my name and canâ€™t get a job because I have very severe anxiety that means I can hardly leave the house. My twin is learning to drive and saving up for a car. I see myself failing so much every day. I know I wonâ€™t be able to pay for a car until Iâ€™m maybe 19. Iâ€™m so unwell mentally. I can just see my life going down. Thereâ€™s no job or career I can see myself doing at all. I think Iâ€™m going to be homeless. I canâ€™t go to school because Iâ€™ve been signed off for the year because of my mental health. My chances at good A Levels have gone down the drain, I probably wonâ€™t pass any. And I only passed 4 GCSEs. I have never had friends and wonâ€™t acquire any friends because I havenâ€™t in 17 years. The pain will just continue.

But I just tell myself Iâ€™m going to kill myself so all this doesnâ€™t matter
