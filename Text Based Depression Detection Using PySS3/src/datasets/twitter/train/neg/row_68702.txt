I dont know if I can spend the rest of my life in painWithout going into too much detail, I've spent the past 6-8 months being tested for different things to see why I'm in pain.

It's come back with nothing serious. So I was suggested I change my diet, start some exercise routines etc. to help alleviate the pain.

And it had helped a lot. Until the past few days where the pain came back again and I don't know why.

The pain is sharp and sometimes unbearable. I don't want to eat or drink anything and painkillers do nothing.

I can't deal with having to live like this for the rest of my life. I was recently diagnosed with agoraphobia because my fear of getting sick whilst being out and about is terrifying.

I'm afraid of going on holiday and generally living my life. I can't stand it and I don't know what to do to stop it. I don't know of I can live like this.
