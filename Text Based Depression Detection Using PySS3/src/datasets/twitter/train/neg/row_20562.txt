My anxiety is starting to get to me, please someone just talk me down. Nothing helps right nowI'm 28 years old and have had anxiety issues before, but nothing too severe. My doctor told me to keep an eye on it because he said sometimes it can grow if left unchecked.

Well, an event took place that has made my anxiety completely take over my life, and I can't sleep at all. I'm so lost because I know I should have a good life, I have a good paying job, a car, am in shape, but I am so beyond unhappy that I'm starting to feel like nothing will get me out of this rut anymore.

My job has been getting more stressful, which has slowly increased my anxiety, but what has sent me over the edge is my most recent girlfriend (who I was starting to fall for) cheated on me and left me for him. And for some reason, that was the final straw for my anxiety. It has completely and utterly broken me. This is the third time I've been cheated on and dumped. I don't know what to do. I'm so ready to start a family. I'm getting older (I know 28 isn't old, but I thought I would at least be married by now). I feel so completely alone after this. Talking to friends and family just doesn't give me joy anymore. I try my best to go out and do stuff and not sulk around, but they are just distractions. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I'm so lost. I haven't slept more than 1-2 hours a night. It's effected my job, as I've been put on medical leave until I can get things sorted out and able to sleep again. But right now, I just don't see this ending. Something clicked inside of me and I'm so scared of what I might do. I'm so tired but I can't sleep. And it's just getting worse. Please someone, if there's anyone who's gone through something similar, please talk to me. I can't get the bad thoughts in my head to go away.
