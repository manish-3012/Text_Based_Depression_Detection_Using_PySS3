Want to die but can't find a method that I am comfortable with. Any one else feel the same?I'm pretty sure it's against the rules to talk about specific methods so I won't mention the ones that I was considering for a while.

My main issue right now is that I just can't find a method of going out that I'm comfortable with. All of it seems like it would be way too painful for me. If someone walked up to me and there was a button to instantly end my life I would just press it, no hesitation. Nothing like this exists though so I'm still here.

As for why I'm depressed, right now my main problem is that I just lack motivation. It's a terrible cycle. I am depressed because I lack motivation and I lack motivation because I'm depressed. I also just feel really lonely as well but that's probably just a product of having so much free time instead of having motivation to do productive stuff to grow as an individual. I would try to find a way to fix it but as I said I'm just not really motivated to. I'm just spending my time doing the bare minimum at school and keeping myself busy with new games coming out like borderlands 3 and cube world.

Maybe one day I'll find a method that I'd be willing to go out with but as for now I feel stuck.
