I need a friend to help meI've been torturing myself for years. My time came years ago. I should've been dead for a long time. I've been dead on the inside for a long time. I kept myself alive and I hate myself for it. I keep telling myself suicide is not worth it, but that's not true. I'm just too weak to do it.

Its been like hell. I cant function anymore. I cant move anymore without getting tired. I've been slowly neglecting myself towards a slow painful death. I hate that I'm doing this to myself just because I'm too weak to just kill myself.

I need someone to talk to help give me extra courage to get it done. To stop my paranoia and just simply pull the trigger. Someone please put me out of my misery.
