Wanted to kill myself earlierI just got off the phone with my girlfriend, who doesn't know that I meant to kill myself earlier. I cut my left wrist four times about 30 minutes ago and I know that the next time I see my girl she'll see the cuts. I was considering calling the suicide hotline for a while, but I heard that they send police sometimes and I don't want that. If someone can call me that would be great, just pm me. I was raped 2 years ago, and honestly I'm having flashbacks tonight.
