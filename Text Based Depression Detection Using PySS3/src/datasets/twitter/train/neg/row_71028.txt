I literally have noone to talk toCompared to people who have actual mental/physical health problems my reasons seem a bit tame to be honest. But honestly in my whole life ive never had anyone I could really talk to other than Google. I was taken out of school at a young age and isolated for many years. I spent a while homeless after I turned 18. It took me years to yearn how to walk normal because my leg muscles were fucked up from never using them.  I also had to learn how to talk to people. some times I'd rent a room off Craigslist and the other roommates would be drug addicted crazy people 

Now I live in a nursing home where they stick people with mental disabilities or who just don't have a place to go. There's noone here that's smart enough to hold a regular conversation. A lot of them talk to them selves and the staff are slightly stupid and sometimes even offensive. I've tried online dating but over the years I've never met anyone that wasn't abusive  (probably why they turned to online dating anyway). 

I always think how great I could have been if I'd started competing with the other kids in school and developing normally and went to college. Then I'd have lots of friends lots of constructive things to think about and I'd be happy. 

When I go outside I don't see bright successful people just walking down the street or taking the l train. They have cars. Its always me and crazy people talking to themselves. Its like I'm stuck in some endless loop. I know it doesn't sound that bad. But it actually makes me want to kill myself. 

I already know what to take so I can die painlessly in my bed. 

If anyone has any suggestions please comment
