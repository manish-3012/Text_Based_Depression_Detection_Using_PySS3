Gave it my best shotIâ€™m 37. Iâ€™m 5 ft 5. Iâ€™m 205 lbs. I have one child that I attempted to raise on my own and failed as a father and had to ask my parents to step in to ensure heâ€™d had a good life. I did 3.5 years out of a 4 year enlistment in the navy. Booted for drug possession. I placed 3rd at regionals in wrestling in high school my junior year. Was favored to win regionals my senior year. I quit, 2 weeks in to spend time with my gf who left me 8 months later during my second week at basic training. I had a job working in customer service. Excelled. Three months in, was asked to apply for trainer position. Got it. Completed 2 month certification, excited about a career that allowed me to help others. Two weeks after cert, our dept closed. 
Went to work at a factory. Started as stacker , four years in I was a machine op training to be line lead. Factory closed its doors. Engaged twice. Broke it off both times. Iâ€™ve failed at everything Iâ€™ve ever attempted. Iâ€™ve never completed anything I started. 

Looking back, the only happiness Iâ€™ve ever experienced was manufactured and fake. 

Iâ€™m sitting in my car at Walmart. I do this every weekend. Hoping Iâ€™ll see someone I know and they will acknowledge my existence. Iâ€™m a sensitive person and  I determine my self worth by how many people need me. I have not spoken to a human in 3 weeks face to face. 

I posted on Facebook many years ago that i would judge my life at the end by how many peopleâ€™s lives I touched, how many people I helped. I can count on one hand the amount of people who will recognize my name from my obit. 

In every way possible, Iâ€™ve failed. I tried though. No one will know , but I tried. I cared. 



TLDR; itâ€™s just word vomit because I have no where else to spew it.
