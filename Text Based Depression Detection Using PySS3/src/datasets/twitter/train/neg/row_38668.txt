What should I do to explain to my kids my actions?So I've got it all figured out and am trying to finish up tyingup loose ends.  I am trying my best to explain to my kids, who are all under 8, though videos and text files that despite the choice I have made, I love them unconditionally and that everything will be alright.  I don't have contact with them, so the next time they will hear from me will be though the media I leave them.  I feel like I may have missed somethings to say to them that would put their mind at ease and allow them to recover quickly.  There really is no need to try and talk me down, I just need some solid advice on how to talk to my kids through media.

EDIT: There is no hope for my life because my situation is too deep.  If you guys could please help me write my final goodbye for the sake of my children that would be real humanitarian act.
