I wish everything was just overHapiness is a lie. Winning is impossible. Life is just a series of lies, failures, pain, almosts and the only peace you'll find is in death.

It's a fact and don't you fucking deny it.

I've done EVERYTHING I can do to improve myself and my situation without ruining everything else and I can safely say that it doesn't get better. It gets even worse and worse. People say that it gets better for them, not for me. Some people have their dreams come true, not for me, only nightmares.

I give up.
