I want to get out so badI need to get out, out of my brain, out of this house, thinking about attempting it, maybe going on more walks, I want help, a place I can go, not my room, somewhere where I can be where I donâ€™t have to feel the cold wind or the weight of life, somewhere with the my gf and somewhere that I donâ€™t have to worry abt anything really, where I can finally be free, somewhere above the world, somewhere where I donâ€™t have to know that Iâ€™m insane, solace is all I want, just some peace, PLEASE GOD HELP ME
