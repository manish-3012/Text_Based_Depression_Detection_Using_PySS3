I don't want to wake up anymore23 y/o, female. Not sure what I am suppsed to do with life. Not brave enough to kill myself. I just wish I don't wake up. I am not motivated to do anything anymore. Worst thing is I don't even know what exactly is wrong. I don't understand to describe to anyone. I just want to die. I don't see any pong of my life. I don't have any real impact on anyone or anything. I am clumsy, mess up everything. I recently started an internship at a corporate org as a business analyst. I don't even know what I am doing anymore. If you are quick to say it's the job, no, it's me, I am a lazy fuck who has no capability to understand or adapt. Either I can't sleep at all or I sleep too much. I get annoyed at slightest changes. I am not motivated to do things I used to do anymore. I don't really want to talk to anyone. I feel like I am a pretentious fuck who has fooled everyone into think I am the good guy. But I feel like I don't fucking care about anyone at all deep down. I just.. wanna leave man.
