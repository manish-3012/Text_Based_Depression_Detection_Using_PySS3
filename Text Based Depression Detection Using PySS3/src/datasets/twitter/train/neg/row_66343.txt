Iâ€™m ready to just die.A lot of things in my life have pummeled me into this state of mind. Many things I once enjoyed have now become boring as fuck. Every day feels the same. Just working long ass hours and hardly remembering a thing. Pot doesnâ€™t help me escape my troubles anymore and I just feel like shit. Ever since Iâ€™ve been sexually confused my mental health has pretty much flatlined. The thought of not being straight, not having a normal life and having no chance at living one, at least in my standards fucking cripples me. I hate my parents for having me. I hate therapists, influenced by politicians who give no solution to my problem other than the lazy half assed â€œit is what it is gesture. Thatâ€™s lazy as fuck. Why canâ€™t they find some sort of gene therapy. They probably donâ€™t want to piss off the gay community, a group that I never want to be even remotely associated with. I hate society. I wish I was normal, but since there seems to be no solution to my problem, no light at the end of the tunnel, I think blowing my head off is probably the best option. Itâ€™ll be just like sleep, except forever. Iâ€™ll never have to worry about anything again. If I stay alive and accept therapists â€œhelpâ€ for my problem, itâ€™ll just prolong my misery and hurt. Theyâ€™ll just dope me up on medications that have terrible side effects. I could just be a hobo, where Iâ€™ll never be judged for being a bachelor. Or I could just end it all the easy way. I hate humans. All i want is just a normal fucking life and Iâ€™d do anything for that to be possible. Fucking Christ please please please please
