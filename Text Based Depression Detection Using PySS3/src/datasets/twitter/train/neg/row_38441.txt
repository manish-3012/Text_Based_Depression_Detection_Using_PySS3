I think I really need help...Hi everyone. I've been depressed for years but I've never told anyone. I've always just sort of dealt with it in the past and made due. Now it's gotten to the point where it's consumed me. This past year has been rough for me. I almost tried to commit suicide because I knew I would fail my last semester of college. I know it sounds dumb but it's true. I finally finished all my school work this fall and got my degree in the mail today which is great. I got a degree in physics so I know I am not an idiot.

For as long as I can remember, I've been an atheist. However, over the last few months I've been obsessed with religion and God. Everything about it like good and evil, heaven and hell, angels and demons, and afterlife. You have to understand that up until that point I didn't care at all about religion but that's when my depression started getting bad. I'm really scared about the intrusive thoughts I've been having and the suicidal thoughts have come back. I'm terrified of going to hell and being punished. I know as well that paranoia, including religious paranoia runs in my family (my great uncle started a religious cult). I don't know if I'm just having an existential crisis or something worse. 

I also have trouble making friends and I don't know what to do about that.

I want to talk to my doctor but I don't know how or what to say. I'm scared to tell my parents because they think mental illness is caused by a person not trying hard enough or being lazy. If anyone can talk I would be happy.

Edit: I think it may be my meds I started taking about a year ago. I think I will talk to my doctor about that.
