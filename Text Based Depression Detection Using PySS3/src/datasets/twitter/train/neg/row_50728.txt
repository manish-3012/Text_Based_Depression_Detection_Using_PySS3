Existence is pain.Existence is the only actual problem for me. Evrything else like â€œmy gf left meâ€ â€œmy mom diedâ€ is for me bullshit. I don t wanna live anymore in a fucking absurd universe where we don t even know wtf is this all abiut. And i think suicide might be the key. Besides that i am 19 yrs old internatinal student, studying at a university in Sweden.
