My final performance(?)Sorry about the eye-grabbing title, I guess I just wanted people to get curious and check this out. Ain't I a lil' attention whore?

Anyways.

I've always imagined that I would EVENTUALLY kill myself, it was inevitable, I turned 18 recently though and...I honestly didn't expect to make it this far.

I recently had a HIV scare, and it took a while to get tested and I just kept thinking to myself "Please don't let me have HIV, I don't wanna die" and shit like that, right? But here I am (thankfully HIV-) back in the same spot, not wanting to be alive. I tried to quit doing drugs, though I don't consider myself an addict, and here I am smoking another bowl. I just...can't seem to get out of the loop. Recently whenever someone wants to hang out it ends up just being annoying to me, and I end up making an excuse, and people finally see me as a flake now that I've ditched plans so many times.

I've got nothing going for me. I don't have a job, can't form any meaningful relationships and those that I did have are slowly dissolving right before my eyes. I don't even want to get better anymore. But in the end I'm probably just gonna pussy out of anything I try and just...continue as I am.
