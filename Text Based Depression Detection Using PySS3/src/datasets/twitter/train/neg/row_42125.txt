Found myself with a blade trying to self harm after four yearsIt's taken a lot of effort not to, and i couldn't go through with it. Barely nicked my wrist. I'm in a lot of pain, from losing friends and getting treated like crap. It's hard to stay positive and present for when people need me. Only to be thrown out like a rag when they're done.

I'm not sure how to tap into that ease of harming myself like before, it feels really hard to. Not sure what to do. Thinking of ending it soon, birthday coming so it seems like the right time to go.

Usually making stories distracts me, but I'm too hurt to even progress
