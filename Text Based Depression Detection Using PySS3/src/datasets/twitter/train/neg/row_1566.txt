(17) Please tell me it gets better after high school. I have a rope sitting in my Amazon cart.I've suffered from this long enough to know that suicidal thoughts are fleeting.

Yet, they keep coming back. Too often. I tell myself that I've grown stronger since then, but the events in my life seem to be worsening. In the past 7 days, I got rejected from a full-ride scholarship that would allow me to pursue my educational dreams. I poured my heart and soul into that application, only to find out that even beyond my stats, my story and hard work just weren't good enough. I also found out that my ex cheated on me for an entire year; they're all laughing at me on social media now. My grades are declining. Straight A student for 11 years...now a chronic C student. 

I find myself, once again, curled up in the corner of my room drenching my t-shirt in tears and snot. 

My mind is currently consumed with the thoughts of, "What did I do wrong? What am I worth? Am I too ugly, just like I had always thought? Why did I not connect the yeast infections and UTIs to my partner's disloyalty? Can I trust anyone anymore? How will I go into my next relationship without insecurities?" 

I've reached out to so many caring friends, but I know I'm burdening them with my issues. Seeking professional help is not an option at the moment, as my parents believe that mental health issues do not exist. They are genocide survivors, and they'd tell me, "How can you be so frail while living a cushioned life?" I feel guilty. Disappointed. Numb. Confused. Selfish.

But most of all, I am tired. I need a long, long rest. I recently read a post somewhere about how sleep is just a free trial of death. Sounds good to me. 

I pride myself on developing my own coping mechanisms, but are they really working if I continue to revisit that corner in my room?
