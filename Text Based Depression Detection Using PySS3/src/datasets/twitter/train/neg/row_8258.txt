I'm pissed at myself for being who I amI get called weird, turn red seconds into a conversation and have no self confidence what so ever. I hate my parents and I can't connect with anyone. I put on a fake face like everything is fine, but really I'm fucking miserable. I'm just want to feel good about myself, not turn red, and connect with people. Help me please
