I want to be betterRecently life's gotten alot worse. My bipolar flared up, my suicidal thoughts are much more active than before, and life once again feels like suffering every moment trying to survive.

I want to get better but I don't know how. I'm with 3 counselors, taking antidepressants and mood stabilizers, and I feel like it's my fault I'm not getting better.

Everytime someone mentions mental health, abuse, or anything like that I get defensive and have intrusive thoughts. I want to be better but I don't know how. I want a cry for help in a suicide attempt, not to actually succeed. Then I feel like I'm just attention seeking and not actually suicidal. I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know how to get by anymore.
