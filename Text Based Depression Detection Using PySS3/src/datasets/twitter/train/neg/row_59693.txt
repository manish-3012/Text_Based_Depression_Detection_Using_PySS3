I tried it a couple weeks agoA couple weeks ago I took a knife to the bathroom and was going to do it. Well... My skin is a lot more rubbery than I expected. Sharpened it, nothing. Tried again, nothing. Then I remembered my brother is pretty obsessed with his beard. I found razor blades, those really thin ones. Didn't expect to cut easily, boy was I wrong. I barely touched it and was bleeding. So I started cutting, doesn't hurt much, feels like an injection all throughout. Turns out I can't cut deep enough, I don't have the fucking guts to do it, so I'll have to find something else. Improvised some stiches with tape and made up some story about my cat, etc. I'm sorry for posting this here, but I wanted to tell somebody, even if that somebody is a bot or whatever
