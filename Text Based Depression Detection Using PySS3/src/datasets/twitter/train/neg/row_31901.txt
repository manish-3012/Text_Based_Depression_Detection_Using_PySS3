Just numb and emptyI feel nothing about anything. I donâ€™t want to do anything I like to do. I feel like I have no identity. I feel like I have no purpose. I feel like I have nothing left. Iâ€™ve just been pushing everyone away and constantly thinking about how and when I should kill myself. Iâ€™ve been thinking about who I would want to take care of my cat. I just give up. I feel so useless and disgusting. I feel like such a failure. I feel so alone. I donâ€™t even want to be with my boyfriend who is amazing and who deserves someone normal. I hate myself. I hate myself so much. Iâ€™m just in so much emotional and psychological pain. I just want it to stop.
