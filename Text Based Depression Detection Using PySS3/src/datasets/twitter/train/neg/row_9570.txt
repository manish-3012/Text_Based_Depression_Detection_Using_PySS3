I still want to dieAbout a couple months back I finally got medication after living with depression for 3 years and a lifetime of anxiety. I felt better for a little while but my anxiety is still relentless and exhausting. I just don't want to deal with this anymore. I don't want to deal with *life* anymore. I'm so tired of being scared of everything. 

I made an appointment to see a doctor to fix my medication, but, god, I just don't want to do this anymore.
