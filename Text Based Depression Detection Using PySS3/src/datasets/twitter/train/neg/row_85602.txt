19, about to get laid off/fired, close to giving upI'm 19, will be losing my job soon, and haven't had a friend for at least 3 years. People usually don't understand me when I talk, so I have to repeat myself and try to avoid talking.

My job is through a workforce program (I didn't need to interview for them to place me at a job) , and I was told that I should start looking for a job. 

The manager at the store as threatened to fire me twice anyway, and I walked out the second time. I came back the next day, and he told me that I need to act like an adult, then told me to get to work.

I don't understand people when they tell me to do something. 90% of the time I need to have someone else repeat it or even do it for me. It doesn't matter if I get hired at another job because I will fail anyway.

I want to give up. The only thing keeping me from hanging myself is what it would do my my mother. I feel like if I don't kill myself now, I'll just do it a few years later.

I have been hospitalized before when I was sixteen, and I do not want to go back again. It'll just waste my parents money. I plan on leaving the money in my bank account for costs related to my death.
