Why do I keep tearing people downI ruin everything I touch. Everything, from the minutiae of my daily interactions to my long term prospects and relationships. I am scum. I'm a thin veneer of a human slathered onto a plastic body. I'm a shell. I don't want to die, I want the pain to end, but it keeps getting worse and worse. Every time things look up, they fall back down. I'm at my wits' end.
