I lost everything (20M)This is not even the whole story because all my life has been shit for years, snowball effect in play for many years, psychological problems + gambling = deadly. I cant take the guilt anymore and I don't want to bother my parents with this shit. I just gambled away my fucking rent. Now I am gonna become homeless at just 20 years old. I feel like dying and ending this never ending rat race. I fucking hate it. I would rather atleast try to just disappearing before dying but how am I gonna do that? I want go far FAR away and start over but I am in the middle of some studies that i don't even care about and I got 10k$ in loans already for that. Existential crisis 24/7. I just feel like a programmed meaningless robot.

I am completely worthless, I can't contribute to society. Money makes me want to kill myself even more than usual, i deal with enough problems already with anxiety and depression just kill me already.
