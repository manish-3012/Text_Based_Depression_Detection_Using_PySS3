I'm worried this may be the beginning of my endEver since I got off active duty for the army, things have been good.  I've always had a self immage issue and its led to me being psycotic about going to the gym eating right and running. I' know I'm a verry good looking person only for the fact that people tell me. But i am udderly disgusted with my self. Not the point of this but may be an underlying cause or sign that something bigger is the problem. I have daily thoughts of suicide, how I am going to do it. What method where when all that stuff. I've gotten so used to the idea that I feel strange when I'm happy or not drinking, I've turned to alchahol as a form of self medication. But can't seem to stay happy because it does dammage to my "self immage" I've seeked help in the past but deny any medication because fellow vets of mine have gained a lot of weight on them.. not sure where any of this is going but if anyone can help or knows of a way to stop these thoughts I would like to know. I think it has become a serious issue to the point where I don't know if i can be alone.
