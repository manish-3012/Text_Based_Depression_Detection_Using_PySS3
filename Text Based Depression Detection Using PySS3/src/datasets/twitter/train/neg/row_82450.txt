Alone and no longer soberI was clean for so long.  About 3 months. That may not sound like much, but I chose to get clean the day before my girlfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me.  She was also my first girlfriend, I'm 20 but my parents are so upset with me for being gay I could never date until I got to college.  With my first girlfriend I lost all of my friends, we got together so soon after I came to college that I just made all of her friends my friends.  With no friends and unsupportive parents I feel so alone.  I have a new girlfriend, of a month, and one distant friend.  The only other people who care about me are my mentors through a pre-doctoral program; I opened up to them about my breakup and drug use at the same time.  I just can't stop using drugs to feel better. My depression is overwhelming unless I can numb it somehow.

I can't keep doing this; last semester I lost my scholarships because I was high all the time.  I have reached out for help with a University Counselor, and I fear that the people I care about are going to stop liking me if they find out I can't quit. My mentors will abandon me, I can't be successful like this.  

I don't know if I can quit, but I know I could just die before anyone finds out I can't quit. Every time I get high I think I should just do it, and every time I get a little closer to going through on that. I have a plan, and not keeping the things I would need to carry out that plan in the house has saved me more times than one. 

I'm just really done, and ready to give up on myself, and I'm so scared everyone else is ready to give up on me too.

I haven't told anyone about being high the last two days except for my counselor. I haven't told anyone period about being currently suicidal. 

TLDR; 

I alienated all the people I cared about, now I'm slipping back into drug use and I have no friends to help.
