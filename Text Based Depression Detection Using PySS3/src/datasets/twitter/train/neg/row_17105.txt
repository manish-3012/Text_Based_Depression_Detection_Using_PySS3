I don't think I can ever get help.I'm trans woman and that bothers me so much. I don't think I can ever get help, because there is no help for me. I hate being male, but I'll always be. Forever. And that hurts me so much. I hear people say "trans people are delusional!" But the truth is, I wish I was delusional, I wish I truly believed I'm a woman, and I do think I *should* be, but sadly I'm not. 

I don't think transitioning will help. I can't change my biological sex. The fact that I will probably always look like a male doesn't help. I feel like if I came out, people would call me a female name and pronouns, but only out of kindness, not because they believe I'm a female, not that I blame them. I don't believe I'm a female either, and that really hurts me. 

I really hate the negative perception of trans people aswell. It really gets to me that people will either think that I'm a delusional mental ill man, or a autogynephile. I might be mental ill, but I'm not a autogynephile. I'm not a very sexual person. I never masturbate, or have sexual fantasies, yet these people will think I'm a pervert. I don't know why I'm trying to prove that I'm not a autogynephile, they'll never believe it. 

 I really just hate being trans. After 2 years of trying to accept it, I can't. But sadly I can't accept being a male either. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense. It just really gets to me. I don't know how I can get better if the only cure doesn't work for me. Some people might be okay with it, and I'm glad it works for you, but sadly it doesn't for me. 

Rant over, now go ahead and call me names. I understand that I'm the weirdo that's easy to bully. Goodbye.
