best friend says if i killed myself heâ€™d do the samehe is the most important person in the world to me and has been forever. i think a lot of people abuse the term â€œbest friend.â€ i love him more than anyone, heâ€™s my soulmate, and he always says the same of me. weâ€™ve talked for hours almost every day (besides some petty fights and hospital stays) since we were 14, despite us being internet friends living across the country.

weâ€™ve both struggled pretty intensely with suicide, but he doesnâ€™t anymore after going on klonopin and getting a good therapist. no amount of medication or therapy has helped me, though. every day i dread living. i dread looking in the mirror and talking to my family and reading the news and thinking about a future i donâ€™t want to live in.

my best friendâ€™s happiness is the only thing i can really bring myself to care about anymore. i know he would struggle without me; heâ€™s insecure, heâ€™s struggling with college applications, he doesnâ€™t have any close friends besides me, heâ€™s addicted to drugs, his boyfriend recently dumped him. heâ€™s told me that if i kill myself then heâ€™ll probably kill himself too, and in the current state heâ€™s in, i believe him. so my plan is that iâ€™m going to change that before i do it.

iâ€™m going to try to make him as happy and stable as possible over the next year. iâ€™ll help him with college applications (heâ€™s extremely smart and could go anywhere he wants if he applied himself) and help him find opportunities in his field (heâ€™s very talented but doesnâ€™t really know how to get his work out there). iâ€™ll help him in his struggle with addiction, rather than being the poor example iâ€™ve set in my own struggle with opioids. heâ€™ll go to college and meet tons of people just like him, incredible people, people who will benefit his life far more than i can. heâ€™ll be happy.

and iâ€™ll slowly distance myself from him, so when i end my life, iâ€™m barely a blip on his radar. a year from now, i want to be dead. i just donâ€™t want to take him with me. and i know itâ€™ll affect him in some capacity, but maybe not so much. heâ€™ll still be able to go to college, heâ€™ll still be able to follow his dreams, heâ€™ll live.

hurting him is my biggest regret, but itâ€™s not enough to stop me from wanting to kill myself. itâ€™s just enough to postpone it. if it wasnâ€™t for him iâ€™d do it tonight. i love you oliver.
