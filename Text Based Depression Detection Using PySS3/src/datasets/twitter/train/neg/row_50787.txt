I just want to have some control over somethingI have no control over anything that matters in my life. Everytime I find something or someone that means something to me they're ripped away from me. I fuck up and want to redeem myself but they never give me the chance. I don't even have any power over my education because I've been robbed of any chance I had of redemption with a predicted grade system being put in place. Any time I try and improve myself its thrown back in my face and just lose any value I had for myself again, feeling totally powerless.

I feel like the only control I have over anything anymore is whether I live or die, at least if I killed myself it would be my choice how I died.
