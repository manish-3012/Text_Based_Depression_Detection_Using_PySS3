So about life? So I know this is kinda a weird thing to ask and all. But I'm a 31-year-old man. with no family or friends. I can't drive a car. and within the past 2 months, I've lost my job. I'm kinda not seeing a reason to live. Like most people live bc of family or friends or bc they have a goal in life. I just don't see one. like I know most people will say, "go talk to someone or go see a doctor." but i have $1200 to my name and that somehow need to last me 2 months when all together my bills are $2200. So by the end of the year. Ill be job less. no family or friends. and homeless. whats the point to living then? Like I dont want to die. but its about to be cold out. and well. Im about to die slow and alone. so wouldn't me doing it in a warm house be better than in teh street?
