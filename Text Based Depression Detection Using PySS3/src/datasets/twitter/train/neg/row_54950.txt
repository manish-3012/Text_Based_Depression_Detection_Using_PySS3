The only desire I have left is to dieImagine, you are sitting at a family dinner with some immediate and not-so immediate family members. You are depressed as hell, but managing to hide and and function more-or-less. Somebody chirps up from a couple of chairs down and says:

"So, what do you want to do now, [Name]?"

And you know what? I've always wanted to tell them the truth. I've been chronically depressed my entire life. I have made no aspirations and no steps towards achieving any sizable goals. 

Why?

I've always wanted to die. And I'm very close to achieving it.
