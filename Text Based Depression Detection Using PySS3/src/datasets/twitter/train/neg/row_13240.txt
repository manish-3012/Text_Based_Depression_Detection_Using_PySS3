Overdosing Soon.Dang, I thought this would be easier. Or at least less heartbreaking. Right, I've [written](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fkq44d/todays_my_last_day/) [several](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dkfqdx/06152019_7719_2020/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dm19y5/im_in_a_very_odd_place/) [in](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dq03l7/a_step_closer/) [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dyjgt8/i_lied_but_today_im_telling_the_truth/) [sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fk3o7m/i_refuse_lifes_plans_for_me/).

1:20 AM: I'm talking with her.  

4:40 AM: I'm going to get in bed, pills at the ready. Once I pop them, there's no going back.
