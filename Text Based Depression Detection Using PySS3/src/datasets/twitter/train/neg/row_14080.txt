i think im going to just wither away and die now, kinda like a slow suicide.ive finally reached that point in depression where you just lay in bed and do nothing. i have not much reason to do anything now. i hope i die. im tired. i dont care about anyone and anything anymore. actually, i do care. but not enough. 

my reddit accounts are all permabanned and my appeal was rejected. this website has what kept me sane. participating in it and engaging with other people has always been something that helped me through things. i deserved to be banned, of course. i was a dick. but im still tired. 

im tired of this world. im tired of the unjustice and cruelty. this is nothing. there is nothing. there is no hope and no reason to live when i canâ€™t do anything to save others. the kids at the border. north koreans. chinese citizens. uigyurs. armenians/azerjis. starving african and yemeni children. the cartels. 

how are people happy with this? content with this? wasting time defending politicians and other people who dont deserve it instead of helping the innocent ones who do.

everyone deserves to be happy. and id give my entire being to make everyone happy. but i canâ€™t. it hurts. i donâ€™t know what to do to save people. i dont think i even care enough or even want to. i wish i never existed in this world. 

i wish i didnt have obligations. a life. a dog to care for, which im barely caring for by the way. friends. family. i want it to just fuck off so i can rot away and die without hurting others. i dont want to be selfish, ive always been selfish and only wanting to talk about myself, but people just wont let me go. 

i messed up bad, and iâ€™m sorry.
