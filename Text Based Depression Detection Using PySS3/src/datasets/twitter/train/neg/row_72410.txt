i feel like im replacing my big brother.so yesterday i moved into my older brothers old bedroom, he got kicked out of home by my step dad at 16 and i hardly ever see him, not even on holidays. i feel wrong that im now in his old room, like im replacing him. i always thought that maybe he would be able to come home and get his old room back. but im in his room replacing him. this is the room i would go to, to ask advice or question about my homework and play xbox with my best friend, the one person i know would never judge me, not the room where i replace my older brother. and i have no one to talk to about it.  my mum is always at work and the mention of my brother makes her upset i have no other brothers and sisters living me expect my 3 yr old brother. im feel so isolated and alone with him gone and now im supposed to live in his place, be him, the older sibling with all this responsibility. being the middle child replacing the eldest is too hard, its not right, he should be here looking out for us, helping us, being a big brother and living in this room not me.
