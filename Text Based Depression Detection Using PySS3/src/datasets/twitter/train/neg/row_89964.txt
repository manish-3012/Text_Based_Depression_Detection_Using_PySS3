in loosing myself.. idk what else to sayi honestly dont really know why im writing this, its been years and ive honestly accepted the fact that no one and nothing will probably save me at this point 

im lucky enough to say that im undergoing therapy and medication but its really not working.. ive told my therapist this but you eventually become so use to lying to everyone including yourself that you dont realize it before its to late for others to understand. im not ok 
im not gonna get better am i..?

it sucks to say and admit that my only reason for living is my boyfriend but even then when hes not around the only thing keeping me sane is doing art for other people, not even myself because it distracts me from life. 
i cant even attend school properly and my mind feels fuzzy for some reason i feel lost in myself like nothings real anymore 

i dont really know what im trying to get by saying this or typing this but i just kinda wanna give up again
i survived my attempt 7months ago and since have been in treatment ever since but it just feels so hopeless and lately my thoughts are all over the place and the only way i can express how i feel is by screaming my lungs out and wishing the pain to stop 

but what pain? i dont know im so.. lost and confused what do i want 
why am i still holding on..?
everythings so blurry and numb 
im tired..
