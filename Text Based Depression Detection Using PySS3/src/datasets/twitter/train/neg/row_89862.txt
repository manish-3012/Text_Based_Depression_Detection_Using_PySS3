How much hydrocodone do I need?And time? I have a whole bottle left from my wisdom teeth removal, and about 9 hours before someone finds me. Should I pair the meds with something else? Iâ€™ve been contemplating this for a while and I just need to be gone already. I genuinely canâ€™t take this anymore.
