I'm suicidal, because I don't want to deal with lifeAt least that's how I feel. Prominently, I feel like if I died I wouldn't have to deal with objectively mundane and non serious things, like my overdue assignments or being called in to work. These things aren't worth dying over, but yet they drive me to consider killing myself daily, although it's not necessarily with the most conviction. I have trouble convincing myself to take the leap, even to something as "less severe" as self harm, because I'm so scared of pain and death. And yet I consider it every day, because I'm cowardly and afraid and weak and I'd rather die than face life, and my failings. 

It would help if I could sleep, as well, to be honest.
