Voices in my head tried to convince me to kill myself for monthsLast year I was in a state of psychosis and slowly but surely lost grasp of reality. Leading up to this day, over the course of several months I was hearing voices. They were very faint and I would often ignore them or assume they were just sounds/voices echoing from the city streets. As weeks passed the voices became more present, they were the voices of my parents questioning my mental state asking things like What's wrong with him? What is he doing? Why is he always hiding from us? Of course, my parents were never there but I couldn't help hearing them although I don't think I ever was sure who or what I was hearing.
Months later as my mental state continued to get worse I had already begun hearing several voices daily and regularly telling me to kill myself or convince me/trick me into doing so. At one point I lost control of my body and nearly jumped from my high rise apartment fire exit. Days later I came to a point where I barricaded myself inside my apartment as 10 to 20 voices were taking over me, they were relentless ans determined in getting me to kill myself. Eventually I ran from my building screaming as those 10 to 20 voices came to be 50-100 voices screaming at me from all directions. I was reported to police as a suicide risk and was taken to the hospital. It took about 8 months for me to get to a point where the only voice I hear in my head is my own. If I can overcome this, please remember you can too. Seek help before its too late.
