I have decided to end my life.I have decided to end my life. 

Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but this concept is the only thing giving me strength to live (ironically enough). Today, I realised with such clarity that I truly wasn't intended for 'life'. So many people have a desire for what they want to do - whether they're socially defined as 'intelligent' or not, if you have something to strive for, you have purpose to live. I have no purpose to live. I cannot think of one career that I would ever enjoy. My future is dependent on how I do now (I'm 17 and doing my A-levels), but I've had no motivation to study, because I don't enjoy my subjects, so I'm not doing well in my exams. This isn't a 'boo-hoo look at me' sob story, this is more of an outlet allowing me to justify, to myself, why I'm eventually going to kill myself. And as everyone knows, life doesn't owe me anything. If I don't have the drive, especially now during my qualifications, then I'm going to be stuck in the car going nowhere; figuratively and literally (I can't afford gas if I don't have an income). Right now, life ending seems much more compelling than working hours a day towards something I have no personal interest in. I've only had a handful of interests in the past years and none of them interest me career-wise, and most of them died out after I realised that it takes too much persistence and energy (which I don't have) to keep them up. The only think I've been consistent with recently is going to the gym, and that's only because it distracts my self-destructing tendencies and gives me a temporary sense of gratification (I have considered a career in personal fitness but, like every other career I think of, I feel no attraction to it). I've began to wonder what the purpose of writing this is, and if you made it this far, I'm sorry for wasting your time
