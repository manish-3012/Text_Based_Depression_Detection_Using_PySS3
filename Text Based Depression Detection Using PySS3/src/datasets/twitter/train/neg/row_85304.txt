I wanna die but I'm not brave enough to commit suicideI want to die. And this thought comes to me almost every day. I'm a girl, I'm 20. Everything is fine in my life. I have family and friends who cares about me. Nobody died. I'm in good health. I have enough money to eat, and sleep in a warm place. I live in a free country. I'm not bullied, or discriminated, forced to anything, I'm not going through any hard stuff.
But it's been more than ten years that I feel this bad. That I have suffocating and weeping crisis on the floor almost everyday. That sometimes I hate myself so much that I throw up after looking in the mirror. That I know I'm completely empty. That even if I seem to have fun, after I know that it wasn't sincere. That I have no passion. No lead in my life. That I not even sure to love my family. That I've never fell in love or had any crush. That I've been incapable of having sex. I had once and it was complete indifference. That I have no dreams, no imagination, no memories. That I disgust myself for being so selfish. That I feel like I fantasize my own grief. I'm exhausted.
Wrote myself a letter 5 years ago for when I'll be 20. Just confirms what I already knew; nothing has changed except that know I don't have the perspective of adolescence anymore. I suffer so much over void, and I'm not even sure this suffering is genuine.
I know what I think is wrong, I'm the first to say that every human being is valuable, deserve love etc... I'm just lost in the nowhere.
