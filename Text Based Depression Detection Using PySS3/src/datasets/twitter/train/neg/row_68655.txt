Military suicide need helpSo Iâ€™ve been in the USAF for 2 years and had to say goodbye countless times. This time is different I met someone who made me happy every time I saw/heard from her made me the happiest guy ever. Iâ€™m not going to be that typical airman that marries her just because I like her. I got orders for Korea, we both wanted to enjoy each other as much as possible before I left. I want to love her but I canâ€™t, Iâ€™ve had to say goodbye to friends and family countless times.  It hurts so much, I hate the military so much. I drink a ton everyday and  I wish I could just die cause I amount to nothing. I canâ€™t love anyone and I just move from place to place. I make friends at the moment but nothing ever last. I served my country but at the end of the day Iâ€™m just another body. I want to passively die but donâ€™t want to commit suicide cause I donâ€™t want to go to hell (from what I believe). I just want to die honorably.  Iâ€™ve thought about suicide countless times.  The  us military isnâ€™t what it seems. Iâ€™m an excellent janitor but I have no outside job skills.  Pls help
