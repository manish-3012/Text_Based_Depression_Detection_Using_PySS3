i donâ€™t know whyIâ€™m 16 and have a great family and awesome friends and i donâ€™t know why i feel so alone and helpless. i constantly worry whether my friends like me or if they talk to me because of pity or whatever. My family is extremely supportive of me in my decisions but i still lie to them and hide things from them. im a failure and thereâ€™s something wrong with me. im afraid of being judged. suicide has been something that always crosses my mind but i know i shouldnâ€™t feel this way. Why would I? I have the best family and friends, iâ€™m doing well in school, i have food on the table so why. Why do i want to commit suicide? PLEASE WHY I DONâ€™T UNDERSTAND. i know if ppl know how i feel despite my blessed situation they would feel that im spoiled or privileged and they might just be right. anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this.
