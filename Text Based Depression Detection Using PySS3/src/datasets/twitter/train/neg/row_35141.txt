Thought that a drink would help a bitI know i know im a bit of a lightweight but i usually feel a little giggly after maybe 2 glasses of wine. Tonight I had 2 at dinner, one mixture after dinner, and a strong mix of my own demented brain like, 20 minutes after. I feel 100% sober. No giggly feelings, no unclear thoughts, no tiredness or nausea, just...the same as always. Why is it that i cant ever get fucked up when i actually want to?
