Set goals but don't see myself reaching them at all. Sick of the boredom in my life.I'm a 19m (youll probably stop reading since I'm not a girl), but ive been suicidal since I was 16, and I was told things would get better simply because I was young. I've never had a relationship, I've never had friends or a best friend, and my grades are still very bad. I was very close to getting kicked out of college but I barely made it with a solid 2.080 when I needed a 2.0, and I just started a job last week. No one there likes me. I've always been hoping to get my grades up and find someone to have a relationship with but it will never happen. Those two things are impossible. I have hobbies that I am bad at, like cooking, playing music and going to the gym. I really don't want to live but I don't have the courage to stop myself from living. I was hoping to get through life with some good accomplishments but its not going to happen. My parents also love to insult me and put me down, and its not good. I posted before, so theres more there, but I didn't get much response because I'm a guy. Any advice?
