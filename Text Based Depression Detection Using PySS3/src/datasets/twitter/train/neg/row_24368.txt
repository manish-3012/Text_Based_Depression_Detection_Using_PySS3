Killing myself tomorrow.I've run out of reasons to keep fighting. I'm single, never had a real life girlfriend, there's nowhere to go to meet people besides bars and casinos, I don't drink, don't have a car and I don't have money, just this week I lost one of my best friends, lost a job offer and my family got an eviction notice. On top of that, I can't even buy the one game I've wanted for like over a year, Battlefield 1 cause it turns out my old college books aren't worth dick. So I have no hope of finding love in this redneck-ass town, no money to buy the one thing that would give me some solace and nothing else. So tomorrow I'm going out and I'm going out in grand public fashion.
