This may very well be the end for meI'm about to fill a bucket of hot water, get my sharpest knife, and cut down my arm until it's damaged enough that it will bleed fast and enough that the hot water should stop the clotting.

I've been in pain for so long and I'm just tired of watching everyone live out their happy days while I'm sitting here waiting for mine. It's even worse that I have to watch the person I care most about be with someone else.

I'm no longer sad, and I certainly don't fear death, I just want my final day to come now.

**Edit:** It turns out it's impossible to cut through my skin with a kitchen knife, I'm going to have to find a different method.
