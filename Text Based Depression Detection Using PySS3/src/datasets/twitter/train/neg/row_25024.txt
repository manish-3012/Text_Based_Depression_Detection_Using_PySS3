Once youâ€™ve realized your unique qualities Itâ€™s easy to tell what people actively try to avoid youBut thing is that it is just as bad to be forgotten.

But i know for sure I am not forgotten, I am simply repulsive to people. It is obvious they actively try to filter me out. And they probably always did.

I couldâ€™ve died right here and now it would takes years be someone would notice. And even decades for people I used to know to realize Iâ€™m dead.
