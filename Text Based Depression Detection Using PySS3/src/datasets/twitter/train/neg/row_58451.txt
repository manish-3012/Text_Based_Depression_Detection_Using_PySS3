Iâ€™ve never been good enough to be lovedThe only thing keeping me here is Iâ€™m waiting to hear if I got this job or not. 

I donâ€™t know what is wrong with me. Why am I never enough? Every time I think it canâ€™t possibly happen again, it does. Someone is always better than me. Someone matters more. Iâ€™m not enough. 

I canâ€™t wait to finally be gone.
