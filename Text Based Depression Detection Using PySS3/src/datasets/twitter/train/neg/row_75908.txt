I donâ€™t think anyone cares.Iâ€™m only 14 and I already think about suicide almost every day, at school all my â€œfriendsâ€ seem to just tolerate me and talk to me just enough that it isnâ€™t a conversation, the only times people really talk to me is when no one else will talk to them and so they know that less important than them and so I wonâ€™t ignore them, the worst part about this is theyâ€™re right I am so insignificant that even though I know itâ€™s all fake Iâ€™ll still go along with it even when they call me shit at things and fat. I hide my emotions from everyone and I just always feel terrible. I think people think Iâ€™m happy but I just joke to try and make other people happy because that somehow makes me feel less insignificant and that I partly matter, even though it doesnâ€™t. People talk over me and make plans to all go out when Iâ€™m in the room and not invite me. I think I might actually go through with it one day but I donâ€™t want to drive my family insane and deep down I think Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to go through with it anyway.

Sorry for the long text but I hardly ever do his so I tend to write lots at a time.
