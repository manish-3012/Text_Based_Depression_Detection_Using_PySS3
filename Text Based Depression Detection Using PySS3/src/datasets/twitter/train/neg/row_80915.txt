Why do I keep bottling up my emotions?I fucking hate the fact that men can't actually express any feelings except anger and happiness. I want to my friends how I feel but I know that they will just try to change subject or feel extremely uncomfortable. God forbid a man says that they have insecurities or admit to crying because if they do then they are WEAK and NOT MANLY. Its shit like this that ups the male suicide rate but it seems like know one seems to care. I want to tell my friend that I'm suicidal but I don't want to scare him or push him away from me. I keep bottling up my emotions and I can't fucking take having to keep doing this over and over. If I kill myself l at least want him to know why I did it but I can't bring myself to even say the word suicide around.


I know that he will accept it but part of my brain is still telling me that bad things will happen if I do tell him. I don't know how to say it  without coming across as weak, I don't know what to do at fucking all.
