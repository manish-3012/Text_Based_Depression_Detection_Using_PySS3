Nothing more than neutralNow that I'm on these anti psychotics I can't feel anything more than neutral, sure I'm not super depressed any more  ut I also can't get excited about anything everything is just fine all the fucking time. I want to listen to sad music and get super wasted so that I get depressed again because its the only way I can feel anything strongly. Whats the point of being alive if I can't feel anything? I dont think there is a point...
