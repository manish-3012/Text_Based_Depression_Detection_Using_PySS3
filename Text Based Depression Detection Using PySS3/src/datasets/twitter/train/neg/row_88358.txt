I truly feel like killing myself is my only option. Iâ€™m truly suffering at this point(I also posted this on the depression subreddit not sure which would be best for insight) thank you so much.....


I am a 24 year old teacher who has been suffering with manic depression bpd and i believe PTSD. I was molested by a cousin at 7, raped at the ages of 19 and 23 once by a friend another by a friend who happens to be a police officer, Iâ€™m not sure but i was made to have sex with my ex for months (but i wouldnâ€™t call this rape) but it was very hard for me. He would guilt me into sex because i didnâ€™t give him my virginity. This same ex verbally abused me, and once threw me across a room. I cannot trust men thanks to this nor can i sleep. I have nightmares 2-3 times a weeks about being attacked so i only sleep during  day which makes it hard for me to work. I canâ€™t sleep beside another person because i scream kick and jump in my sleep. My mother was verbally, physically, and emotionally abusive to me most of my life. Telling me i was a mistake and she regret having me. My father never was there and when i tried to reach out last year he hung up on me. 

I know what you may say boohoo so what get over it. I tried i went to college graduated with 2 degrees at 21, joined every club on campus, became the leader of a womenâ€™s empowerment group, talk to rape survivors, became a teacher, was working to become a lawyer and got therapy but none of it is working. I even got into a relationship after 3 years of being single, but it ended which caused me to be in an even deeper depression. He became my very good friend. Since after my rape at 23 i started self harming, and withdrew from everyone around me. But now i no longer have him. I tried to tell my mother i am suffering since i had no one else. But she basically ignored me. My therapist dropped me last week because i was too depressed to go. I have been trying to kill myself for the last two months. But have failed or have been saved (by my ex). I am at the point where i think i should try again. I cannot sleep, i cannot go to work, i am using all my savings, and i canâ€™t pull myself together. I self harm more often now, i eat once a day if that. If i do work i cry all day. 

I know what some of you may say coward others will say stay. But Iâ€™m not sure everyday is suffering for me. I look at my students and i think how selfish i am to even be around them they deserve better. I want to call my ex but i cannot at this point because i have been using him as a therapist and not a partner and i know it isnâ€™t healthy. I just wish i was normal. I know Iâ€™m only 24 but Iâ€™ve tried everything. I took meds, therapy, i even went to the er asking for help the doctor said nothing is wrong with me i was being a big baby. What do i do? I think i should just go.
