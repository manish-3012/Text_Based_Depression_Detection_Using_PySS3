I made a plan last night.Iâ€™ve been depressed for over a decade. Iâ€™ve spent so much time wallowing in it over the years that I have no idea what makes me happy any more. Iâ€™ve been getting crossfaded nearly every night for the past year, as thatâ€™s been the only way Iâ€™ve been able to get away from myself for a couple hours. It isnâ€™t working anymore.

As soon as I have money to fill my carâ€™s tank, Iâ€™m going to drive to Duluth. There, Iâ€™ll use by debit card, and leave my phone at a rest stop. Then Iâ€™m going to drive up Minn 61 until I get to Palisade Head, where Iâ€™ll throw myself into Lake Superior.
