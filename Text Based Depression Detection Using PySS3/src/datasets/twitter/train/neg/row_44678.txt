How do I stop my hypochrondriac ways?I have excessive health anxiety.  And I want it to stop.

Everytime I wake up, there's always a new health problem I'll be suffering from today.  It'll either be possible stomach bleeding from the medicine I took last night (motrin).  Or maybe I tripped and hit my head real badly and now I'm certain that my brain suffered a contusion.

I know my problems really annoy the people I love; I know my brother is sick of it, for one.  I just can't help it.  If I get it my way, I'll get a catscan done and it'll come back negative.

I know it's irrational, but I just don't know how to turn off that part of my brain that's always making huge leaps and assumptions about the slightest ticks in my body.

Please help!
