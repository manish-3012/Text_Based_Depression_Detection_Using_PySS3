Iâ€™m scaredI canâ€™t get support for how Iâ€™m feeling right now without it being used against me in my transition because the UK medical system wants me dead and Iâ€™m just so broken right now all I can think about is dying and Iâ€™m sick of the constant crying and panic attacks and I just want it to stop the only thing keeping me from doing anything right now is the chance I survive.

Iâ€™ve tried to call a few helplines and theyâ€™re all too busy so Iâ€™d rather someone who deserves to live get the help they need so Iâ€™m just gonna stop trying Iâ€™ve been sat here staring into space with a box of sleeping tablets for maybe 12 hours just trying to come up with a reason to keep going but the list is running so low at this point that Iâ€™ll be surprised if I make it to the end of the week.
