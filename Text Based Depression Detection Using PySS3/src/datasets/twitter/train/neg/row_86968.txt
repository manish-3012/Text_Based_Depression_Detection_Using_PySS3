I'm tiredI'm tired of trying to find a reason in all of the bullshit. 

I'm tired of all the bullshit. 

I'm tired of having to pay to live.

I'm tired of having to pay to have basic human necessities.

I'm tired of being told I'm lazy.

I'm tired of being told to just get over it.

I'm tired of having to fight with myself every day.

I'm tired of trying to find a medicine that will "make it all better".

I'm tired of hearing it will get better.

I'm tired of being told to socialize because it will help. 

I'm tired of useless conversation.

I'm tired of trying to care about people.

I'm tired of people.

I'm tired of society.

I'm tired of existing.

So now I'm done.

I'm not tired anymore.
