If I can't escape my job then I want to dieI'm completely trapped in my call centre job, I graduated 4 years ago so it feels like I can't use my degree now. 
All my real work experience is in admin/call centre and the only easy job type I can get, is exactly what I have now but less well paid

I'm 27 and my life is going nowhere
I need a way out or I will make a way out
