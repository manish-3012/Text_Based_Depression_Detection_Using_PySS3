Chronically SuicidalI've been suicidal for 5 years and my first and most recent hospital stay was 10/20/19-10/25/19. I hated it there and lied my way out. I should probably still be there. I constantly think of suicide. I hate being alive and I want to die. Everyone says "life gets better," but I don't believe them, it just gets worse. I just want life to be over, I didn't ask to be here, yet I can't even bring myself to commit suicide. I just, I don't know. I needed to yell into the void of the internet.
