Why go on?One of my only friends is going to kill himself in a month. I can't convince him to live and he doesn't believe I care about him. I cut myself with some random glass that I hope was infected but if I survive that, I found a place where I can finish it. I don't want to be crippled and survive though. I don't know what I want or what is stopping me. There seems to be nothing to live for but pain and disappointment. I'm scared to die and I'm scared to not die and see tomorrow.
