Somebody give me a reason not to die.What do you do when you have no reason to live?  Let alone fight a neuro disease that tortures but refuses to kill you. Might vegetablize you at some point. What reason do you have to fight it?  Why? Not only does NO ONE come to a hospital or hold your hand. Ever. No one. Ever. Even tho you have adult children less than 5 miles away. 

No one comes. In fact, attempt suicide and you'll wake up in an ICU with a crush injury to your ass where you were kicked by your paramedic sister while you were unconscious and dying. Kicked while dying.  And you overhear the nurses say she joked about washing her car on the way to the hospital. 

And your kids don't show up. I'm so sick I haven't eaten in two days I need help to get to treatment. Sorry I have to work but I can call you tomorrow after your infusion if you want.  

I've been reported to adult protective services because I've been left in the house half paralyzed and confused and no one would help me. And the social workers were really pissed at my kids who just left me there. 

Why do you live when you're surrounded by people who care nothing if you die?  Worse if you're starving and suffocating alone peeing into a towel? You say you're unsafe and its "I'm hanging with my friends right now can you call somebody else?"

Why?  Why should I go to treatment tomorrow? Why?
