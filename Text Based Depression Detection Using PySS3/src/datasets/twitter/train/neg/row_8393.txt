A human parasite, headed downhill.Each morning I get up, and like a rodent, I crawl around my backyard in search for cigarette butts or quarters so I can buy a pack of Swishers. It's not even my backyard. It's my friend's girlfriend's sister who has been generous enough to let me sleep on the couch. This is the start, I feel. I'm 20 years old and I'm terrified of approaching rock bottom.

If I was a color, I'd be gray. Neutral. Uninteresting. Lazy as fuck. The most bland color on any spectrum. When I graduated, I was full of so much hope. 'This is it, I'm going to be somebody important. A writer, a musician, whatever. I will be a gogetter.' For two straight years after graduating, I'd focused heavily on writing.  I wrote 6 novels/novellas. 6 novels and all of them were garbage. A waste of two years I'll never get back. I can't even tell you much more about myself because as far as anyone's concerned, I'm an enigma. Just an empty canvas.

I'm so uninterested in everything. I shut out anyone who tries to enter my life. Women do not interest me. I see them as distractions from my pursuit in writing. Anytime a girl tries to message me, I ignore them. I don't care who they are. I'm legitimately a robot. I've stooped to the instincts of a wild fucking animal. I eat, jack off, scrounge around for tobacco and then I try to write. These are the best years of my life and I've gotten so comfortable with repetitiveness that I don't think I can get out of it. I've never been suicidal. I've always been lonely but that's by my own doing. I don't mind being alone.

My friend, my best friend, has this idea in his mind that we're going to move to Hollywood and become rock stars. My brother lives out there and is doing well for himself so I planted the seed in my friend's head when I told him about my brother. Anyway my friend is working his ass of right now, saving up every penny so we can pursue our pipe dreams, and all I'm thinking is, 'How the hell am I supposed to make it in Hollywood if I can't even survive in Smalltown, USA?'

I always figured it'd be impossible for me to ever be depressed, because to do so I'd have to experience happiness first. Well here, I am. The big thing, I think it is, is that I don't think a guy like me is capable of happiness. I think I'm meant to always be at a perfect middle point, and these moods I'm having now are me rebelling against all of that bullshit. I want to be happy. I want to go to school, but I don't want to work for any of it. I'm the definition of a human parasite.

So while I'm not completely suicidal yet, I know I will be if I don't make important changes. Any advice?
