I don't know why I'm posting this.It's probably going to be lengthy, and I'll probably jump from problem to problem and most likely get someone reading this confused and uninterested. I apologize in advance.
I'm seventeen years old, and i'm a female.

I really really don't know how to start so I'll just start listing problems I've had.

Never met my father, as of a year ago I found his Facebook (I didn't request him or anything, it was a random spur of curiosity - I've never really cared much about knowing about him until a few years ago, and yes, I'm 100% sure that the Facebook I found was him), and found out that he has a family. This sounds really wrong, but it makes me wonder what that family had to have him stay, and what made him ditch my mom once he heard she was pregnant. It makes me feel betrayed. Very alone, and very betrayed. I was talking to one of two of my close friends last night about it, and he said he thinks all of my problems root from this. It got me thinking, and it's gotten me severely down.

I started self-harm in sixth grade, and it continued until about 9 months ago. Two years ago I had cut my leg too deep, and was scared and ended up confessing to my mother, who put me in therapy. Therapy didn't help, I didn't open up to her, and I didn't feel comfortable with her. All she ever did was give me breathing exercises to get rid of my anxiety, which only helped for so long. (I have pretty bad social anxiety, and just anxiety in general, and also have a lot of shaking episodes if I dwell too much on things.) We moved, never went to therapy again. But thinking about my father last night has given me urges I thought would never return.
 
I've been with my boyfriend (LDR relationship) for 8 months as of yesterday. We've already seen each other twice, he stayed at my house for a week two months ago, and I just got back yesterday from a two week trip to his house. He's romantic, sweet, a gentleman - opens doors for me, manners, and all that, has good hygiene, plan for the future. He's a country boy as well. What i'm trying to say is he's the "perfect guy." 
I was really really, truly happy for the first 5 months. I had gotten confidence in myself, started losing weight like I've been wanting to. 

But after he had left here, I started to get depressed again, I pushed him away, became suspicious over everything he did because I had found out he lied to me once, and I just couldn't get over it. I'm still not over it, and I'm still very suspicious. While I was there for two weeks, I constantly snapped at him, and then I would hug/love him as if I weren't a complete bitch to him 20 minutes prior. It was like punching someone in the face, then getting ice for them.

I know I need help with this. I don't know why I can't deal with the fact that people mess up sometimes, people lie sometimes. I act like I'm fucking perfect, and when someone messes up, I just cannot EVER get over it, and I hold the worst grudges. Shit, I mean, I've lied to him before, nothing big, but a lie is a lie. I don't understand how I can admit I need help, but once I get the help I need, I pretty much wait for things to fall apart because I know they will. I have no idea how to cope with anything that's handed to me, because the only way I've ever coped with anything was to grab a razor. And I'm trying not to do that again.

There's a whole 'nother slew of problems that I really don't feel like writing out because I don't think it's worth it. So, I'll sum it up. 

* Since we moved, my social anxiety has gotten worse and my mom thinks it's just me being shy, and won't take my seriously. 

* My only close friends live in Canada, which makes me feel even more alone than I already am.
 
* Since moving, I literally have no one to talk to, and have zero friends at school. I'm not even joking. I've tried making friends, but they all act like I'm a virus since I don't wear Hollister. (I go to a really snobby school. If you don't wear designer, you aren't even in existence.) The only person in my new school that I've talked to was my bus driver. 

* My mom hasn't had a job for years, and we're barely getting by right now, if that, we have a nice landlord who has brushed off the fact that we haven't paid rent in two months. Unfortunately, our landlord is losing her mind, her son might take over, and he's not as nice as her. But it's understandable. We owe them so much.

* My family is falling apart because of money, and I lost my favorite relative to this huge fight over it.

* I am just no where near prepared for the real world. And I'm now a senior. I have no idea what I'm going to do after highschool. I had planned to live with my boyfriend, but I don't know what's going to happen to us because my feelings are all messed up and I don't know how much longer he's going to stick by my side and deal with it all.

* I'm trying to get prepared for the real world, but I can't because, 1) My mom never takes me out to go job hunting like I constantly ask her to. (hypocrite me is partially happy because I won't have to deal with people) 2) I got a credit card for myself so I could learn how to use it/learn how banks work, but my mother has also taken that because it's easier for her to use since she can do direct deposits. 

I really don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know how I can be so cold-hearted towards people and just not care. I'm a selfish hypocrite. I want help, but I want the sadness and it's a constant cycle of wanting and needing and it's driving me insane. I feel like I'm killing myself of any good feelings/thoughts. And then I'll think I'm being a typical teenage girl, and then I'll have deep conversations with my best friend, and I'll think "No way does she have the same, fucked up thoughts that I do."

I feel like my boyfriend could get a girl that has her shit straight, and my best friend wouldn't have to deal with so much of my shit if I just weren't around. And I'm honestly considering it, which I guess is why I'm posting it here.

I feel like a typical teenage girl with daddy problems, and it sickens me. Can someone just be straight forward with me, please?
