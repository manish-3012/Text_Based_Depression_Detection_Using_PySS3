No futureI have nothing to look forward to. All this shit is teaching me is that no matter how hard I try to escape the universe will just slap me back into hell. I'm stuck with my abusers and no ability to escape because of everything... I can't claw my way out of this hole again. I'm not strong enough. I'm barely strong enough to get out of bed each day. And I wish I didn't have to ever again. I just can't take it anymore. 22 years of just being berated and hurt in the worst ways, I'm completely broken.
