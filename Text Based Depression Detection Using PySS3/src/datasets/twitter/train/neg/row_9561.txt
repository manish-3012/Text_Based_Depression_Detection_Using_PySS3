Itâ€™s my birthday today and I want to kill my selfToday and my birthday and I still want to kill my self. Everyone else has friend and dates and they all go out to do stuff with each other and here I am by myself because no one wants me. I never had any irl friends or a girlfriend. Online people just leave me and the best friend I ever had left me about 2 months ago and I really miss her. I just donâ€™t get why everyone hates me. I didnâ€™t do anything to them. Killing myself just seems like the only option I have to get rid of this pain everyone causes me and no one will care anyway. If people say they do care or whenever I kill myself, they should have cared sooner.
