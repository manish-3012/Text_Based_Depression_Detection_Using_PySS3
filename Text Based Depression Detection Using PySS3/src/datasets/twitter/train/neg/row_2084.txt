Does my presence make a difference? Would my absence be noticed?Ever get the feeling that there's something wrong when things start to go good?... I thought I had overcome all of my past struggles, but they never seem to far behind me. College was going great: Everyone loved me, got good grades, stayed busy. People always love me for the wrong reason though. They love me for what I look like, and for what they can get out of me. I feel like my intelligence is rarely accounted for. I worked so hard my first semester of school. I got A's in all of my difficult classes, but somehow I managed to screw up the easiest class I was in. I got a C in my computer course. Now I know that you're thinking "why is this the end of the world". Well it's not, but it's certainly the tip of the iceberg. I've probably lost a total of 5 or more friends in the past week. I suppose my personality isn't worth anything. If it was wouldn't people be interested in still being my friend even though I didn't want a relationship? Why am I even in college?......I might as well drop out and become a lingerie model or something like everyone expects. Why am I even here, right now? I don't understand this world, and I'm not so sure I want to continue being a part of it. I felt like I finally had a hold on my ADHD and my family relationships, but I guess not. I'm loosing control again, and I can't let that happen. I felt the rush of a razor blade for the first time in a long while today. I don't regret doing it though. It at least made me realize I am still alive in this miserable world...but who knows for how much longer.
