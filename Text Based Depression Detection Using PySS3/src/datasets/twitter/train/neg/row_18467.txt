Kicked out, nowhere to goI have been having a lot of fights with my parents lately, mostly about freedom of choice for myself. My parents have always been overprotective, which seems nice in some ways, but it sucks. Basically they don't trust me to be able to live on my own so they don't allow me to do anything. I have to hand in my phone and laptop everyday, I have to sleep at 10 PM, and many other things.

This might seem normal for some people, but the problem is that I'm 18. I just want to be treated as a normal adult, and make my own life choices.

I told them this and they got really mad about me not appreciating them as parents or something. That resulted in me being kicked out of the house. They have done that more times but this time they were serious, I called them too and asked them if I could come back, since it's winter. They told me I should just figure it out myself.

I have been thinking about suicide for every day for a few years now, and the actual suicide attempt is closer than ever. I just want to see if I'm able to find a place to live, I'm sitting in a library now, with only my phone and my laptop in my bag. They took away my wallet so I can't pay for anything.

If I can't find a place to sleep tonight, I might just end it all.
