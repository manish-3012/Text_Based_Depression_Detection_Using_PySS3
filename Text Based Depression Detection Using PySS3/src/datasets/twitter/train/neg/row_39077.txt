Iâ€™m joyless, just living to accomplish things until I run out of gas. At law school, Iâ€™m already close to out.I probably have an objectively decent life. I go to a Top 20 law school for free, without debt from undergrad. Some law students would kill for that Iâ€™m sure. So no one should pity me. But my grades came in yesterday and Iâ€™ve not expressed this to anyone I know, but I just feel like my life should be over.

My grades were not even awful, just mediocre or slightly below average. I feel like that almost makes it worse. At least if they were extremely bad Iâ€™d have a story to tell, people would pretend to be more supportive. But itâ€™s nothing interesting.

Itâ€™s probably despicable and narcissistic, but I almost wish I had more struggle, a better story or a better reason to end it but I donâ€™t. Everything I did to convince myself life was worth living was use the grades and accomplishments I earned as reassurance that Iâ€™m worth existing. Now that I donâ€™t have that, I feel like I have nothing to live for.  Thereâ€™s nothing to strive for, not a future goal I ever really wanted. I convinced myself to want things I could never possibly have because they were the things that kept me motivated. â€œMaybe you could be a Supreme Court justice one day,â€ â€œMaybe you could be a millionaire.â€ Just childish dreams. Finally a door can be shut there.

If a person asked me what I was good at, or a boss asked why they should hire me, or a date asked me what I like to do, I honestly could not think of a single thing to say. 

I have no motivation to try anymore, and if I canâ€™t be useful or impressive, I donâ€™t want to live. How can you convince yourself to keep going if you donâ€™t know what the point is?
