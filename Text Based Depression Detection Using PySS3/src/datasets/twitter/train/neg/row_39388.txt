One more yearI was supposed to not be here right now. Literally every week after that moment I decided to move on has been a downward spiral. Nothing good came out this year. It's like life bugged out because it did not anticipate me not being dead.

And yet I'm still here. I don't understand why, but I'm still moving. Moving in whatever direction I see, still on my feet.

One more year. Until I hit 22. I never thought I will make it to 21, but I somehow did. Is this cause for celebration? I don't know. But if the next year does not improve, oh well. At least I could say I gave it a chance. 

But if I find out that the next year is going to change my life forever, I'm willing to take the risk to be hurt one more time. Maybe something will come out of it.

Here's to all of us still around. We know who we are.
