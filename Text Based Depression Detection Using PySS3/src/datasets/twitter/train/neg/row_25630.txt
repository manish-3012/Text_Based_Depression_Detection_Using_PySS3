surviving schoolso school actually makes me wanna Kermit, I'm sure it's like that with other people too but I genuinely can't anymore, I just want to be left to die in my room every morning when I wake up and I think about how okay I'd be if I didn't wake up and night, I've gone through all my options, school counselors, telling my mom I wanna die, telling teachers, friends, suicide hotlines, and I've even attempted, but one, my therapist, I would tell her but then she'd send me to a mental hospital and my family can't afford it everyday is worse and I'm afraid I might do it again, the anniversary of my first attempt is coming up (march 13th) what if I don't make it past? IDK I'm just sick of being so alone I'm a fucking 14 year old with a suicide attempt and 5 mental illnesses under my belt, can't I have a break? please give me a break
