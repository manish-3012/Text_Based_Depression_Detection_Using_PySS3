I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m a 17 year old male. I am a senior in high school and donâ€™t turn 18 until August 21. My parents have always been over protective and controlling. My parents forced me to break up with my girlfriend back in October. Now any time they mention her they refer to her as that stupid little whore or that tramp. Itâ€™s always something like that and it makes me so mad I canâ€™t control myself. My parents are constantly pressuring me about things in general such as grades. Iâ€™m told on a pretty regular basis that Iâ€™m just a lazy piece of shit. My father tells me that I live like a fu***** ni**er. Iâ€™m told that Iâ€™m ungrateful for everything. When I was around 10 years old, my father had an affair and he let me meet the woman. He would make me tell her things like how great of a stepmom she would be. When he would take me to her house, I would be left to care for the womanâ€™s 4 year old son while they went into the bedroom to have sex. Iâ€™m always getting screamed at and cursed at. I honestly just canâ€™t take it anymore. Being in this house makes me feel like Iâ€™m going insane. Iâ€™m constantly on the verge of a panic attack while in this house and I feel that the only way out of it is to kill myself. I donâ€™t want to kill myself but at this point it seems like the only option. I have a counselor but havenâ€™t told him about my suicidal thoughts due to fear of being sent off to a mental institution. I canâ€™t see the person I love, I hate my household and my parents. Whatâ€™s the point of even staying alive? Iâ€™ve talked to an attorney about emancipation but with me being so close to 18, it would be useless. Iâ€™ve called the runaway hotline, the suicide hotline. They have both told me to speak with my counselor about my options to get out. The only other option I can see is contacting DCS but at the same time I feel like Iâ€™m just being a bitch and they wonâ€™t even do anything for me. Are these things considered emotional abuse or not?
