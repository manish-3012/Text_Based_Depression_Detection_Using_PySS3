i need help pleasei donâ€™t want to bother anyone but can anyone talk to me like actually listen   iâ€™m really sorry but i just canâ€™t do this anymore. iâ€™ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for many years but right now everything is worse and the people around me make it even harder for me. my parents donâ€™t want to listen to me, they even abused me for the stupidest reason. my girlfriend said she fucking hates me and wants to break up but said she wont because iâ€™ll kill myself if she broke up with me and sheâ€™s right. but i think iâ€™m going to do it either way  i just want everything to end i really donâ€™t know what to do anymore   could someone please talk to me?
