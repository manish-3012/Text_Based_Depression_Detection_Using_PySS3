Ready to goI'm under-educated, under-employed and in poor health. There's no reason for me to believe that anything will ever get any better. Every day I can just feel the world closing all around me. I want out. I have no access to firearms. I just found out that my car's exhaust isn't an option. Doctors won't prescribe anything to me. What kinda OTC stuff can I take (and how much will I need) to get the job done?
