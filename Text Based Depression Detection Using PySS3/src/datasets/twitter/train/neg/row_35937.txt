I'm worried and don't know what to doI'm really worried that soon I'm just going to hit my breaking point. I'm just really scared. Whenever I talk to people about it everything is fine enough and then a few hours pass and i feel the exact same and nothing has changed for years. I dont want to die I just want to reset I really don't want to die i dont know what to do
