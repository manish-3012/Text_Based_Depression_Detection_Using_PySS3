What if I popped a baby out for the hell of it?Iâ€™m sitting here now in a doctors office awaiting a letter for my hysterectomy Iâ€™m scrolling through photos of peoples daughters. So many women have daughters. Maybe I wanna try and pop out a baby just for the hell of it? But I couldnâ€™t stomach it being a boy like genuinely couldnâ€™t. I have horrible gender dysphoria and really wish I was male so I just couldnâ€™t. What if I tried to have a baby girl with someone literally just to get it over with? Just for the hell of it?
