i feel like a burden to my familyi was diagnosed with T1 diabetes 6 years ago and fr the past year i have been feeling like a nuisance to them. we never go on trips or vacations and currently my dad needs a new car but cant really afford one but if they didnt have to pay for my insulin then they could. im just done with feeling like this and i think im gonna do it this time i see no reason to live like this.
