to be or not to be?I know this quote is so popular itâ€™s a clichÃ© at this point, yet it is only now that I fully grasp the simplicity and complexity of it all. It really is the fucking question. How do you know if life is still worth living? I cannot find a reason to live anymore. That chaotic beauty that seems to enchant everyone else I pass on the street is lost on me, itâ€™s been lost on me. This grey cloud has hung around for years and sucked the sound and color out of every corner of my life. Thereâ€™s a song that goes â€œeverything means nothing to meâ€, and I embody that more than ever right now. My life is not important, I have not built anything of worth, and my death would not be meaningful. How do I know if itâ€™s time to go and how do I know if itâ€™s time to fight? If my life is nothing but numb monotony , if I donâ€™t mean anything to anyone, if I didnâ€™t carpe my diems in my youth...then is it worth waking up tomorrow? I canâ€™t justify living anymore if this is all there is.
