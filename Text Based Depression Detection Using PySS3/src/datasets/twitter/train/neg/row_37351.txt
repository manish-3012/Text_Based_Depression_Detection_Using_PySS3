Currently Preventing Sister's SuicideThrowaway account.

My sister called me a couple hours ago saying she wanted to end it. I talked to her about it for 15 minutes or so and after assessing that its quite likely she's serious, i drove to her place an hour or so away while keeping her on call. We sat for like two hours while she demanded I leave so she could suicide in peace and i stubbornly said no. Her plan is to use sleeping pills well beyond a lethal dose and just pass away in her sleep. After establishing that she will be unable to while im here, she went to sleep. Im staying up to make sure she didnt sneak any in, and at the moment im pretty sure i will have to stay with her all day tomorrow and the next, and basically be there around enough to make it impossible for her to get a chance at doing the deed. Right now, i just need some outside opinions and suggestions on how to go about doing this, or something else to do.

Naturally im trying avoid calling any authorities or help agencies because we're kind of past the point of the latter, and calling any authorities will add to the burden because the repercussions are disruptive and costly. Hard to explain all the context and intricacies to the situation.

For some added context, she called me because she knows i'm very similar. We both have anxiety and depressive disorders, similar symptoms while depressed, and I've attempted suicide several times in the past, once in the same manner, so I know what it's like. At the moment just trying to sort things out and come up with a game plan thats feasible and helpful in the long-term.
