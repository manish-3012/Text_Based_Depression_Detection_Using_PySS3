I'm suicidal.So, I don't know how to start this and I'm sorry for the poor grammar but I'm like crying right now and using talk to text. I basically like just started Paxil about 7 weeks ago for my depression anxiety and OCD.  like I've always had Suicidal Thoughts but they've never been like really really really in depth like they are now and I really want to go through with it. Also my ex boyfriend decided to tell me that he actually fell out of love with me a long time before he broke up with me which is really shitty when I keep thinking about it because I keep thinking about like how I was just laying there next to him like thinking about our whole life together and he's just sitting there wondering how he's going to break up with me. We had been together for three and a half years and he is not the complete reason I want to die. I just I don't I'm so worthless I don't know how to explain it like I'm such a piece of shit. I haven't had a job in like 4 months and like everybody keep supporting me and I know they're tired of me and I know my brother is starting to slowly fuckinv hate me and I just I fucking hate myself so much I wish I could be a whole different person but I can't I'm just so in a dark hole right now. I'm not funny I'm scared of what I'm going to do when I'm alone I think I need like 40 Xanax I don't know like I'm so lost and so scared I just need somebody please please. Please don't make fun of me or being mean to me because I just really need some help and I don't want to go to my friends because I think they're tired of hearing my whining and crying about and how I just want to fucking die I just feel so alone.
