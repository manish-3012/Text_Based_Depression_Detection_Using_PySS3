Hey, my name is Ras. I don't know what to do anymoreI'm super drunk, as always now days, so bear with me.

Let me get it from the beginning. Im from Sweden, I've talked to proffessional shrinks. I got a beautiful girlfriend that works 14 hours a day. I'm self destructive. I can be up super late at night drinking myself to sleep and drinking myself out of jumping in front of a train.

My family broke all together in 2004. My mother and father broke up and me and my younger brothers (now 21 and 15 but then 12 and 2) were not as affected of it as I was. My mother and father refused to talk to eachother so I had to be the grown up in the family at the age of 14.

My mother and father got back together and moved to another city with my two younger brothers without me in 2012 and I just moved in together with my girlfriend at that time.

Move forward 3 years and they separated on even worse terms than the first time. Now they both refuse and hate eachother for whatever reason and I have to keep all my family together because im the only one having no ill will in my family.

Ok I understand this is super confusing. Lets do a tldr version here:

TLDR: my family is split as fuck since a few years back. Im the only one that keeps it together with everyone. My moms a mess. My fathers an alcoholic. Im an alcoholic at 26. I've seen a shrimp several times for several familyissues in my life. I've contenplated suicide a lot of times. But not done it since i still love my brothers of age 15 and 21.

Im a big mess and has been the past 12 months. I dont know what to do anymore. Im so fed up. Im drunk. I want to end it right now.
