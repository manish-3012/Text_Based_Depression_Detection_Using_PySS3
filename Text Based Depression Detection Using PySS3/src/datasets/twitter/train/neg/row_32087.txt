Something is wrong with meI have had suicidal feelings increasingly recently. Though i dont have the balls (or knowledge) to follow through, im in so much pain emotionally that i often wish for death.

During the pandemic i have not been able to get the help i need. Money, location and work schedule prevent me from connecting to people, especially when im having an anxiety attack. 

Ironically my attacks happen late at night when im alone and everyone is asleep and my partner is being cruel, sometimes calling them fake and other hurtful things. Ive come to realize i cant rely on them during a low moment.
Ive called suicide lines when i feel close and its either a robot texting or the call never connects. 
I've reached out to family members and friends but most live in different states and all of them have busy lives. They verbally express concern but otherwise im left alone to battle my demons. 
Sometimes the pain and attacks are so unbearable i truly feel its only a matter of time but for now i cant stop myself from self destructing in my relationship, career and health. My next therapy apt is a month from now (earliest) and there is a wait list for others. I hate going to hospitals because they lock you up for days and i dont have any sick time at my job and will surely be fired.
I just dont know how to adult anymore. My depression is severe at times and im afraid ill follow suit in my family's long history of suicides.
