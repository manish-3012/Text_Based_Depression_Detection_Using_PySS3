Is Myriad9 okay?Hi there. I just read one of her posts that she wanted to commit suicide. I talked to her yesterday and we had a really nice chat. Her last post was around 1 AM GMT time, thats 10 hours ago. 

I pray to god that sheâ€™s alright. It hurts loosing yet another person. If only I could have been there when she made that post, but I was asleep.
