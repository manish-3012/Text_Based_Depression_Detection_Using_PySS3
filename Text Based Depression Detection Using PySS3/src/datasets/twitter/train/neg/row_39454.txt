I received a suicide not in a video game and could use some advice.I received a message from a guildmate 14 hours ago and don't really know if there's anything I can do. I contacted the company through their customer service department with his account name, but other than that, I only know he lives in Canada. I don't have any contact info other than Discord and Teamspeak.

Is there anyone here with experience with something like this? I know it's vague and 14 hours old. I just now logged in and saw the message.

Thank you and I apologize if this isn't the proper place to ask these sort of questions.
