multiple half assed suicide attempts since elementary schoolnot sure how much i actually intend to say here but i've been suicidal for as long as i can remember, i think my first attempt was around age 7 and suicidal thoughts have been a constant in my life since then, from age 7 to 18 i've tried to kill myself a few times with no success and struggled with self harm in between that, i got close to trying again until i just lost all motivation to even do it and resorted to staring at the floor after realizing i would fuck up like the past few times, i was planning on just going out to a field near my house and jamming a knife into my stomach 

probably badly worded but whatever i'm just incredibly frustrated especially after years of being denied help, medical malpractice, and other bullshit pushing me closer and closer to killing myself, all while being kept alive for other people's sake
