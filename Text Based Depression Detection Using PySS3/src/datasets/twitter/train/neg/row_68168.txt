Hollow HopesIt's always fruitless. I'm afraid suicide may be the only way out for me, the world has always had some kind of vendetta on my head. It makes me so melancholic to realize I never lived but when will I learn? Nothing ever turns out for me, there's always some critical breaking point that needs to be fixed and I gave up years ago when I fell into depression. This empty reality isn't worth existing in, Imma wait my 40 days and sleepless nights until my next opportunity to attempt comes along.

I keep having anxiety that I'll fail and wake up in a hospital, that I'll get brain damage, that someone will find me and stop me, that I get put away in a mental institution. I wish this planet would just let me go and stop keeping me here to play with me. I'm tired of it.
