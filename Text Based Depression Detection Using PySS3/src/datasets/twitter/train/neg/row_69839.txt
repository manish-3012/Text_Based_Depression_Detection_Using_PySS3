I can officially afford to dieSupposed to be starting a new job this Monday in a whole new state. Suppose to be my new chapter. In reality its all an act to avoid my family from tryna lock me in the psych ward. This July my boyfriend was brutally murdered. &amp; ever since all I've wanted to is join him. Everytime I came close to ending it, thoughts of my mother finding my body &amp; her reaction is the main thing that kept me alive. But now I chose to move, the plan was move pretend to be fine &amp; pretend be moving on. Just long enough to write a will &amp; make sure there's enough money in my bank account so that my family wouldn't have to worry about money for the funeral. But now this job offers my family a nice $25,000 after me being employed for 30days. Meaning after the next 30days I can finally die. I can fast ward it all.
