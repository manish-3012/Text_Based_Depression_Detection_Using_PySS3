You wanna know the best part about burning bridges?Eventually, youâ€™re gonna be on an island with nowhere to go.

Every time I burn a fucking bridge I tell myself itâ€™s the last, but here I am again, actively fucking up other peopleâ€™s lives like itâ€™s a necessity. 

I havenâ€™t thought about jumping off a bridge seriously for years, but I do now. Itâ€™s kinda ironic, donâ€™t you think? 

It hurts the fucking worst when itâ€™s your fault. Thereâ€™s no excuses, nothing you can tell yourself when itâ€™s your fault, because itâ€™s yours and yours to keep. Itâ€™s always been my fault. Every step of the way in this life Iâ€™ve ruined all my chances of having people in my life by doing something stupid and making the same mistakes over and over again.

Maybe this should be it. Iâ€™m running out of matches. I feel like Iâ€™ve exhausted every fresh start there is and no matter how nice or welcoming someone is I fuck it up, I just fuck it up over and over again. I get caught off guard and realize Iâ€™ve always been this way and I always will. 

Thereâ€™s only one way to stop the burning and that is to remove the source, so Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s about time to put out the fire before someone else gets burned.

Hopefully thereâ€™s a bridge I havenâ€™t burned to jump off of
