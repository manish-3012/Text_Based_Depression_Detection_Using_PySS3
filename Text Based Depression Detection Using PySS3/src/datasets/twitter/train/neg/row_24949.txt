Shot myself in the chest and it did not work   After battling a bad breakup and losing my hope and trust in my friends, family, school, etc, I finally attempted to end it all by shooting a hallow point revolver round into the upper left of my chest. However, I missed anything vital and I was only able to bruise my left lung and graze my left arm (because of how I was positioned and the angle, the bullet left my back and scathed it). Guess I should have paid attention in Biology class. 
    Idk what's going to happen after this but I do know that I won't be in school for a few weeks because of the hospital and the psych ward they want to send me to. I'm usually a lurker, but I decided to share this because this is my first ever real attempt.
    Has anyone else attempted suicide in high school and was sent to the hospital? What's going to happen to me? Please share your stories, I have nothing to do right now.
