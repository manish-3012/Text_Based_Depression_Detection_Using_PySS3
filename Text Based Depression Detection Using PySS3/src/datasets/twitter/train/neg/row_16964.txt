no one cares at allIâ€™m about too sneak a knife from the kitchen into my room and just cut my self tell I feel something no one likes me no one cares and if I somehow got a fucking friend they probably would not enjoy my company cause of major mood swings from super happy too crying within a minute Iâ€™m only ever happy if Iâ€™m talking too someone like on a online game and that donâ€™t last long cause I go back into kill myself mode nothing matters mode only thing that would make me happy is genuine careing from a friend and wow I have 0 Iâ€™m talking about irl btw 6 years Iâ€™m 16 nothing no interaction for 6 years Iâ€™m done Iâ€™m so sad any impulse will could lead too my suicide cause I donâ€™t like feeling like this I want a hug no one cares...
