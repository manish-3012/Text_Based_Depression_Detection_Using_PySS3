Not if, but whenI know I'm going to kill myself; it's just statistics. I could die of cancer or from a car accident, and while they're both technically preventable, entropy is going to win out. I've lived with it for most of my life, and I feel like it's completely eaten away at me. I don't have hopes or goals. I don't enjoy doing anything. I don't have anybody I'm close to, and the odd days I'm in a good mood leave me feeling emotionally drained for the rest of the week. 

When I think of the future, I just want things to stop. I can't think of anything more appealing than just not existing. And some days, it feels so close and so possible. I've tried before, and I can only fail at it so many times before it works. I'm tired of putting it off for another night, and posting anonymously on the internet is probably the last, most pathetic cry for help I have left.
