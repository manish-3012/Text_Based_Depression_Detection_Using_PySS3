My house is up for sale - where does the money go if I were to commit suicide?I currently own half of a house that is up for sale. I plan to commit suicide before the sale is finalized and I would like to ensure the money goes to my family.

Sorting out a legally binding will would be too costly and time-consuming. I plan to leave a brief suicide note, in which I was thinking of writing that I wish the money from the sale of the house goes to my family, but would this make any difference?

I don't want the money to automatically go to the other joint-owner of the house.

I live in the UK if that makes any difference.
