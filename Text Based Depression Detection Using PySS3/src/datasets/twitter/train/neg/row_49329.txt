Is it time to go?Iâ€™m getting a new refill of a med today, one that I know in high dose is deadly, why am I so tempted? Iâ€™ve told no one how I really feel, I donâ€™t think I ever will. I find ppl donâ€™t give a shit whether u cry and whine about wanting to or if u just do it. I find those that do it just donâ€™t say anything. Iâ€™m good at being quiet , itâ€™s the only thing Iâ€™ve been good at.
