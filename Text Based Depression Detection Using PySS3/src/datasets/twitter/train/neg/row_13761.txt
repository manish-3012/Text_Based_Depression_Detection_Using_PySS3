I put myself out there and asked them out. It was pointless. I want to die now.I don't even have it in me to write much out. Just check my post history. This just confirms everything I have ever thought about myself.

People ask how I'm doing. Well this is how I'm fucking doing: I want to die because I think I loved this person and I can't imagine any life without them. Now I feel totally betrayed and have confirmed thoroughly that I am useless and will die alone.

I doubt our "friendship" will last a week. It was never real anyway. They don't want to spend time with me. They don't want to watch movies with me. They especially don't now. I don't get to have friends. The most I will ever get is a painless death.
