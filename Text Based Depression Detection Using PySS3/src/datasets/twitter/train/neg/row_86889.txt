My Suicide NoteI broke today, For many reasons I'm the most hated kid everywhere even online. I'm tried of the verbal abuse, I want to be set free from the horrible would I will never grow up past 14. I'm ready to leave nobody cares about me the world is unfair to me I couldn't fit in. Because nobody cared. Nobody found me another home, Being autistic makes you feel different left out who considers an kid as a outcast because their autistic I can't help that everyone tells me to die I hate my disgusting body, I will be free from it I don't know where I will go but I want to be out of this world July 21 Wednesday 12:24 PM will be my last time alive goodbye school! Remember don't make the same mistake I did
