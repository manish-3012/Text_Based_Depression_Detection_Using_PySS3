I'm staying drunk to punish myselfI'm so done with everything. I can't keep breathing, its so painful. I just don't want to exist anymore, I feel so fucking lonely every second of the day. I can't sleep, I have no one to talk to. My boyfriend, soon to be ex I'm guessing he's going to dump me as soon as he can. And I'm not even blaming him, I'm a fuck up. I don't deserve to be happy or to be loved. Everyone leaves, that's for the best. Being around me is poisonous. He's the only person I've ever trusted and I've been betrayed. He ignores me all day and never answers anything. I'm getting the blame for anything, for arguing. I don't want to, I just want to be loved.  But I'm so stupid to think that someone would, who wants this piece of crap? I'm just wasting space on this earth, I shouldn't be alive. I should've died when I took the overdose 2 weeks ago. I'm just a mess, and so extremely alone. Only thing I am doing is crying and drinking, and taking sleeping pills to numb the pain and shut my brain of. I can't. I can't shut it of, I'm so sad all the time. Even breathing is difficult. All I want to do is end it. Just takes all the pills in my cabinet and sleep forever. I think about it all the time, every time I take the train I want to jump in front of it. I tried to slit my veins open yesterday but they just stopped bleeding. I can't even kill myself, I fuck up everything. This is for the best, for everyone. This is a goodbye, on my 20th birthday 27/8, I'll be sleeping forever.
