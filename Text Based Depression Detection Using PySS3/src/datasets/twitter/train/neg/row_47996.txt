The only reason I haven't is my baby...I struggle with post partumn depression and I haven't been able to go to therapy so it's gotten progressively worse to the point where I'm harming myself. The only reason I haven't yet killed myself is because I'm a stay at home mom and no one else could watch my baby during the day. I know she'd be better off without me, her father (my boyfriend) as well. They both deserve someone so much better than me. I'm a shit mom. I get so angry every time she cries. I cuss and yell in front of her and I'm just going to fuck her up. She needs someone better. She deserves a better mom. If I had someone to care for her I'd kill myself right now. I don't deserve to be a mom and I don't deserve to be alive but here goes another day...all I can do is try to be better.
