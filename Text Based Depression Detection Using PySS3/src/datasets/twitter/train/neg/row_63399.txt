I feel helpless and loneI've been having suicidal thoughts for some time now, but I dont have anyone to tell about it, I feel like they would make a scene out of it and blow things out of proportion or just straight look at me as if I just wanted to draw attention instead of understanding, I need someone to talk, (un)fortunately Im not ready to do such thing, so you could say that Im "safe", but I think someday I would just stop caring and do it anyways.
