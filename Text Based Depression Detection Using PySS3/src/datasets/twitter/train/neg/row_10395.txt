I am killing my self on MondayWhile playing a game I found myself being constantly mean to my friends (I've done this to my friends as long as I can remember) and I came to the realization that everyone would be better off if I was dead. This is'nt my first rodeo so I shouldn't fail (Again). The reason it's on Monday is because everyone is gone so I have free access to a firearm. sorry for being selfish.
