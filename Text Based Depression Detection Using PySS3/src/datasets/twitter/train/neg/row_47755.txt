I'm a military veteran who has messed up in more ways than one. So many blown opportunities. I'm just tired of fucking failing. I used to be angry, but not anymore. I'm just here. So many blown opportunities. I'm just tired of fucking failing. I used to be angry, but not anymore. I'm just here. Idle. Can't move forward because I fucked my past up so bad. I don't want to see the look on anyone's face if I was diagnosed with depression and they found out. I just don't want that feeling. I wish I could have the last 4 years back. So much failure in those years. I broke myself and I don't want those around me to know. The future just looks so grim
