I planned to end my life today.I had a doctors appointment this morning. She knows things are hard for me right now, and I was quite upset when I saw her. I planned to go down to the train tracks afterwards, but I didnâ€™t tell her that.

She gave me some medication (I gave it to her a while ago to hold on to for me) and stitched my self harm wound.

She took me in to the treatment room, gave me a hug and let me sit there for a while and have a chat with one of the really lovely nurses that works there. 

We talked for a little while and sheâ€™d come in and out to check on me between helping other patients, and once I felt okay enough to leave, she gave me a hug and I went home, still drowsy from the medication, but feeling a lot better than I was when I walked in this morning. (I donâ€™t drive so the medication wasnâ€™t an issue.)

Iâ€™ve been seeing that doctor for 6 years, and the nurse Iâ€™ve got to know quite well over the last few years too. 

They donâ€™t know it, but theyâ€™re the reason Iâ€™m still here. Theyâ€™re the reason I didnâ€™t jump in front of a train today, and I am so fucking thankful for them.
