I think this is where it ends. It's been too much lately, just too much. College work pouring in at a wild rate, i can't keep up. I have loud and rowdy room-mates who don't shut up until 3-4am every night. I living on only a few hours of sleep. I did go home for the weekend, that was OK, had to wear my mask to hide what im really feeling. 

"Is college fun?" they would ask "Yep i'm having a blast" i would reply. I can't let them know how i am really doing, im too far away and they are already worried, if they knew i was suicidal, that would be the end of it. 

I feel overwhelmed with work and I'm failing. I'm actually at the point of not caring what my family thinks if i do kill myself. They would be upset i'm sure, but i don't even care anymore. I can't keep up with this stuff.  I home for a bit and need someone to talk to. But i can't talk with my room mates or RA, i don't see the councillor until tomorrow at 11 and that rarely helps me at all. The one person i can trust around here now hates me due to some things that were said.
