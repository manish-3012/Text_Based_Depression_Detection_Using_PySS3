I need a true connection.I feel alone. I have friends, I donâ€™t have family or a partner. My friends are basically family. I am not alone in any measurable sense. What Iâ€™m missing is a feeling of true connection. Where I can be myself and not worry about how hated I think I am. I believe that the right connection will stave of my death. But, Iâ€™m yet to be not alone.
