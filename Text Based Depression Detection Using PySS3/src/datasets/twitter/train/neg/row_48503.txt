I want to dieI want to die for many reasons;

Im 19 .I was kicked out of my parents house for being gay and trans. I was at a homeless shelter in my home state nyc for a while and met a boy and moved to Portland Maine.

I was abused many times by him, i ended up running away from him when he got arrested. I tried to continue my life but everything is really hard. 

Many people wont date a trans person, but i dont feel comfortable living as a male. I tried to be a male and be happy but i felt uncomfortable and sick

Im alone because the chances of having a partner are slim and my family disowned me

I donâ€™t really have any friends, i tried but it sometimes just seems like its hard to reach people. 

I tried to go back to being a gay guy, I downloaded grindr and used a pic of when i had muscles and it seems like even isnâ€™t enough to attract men. I do get some but not alone and idk if itâ€™s because im black and this is a primarily white region idk. I made a fake profile and used a app to change my skin color and within an hour so much messages.
 
I work a crappy job dishwashing because Portland is like a restaurant town and i needed money but i hate it. Especially now that its cold... I feel like i dont belong anywhere. Iâ€™ve always felt this way since i was 10. That was honestly the last time i was somewhat happy.

I think im done trying, Iâ€™ll either kill myself or just buy a plane ticket to somewhere warm and idk try again or just wander

Im tired
