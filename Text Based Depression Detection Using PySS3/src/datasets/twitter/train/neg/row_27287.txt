I got my dream job, and Iâ€™m already going to lose itIâ€™m a 23 y/o female, who just graduated college exactly a year ago. 
A few months ago, I got my dream job at a huge, very popular corporation. 
I also landed myself in an abusive relationship, where I travel to and from work every day for an hour and fourty five minutes. 
I bought a house, but it wonâ€™t be built until July. 

Thus, I am stuck in my current situation. 

But hereâ€™s the thing; I donâ€™t have time to deal with this shit. 

I worked my ass off to get where I am. Iâ€™m 23, working with men and women who are all 35+ and married. 

I donâ€™t have the time to deal with the abusive relationship shit, the mental breakdowns I have every day before work. 

I have so many attendance points Iâ€™m going to be fired. 

And instead of ruining my dream, by being fired from here. I may as well end it all.
