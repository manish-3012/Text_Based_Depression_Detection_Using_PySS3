boyfriend problemshi all im really struggling. my boyfriend is yelling at me because im having a breakdown and needed his attention because im really struggling but hes hanging out with friends. he told me to leave him alone, and that i should just deal with it. idk what to do anymore. he always gets mad whenever i have a breakdown. im really close to doing something dangerous and it hurts that he would yell at me.
