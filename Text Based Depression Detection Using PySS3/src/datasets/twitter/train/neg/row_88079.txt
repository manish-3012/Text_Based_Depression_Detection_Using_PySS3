Death Would Be a ReliefI don't have a place in this shitty world and there's hardly a point in going on. I don't know what I'm doing no matter how much I pretend I do. I live in the middle of nowhere and have no way to meet many people, always the same few garbage I'm around. I just wish I could leave forever already. I doubt life would be better somewhere else though. I have to try though? I don't fucking knoe anymore.
