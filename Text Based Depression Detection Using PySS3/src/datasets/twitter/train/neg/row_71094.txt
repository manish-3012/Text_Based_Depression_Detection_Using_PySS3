I just wanted to be lovedI never really felt loved. My parents were never affectionate with me. It's my fault. I never told them I wanted a hug.
I envy people who have good relationships with their parents.

And it's my fault that he did this to me. Just telling no isn't enough. I should've shove him away from me. He was my boyfriend and I trusted him.

My nightmares won't leave me alone. I'm getting drunk to sleep better.

Maybe it's just genetics. My mom was like that, my uncle is like that.

It's been seven years with these up and down feelings. This rollercoaster should end. I want to feel numb forever, these feelings and nightmares are too much for me
