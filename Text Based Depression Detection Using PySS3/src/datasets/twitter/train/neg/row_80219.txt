AlmostI tried for the first time, I almost did it, but I couldn't. I tried hanging myself, just as I was losing conscience I snapped into reality and couldn't make myself do it. It felt so good and calm, my vision was getting blurrier, it felt like a dream, but I just felt so horrible and scared afterward. 

I was so close, yet so far. It scared me so fucking much, I don't think I'll be doing it anymore. I can't.

My family arrived just after, so I'd have been "saved" and probably made my life shittier.
