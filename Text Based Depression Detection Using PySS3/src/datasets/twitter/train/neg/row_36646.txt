I don't want to feel trapped..I'm going to be graduating college in May and getting a new life...but right now I'm dealing with such a toxic family life...and right now I don't have the means to leave..
It's hard (and frustrating) to know anyone that understands that I feel like a bird in a cage...
I don't want to die...I know I've got a lot of amazing things that I'm beyond capable of..don't know what I'm doing. I just want to escape...just end..
I'm tired...
