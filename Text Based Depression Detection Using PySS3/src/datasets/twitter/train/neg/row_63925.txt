Just need to speak my true mind with no judgment.Maybe this forum is more appropriate because I get down voted in the depression thread. I'm 36 age American male going through a break up and past trauma.

I just wanted to say the other day at 3am I'm looking up methods. I have a train literally within  200ft of my apartment, tons of opiates and benzos. I've questioned it a lot and have a lot of resources outside a gun...just hate them. But have the pills and hear the train shaking my apartment on schedule.

But that was just one day in a life's thoughts...tonight I went out and talked to friends, and they were saying I should come play a venue with my music. I have 60-70 songs just sitting around. It was nice to think about it and snapped me out of my feelings..for once capitalism, isn't part of my daily life, yay. 

Expression...just anything. Whether I do or not, it's good people will give me a small platform for expression. It means a lot. So does just having any connection. My ex of 7 years was my emotional connection to the world. Not so much anymore.

The day before I was almost in a car accident, but nothing bad happened. My car leaked and it was a bit alarming.

Haunting me... cancer gone, but lost a right testical as a causality and a few front teeth(wear a partial retainer/denture) detoxes off a opiate last year and had to get back on at a lower dose..currently storing again. But not sure I'm in the same peak physical and mental health to endure another withdrawal all alone with no support. I'm gonna try but scared of the rebound depression and possible mania.

I'm not saying I'm gonna kill myself...but this is what I'm going through and thinking. It seems a bit over the top for other threads and felt maybe I could post here without judgment. 

I wanna cry a lot right now. 

Thank you for listening.
