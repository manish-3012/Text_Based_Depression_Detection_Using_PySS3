Want to fuck up my lifeAnyone else just want to fuck themselves up sometimes?

Alcohol, drugs, driving fast, whatever... sometimes you just feel like saying â€˜fuck itâ€™ and doing something crazy. I wish I could control these urges or suppress them but theyâ€™ve been so common recently. Not sure why.

I have enough money so that I could enjoy myself before doing it, if I wanted to. Enough to fuck myself up and maybe, idk, feel something, anything at this point. The only enjoyment I get is out of video games and really what sort of life is that.

Part of me envies certain people for just being able to â€˜live their lifeâ€™ in a way that being happy and fulfilled is their default state. It almost feels like Iâ€™d have to change my life completely in order to really feel â€˜happyâ€™.. itâ€™s so much effort and Iâ€™m just tired...

Maybe if I did something stupid, at least Iâ€™d feel alive. Taking suggestions
