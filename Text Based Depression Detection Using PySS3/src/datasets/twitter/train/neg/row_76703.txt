My Friend Jokes About Suicide and Self-HarmA couple of weeks ago I have met a friend. They told me that they were suicidal a few years ago. Sometimes they would o joke about suicide and self-harm. Whenever my friend would be upset they would grab a pair of scissors and get it close to their skin, and put it in a motion-like cutting, and would pretend to hang themselves with yarn. I used to self-harm and this was sometimes triggering my tendencies. 

When I used to have these thoughts and was stuck in a loop, I never really joked about it. I really don't know what to do with this scenario and I'm not sure if I should confront them. Is this something I should talk about to them and is joking about suicide common?
