I need help helping my "sister"This girl who is the sister of an ex-gf is really close to me, so much so that I call her my sister and she calls me her big brother.  I love her very much and we talk about almost everything as far as I can tell.  For many years she has been depressed and working with doctors and therapists to try and help her and get her on meds, but they seem to either not work, or really mess with her body which makes it worse for her.  I found out maybe a month ago that she is cutting and has cut in the past.  She has come to me asking for help in the past for depression but tonight she said that she really needs help and she "is tired of using my leg like a venting tool."

I have been doing my best to be there for her and support and encourage her as much as possible to get her by day by day, but I feel like I keep treading water and am slowly going under in that I am not keeping up in my support for her.  I need and want to do more for her but I keep feeling lost.  I keep trying to get her to focus on the good in her life and her accomplishments, and compliment her that she is amazing, but I keep feeling like that isn't enough.  I keep feeling like that is is just helping her get by for that moment but isn't helping any in the long term.  Any advice or recommendations to support either for me to help her or her helping her self would be appreciated.

tl:dr My very close female friend who is my "sister" is cutting and I feel like my form of trying to help her is only small band-aid fixes.  Looking for additional support.
