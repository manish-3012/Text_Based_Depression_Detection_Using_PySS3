How to hide my cutting wound?Hi everyone, so i started cut myself in the wrist (before i only cut myself or harming myself when im angry and resulting a bad wound) rn my would still shallow because  i do the cutting when sober ( i mean when im not angry or anything, i dont know the word to describe it becaus english not my first language) but the wound slowly became too many and noticeable. So i want to ask you guys how to hide my wound? The problem is that i need to use chef jacket when im working. It will be weird of i suddenly use a lot of bracelet ( and its not adviceable to use accessories when im working). When im home its particulary safe because i only meet my parent when eating.
Thank you guys for reading this post, have a good day everyone
