Contemplating suicide because your SO cheated and left you? Ask me anything.IAMA 29 year old guy that has been married for 5 years. Wife cheated on me and left me- taking our kids (age 1 and 3) 1,200 miles away to Florida. This forced me to file for divorce and emergency return of the kids (which she complied to). Then, in December, she alleged that I molested my daughter. We went through all of the investigation rigamaroll and I was acquitted of any wrongdoing. Now I am $25,000 in debt to lawyers and my parents due to my wife's actions.

Point of this post is to show you how bad life can get- but yet I still feel as though life is worth living even though the woman I committed to for life left me for a marine, took my two kids away from me (that I love dearly) and has put me into financial peril.

Have similar things happened to you- and you're contemplating ending it? Ask me anything. We can get through this.
