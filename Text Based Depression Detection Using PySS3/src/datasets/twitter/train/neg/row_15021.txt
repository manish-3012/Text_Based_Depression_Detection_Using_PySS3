End of life arrangmentsAs someone who has battled with suicide on again and off again lately I've been wanting to make end of life arrangements. A living will, what I want done with my body after I die, memorial, or lack there of arrangements.. I don't want one. Don't want a funeral or anything. I just want to be forgotten about. I want everyone to wake up the next day and go on as if I never existed. Yet, there really isn't a way I can do this. Nobody I can talk to that won't just tell me "it gets better" "think of all the people who will miss you" etc...
