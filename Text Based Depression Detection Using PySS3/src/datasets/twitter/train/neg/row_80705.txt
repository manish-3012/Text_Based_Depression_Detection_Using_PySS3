I may not wake up tomorrow and am looking for someone to notify next of kinSo I poured a bottle of sleeping pills and a bottle of ibuprofen pm into a contigo 20oz canister, filled it with water and, well....

I'm not sure if I'll wake up some I was wondering if someone could notify next of kin in the morning (SoCal PST here) just in case.

This is serious.
