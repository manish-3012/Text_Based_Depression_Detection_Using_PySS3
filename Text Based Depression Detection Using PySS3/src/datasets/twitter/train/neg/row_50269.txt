I cant take this anymore.to tired to explain everything but I have always had a bad relationship with my parents, been told I was a mistake, I talk to much, I dont do enough, Im lazy, stupid, fat well you get the rest. these past months I thought my relationship with my parents was better. but just 3 days ago I got a long text from my parenst telling me they dont want to have contact with me anymore. they are just throwing me away. then why the FUCK did they keep me? why was I even born? if not even my parents want me, then who the hell want to??? Its just over a year I tried to kill myself. there is no fucking reason anymore. I cant stand this pain. Im so fucking worthless not even my parents want me. great. Im seeing my doctor on monday. im scared to tell him all this. I dont want to be admitted to a psych ward again. not another 7 months. i cant take that. I feel so broken. i dont know what to do. I feel so worthless. dead on the inside. nothing is ever going to go my way. I was never ment to be alive. this life is not for me.
