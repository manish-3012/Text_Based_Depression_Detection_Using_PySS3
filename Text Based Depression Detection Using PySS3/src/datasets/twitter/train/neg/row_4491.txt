I had planned to do it last nightSpent a week planning for last night to be the night. Then didn't do it. Then made the mistake of telling housemates. Their reaction felt like shit because it felt like they didn't really care, just didn't want me to do it here. I still feel just as horrible but now my plan is derailed and I feel miserable and trapped. I desperately wish I had a gun, then I'd just drive as far away from this place as a full tank of gas will take me and do it somewhere random.
