Just venting, do not respond.I have no empathy left, I could never form any close relationship due to maternal abandonment at a very early age, I have strong narc traits and the meds are not doing anything (since I never had a chem imbalance, just no girlfriend).

Girls were attracted 2 me but I rejected them bc of my mother's decision to place me in kindergarten at age 1. Now? Now I can't match on any dating app since I have no prospects or anything else that women find attractive. And they are pickier than ever in 2020, since attractive men are choosing to fuck 100s of decent-looking girls rather than marrying one good woman from the get-go.

My only cope is to not think, and when it fails, this happens, not that it's negative or that I am dissatisfied with my situation, I do not exist. I am a part of a brain that will disolve quickla and have already shifted shapes billions of times.
