Crazy how things changeI have slowly lost all empathy from past events... Not even a month ago I was on here trying to help those who were struggling, and now I am falling and can't seem to stop.  Death is no longer something I fear, which scares me.  I lost the girl of my dreams.   I was combating my addictions to porn, and now I just don't care.  I have lost all inhibitions and I no longer think about finding other people.  I have lost interest in my friends.  I have lost interest in my hobbies.  I want to sleep and never wake up.  I just relapsed again for the 5th time in 1 week.  I just failed everyone who thinks I am doing better, including my friends and family.  I will never have a healthy relationship.  I always move too slow or too fast, or show up at the wrong place or the wrong time.  Suicide is entering my thoughts, and the fear that planning it will come soon is taking control of me.  I lost her, I lost myself and I'm letting my bridges burn.  People rarely notice I am missing, and rarely care about what I have to say.  I am a shadow.  The only emotion I have now is fear, and even that is slowly fading away...
