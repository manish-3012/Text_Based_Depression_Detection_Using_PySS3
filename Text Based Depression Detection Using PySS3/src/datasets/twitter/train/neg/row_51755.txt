I want to die so it will all just end.Around last June I found out that my first real boyfriend of 6 months cheated on me with a close friend I've had since grade 8. They both went behind my back and lied to my face when I asked them about it for months. Then she told me what happened and I wanted to puke. I read the messages and was told everything that happened. Me and him tried to work it out but I ended up ending things because even him touching my arm would make me freak out. After that I started to spiral into a bad depression and started have nightmares about him and her and everything that happened and didn't and still haven't slept for months. I started self harming again and hated myself more than ever. Flash forward to now. Three times this school year the principals have come to me asking if I'm going to fight her because her and all of her friends have been spreading rumours. I was fine for a while but recently it happened again and now I'm right back where I started. I'm having nightmares again. I have no self esteem or confidence. I'm angry about them doing it. And I for some reason can't get him out of my head. And on top of that my home life is shit and I have this wierd disconective thing where I always feel like I'm dreaming and nothing is real that makes me feel even more crazy and I have never in my life wanted more than to just be dead. I have no hope that it will get better and be happy. I have nothing left and I just want it to all end and stop.
