Lost escense - me, my uncle, and grandfather have suffered some form of brain damage. I can't live with it!!!I took LSD and since then (2) years live with a chronic headache. It causes me to seclude myself thats difficult when you suffer from borderline personality since I also cant stand being alone but I cant function socially fully


My uncle had a heart attack in June and had brain damage due to lack of oxygen. This was my favorite uncle and now hes stuck ina childlike daze.

My only grandfather that was also my godfather and apparently his favorite nephew   
began suffering from dementia.

I dont know what to do I am trying to work with my uncle but only break down in tears that only gets me more depressed, but hehelped me when I first got ill so I owe it to himthough he doesnt remember me.


Is there any hope for any of us?
