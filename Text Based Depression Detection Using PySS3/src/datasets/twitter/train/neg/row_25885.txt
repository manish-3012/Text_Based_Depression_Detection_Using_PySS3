I dunno what to do anymoreI don't know what to do anymore. Every day, I've been tempted more and more to take my own life. I have nothing to live for anymore. All of my friends are either too far away, have replaced me with other friends or they have just left me on my own, and it makes me feel like a piece of shit when I think that they should be helping me out and not focusing on themselves. It's just plain selfish, and I am just a terrible person for thinking like that. I am an awful person, and I don't even deserve their friendship in the first place - so it makes sense that these people will leave me at some point. 
 My parents have told me that they're depressed and everything around them is depressing to them. They didn't specifically say me but they've told me in the recent time that they hate me and that I annoy them, and they're probably right to think that. My brother has told me on one occasion to kill myself, and so I have no idea what to do anymore. 
 I'll turn to my youtube channel, to the stuff I'm writing or reading and video games to make me feel better, but i've come to the point where that doesn't even make me feel happy anymore, and if that doesn't make me happy, what can? I have tried to find something else, but I can't find anything no matter how hard I try. 

I don't think I'm going to be able to find anymore, and I don't think I'm going to survive at all. I want to give up.
