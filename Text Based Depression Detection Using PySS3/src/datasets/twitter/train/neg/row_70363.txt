Lonely around friendsDoes anyone else ever feel very out of place around people? Like when you're around friends you feel like you're not supposed to be there. Nobody's going out of their way to make you feel like this but you just do. I feel more lonely around people than I do when I'm by myself. 

I don't want it to be like this though. I want to be able to enjoy the company of my friends.
