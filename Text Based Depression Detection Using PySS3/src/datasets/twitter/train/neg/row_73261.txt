Im suicidal because of my disability.Is it true that without a good education your'e basically fucked? Because unskilled work is low paid, and even if youre lucky and it is not that bad paid, its not very secure. More and more unskilled work will be automated. You may ask why not just get a education? That's not that easy for me. Because of my disability (autism) it's very hard for me to learn new things. Yes i have a learning disability too. So what should i do? I dont want to end up in a dead end job. But i fear that's going to happen because i can't get a decent education. Any tipps for me? I had tried several times to kill myself too. Why? Because i have no future, i think. What should i do?
