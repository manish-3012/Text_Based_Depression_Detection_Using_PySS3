An early weekly post #1As promised i would post weekly, not for annoyance but for my sake...

I am going to a therapy appointment,
 Tommarow.  i personally dont trust them but i need to tell someone i want to kill anyone, even me. I slept horribly again, i was choking in my sleep like i normally do. I woke up and wrote a fury filled speech to my father(whole other story) for when i call him. If i dont post for a while it will be due to my trust with my therapist to be broken by another baker-act . So much runs through my head now. I dont want help with my thoughts i want a solution, i dont want a "we help right?" From the government... If assisted suicide was legal id apply to the courts but its not. We blame shooters for killing people, we demonize their actions, but we dont realize they are ill. I know many of us on this page thought of bieng like them. 

I digress like i always do.
