Going through mental torture "every" nightMy death anxiety is driving me insane. Imagine being mock executed night after night. It sucks, to say the least.  
Im on xan and beer rn. I feel like I rly can do it in this state.  
Tomorrow im gonna take a FAT dose of amphetamine, get tweaked as fuck, then after an hour or so, ima take all my fking benzo and a beer, im gonna stand by the highway(not suspicious cuz there is a bus stop there hehe). Then i'l do my best to run out when a truck in high speed is coming. Honest question now, if I somehow would "live", can I write a piece of paper to say its ok to "pull the plug" on me?
