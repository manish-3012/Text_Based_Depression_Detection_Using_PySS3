I can't go to school because of my depression and anxietyMy depression and anxiety have been so bad lately and I've skipped many classes this year. I don't know what to do, I don't wanna get kicked out of school. I would go there, but everytime I try I have a massive panic attack in the morning or during class and if not then, then after coming home from school so then I cannot go the next day, because the panic attacks are this huge. My parents are really supportive and they are really trying their best, I see therapists, I have meds, but still I just cannot do this. I just wanna be a normal teenager, all the people in school seem so chill, if they get a bad grade they are relaxed and just hope they'll be able to fix it in the future. I just wanna fucking die. School should by my only problem rn and if I'm not able to handle it, I don't think I'll be able to handle other problems that will come to my way in life. Any tips? Anyone who has the same experiences?
