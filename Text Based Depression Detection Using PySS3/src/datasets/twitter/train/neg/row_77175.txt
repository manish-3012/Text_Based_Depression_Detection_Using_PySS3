I just want someone to listen.Recently my girlfriend of almost a year dumped me over text without any warning. I have no friends to talk to about it and I'm scared to tell my family I'm this depressed. I've never been this sad and I just can't keep out the thought of ending all the pain in my life the easiest way I can.
