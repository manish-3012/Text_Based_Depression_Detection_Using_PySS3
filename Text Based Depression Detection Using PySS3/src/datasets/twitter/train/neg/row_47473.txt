Losing the warMy life has been nothing but a wreck growing up and I donâ€™t Iâ€™m going to make it. Iâ€™ve fought myself about owning a firearm since whatever age I could legally buy one but I canâ€™t take it anymore Iâ€™m going buy one soon and walk into the forest get drunk and shoot my self. I know Iâ€™m going to be missed by my friends and family but I donâ€™t care at this point.. I tried talking to someone on the hotline but it felt useless like he wasnâ€™t understanding why I was feeling this way. I even made an appointment to talk with a psychiatrist but I felt better and ended up not going and I regret it. All of this over a fucking girl too.. It took me 3 years to get into a relationship trying to bring myself back from the edge and now Iâ€™m back on it and this time Iâ€™m falling over and Iâ€™m going to make sure I do
