I feel like I should be feeling something at this pointI have a plan... more of a loose structure, really... made a note, got all my passwords for things my family might need. Things have been bad for a while. Therapy doesn't really do anything, medicine doesn't make me feel different. I feel like I've been flying close to the ground, just kind of gliding, and one day I'm gonna snap and hit the ground, you know? 

I'm not even really sad to be checking out- I know when I decide to do it, it'll be on an impulse because that's just how I've always been. 

Now that I think about it, I'm not even sure why I'm posting here. We all have different experiences in life, think about things differently, *see* things differently...
