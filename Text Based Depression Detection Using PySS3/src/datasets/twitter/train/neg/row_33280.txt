Having it as a choiceIs it bad that I have it as a choice? I donâ€™t think about it often, but I know how I would do it if something happened and it came to it. Itâ€™s something Iâ€™m sure of would work unlike my last attempts which were pretty lethal. Why do I keep it even as an option. What does that mean.
