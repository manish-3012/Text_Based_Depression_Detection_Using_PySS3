I can't stand society and this world anymore. I want out.Hell, I'm not even depressed right now. I just don't want to deal with life anymore. Even the things that make me happy aren't enough to keep me from wanting to die. It's not that I don't feel joy, it's just the dread of living through another day on this shitty, unfair world that makes me suicidal. 

I want to end it, and I want to end it now. I'm trying to find easy ways to kill myself without having to get my hands in anything that's illegal. I don't know what it'll take or how long. Don't really care that much either.
