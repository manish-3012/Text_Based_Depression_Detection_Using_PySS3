I'm getting at the end of my rope, eat up with guilt and shameI've struggled with depression for some time now. I periodically have suicidal thoughts where I feel like my life has no value and like it'd be easier not to exist. I did something very bad to someone I love a couple of years ago and I have a hard time working through it.

We have talked on and off since it happened and we always end up fighting. She doesn't believe I care about her or understand her, which is the furthest thing from the truth. I love her more than anything. But we both have bad tempers and I have a harder time working through things with her because she has a lot of hurt over what I did. It always ends with a feedback loop of bad words and stray tempers.

I've tried to move on but it haunts me. When I'm not talking to her, I lose sleep. When I do talk to her, things may go well for a while, but they always explode. I said something to her today that I didn't mean, and I can't take it back.

I feel worthless. I pretend to be happy and to have a good life and I put on a good face for other people, but I'm exhausted. I have come closer today to letting it all go than I ever have. I even wrote a couple of notes to my friends and family.  I am so full of shame and I feel like I'm an awful person. I feel like I don't belong anywhere and that I don't deserve to be happy. I've cried so much today. I've had to leave my office a couple of times to keep people from knowing. I don't know what to do. I've hurt for almost two years. I just want to stop hurting. I want her to stop hurting even more.
