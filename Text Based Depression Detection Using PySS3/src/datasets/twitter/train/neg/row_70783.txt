It all makes sense nowI have the worst streak of luck ever, and it feels like it's not coming to an end. I moved across the world to chase my dreams and ideals, and I no longer care. I often feel alone and overwhelmed by the speed at which people are living here. Everything seems temporary. Everytime I get invested into something it crumbles right in front of me. I don't know. What's the point?

Why does nobody listen to me for once? I'm always supposed to give, always giving all my heart, but no one ever truly listens to me. No one ever asks me how I am. All these people walking around, living their lives, I'm just another blip in their lives, I feel like giving up sometimes. 




Help.
