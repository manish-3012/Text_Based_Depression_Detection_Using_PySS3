I'm tired .i was told I had depression and anxiety last year. I didn't believe it because i thought the way i was feeling was normal. I ignored it but it's gotten worse. i hate myself for being depressed. I was recently hospitalized for trying to kill myself. I want to try again but I'm afraid of going back. I'm tired of not having anyone to talk to. I can't talk,when I want to I get really anxious and I think I'll be quiet anyway so i might as well not talk at all. I can't text people back,as that makes me anxious too. people say they're worried about me,but I know they're lying. I'm waiting until my mom goes to work and then I can just end it. I'm tired of not being able to do really anything. I don't want to be depressed but it doesn't get better no matter how hard I try.
i just can't try anymore.
