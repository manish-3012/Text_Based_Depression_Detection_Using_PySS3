ready to off myselfI'll be honest i always had an easy life. single child, parents have always been easy on me, loved to no end, it was unfair how easy i had it. Now i'm grown up and having to deal with life problems on my own tho and i have no guidance, no friends, no life, nobody. I'm getting my ass kicked proper and i can't deal with it, i can only cry.
