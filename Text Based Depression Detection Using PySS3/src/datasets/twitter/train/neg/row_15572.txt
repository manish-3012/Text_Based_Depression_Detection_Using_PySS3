the death of someone else is triggering my suicidal urgesrecently, theres been a death in my community. someone who i sort of grew up with and didnt know personally as we grew older. i just knew of them over time. this person also happens to be my neighbor across the street. 

this death has triggered my depression immensely.  and it feels like this person is beckoning me to join them in death. i didnt even know them enough to call them a friend. but it feels like my plans of killing myself are being pushed to a sooner date. 

i dont know why i have this sudden urge. i know that it will surely tear my loved ones apart, but i always had a plan to not live past 25 (im currently 21) and each day that passes is a day i just cant take life anymore. i dont see a future. i dont see love in my future. i dont see success in my future. i dont see anything. 

i dont know what to do with myself right now. im just tired uninterested all the time. im on medication. i see a psychiatrist. i feel like none of it is working and i can never escape this horrible dreadful feeling.
