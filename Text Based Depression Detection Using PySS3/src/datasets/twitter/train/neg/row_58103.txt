I donâ€™t want to liveIâ€™m 45 and dead alive.  My wife took my boy and left me for a Czech photographer back in 2013, she could not bear a weak and sick husband. 
    My depression was diagnosed in 1994 and now Iâ€™m fully retired. My kid is 12 and has to suffer my sadness, Also Iâ€™m a rheumatic and a fybromyalgic and for that Iâ€™m also in physical pain. Iâ€™m alone, my pay is low and I must pay a third of it each month to her..she took everything from me. 
As a bad gambler a put my money all-in our marriage. 
As I have no money I canâ€™t do any fun thing with my boy whose pre-teen phase makes him be all day playing games in his room.
Iâ€™m tired, living in a small town far from everything and without a car because of my poorness. My family lives 500 miles away but Iâ€™m stuck in here. Without any future.
    I have a strong faith in god but the time to be healed on paradise is not yet here. The only reason I donâ€™t take my life is because that will create such a big trauma in my sonâ€™s mind that I will make him a disgraceful all his life, just as the shitty father he has. Maybe when he grow as a strong man I will.
I just pray to keep my mind and donâ€™t lose it and do that to him.
