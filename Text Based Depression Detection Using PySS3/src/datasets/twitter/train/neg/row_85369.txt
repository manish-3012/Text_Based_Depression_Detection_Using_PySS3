DrunkWith my friends and thinking. Iâ€™m relying on autocorrect right now, really. Why am I alive? Life goes wrong time after time and barely goes right and it feels like life is worthless. Itâ€™s bullshit. Keep going and youâ€™ll be okay.. sure. life gets shittier and shittier. I canâ€™t imagine myself beyond 25 because of that.
