girlfriend tried to commit suicide, freaking outMe and my girlfriend got into a fight (she is very drunk and I'm 100% sober), shes had a past of depression. Things escalated and she started pushing me. Eventually, she went to the drawer and grabbed a large knife and screamed she wanted didn't want to live anymore.

She's attempted multiple times before, and so I knew I had to take immediate action.

I got the knife away from her, but she cut her hands. I got covered in blood trying to cover the wounds. She threatened me that she would kill herself again if she got the change if I called anyone. Her mom got really messed up from the previous attempts.

I waited until she blacked out finally. I've hidden the knives/anything sharp and I'm cleaning up blood. I'm staying up so she doesn't try anything, its currently 2:30am.

I'm so scared, I love her. I'm so scared, please if this post gets deleted thats okay. I just want to talk to someone. Please, I can't get the images out of my head. I'm so terrified.
