Ending it tonightThe woman of my life broke up with me. She was the only woman who genuinely cared for me. She was so kind and we had such a good time socialising. I can't find anybody else, I'm too ugly &amp; autistic. And I have nothing good going for me in this life, everything is pure misery. I have no friends and live in total isolation.

Just wanted to share these thoughts. Gonna jump off the nearby bridge soon.
