I hate myself. I cant even kill myself.I've been having treatment and taking meds for a while now. Its always the same thing. I feel better and then I want to die again. But as I'm too much of a coward to actually just jump or just take the whole damn bottle suicide isn't a realistic option. So I end up just asking for something to kill me outloud for hours on end. I have friends I talk with when I feel down but I feel like it drags them down and it doesn't seem to help me as I end up spiraling the same way down as I always do. I dont even think theres a point to me writing this. I'm sorry for wasting your time. I've failed at everything in my life and I'm such a useless piece of shit that I can't even end it all.
