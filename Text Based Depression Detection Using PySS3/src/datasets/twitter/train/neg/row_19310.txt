Does anybody ever think about their suicide being exploited for attention?So recently a man who went by the name "Reckful" killed himself. He was known for broadcasting himself playing video games to the internet. After he took his life, a female streamer named Alinity made his death all about her. She broadcasted herself having a "breakdown" whining about how SHE has wanted to kill herself for years. I find it disrespectful to say the least. Didn't the same thing happen after Kurt Cobain killed himself? I'm seeing a pattern here...
