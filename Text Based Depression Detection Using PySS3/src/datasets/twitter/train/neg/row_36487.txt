Is it suicidal to want to die but to not want to do it yourself?It's been a while since I've felt like I actually wanted to be alive, "I want to die" is almost a daily mantra for me now, but whenever I think "I want to kill myself" or about the act of actually doing it myself, it makes me uncomfortable.

I think it might just be because I'm terrified of failing at that too, if I end up shooting myself in the head and surviving it'd be horrible. Especially with the gore gifs of suicide survivors that circulate now, I know I'd be one and I can't imagine surviving and seeing it. I have an idea of what I would do, but I'm just so scared of surviving.
