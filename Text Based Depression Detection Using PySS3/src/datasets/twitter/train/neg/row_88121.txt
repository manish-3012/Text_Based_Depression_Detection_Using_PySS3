Feel terrible about past mistakesThere have been a few occasions where I was out at a club and dancing with a girl where I took things too far. Basically on a few separate occasions while extremely intoxicated and dancing with a girl I have fingered my way through clothing and touched a breast for a couple of seconds. The first couple times I did it the girl I was dancing with seemed to have no problem with it, even kissing/making out with me. To me this made it seem to like somehow this was okay. I now realize I was terribly wrong and there is no excuse for my actions. I have no idea what possessed me to make me think this was okay. The most recent time I did this which was about a year and a half to two years ago  I may have accidentally exposed the girl I was dancing with. Although she kissed me as well I feel I made her uncomfortable with what I did and my presence in general which hurts me the most because I genuinely care about people and the last thing I want to do is hurt anyone. Her friend escorted her out of the club and yelled at me. I immediately realized that what I had done was wrong. I wish I had never done any of this. I feel like the biggest scum on the face of the earth. Iâ€™ve tried to forgive myself for my actions but donâ€™t feel I deserve forgiveness.
