Everyday seems to be getting worse and I just want to go to sleep forever.I let myself and my family down over and over again. Just got my first dui and now I'm stuck living in the living room at my parents place. Can't drink or hangout with any friends because they are scared of the influence it will have on me. I want to just down a whole bottle of unisom to go to sleep for good. Worst thing is this would be my 3rd attempt at killing myself. First by carbon monoxide, second but slitting my wrist. Nothing anyone talks to me about or says brings me any kind of comfort. Just pushes me closer to the edge. I wish my parents, family and friends did hate me so I could go and make sure no one suffers after I'm gone. I'm done being the burden on everyone else. I hate myself and this world now. My life is nothing and I just want to go to sleep forever.
