I feel so useless.I feel like all I do is drag everyone down. I'm afraid to tell anyone I'm suicidal in fear that they will lock me up or put me in a psych ward making things infinitely worse. I just want this all to be over but I'm to afraid. I'm a worthless coward who can't do anything right. I feel like no one actually truly loves me. I feel like a waste of space, I feel empty. I just want this pain to end, I want to be done.
