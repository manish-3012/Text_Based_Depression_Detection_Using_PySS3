suicide, it's my only way out.I've stopped trying to be happy, stopped trying to smile, stopped trying everything. I wake up every morning wishing i died in my sleep, spend the day being numb and plotting plans on how to kill myself, get home wishing i had razors to slit my wrists, even though i don't, I've thought about going out to by some, i just don't like going out by myself. I've almost bled out before, it wasn't that bad actually, it felt kinda good. I end up falling asleep around 11, wishing, hoping, trying to figure out a way to die in my sleep so that i don't have to deal with tomorrow. I'm tired of never stopping thinking about someone who shouldn't even matter anymore. Blaming myself for what she did. I'm not even sure why I'm asking for help honestly, no one can change my mind anyway
