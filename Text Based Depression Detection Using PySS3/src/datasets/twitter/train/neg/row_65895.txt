I'm tired.I thought I could find my way out of it- told myself I'd become strong if I could do it on my own. I knew I should've talked about it; stayed silent every time I could've asked for help. I was scared. By talking about it, I would lose something because it wouldn't be a secret anymore. Like I would be giving up my option to commit suicide if they took action against me. I didn't want to take anti depressants; I didn't want to be watched; controlled. I just wanted to be free, even if it meant carrying this darkness with me. 

I isolated myself, cried over things that kept falling out of my grasp and ties I never meant to sever. I've become so useless. Debilitated by my own thoughts, I struggle to sift through what still makes sense. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live. I thought I could fix everything by finding love, but I failed that over and over too. 

Fall semester is coming, and friends and family all expect me to re-enroll, but I can't find the drive to do that and commit for another semester. I'm running out of time, and I don't know what to do. I have this dark premonition that everything is about to collide, and I'd rather not be around for it. I have headaches all the time now, and I can't sleep right. I'm just so tired.
