I'm weak and want to kill myselfSo, first some background. I'm 18 and I'm currently in full time employment doing web programming. I have no social life at all, and any friends I do talk to is just on Facebook or MSN chat.
I'm extremely introverted, so I find it hard to make friends, and just get on with people in general. I have depression issues and I think lowest of myself almost all the time.
Sometimes I find it pathetic that I feel this way; there's hardship going on all over the world and I'm complaining over stupid emotions, and this just makes me feel weak.
Something that's been a huge factor in my depression is that I want to be a female. I haven't ever told anyone this but I feel like I'm in the wrong body sometimes. 

Sorry, I don't know what I was trying to achieve posting here, I just feel really suicidial and as I'm a coward I sometimes feel that would be the best option.
