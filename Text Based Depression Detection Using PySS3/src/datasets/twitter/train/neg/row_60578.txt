Today I turn 28 and all I want for my birthday is to not exist.My name is Andrew. Today I turned 28. Today I also lost my only 2 friends in the world by being a useless, lazy person.

I am moving back in to my parents house tomorrow after living with 2 friends since the start of 2017. In the 4 months since living together I've managed to alienate both of my friends that I've known for 10 and 6 years respectively. The messages I got from them today told me they have given up on me and hope I die.
I have no money, no job, no future prospects and I am alone.

I have never had a romantic relationship, nor even had sex.
I've failed my attempts at university numerous times.
I am and have always been fat. I've tried before to lose weight but always feel back into comfort eating.
I hate myself.
The only job I can manage to keep makes me want to kill myself.
The only thing stopping me from being homeless and living on the streets is that my parents are the most wonderful people I know.

I am alone. My parents love me. My brother loves me. My grandma loves me. Yet I feel completely alone.

Both of my mothers siblings killed themselves. My uncle before I was born by carbon monoxide poisoning and my auntie 11 years ago by hanging. 
For my mum and my grandmas sake I can't kill myself. It would destroy them.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to die, but I don't want to exist anymore.
