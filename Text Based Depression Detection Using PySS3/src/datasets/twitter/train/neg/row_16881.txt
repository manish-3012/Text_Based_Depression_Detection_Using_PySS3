How do people go on in life?I'm just so frustrated by society. I'm blamed for everything, I have years of experience under my belt as an abuse survivor, and my own family couldn't care less about me. I don't know how anybody can go on and be happy with everything that happens. I'm just really glad I have my emotional support dog who's been nothing but wonderful. I can't even tell my therapist because I'll just get out in the psych ward. Ughhhhh :(
