I'm going to kill myself tonightI can't take it anymore, I just give up. I tried my best to stay somewhat positive and not give up for about 3 years now but I'm done. At this point (as selfish as it sounds) I don't care who I'm going to hurt by doing it, I just want to be gone. But, I just wanna say you're all amazing people. Goodbye.
