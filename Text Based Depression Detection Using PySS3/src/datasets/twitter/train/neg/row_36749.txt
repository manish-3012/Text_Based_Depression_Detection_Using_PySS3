I donâ€™t know if I can do this anymore.I feel selfish for wanting to die, but I donâ€™t know if I can do this â€œlifeâ€ thing anymore. Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s worth it. I havenâ€™t felt like myself in a long time. I lost someone I really cared about and loved and things probably wonâ€™t be the same again between us. Iâ€™m not sure if I will be able to move back to college this fall because the pandemic just got really bad in my state and my parents are putting me under a lot of pressure to stay home instead. I understand that I may be safer living at home since my chances of getting corona are lower, but I also feel that my mental health will suffer while living at home. Unfortunately, my parents arenâ€™t the best at supporting me emotionally. I was really looking forward to moving back and having more space to myself, but Iâ€™m not sure if that will work out. And Iâ€™ve been stuck in this stupid rut where not much seems to be working out in my favor for over a month now, and Iâ€™m tired of feeling miserable. I literally cry myself to sleep multiple times a week. And it fucking sucks. So basically I feel like I donâ€™t have anything left to live for. 

TL;DR I donâ€™t know if I can do this anymore because everything seems to have gone to shit and nothing seems to be getting better. I donâ€™t really have anyone in my life I can talk to who understands.
