I think suicide is the answerWhere the hell to I even begin? I recently lost my first job that really gave me any purpose in life. I got fired, I royally sucked at it. My hours kept getting cut until my boss just flat out said I'm fired. 

I'm not in school but my I want to. Only problem is I nearly flunked out of high school from depression and anxiety. I'm worried I'll do the same. 

My family has been putting too much damn pressure on me and it's too much. It also doesn't help that my friends all basically abandoned me. All have gone off to college or just pushed me out of their lives. 

So fuck it, I'm done. I'm angry and sad at myself and others. This world doesn't need me. I'm going to jump off a bridge near my house tonight. I've clearly reached the endpoint and there's no turning back from here. Goodbye.
