About to become Homeless. I don't know if I can do it. I have one month before I'm homeless with no job, nobody to stay with, and no friends or family to help. I have a few grand in student loans to my name and that is pretty much it. 

I know being homeless isn't the end of the world. I know that if I survive it, life will get better. I just cant find the motivation to fight anymore. For the sake of anonymity, I wont explain my past, but the last 2 years have been the worst of my life. 

I have been slowly picking up the pieces, taking baby steps because that's literally all I can handle. Give me time and space, and yea I can pick myself back up. I'm finally feeling like i'm back to my real self. Something I haven't felt in months. But with my impending crisis, and rock bottom in clear view, I'm scared that I wont have the motivation to fight through this next setback especially without any support whatsoever. 

TlDR: Life took a shit on me, finally becoming my self again. Incoming setback that removes any and all support. I don't think I can fight through it again, this time, by myself.
