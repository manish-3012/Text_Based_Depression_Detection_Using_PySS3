Suicide feels like a foregone conclusion for meTitle pretty much says it all. I've been suicidal since I was 11 or 12, attempted for the first time at 13 and a second time at 16. I honestly am not really prepared at all for life because I never expected I'd still be alive at this point. I always saw adulthood as more of an abstract concept than something that was actually going to happen because I assumed that I'd be dead before I got there. As of right now, I've made a kind of promise to myself that I'm not going to attempt again unless I'm reasonably certain it's going to work, because I can't deal with the fallout from another failed attempt. I'm 17, so I can't get a gun, and that is how I want to do it, because it seems to be the quickest, least painful, and most effective death, just a bullet to the head. Once I turn 18 and can get a gun, who knows. I don't have like an active plan as of now, bc I've tried to get a gun several times before but it didn't work, so for now I'm just kind of floating through life in pain, but I don't see a path going forward that doesn't lead to suicide. I'm also weirdly at peace with it, like I'm very apathetic towards that fact, and I don't really care. It is what it is.
