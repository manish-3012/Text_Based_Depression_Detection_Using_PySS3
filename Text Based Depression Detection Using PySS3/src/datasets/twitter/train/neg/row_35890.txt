I need help.Hello Reddit, my name is John, and although native to Louisiana, I'm now living in Kansas. I moved here on January 1st due to my mother's new job at the Cessna building. I've been suffering from mild to severe depression levels since I was around nine, maybe I'll share my life story some other time. Right now, I'm a sophomore dropped into a new environment with entirely different kinds of people, and although I have tried to maintain a positive outlook on life, I just can't. Everything I do I have to force myself to do. Whenever I'm not doing work for school or money, I find myself sleeping away most of the day. I've been here for over a month and I still have no friends. At this point in my life, I feel a blanket coming back over me. I thought I had finally gotten rid of my suicidal thoughts but now, if I stop forcing myself not to think for two minutes, I begin to cry and have to force my mind off of the subject of suicide or else I'll just fall into uncontrollable sobbing. I don't want to die, I don't think, but I just want everything to stop. I hate that I can't just talk to people. I hate being a "gifted child". I hate being put on a pedestal. I hate losing everyone I care about. I hate that I just can't be normal. I don't know what to do, if anyone can help me, please, I don't want to be a danger to myself anymore.
