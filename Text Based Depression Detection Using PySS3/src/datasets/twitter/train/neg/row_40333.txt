Suicide vs. FutilityI will always be in debt and will likely never retire. The thing is I doubt Iâ€™ll live that long in the first place when I also wonâ€™t be able to afford health care, housing, decent food, and will always be alone and rejected in a broken society. 

Is there any reason to not commit suicide when your life is already at a dead end? Thereâ€™s nothing noble about suffering for 30+ years just to avoid killing yourself.
