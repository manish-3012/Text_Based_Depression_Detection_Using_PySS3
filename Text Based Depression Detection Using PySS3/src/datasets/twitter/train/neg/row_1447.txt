Saying people are evil is the understatement of the century.I hate women, I hate men but I especially hate women. Everything in society is about how special women are, validate me, validate me, celebrate my body, celebrate me.  And we do.  We celebrate tall men as well, we celebrate beautiful people. We're so fucking sick. We laugh at those who aren't born in the right bodies like they don't deserve to live. Let's laugh at short men, let's mock them until they blow their brains out then laugh some more about how society is better off because of this COMPLETELY fucking arbitrary aspect of a human's life. WHAT THE FUCK IS WOMEN'S PROBLEM?  They know exactly what the fuck it is like to be judged, so why are they ALWAYS the first fucking people to judge. Fucking laundry list of expectations and she won't meet half that  WHAT THE FUCK IS MEN'S PROBLEM? They'd kill each other if they were allowed.

What the fuck is the point of even having a brain? It's pointless, intelligence is just another way to see this is all suffering and assholes taking advantage of each other. There is no more culture, there is simply economic activity and a shell pushing us forward.
