I just want it to endAll week Iâ€™ve been thinking about it and then last night my mom gets trashed and cries and comes into bed with me saying if I killed my self she would kill herself. I want to die even more now that I made her feel this way and I canâ€™t even do anything about it because I feel guilty. Even more than I ever did before. After awhile I thought I was selfish but I donâ€™t even think that anymore. My life is meaningless
