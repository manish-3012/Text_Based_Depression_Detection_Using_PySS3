Pain is my lifeI am a sixteen year old male. When I was four I had my first headache. I have a rare disorder that causes more pain then I expect you could imagine. As an example when I fractured my skull about a year ago it felt like a scratch not even close to an average headache. Because if this pain I have been depressed since 3rd grade and first attempted suicide in 7th. Since then I have attempted at least 10 times. Every time from over dosing on prescribed pain killers. Recently I was the closest I have ever been to death and was in the hospital for 11 days after an attempt. I am in extreme pain both physically and mentally. I feel another attempt coming on, please help me.

Edit: Thank you. I am actually feeling a bit better now.
