My SO attempted last night, now I am unable to see him...advice?Last night while I was at work, my fiancÃ© called me and said he did something dumb and that he was dying. He has been depressed the last month or so and is actively taking medicine/therapy to help. But I knew he wouldn't just say something like this, he is not the type to do things for attention or anything. I left work and stayed on the phone to keep him responsive until I got to his house. I walked in and he apparently had taken 100 generic sleeping pills, 10-15 Tylenol, and a few generic antihistamines along with tequila and rum. I called our neighbor (good friend) and then called 911. I wasn't allowed in the ambulance or in the room, so I had to leave. His mother is a doctor at this hospital. I went to go see him this morning and there was a sign on the door that you had to check with the nurses station before entering. They wouldn't allow me in the room. I would assume possibly his mom  has ordered that I am not allowed to see him, since she is a doctor here. my fiancÃ©. So I know they are blaming me for this, his step brother told the neighbor that when he got home. That this had to have been caused by our relationship. I texted his mom and said could you please just give me an update? Thank you so much. And I have no reply. 

I have texted him but I can see he hasn't read them yet, I am pretty sure his step brother ended  up with his phone. I am terrified I will never see or talk to the love of my life again.

I sent him a text letting him know that I love him and that whatever will make this easier for him, I will respect that. If he feels we can't be together, that I would respect that. But I will always care for him and be there for him. etc. that I am so thankful he is in good hands and just to let me know when he has his phone and is feeling ok.


And I feel terrible that I am being the one to blame for his suicide attempt. I just want to see him and talk to him. It is getting harder as the day goes on, as I struggle with depression and anxiety myself (under control).

Any advice or words of encouragement? Or has anyone ever been in a similar situation?

Thanks guys, I am feeling rather shitty at this point today. I just want to talk to my fiancÃ© and hold him. Thank whatever higher being he is alive. 

TL;DR: my fiancÃ© attempted suicide last night, I called 911, he was placed in hospital where his mom is a doctor, she has restricted me from seeing him...is now blaming me 


Update: I am guessing his mother doctor is not who is not allowing me to see him, from information I have heard he is not allowed to see anyone, even family at this point. No access to his phone either. I was assuming the worst and victimizing myself for feeling like I was singled out in not seeing him.
