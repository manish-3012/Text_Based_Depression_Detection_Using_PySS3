Had a moment this evening.I've not had a suicidal thought in almost two years. This evening, I thought about my finances and felt like giving up. My truck broke down last week and I have no way of repairing it. I don't make much money and live check to check. There's no public transportation here. I have shit credit since my divorce. The Department of Education took my taxes for student loans. My mother is over 60 and still lives in addiction. My father makes enough to live, but that's it. I have no one to help.... Life is shit, sometimes..... Thanks for listening.
