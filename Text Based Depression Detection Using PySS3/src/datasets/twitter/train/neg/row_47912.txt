Struggling with bad body odor and candida. I'm deeply considering suicide.I had this for 15 years, it started with a fungal infection before it develop into bigger problem. I can't go out due to my bad body odor. I shower frequently, do laundry and clean my room daily but the odor will stay there. I constantly hear my families and neighbors sneezes, cough and fart all day. It's mentally torturing for me knowing that I cause such discomfort to others. I never smoke, drink alcohol or do drugs. My health has been getting worse lately. I've been through multiple surgeries in the past. I tried different type of medicine prescribed by the doctor. I tried different type of diet and lost so many weight already. But my condition never gets better, only worst. And the constant failure really stressed me out. It's like every effort I put only worsen it. I realize that my body gets weaker now as I grow older. I just can't fight this anymore
