I wish I had the gut to end it.I'm so sick of living. I've been suffering for 20 god damn years, and I just can't take it anymore.
I lost my father (god bless his soul), and all of my friends this year. I'm all alone. I have no one to talk to about my day, my interests, my ramblings, etc.  I'm *alone.* I try to make friends, but everyone has their own set of friends already in college. I just don't know why people don't like me. Loneliness is a slow poison. No one will miss me.

I like to delude myself into thinking that life will eventually get better, but its been a hell hole since I was 12 years old. I tried to commit suicide when I was 15 and 16, and god I wish I actually went through with it. I grew up with abusive parents. I didn't know how to act with my peers due to sexual, physical, and emotional abuse so I seldom had friends in elementary school, but I wasn't excluded. I was just the weird kid everyone knew, but never wanted to be friends with. I was looking through Facebook the other day, and all the people I knew in elementary/middle school are living healthy, happy lives. It shocks me at how much they've grown, yet I'm stuck in this depressive fucking rut. I'm never getting out. I've been the same, toxic person for my entire life and I've done absolutely NOTHING. I want to have peace. I'm done.
