Vent/rantPositvity makes me sick and angry. I hate seeing it. Especially online. It feels so forced every single time. I hate people who observe and lurk. I dont care if you read shit people post, but please dont go out of your way to do full blown investigations on people and post about it. Fuck, my mind is broken and dead. Everything is so boring. I wish I could die rn.
