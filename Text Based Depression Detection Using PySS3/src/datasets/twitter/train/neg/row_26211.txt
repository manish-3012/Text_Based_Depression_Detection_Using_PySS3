DrunkI've gotten drunk for the first time since I've been feeling suicidal. I'm glad I'm not at home near all the guns. I'm with friends and am making plans to move on but feel like I can't. Or I shouldn't. I'm feeling guilty for not feeling terrible. And I feel bad for that. I still have the thoughts and feelings. I just hope they don't keep getting worse. I miss her so much. I still font know if I can live without her but I'm trying. It still hurts and it makes it hard to enjoy moments like this. I dont want to live like this. Constantly feeling bad for having a good time. I don't know what to do. I know I'm going to be worse tomorrow. I hope it doesn't affect work.
