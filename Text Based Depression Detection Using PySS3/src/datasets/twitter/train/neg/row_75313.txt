Copes and copes and copesI feel like most of us or maybe many people are just coping when it comes to their life. I know I am worthless. I am really really ugly, fat and above all mentally ill. Have been for years. I am also not pretending that there are benefits in this life because there arenâ€™t. I mean, who are most of us kidding? Life is not fair and there will be people who wonâ€™t make it, many of those people are here. Me included. I always think about Nietzsche and how he was so self-aware about all of this and he embraced the absurdity, the void and the misery. Only my family would care if I died. But they generally like my brother better. Some of us are just fucking unlucky. I also see no point in talking to a therapist for they will just tell me to change this or that because they canâ€™t say to my face how shit my situation is. It is a farce, really. 

I just wanna go to sleep and never wake up again, I donâ€™t even have the balls to kill myself. I wish someone would just kill me instead.
