I just want it to endI want to fucking die. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve ever wanted. Nobody cares. Every time I try to talk to someone about the way Iâ€™m feeling they never care. They donâ€™t really listen or take me seriously. Iâ€™m tired of cutting myself. It doesnâ€™t make it all go away. Maybe for a little while but it always comes back. My mother found out I was cutting about a year ago and the only thing she said was that I was doing it for attention. I never cut for attention. I do it because itâ€™s the only thing that I can do. I want to kill myself but I just donâ€™t know how. It feels like my life is falling apart. My mom says Iâ€™m a loser and sheâ€™s right. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ll ever be. Just a miserable piece of shit. There are so many things that I want to say but I feel like this has gone on for too long besides, nobody really cares enough to listen anyway...
