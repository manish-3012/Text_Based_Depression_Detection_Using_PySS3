dont really want to kill myself. but im hoping i wont wake up in the morning....well wow.
here i am. this is insane. ive never really felt... well who am i kidding. or course i want to die. not neccesarilly kill myself.. but just... dissapear i suppose.
its for the silliest reasons too. i have it pretty good. but ive been molested multiple tims by 3 different people... all wo claimed to be my best friends.
i have three dads, and the one who my mom is crrently marrid to made her emotionally abusive. so theyre both emotionally abusive my biologicalfather was mia for years, then recently cameback into my life, smoked me out, then dropped a dime on me. never got an appology either.
all of my friends and the love of my life aregraduating tomorrow... and im not sureif ill ever see him agian. my parents are forcing me to mve back in... and god i dnt even know what to do anymore.
what the fuck am i supposed to do? everything good in my life is just taken away. icant lose him, hes the only voice of reason i can hear... the only light i ca seethrough my twited reality... and im *this* close to taking thepills in the medicine cabinate and laving this all behind.
i will not cut again... because if i batle with my demons agian... im letting thm win.
i cant do this anymore.
