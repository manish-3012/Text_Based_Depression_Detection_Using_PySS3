I suddenly want to die for no reason.About an hour ago I gained an overwhelming feeling that I want to die. Nothing really brought this on, but I want to die so badly. I don't think I could do it, but I have gotten close in the past (about 3 months ago I was in a very bad place and had a reason to want to die, but I couldn't bring myself to do it then) I have friends who care about me, I just don't want to burden them with this. A few of them know about how bad I had gotten, but I only told them months after it happened. 

I'm almost out of high school and I know life is supposed to pick up after high school but I can't find anything to look forward to. I used to day dream about getting married, having a family, having a house, etc, but now it feels like it's nothing. Like there's no point. I feel like I provide nothing that someone else can't give. I'm not dating anyone, never have, and I feel like anyone could do better than me. I just have nothing to give. I'm not special. I do a lot of dumb things, and I think the longer I stick around the dumber stuff I'll end up doing. I don't know if I have depression or anything of that sort. I was in therapy for a long time for my anxiety disorders, but I don't think that has anything to do with this. I don't want to tell anyone about this because I don't want them to worry. I just want to stop existing. 

I don't think I'll do anything drastic, I just really needed to get this off my chest, and anything would help I think. I don't know what to do.
