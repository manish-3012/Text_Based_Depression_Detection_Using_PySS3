I'm Old and Tired of LivingHi.  I am 36.  I had a good life.  But it all started heading south about 2.5 years ago.  I worked in construction and made a good living.  (When I say good living I made a mid 5 figure salary).  I wasn't wealthy by any stretch. But I was providing for my wife and 4 kids well.   But then the bottom fell out of the construction market.  I was laid off. I found myself working odd jobs until I found my next job.  I was lucky enough to find another job after only 3 months.  2 months after I was hired I was laid off yet again.  Anyway to make a really long story short, I have been marginally employed for the last 2 and a half years and I'm struggling to make ends meet.  Right now I am working 70+ hours a week at a shit 100% commission sales job that I totally suck at.  I never see my wife and kiddos or any of my friends.  I feel anxious, depressed and alone.  For the past few weeks suicide has crossed my mind just about every day.  The thought of leaving my family behind is really what is stopping me at this point.  I am not sure where to go for help.  Everyone that I talk to says to "just stay positive" or "hang in there".  Help.  I cannot escape this feeling absolute helplessness and doom.
