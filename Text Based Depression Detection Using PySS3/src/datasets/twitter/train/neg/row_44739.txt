tiredim really, really, really tired of everything. 
tired of living.
tired of trying. 

just tired. 

nothing helps.
nothing distracts. 

i wanted to do it yesterday but ended up in the psychiatric hospital and got sent home. 

the doctor made a schedule for me until Wednesday morning. im having a phone meeting with a nurse i usually talk with then. last time i visited her i left crying. i was tired of no one understanding. i just wanted to disappear. i really want to die. suicidal thoughts is the only thing i have. only thing i feel is that i shouldn't be here. i shouldn't exist and i don't know why. im mentally exhausted. i know ill do it any time soon. im already over the edge but trying.. trying to not end it. 

im here making goulash soup but it feels pointless. everything feels pointless. i feel worthless. don't know how it'll go today or later on. ive been thinking about going out again towards night time. i can't anymore. i can't. i really don't. 

please take care of yourselfs if you're reading this. call or talk to someone. hugs.
