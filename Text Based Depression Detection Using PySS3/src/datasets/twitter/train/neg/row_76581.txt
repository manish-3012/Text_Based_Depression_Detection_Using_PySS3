Everyday I swear problems just pop up everyday itâ€™s just pisses me off, Iâ€™m trying to better everything but nothing works it seems. What Iâ€™m i suppose to do?Like everyday is just getting harder to make it thru I swear, life just seems like itâ€™s feeling into a bigger hole. I try to improve but I just donâ€™t seem good enough for anything.

I post here sometimes to rant and get some help or advice but nothing seems to work. 

I just feel so trapped like at the point where if I had a gun or something to kill me I would do it.
