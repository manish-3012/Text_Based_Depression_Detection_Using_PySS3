My entire treatment has been a lieThere's no cure for depression. I've been having therapy and medication for years now. 

You can achieve an "okay" life for a while, but it's just a temporary high. 

You'll always come crashing back to rock bottom. The future is pointless and disappointing. I want for nothing in my life. It's "perfect" but I ache so badly from this horrible disease rotting my brain that I can't enjoy it. I can't die because I'll let too many people down. I can't live because it's absolutely excruciating. 

I have an appointment with my doctor on Monday. I want to tell him how angry I am with this all. I want to be cured. He may suggest hospitalising me, but I don't want that as there's no way out if I truly need it. 

I'm so trapped.
