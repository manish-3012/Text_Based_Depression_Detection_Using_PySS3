I wish my family would just give me permission to kill myselfMy mom is dying of cancer. She'll be in hospice soon. I don't want to be here anymore. I've been worried sick about it for 6 years and my life has not progressed at all. I'm 30 years old, single. I don't date or have any hobbies because all I do is think about death and my mom. I just want the suffering to stop. But oh, I can't do that because my mom would be so sad to lose me. So now I have to wait for her to pass before I can do it, but then people will say, oh, don't do that to your family who just lost your mom.

It never fucking ends. I just want to go. I don't want to hear people tell me they're sorry for my loss. I don't want sympathy. I just want to die, and for people including my family to understand that I'm tired of suffering. It will never get better, only worse when she dies. 

Tomorrow I'm going to finish the process of buying a gun. Then I play to buy lots of alcohol and get wasted. And hopefully the rest will take care of itself.
