Stuck in limboI walked for an hour to find a tall enough building. Then I watched people walking by it, beneath some crazy bright lights, and I suddenly felt sick. There was no thought in particular that was making me sick, but I felt compelled to get away from that place. So, I raced back home and straight into bed. I cried more than I've ever cried before, and there wasn't a thought in my mind.
I don't want to die anymore, but I don't want to be alive.
