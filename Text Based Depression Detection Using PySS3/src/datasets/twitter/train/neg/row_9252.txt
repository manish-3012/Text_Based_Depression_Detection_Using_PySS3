Do I have to continue?I have going back and forth from being in this pathetic state, every time I feel I'm getting better something happens and it's all downhill then. It's like I take 2 steps forward only to be dragged 5 steps back. I have been thinking of committing suicide a lot lately, so much so that I even dream about it. I don't think it'd matter to anyone if anything were to happen, considering how everyone's basically  convinced that I am a terrible person, and more than anyone else I have convinced myself the same more and more affirmly each and everyday. I reach out to people in the only way I know how, through writing, where I explicitly talk about suicide but no one seems to notice what a terrible state of being I am in. Sometime things get so bad that I can't look myself in the mirror because that's just how horrible I feel about myself. It's 3AM here and I have been wondering if I'm even worth living? Why bother continuing? I don't want to continue, I'm tired and exhausted, completely drained from the insides. I don't want to continue.
