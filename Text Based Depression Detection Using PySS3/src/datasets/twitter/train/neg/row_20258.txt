In less than 24 hours I plan to embark on a ship and jump off to end my life. I'm now having second thoughts. But I still want to do it.I guess it's kinda weird asking this since I know most people will tell me not to do it. No matter what, I only see myself as a problem, creating problems to those close to me. I know I need help and i've already received that. I probably need to up my meds. I know that I have to put in my own effort to better myself. Still, idk, I feel and believe my existence is just burdensome. Like, I should work on not being a burden to other people which I have been trying these last couple of years. But, in the end, wouldn't it be better if I was just gone now? Don't worry, my plan is to have my body not be found so there won't be any burial. You can tell me i'm running away or that i'm a coward. It doesn't matter anymore.

Sure, they'll grieve but they'll move on and forget. I want them to forget me entirely. How I wish I could erase me and every trace of my existence. If only I had magic. Anyway, idk.
