Having "those" thoughtsI've been slowly slipping into a black hole. My numbness has turned to a deep deep depression. I have no one I can talk to without making me feel worse. The person I called my "brother" ended up date raping the love of my life. She has been able to move on and has a family of her own while I'm here mistrusting EVERYONE. My "best friend" ghosted me over a measly $500 my elderly mother paid for her to bail out of jail. Looking back I ask myself why I EVER trusted anyone. My mother is the only one I have left who I feel truly cares for me and she's too heartbroken in her own grief over losing my father. I cannot tell her how hurt I am because she will instantly start feeling like it's all her fault. I don't want to kill myself but the physical, emotional and mental pain has been growing and I'm afraid it will tip the scales any moment. 

Every day I'm shown that people really only care about themselves, and my country is slipping closer and closer to hell and/or war with people deciding to turn their heads instead of face the facts. I'm not going to kill myself today because of one reason: It would kill my mom and my soul cannot hold that responsibility. 

I'm a little over 3 years without a drink and just recently gave up marijuana, the one medicine that took away my headaches/chronic back pain without debilitating side-effects. Reddit is literally the only place I have to vent without feeling like I'm putting my pain on someone else. Tonight I go to sleep without killing myself, but tomorrow is a completely new day in this hell. Thanks for reading, or not, I don't really care. Sometimes it just feels good to write it out.
