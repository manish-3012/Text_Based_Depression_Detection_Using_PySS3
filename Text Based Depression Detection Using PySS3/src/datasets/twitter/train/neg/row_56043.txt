Victim of Narcissistic Abuse, I Can't Take It AnymoreI'm getting divorced from my wife, who is a covert narcissist to the tee. For years I dealt with her lies, manipulation, and cheating all in an attempt to keep the family together and because my dumb ass loved her and still does. This eventually turned me into a monster towards her (disclaimer: I have Borderline Personality Disorder). She lied to me about being pregnant with our first so that I wouldn't be careful and then she actually got pregnant. Throughout our engagement I constantly found out about her flirting with other men and twice where I'm pretty sure she slept with them although I have no actual proof other than being tipped off by friends. We got pregnant with twins, got married, I bought her a brand new house and nice vehicles on my credit. Then found out twice that she was flirting with other men again. When I married her I thought she had changed. The second man is a complete dead beat who doesn't see his own kids, doesn't own a car, and has a history of drug and alcohol abuse. This fuck is practically living in my home right now, seeing my children every day while I live in an apartment and get to see them maybe 2-3 times a week. She's blaming me and saying everything is my fault for my rage fits and generally bad attitude towards her after I had found out she was flirting with the first douchebag back in January.

These past four years are sinking in, I'm an idiot for marrying her and a noose sounds perfect right about fucking now. I never asked for this shit. What the fuck.
