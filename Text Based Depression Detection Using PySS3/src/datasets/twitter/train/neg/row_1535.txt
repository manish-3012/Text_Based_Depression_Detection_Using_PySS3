Life is not going to get better.For 5 years now I have been suicidal. I remember that first time when I thought about swallowing those sleeping pills. But I held it off. I gave life a chance. Perhaps it would get better.
But it didn't. It just got worse and worse. 
I don't want to die. But I don't want to endure anymore pain. I realized that when I do this the regret, the anger, the loneliness will not matter anymore. Its only when I think about suicide that I am fully at peace.
What do I do? What can I do?
