I don't enjoy doing anything in life anymore.Ever since my best friend (my dog) died about four years ago I haven't been able to enjoy anything. I've made no friends IRL, no romantic relationships. (I'm probably too ugly anyway) Nobody sees this because I hide it very well. All I ever think about is killing myself because of how much of a loser I am. I don't want to hurt my family, but I can't stand being alive anymore.
