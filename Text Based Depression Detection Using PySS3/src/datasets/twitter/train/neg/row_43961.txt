Help. Please.If I had any energy I would have already grabbed a knife from the kitchen. As it is this post is taking me forever to write. 

I'm bipolar. But I'm on my meds. I go to work. I'm eating and sleeping. I'm doing what I have to. What I'm supposed to. It doesn't seem to help. 

I really just want to ask my husband to come home. But he can't. And I'm sure he's sick of me by now. 

This all sucks. This all hurts. I know I have a good life. Decently job. Wonderful friends. Wonderful husband. It doesn't seem to matter. All I think about is dying. A hundred times a whisper "she killed herself" to myself. I want it to go away. 

Help. Please.
