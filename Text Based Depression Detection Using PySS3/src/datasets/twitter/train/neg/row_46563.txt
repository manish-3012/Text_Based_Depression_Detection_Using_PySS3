I never thought Iâ€™d be readyMy husband just came home from work, he doesnâ€™t love me anymore. I see it in his face, in his actions, and the way he talks to me. We just got done talking in our bedroom and... He doesnâ€™t love me at all. He wonâ€™t say it but he makes it so, so clear. He can look me in the eyes while I cry and say â€œshut the fuck upâ€ So I know this is finally it. The last person I love has given up on me. 

A peace washed over me when I left the room. I always stopped myself from committing suicide to protect him, so he wouldnâ€™t be in pain over me. He doesnâ€™t care anymore though. I can drive the car straight into the wall going 100+ mph and know that he is at home not caring. Fucking finally I wonâ€™t feel selfish. I wonâ€™t feel bad leading up to it. 

Today is finally my day, no more putting it off. I have no reason to live anymore.
