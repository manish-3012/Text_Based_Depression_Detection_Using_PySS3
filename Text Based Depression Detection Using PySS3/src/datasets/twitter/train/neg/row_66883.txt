I want to end it but I never doIâ€™m 17, Iâ€™m so lonely, all Iâ€™m good at is art. 

I have had bulimia for a year, idc the damage it does to me.

I have self harmed, for about 2 years now, I have over 70 faint scars over my legs, nobody has seen them really.

But nobody knows how much pain Iâ€™m in, I am so so broken and lonely

Idk what to do, I donâ€™t want to be this way, I just want to be happy, please can someone tell me small ways to be happy, or give me some hope, Iâ€™m crying right now. A 17 year old should be having the time of their life. Not wanting to end it
