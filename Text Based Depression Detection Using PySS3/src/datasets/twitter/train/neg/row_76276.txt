I think I'm finally doneI've never really felt comfortable talking to people about my problems or bringing attention to myself but I just wanted to say something to someone about how I feel. I've felt lonely for a long time in a way that isn't satisfied by spending time with friends and family, like I'm on the outside looking in at everyone else, not really a part of anything. I've been dating, and I either don't connect with anyone on a deep level, or the few that I do is only one sided or doesn't seem to last. I can't seem to make any kind of meaningful connections, I don't want to go through this whole life alone but that's the way it seems it's going to go. I'm tired of trying, I'm tired of not trying, and I guess I've just lost all motivation and passion to want to keep doing anything at all anymore, and I can't keep feeling this way all the time. The world can be a beautiful place, I just wish I could have figured out my place in it all.
