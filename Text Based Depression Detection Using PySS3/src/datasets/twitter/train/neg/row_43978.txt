Not sure why I shouldn't kill myself?Trump is president. I am lesbian, a woman, disabled, and shit poor, relying on SSI. Why should I bother? I could wait and see what happens, but I'm not sure what the point would be? Already there is so much hate going on, and trump is gonna get a lot of things passed that will make my life go to shit. I don't want blind hope/optimism, I want logical, intellectual reasoning as to why the hell its worth to stick around while a dictator ruins my life
