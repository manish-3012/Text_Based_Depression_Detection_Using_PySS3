can't stop thinking my deathdw I don't think I'll commit any time soon but I can't get the idea out of my head. I keep on planning different methods, fantasizing about how it would feel, I think about what my lifeless body will look like etc

I'm so sick of not improving over the years, of just suffering. yes good things happen but so do really bad things. if life is like that I don't want to live it. call me weak or pathetic but I didn't ask for this, I didn't want to be born just to be in pain.

I don't really have any hope or goals to look forward to for the future other than dying
