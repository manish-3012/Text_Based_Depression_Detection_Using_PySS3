i think about the benifits of killing myself dailyi spend a couple hours a night thinking about how everyone wants me dead or just wouldnt care either way. im 18 i have Aspergers i was bullied constantly through out high school, i use to get told from multiple people that the world would be better without me, ive never really had a true friend, my ex was the closest person in the world to me she now hates me so much and if i try and talk to her she threatens to call the cops and get a restraining order, she was the first person not to treat me like shit. i have no one left to talk to, i just dont see how i can do the world anygood, i just hurt anyone who gets mistaken into talking to me
