Im just tired of lifeIve reached a point in my life where nothing excites me anymore. I don't look forward to anything. I wake up in the morning only wanting the day to fucking end. I'm just so done with everything.
My parents could not be less supportive of me if they tried. Always calling me a, and I quote, fucking psycho, dramatic bitch, and so on. Always calling me fat, lazy, etc. Being with my friends is kind of even worse, because I'm known as the happy girl. So every fucking day of my fucking life I have to pretend to be happy, and make the extra effort to make everyone laugh and be the goofy girl everyone expects me to be. And I'm done with it. I'm done having no one, literally no one to turn to. I'm done being insulted by the people who are supposed to love me the most, the ones who are supposed to support me. I'm done playing a role I don't want to have. I'm done being sad all.the.fucking.time. I'm tired of everything. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.
