About to do it..I don't want to, but I feel like I have to. I am so tired of failure.

I am stuck at a job I can't stand, Im 30 and never got to college. Still need a GED. I am stuck in a broken down appartment filled with rats. And this is the best it's going to be.

I go back to school now and won't have anything until im 35. I will be almost 40 competing with kids half my age for a first job out of college.

There is no point this gets better. The best I can hope for is less miserable.

I don't know where to go from here.
Im also just afraid to die. 
Im so terrified that I will have failed everyone again. But at least this will be the last time I fail them.
