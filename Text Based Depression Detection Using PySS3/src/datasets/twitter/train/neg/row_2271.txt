I just don't know where to go or what to do anymore.So, I've been unemployed for 8 months now, I can't find a new job, no matter what it seems that I can't get a single fucking job again. I've been struggling with depression for most of my life but I always found a way to deal with it, but today a lot of stuff happened. I had been involved in a situation with my girlfriend that recalled back a lot of childhood memories of sexual abuses I have been through, and today I lost my shit. I dont want to make she sad, or my friends or anything, I just lost all my hope. That is it. I can't do it anymore. I lost it today. My mother and my sister went apeshit crazy because I was crying too loud and they had no idea what was going on. I cant stand making people go through this kind of stuff anymore. I can't stand that I am going through this stuff anymore. My father is a police officer and I know how to handle guns, I just lack a bit of courage to do so. I know suicide wont bring me what I want, because I want relief from those demons that have been haunting me, but I just can't take it anymore. I am so fucking lost... I need help but I don't know what to do, the people I talk it mock the situation somehow, and the ones who dont are the ones I dont want to be worried about me... I just cant do it anymore. I need help.
