helpi have adhd, i know its not good to self diagnose but i know i have it,my family doesnt take me seriously, though. ive looked and i have almost all the symptoms. anyways, i also have anxiety (diagnosed) and im relaly anxious about the next school year

anyways my mom tried to get me diagnosed for adhd because i kept nagging her and i got forms to give to my teachers, i forgot to give most of them to her and she only had one form to take to the doctor and i guess from that one he concluded i didnt have adhd. i confessed that i forgot to give the other forms to her and she said she wont go back to the doctor to get me diagnosed.

i get really bad headaches whenever im faced with too much work for me to focus on and i have one right now and i told my parents i wanted to try grapeseed extract because i read its good for focus and they just yelled at me, they really dont want to help me in any way

my marks were so low last school year and i want to fucking kill myself, people with adhd dont belong on this earth, we cant function in it. i feel like a burden to everybody i know and i just cant do my schoolwork and if i go on living ill probably just be a fucking bum. i dont know what to do. killing myself makes the most sense because honestly im pretty worthless and really cant do anything without getting a fucking migraine

help?
