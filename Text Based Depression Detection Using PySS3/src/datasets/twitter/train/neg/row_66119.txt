Girl got my emotions every whereI've been talking to this girl for a few months and she just brings me on a rollercoaster of emotions. I get so happy when I talk to her but when she doesn't respond in days, I just feel a bit broken inside. I really like this girl and she is always on my mind. I feel like she is toying around with my emotions but I don't know what to do. She is a person that is very flirty and has a lot of guys messaging her. I don't get angry, but I get really sad or just numb. I haven't like anyone in over 3 years and I don't know what to do. She gets upset if I don't respond to her quickly, but she takes forever to respond herself. I don't know her intention. Any advice would help a lot. Thanks for reading.
