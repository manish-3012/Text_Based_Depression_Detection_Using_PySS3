Feeling like I should give up and end it but I have a feeling itâ€™s not the timeIâ€™ve been struggling with depression and suicide for a couple years now I get so tired of living at times that I just wanna die at some points Iâ€™m going through a tough time right now feeling extremely alone and like I have no one to talk to and that no one cares I wanna just end it some days but then I get this feeling like as if itâ€™s not the right time like if I can see my future and how much I can accomplish I think that is a little bit of hope to keep staying alive or maybe itâ€™s just a false hope idk it gets so dark at times and then I just think no not yet I have to do this first almost as if I have to leave my mark on this dreadful earth before I leave it I canâ€™t just die a nobody with no legacy or something if anyone could just let me know Iâ€™m not alone I would appreciate it a  lot
