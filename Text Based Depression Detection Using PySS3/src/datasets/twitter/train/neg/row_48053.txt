sooni've lost all hopes. i've no reason to keep fighting this mental illness. i will let it consume me. i will let pain engulf me until the only option there is is to end it. it will never get better. i've waited for years and years, full of hope that i will have my shot at happiness like everyone else around me. but i was just making things worse. this illness is the perfect punishment for someone as ungrateful as me. either i die, or live the failure that is my life.
