Anyone else just content with being a beta male, and therefore conceding life to those more "worthy".I contacted Gravitas tonight with the hopes of ending my life. In all honesty I feel like I'd be doing humanity a service (more than I've served in my past 5 years as an eligible worker here in the UK). 

I can't truly express my opinion on suicide more than I already have in my e-mail to Gravitas, so Ima just copypasta a piece of what I sent them. 

In all honesty, I have no aspirations, therefore no motivation to endure life, (while others may consider it a gift, I bear it as a burden, and the responsibility laid upon me as a human with a conscious mind is too much to bare. 

As a beta, I consider my contribution to humanity over. I'm a lazy, overweight, asthmatic who simply can't/isn't able to handle the responsibilities that an adult human is due to bear in the 21st century.

As such, I feel that I'm doing humanity a service in offering my life. If I was born 10,000 years ago, I'd have been torn apart by a pack of wolves. 

Survival of the fittest still exists in Humanity, the Human consciousness is simply aware of this and has managed to circumvent it, but doesn't this de-stabilize the future of the species? imho yes. As such, those that are unfit/unsuitable to future the species should offer themselves to the future of society as we know it. 

I'm confident (for once in my life) that I should die in order for humanity to solidify it's future.

EDIT: Missed a word.
