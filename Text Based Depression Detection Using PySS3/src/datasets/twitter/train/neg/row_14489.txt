I want to live my life so fucking badlyHaving bad thoughts and I just want an easy way out but I know I could never do it. I just donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m supposed to live my life when I can barely get out of bed. I feel like I have a terminal illness with no cure I take anti depressants and they donâ€™t do shit. I just want to feel fucking normal for once. I donâ€™t even know why the fuck Iâ€™m making a reddit post I should just go to sleep so I donâ€™t have to think anymore.
