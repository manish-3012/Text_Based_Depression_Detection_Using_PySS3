I really don't care anymore.I feel like my life has been miserable for so long despite any attempt to try to improve it that I quite honestly don't care anymore. I dont want life to get better anymore cuz even at its best it just dosent seem worth all of this effort. Life has lost its beauty for me, what good is a nice panoramic sunny day for me when I havent been able to afford food for most of this year? All my life I've heard "itll get better" and at this point I do not believe that even a little bit its hollow words that people think they have to say. I've put in more effort than anyone I know to end up with the least out of everyone know and im just fucking sick of it. If I'm just gonna be a failure at everything I do for my whole life whats the point of hanging around? I havent had food in my house for 8 months and counting, I am absolutely useless socially, I am not very smart and I have no marketable skills, I have nothing at all going for me and now no desire to fix it. Fuck it. 






I have no plans to kill myself right now but this where I'm at right now.
