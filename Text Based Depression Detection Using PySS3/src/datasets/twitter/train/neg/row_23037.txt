My mother is happy that I did not get helpRecently I was taken by police to the hospital after I called suicide hotline for intervention. They made me book an appointment with a psychiatrist and charged me for the emergency fees. For the past two weeks my mother has been nagging me to tell the psychiatrist that everything is okay and that I don't need help, otherwise they will charge a fortune and never leave me alone. She even tried to get me to admit I called the hotline as a prank. 

I went to see the psychiatrist and I could not bring myself to tell the truth. I told her everything was okay and that I was just having a bad night when I called. This is not true, I have been actively suicidal for the past year. But I couldn't say it. I couldn't even look her in the eye.

I was assessed to be of low risk so I was sent home without need for meds or another appointment. I came home and my mother asked me what happened. I told her and she was very happy with the fact that I did not tell them the truth. She is more concerned with the money, with the phone calls, with the health records. She does not care if I am feeling this way, she just wants to pretend everything is okay. But it's not.
