New to this and trying to reach outOK so to start I'm fairly drunk but I've been dealing with this for a long time. Unhappiness feels like home and I don't know how to get out of it. Recently I've lost my home, my friendships and relationship. I'm trying to start fresh but my "friends" have taken a side without getting the full story so my support network has dissolved. (That includes where I lived) which had people that "understood" but have now ceased to talk to me. The only person than "seems" to understand is my ex which was an absolute abusive relationship that for the past 3 years has been built on lies and abuse (which she apparently didn't see depiste me bringing it up only to me be met with harsh words and snaps). I understand that I may have been difficult to deal with but I feel and now know that I have been emotionally bullied into my current state which considering I have been dealing with since pre teen years is a fucking black hole of emotions. Too many thoughts to properly put into words but I'm at a loss and for the longest time I've wanted to end it  but felt too much guilt to actually follow through which just makes me feel more guilty and a coward. I dunno what I really trying to say right now I'm just trying to reach out. I know I'm not alone but it doesn't ease the pain I'm feeling and have been feeling for so long. I guess I'm just grabbing grass as I go over the edge again but grass doesn't grow enough to keep stopping me and as I reach my 30's and I have always been an atheist and I keep wandering what is the point? The only thing tying me to this world at the moment is the guilt I'll leave my mum and dad and like I said it's been a long time and that's wearing thin. Im not looking for an easy way out cause I know what that is but I'm looking for something to help.
