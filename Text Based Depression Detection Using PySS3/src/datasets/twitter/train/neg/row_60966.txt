This community has failed meIâ€™ve posted on /r/suicidewatch in the past with various throwaway accounts. At this point Iâ€™m running of excuses for why I shouldnâ€™t kill myself. Iâ€™ve received countless messages from kind hearted people here telling me things like â€œit gets better, I promiseâ€ and â€œyou just need to pick up some hobbies.â€

Guess what? None of that fucking helps. Iâ€™m sorry, but no amount of exercise, motivational quotes, or talking to strangers on the internet is going to fix my life. Iâ€™ve been looking for a job for 8+ months and am running out of excuses for not ending my life today. Things just arenâ€™t working out â€” the only thing that could make things better is them working out.

I donâ€™t know what I expected out of this community, perhaps Iâ€™m searching for something that simply doesnâ€™t exist. Iâ€™m sorry for the rant, I just donâ€™t know what else to do.
