It doesn't really get better does itSince all I can think about right now is chugging down a bottle of pills and letting things take over from there, I tried going to sleep. 

My fucking family, after me telling them twice that I'm trying to sleep and I need it them to talk below a fucking yelling volume of speaking, visibly sobbing while I'm doing it, still ARE FUCKING YELLING RIGHT OUTSIDE MY ROOM. I ALMOST FELL ASLEEP, ESCAPING FROM THE CONSTANT PAIN THAT IS COMING FROM ME BEING CONSCIOUS RIGHT NOW. THEN MY SISTER COMES HOME AND MY MOM AND HER HAVE TO START SCREECHING ABOUT THE MOVIE SHE JUST SAW. 

I honestly sound like an irrational asshole right now, but I feel like using your inside voice while you ignore your family member having a mental breakdown in their bed isn't so hard to manage. 

The only real reason at this point I haven't just ended it after being woken up is that I really don't want to go that way. When I die, I want my body to disappear with me. I really want to be GONE. Nobody really cared for me in life so fuck off with trying to mourn me in death. I don't even want there to be solid proof I died. I don't want that kind of closure. Nobody let me have any say in my life so at least let me have control over my death right?

It's kinda sad to think at this point the only reason I haven't ended it is that I'm waiting for the right opportunity to kill myself. 

I probably won't hold out for much longer though. The idea that all of this could be over in an instant seems too good to be true. That's what I'm really afraid of. Nothing ever goes right in my life so why should I think death would be any different.

Maybe random chance will put me out of my misery. I could luck out and have a piano fall on my head or something. You never know. 

I'm just tried. I just want to sleep now but I apparently don't even get that luxury.
