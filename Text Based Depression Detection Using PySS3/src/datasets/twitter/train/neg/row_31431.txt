I think tomorrow night is the night.Unless an actual miracle happens I think I will end this. I asked for help to make my life better like 2 weeks ago. I was actually going to take some baby steps on fixing things and hanging in there. Then I hit another pretty huge set back before I even got started. It will never get better for me barring something amazing happening. It is okay though. I am not crying or anything. I am clear minded and collected.
