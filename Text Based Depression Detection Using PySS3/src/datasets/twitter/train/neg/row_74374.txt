Why carry on if I can't even afford to live?It's all my own fault for being selfish and wanting to do a Masters degree. I barely have enough time to work on my Masters because I have to work four shifts a week in a minimum-eage job to pay my house and bills and still barely have Â£10 a week leftover for food and other necessities. And now my shifts are being cut down to two shifts a week. I'll have more time to work on my Masters degree but I won't even be able to afford bus fare to go to class or the library, or even food. I'm even at the point of selling my own things to get money that I need.  I can't afford to live so why bother?

Even if I drop out of my Masters now and start full-time work to support myself I'm still going to want to die because I'll be heartbroken to have given up my dreams and also everyone will be disappointed in me for dropping out. I don't see any point in carrying on. I'm exhausted.
