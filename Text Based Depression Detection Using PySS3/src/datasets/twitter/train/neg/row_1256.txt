I don't really care if it would get better or not. I don't like living and I just want to die.Life is so fucking pointless its not even funny anymore. I can have these "good" days where I feel nothing but being neutral or have these bad days where all I can think of is how lonely I am and how much of a piece of shit I actually am but never anything else. Once in a blue moon I'll have these amazing days where I'm genuinely happy but I know for a fact that that will mean that the next day, or the day after that I'll feel like fucking shit again.

It doesn't matter if I'm dead or not. The people around me probably wouldn't really notice or at least get used to me not being there within a matter of days. It's not like I have friends to hang out with. A few I text with but I'm pretty sure that they wouldn't really care if I just stopped responding. Its pointless. I'm only here so I won't hurt my parents. There's nothing left to live for.

The only thing really keeping me from killing myself is the idea of my parents hearing about my suicide. To be honest it kinda sucks. I just wish I could just leave without saying a word and not feel guilty about it. My life has just turned into a waiting game untill I'm either old enough to kill myself without having that much of an impact on my parents or untill they're both dead or don't recognize me.
