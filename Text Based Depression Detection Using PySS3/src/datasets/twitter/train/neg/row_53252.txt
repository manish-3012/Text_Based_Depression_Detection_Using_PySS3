Why does everyone say it gets better?Just asking tbh. I've felt extremely suicidal plenty of times in the past, never actually had the balls to do it though. Everyone says "it gets better", but does it really? Year after year after year I feel this way and not once does it get better. A few months ago things were starting to look up for me but just like every year it got taken away from me. So I'd like to ask, when does it get better?
