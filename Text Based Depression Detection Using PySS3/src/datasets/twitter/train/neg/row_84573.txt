I've been wanting to die lately, but I won't do it.I just want a place to freely post how I'm feeling lately. No need to respond or anything. 

I've been feeling really depressed and having suicidal thoughts for awhile now. I keep thinking of ways that would be the least painful, but death would hurt no matter what. I've even thought about ways I would want to say my last farewells to everyone or secretly cry out for help for someone to notice and ask how I'm doing. I don't tell anyone I feel because I don't want to feel like I'm being a burden to them. I don't want to seek help either out of fear of being told something is wrong with me, I don't want to be diagnosed. Everything to me these days I feel is useless to do and doesn't matter. Watching my favorite TV shows or youtubers are the only things that make me feel like my usual self. Although I don't really know what my usual self is anymore. Life only seems worth living because of my cat and wanting to know what happens in my TV shows. Is that good enough reason to go through life still. I don't know, but it'll have to do. There's more I want to write, but I'll end it here. If you read this post, thanks for caring.
