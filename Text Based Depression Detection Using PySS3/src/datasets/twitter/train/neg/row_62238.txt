Why does everyone lie to me?I've been lied to my entire life. By my family, my "friends", everyone I've ever genuinely believed. They all say that I'm special and smart and funny but I've never looked in the mirror and thought that was true. All I see when I look in the mirror is an ugly, braindead, depressed maniac who can't control anything in his life. And it sucks to know I've never had anyone tell me the truth about that. I wish I could just say fuck them all and live my life but I don't even know if I've ever made a good decision for myself. I abuse my body and my mind every day and I'm so sick of it. I don't feel like anything is worth it anymore because I know I'll just fuck up everything I touch somehow. So if I can't help but sabotage myself constantly, and nobody really cares enough about me to tell me the truth, what's the harm in ending it all?
