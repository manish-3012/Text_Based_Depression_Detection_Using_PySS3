I have totally messed up my life and there really is no light at the end of the tunnel.Pretty self-explanatory. Iâ€™ve fucked up my life. Any friendship Iâ€™ve ever had has been ruined by anxiety, chronic depression and serious self-esteem issues. My relationship with my family is gone far beyond the point of repair. I have zero interest or passion for anything. Iâ€™m a college dropout with no future. Iâ€™m unemployed and the best job I can get is dead-end. 

I really wish things werenâ€™t like this. I just want to be happy and go back to the way things were. But over the last 8 years Iâ€™ve just gradually been getting worse and at this point I donâ€™t see any hope of recovery. Itâ€™s all just a huge fucking mess that I created. Iâ€™m a burden to everyone in my life and I just spread misery like a fucking disease. I want to get better but it just isnâ€™t going to happen. Itâ€™s too far gone. 

Day by day I get closer to just ending it all. I didnâ€™t ask for this shit. My life is just one dilemma after another. I just want to mend all the problems Iâ€™ve created but Iâ€™m just incapable. Iâ€™m going fucking insane. God I just want it all to fucking end. 

Iâ€™m going down to the harbor tonight and throwing myself in. Fuck it, I offer nothing but misery to the world.
