Is that all?Im 16, for the average american thats not even 20% of what I am expected to live, I feel the most miserable ive ever felt.
A year ago I had a lot of suicidal thoughts, at that time I even wrote a 10 page text talking about a lot of stuff, it was good, i liked writing, i liked something, now i just dont. Friends are ppl that are interested in what I have, my girl is just rotten flesh that I use for sexual purposes, gaming is nothing else but a distraction for my miserability
Is that all I have for life? Is it all just the "get good grades, go to college get a job, build a family" and then what?

I dont think my existence does anything but bad, I am an issue in my family that my parents are tired to be the ones responsible for handling.
I dont want this shit anymore, but I dont wanna die and make my parents think they did a bad job, or they werent good enough...
