I was planning to do it today, for real this timeBut I haven't, even though I feel trapped and desperate. I really was going to finally sneak my .380 out to the woods. I thought about it all day at work, where I can't win no matter what I do.

But then I came home, and saw my husband and our friends (who are currently living in the driveway) working on the greenhouse I've wanted for so long. They're trying to get it done before my parents arrive tomorrow. I keep telling them that they don't have to, it's OK, you can stop. But they're still working on it even right now.

And then my sister responded to my many ranty texts.

I can't do it, not today. Not to my sister. And even though I think my husband is really frustrated with me, I can't do it to him either. I guess just not today.
