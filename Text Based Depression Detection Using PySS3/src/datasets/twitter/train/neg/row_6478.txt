HiI dont know if this is what I think it is. I'm not gonna kill myself at least I dont think I will. I'm so uncertain whether I will or will not. I'm not sure what to expect from this post I dont think I really care. The thoughts of taking my own life haunts me and it's a beautiful day to die. I've attempted the taking of my own life once by taking a handful of sleep aid medications 17 to be exact yet I couldn't even do that right. My world is always breaking and reality only gets heavier. I've loved and lost time and time again damn the fool who believed it's better to have loved than not at all. I dont think I will kill myself because the thought of not being in the same plane of existence as her cuts deeper than the knife that screams at me. I've reached out to friends and all too busy despite how hard it was for me to try. I'm scared to go to family less I look a fool and cry before them and I'll never go back to the hospital because it's easier to die than commit financial suicide. I loved you all
