Feeling depressedI've had a rocky relationship with an ex, and I just feel as if she hates me. I always bother her and multiple times we tried to be friends or even restart things. I love her deeply, and I consider her to be the best friend I've ever had above with everything else.

But I keep ruining things again and again. I worry and get upset and that annoys her and she starts avoiding and ignoring me. Earlier tonight I blocked her on Facebook so I wouldn't bother her anymore and stop making things worse. She's probably not going to notice for a while

I've struggled with depression for al ong time, and this along with other recent events are just too much for me, and I want to kill myself tomorrow
