Tell me suicide isn't the answer.You can't. Plain and simple. 

Life is worthless. We all die, every single one of us. What's the point of prolonging the inevitable? What the hell does it matter if I die now or 50 years from now? 

Some of you might say, "what about how your loved ones would feel if you killed yourself"? Well I'll tell you this. Nobody really cares about anybody else but themselves. This isn't coming from a place of angst but of truth. Human beings only understand the self. It's all we know as long as we aren't 100% certain that the self is all that exists. 

Put simply, my parents would only be upset because of how they would feel, not because of any arbitrary love for me. 

Even more simply, love is not real, it is only a chemical reaction in our brains. On top of this, every single thing we do in life is just to get a rush of dopamine. There is literally nothing else. 

Some of you will throw some "feel good" bullshit at me. Go ahead. Try and convince me life is worth living.
