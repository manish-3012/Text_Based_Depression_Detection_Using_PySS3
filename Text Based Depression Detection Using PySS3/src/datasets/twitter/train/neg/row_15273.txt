Just tired.Throwaway as per usual, I guess. I've been thinking about killing myself for the past three years. I've been seriously thinking about it for the last few months. I feel like I might do it soon. I don't even know why I'm writing this (as per usual). I'm so lonely and I just feel like there's nothing left here for me. I've been holding out for so long, but it never seems to get better. By this point I'm more afraid of waking up tomorrow than I am of dying.
