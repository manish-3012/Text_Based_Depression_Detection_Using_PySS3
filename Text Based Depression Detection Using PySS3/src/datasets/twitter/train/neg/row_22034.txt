It is so hard to keep goingI feel so selfish when I think of ending my life but I also feel as if itâ€™s the most selfless thing I can do. No longer will I be a burden to my family. I barely have any friends. I feel like every day Iâ€™m grasping at straws trying to find reasons to keep going but every day there are less and less reasons.
