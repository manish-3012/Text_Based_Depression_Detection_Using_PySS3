Intrusive thoughts oh boyrecently it feels like... i have to distract myself all the time or else these negative feelings catch up to me and flood my brain and tell me everything sucks and that i should die. i get close to writing my suicide note and just leaving everything behind

it started a few days ago, when i found out someone who i thought i was on good terms with was actually talking shit about me behind my back... and im not over how hurt i feel. i feel like i should be, but im not.

but more importantly than that, im alarmed at how strongly i feel the need to escape, but how guilty i feel that i want to do that. i dont want my friends and family to be sad. i dont want my cats to think i abandoned them. my life insurance is too low. my housemates would have to move. that guilt is the only thing thats really making me stop and think before i go through with anything

i havent told anybody about my thoughts because i dont want to worry them. i set up a therapy appointment but it's not until next week. ive been to a psych ward a few years ago and i dont ever ever want to go again.

i just dont know what to do but i need to tell somebody
