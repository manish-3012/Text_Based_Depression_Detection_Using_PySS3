It's timePlan: First ~500mg of good old Methylone to calm me down, make me fearless and get in the mood to just do it. Then 8x40mg Methadone (by far enough to kill a slightly underweight 21 y/o. I think about ~20mg is the lethal dose for an opiate naive adult) and hopefully the process will be quick! 

I set an SMS to be sent to a relative in 24 hours in the future to have him call an ambulance to pick up the body. 

Been planning this for many months now, just proud that I've built up the courage to finally do it! 

Bye!
