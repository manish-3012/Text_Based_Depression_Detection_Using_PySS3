I hate being alive.I'm a freshman in college and I'm bored out of my mind. I just hate it here. All my friends are boring. There's nothing I want to study or major in. There's nothing I can see myself doing with my life. For about two years I've been feeling this way and I've been looking forwards to college as a way out but it's not a way out. I've never been in a relationship or even kissed anyone and I'm starting to realize I never will. I feel really alone I know It's cliche or whatever but I really do. The only people I feel close to are my parents. Everyday I wake up I remember how much life sucks. I hate my homework. I hate the fact that I worked so fucking hard in high school to get into this "prestigious" school. It was the biggest waste of time. Everyone here just wants to do their work and get good grades and get a job and then work and die and it just sounds so boring I want to puke. I just have nothing to look forwards to.
