Is there a point to anything?I am highly disgusted by mediocrity and i have come to realization that i am just mediocre. I am nothing and I can never be who I want to be. My skin has been breaking out like crazy, i have gained 10 lbs and I am JUST DONE. i have no motivation. I come home and just hide under my blanket everyday. I don't do school work, exercise or even search for a job like I should be. I am just DONE. I don't want to do this anymore. My parents are crazy af, I have no true friends and I just feel alone. I have problems with getting close to people. Even if people approach me, I just think what's the point? We're all going to die. Why should I go through the physical and mental struggles of life, when we are all going to die someday anyway? Why is life worth living? Why?
