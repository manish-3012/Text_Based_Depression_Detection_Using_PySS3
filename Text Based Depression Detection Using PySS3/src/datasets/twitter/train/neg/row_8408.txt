can't get outfiance left me for much older man abt 8 months ago. it still hurts just as bad as it did that morning. coming close to flunking out of a school that I can't afford anyway. my family has never been close to or supportive of me. living with type 1 diabetes and barely getting by. i wake up every morning and my first thought is that this is gonna be the day I die. i don't talk to anyone anymore, haven't heard from close friends in months and months, can't seem to engage with anyone or anything. can't run away from all the hell in my life. idk man im just pressed. this has been more of a rambling than a coherent thought and i apologize
