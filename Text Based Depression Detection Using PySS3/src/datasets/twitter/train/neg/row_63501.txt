Effective altruism plus an existential crisis backed up by powerful apathyI think my organs would be best used by people who actually want to live.

I'm not depressed. I'm not doing poorly in life. I have no dependents and no will to live. I've felt like this for years and my friends and family can do fine without me. I'm looking into the best way to donate my body during this existential crisis that has lasted a decade. What possible reason should I not?
