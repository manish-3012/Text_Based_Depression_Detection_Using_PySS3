feel completely alone all the time. very consuming.Here it goes. I used to have a social circle and after I graduated from college slowly everyone began to drift away and settles into different stages of life. It was a gradual process but I went from having a group of people who I loved to having absolutely no one. It's been about three years and I haven't made a single new friend. It is so hard. I am lonely all the time, consistently, and have no one. My depression has gotten very bad since I lost a support system of people and I feel like it is nearing the end for me. I always pictured myself as one of those girls who was married by 30, and had a stable job and a quiet life but I am nearing 30 and nothing is like that at all. I wish I could have a nice little job, a stable life, and a boyfriend. Nothing really worked out as I thought it would, and the future is so horrifying to me because I imagine it will be more of the same as what I'm experiencing.
