I donâ€™t want to liveIâ€™m a 17 year old female and Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was 10. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized for a suicide attempt before, and Iâ€™m addicted to self harming.  My last suicide attempt was in January and I hung myself but unfortunately I survived. I see a therapist and psychiatrist but nothing seems to get better. I was molested as a child for a couple of years by my brother, sexually assaulted for a year by someone who claimed to be a friend, and I was raped in January by someone I liked. I was also beat up as a kid not only by peers but also my family.  Iâ€™m diagnosed bipolar with ptsd and anxiety, before my bipolar diagnosis I had major depressive disorder. I also have schizophrenic tendencies.My therapist suspects I have body dysmorphia as well. Iâ€™m rapidly losing friends and constantly getting in arguments with family.  I feel like I have nothing to live for. The happiest Iâ€™ve been was actually in an emotionally abusive relationship that I kept up with for over a year. Iâ€™m still not over him unfortunately. I just donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m still here. Iâ€™ve come so close to death. So many people dismiss me because I get good grades and my life on the outside seems great because I appear so happy. Sometimes I want to die just so I can make others feel bad for putting me down. I wish I wasnâ€™t here anymore. Life never seems to get any better, Iâ€™m always under constant pain
