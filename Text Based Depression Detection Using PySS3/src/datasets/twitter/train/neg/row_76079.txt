Sorry I'm just venting to myselfI wish people could see inside my head so they know how I feel / what I go through. It may not be anything compared to others and I know i have it very easy in life. But I don't know man, I just can't do this much longer. I don't feel depressed, sad or anything. I just feel empty of life, nothing matters to me anymore. I can't express my emotions to anyone in person, so that's why I post on here. I don't talk to anyone, I'm always by myself and talking to myself. I just feel so different compared to others. I just feel bad for my family and little sister. I can see the disappointment in my family's eyes. I really can't do this much longer, I just can't man. It's killing me inside
