I don't know what to doI'm not sure how to word this because this is one of my first reddit posts but oh well

I'm 15 and i feel like i have no future, everything seems to just make me sadder and i don't know if i want to commit suicide or not. I live my life just for the purpose of existing i haven't ended it yet because i don't want to hurt anyone around me or make anyone feel my mom feel as sad as i do. my life feels worthless.

Edit : Also in the closet Gay
