Thanks for the loveShared a pretty shitty thing that happened today and a horrific thing that happened when I was 8 and expected to be ignored, but damn!you guys made me feel so much better about myself and my situation.  Some of you took time out of your day to message a stranger in a rough patch and honestly not many people in my actual life listened to me but you guys did and that meant the world to meâ™¡ thanks for listening and talking me through a really shitty discovery/day Reddit fam â™¡
