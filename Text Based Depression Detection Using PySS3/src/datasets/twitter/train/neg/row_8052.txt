Got a gun to my headHere is why: 

**INTRODUCTION:** So I recently have caught feelings for a coworker. I haven't interacted personally with her all too much because whenever we do communicate its always about work-related things. I'm having issues starting a dialogue with her along with many other personal issues that all relate to me liking this girl.

**BACKSTORY:** My background with women is not good at all. I'm 18 and I've never been in a relationship before. While I'm not necessarily shy, I am not the type of person who puts themselves out there for the world to see. I keep to myself most of the time but I like to be around my friends and socialize with them. The issues start to arise when it comes to the opposite sex. It should also be noted that I consider myself highly psychologically sensitive. In the past, I have tried to talk to girls and I have even asked girls out in the past. Unfortunately, I was rejected by every single one of them. I also remember when I was a young child I had a cringy "relationship" with a girl and I was constantly teased and made fun of by my family because of it. This same thing happened when I told my parents that I liked a girl when I was in Middle School. Both being constantly rejected and that experience as a young child has made a major psychological impact on me. I grew up under the impression that dating was wrong and that it is something that you should tease people about. This impression still shapes the way that I feel about dating today. Me bring constantly rejected in the past has enhanced my fear of women and relationships to astronomical levels. Some nervousness is normal, however, my nerves take it to a whole new level. I will get into more detail on these nerves further down in the post.

**FEARS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE:** One thing that I fear most about me being in a relationship with someone is how will others think about me and her as a couple? Especially with this girl what will everyone at work think? Will I be subject to teasing about it? How will everyone at work treat me? If we break up, will work become a hostile environment for me to be at? It should be noted that I work in a good work environment. Everyone gets along and we all like to joke around with each other. Most of these questions also apply to my family as well. Since the teased me in the past, will they tease me again? How will my relationship with my parents and my sister change because of my relationship with this girl?

**FEARS ABOUT COMMUNICATING WITH HER:** This and the fear about other people are tied when it comes to my biggest fear when it comes to a potential relationship with this girl. I am deathly afraid of the repercussions of following her on Instagram and adding her on Snapchat let alone speaking to her. These repercussions I speak of are tied to my fears about other people, especially my coworkers. Who knows if she suspects something and starts telling people at work about her suspicions? But I know that if I don't follow her on social media then I won't find out any more information about her such as if she has a boyfriend already or any information about her interests. I overcame a little bit of this fear by requesting to follow her on Instagram but I don't think she has notifications on because she hasn't accepted my follow request and her number of followers haven't increased in a while.

**CONFIDENCE:** I also have some serious confidence issues. I don't think I'm attractive on the outside but I have strong confidence about my inside. I'm the type of person that needs someone to enable me to have confidence and sadly I haven't had anyone to give me such confidence. In fact, I feel like I'm being judged about my looks wherever I go. Whether that be about my minor but noticeable space between my two front teeth, my minor acne, or my stocky build.

**DEPRESSION:** As of right now, I am suffering from severe depression both from this issue regarding the girl I like and my past. I am fearful that if I do pursue this girl, history will repeat itself and I will get rejected once again. I am starting to lose all hope in myself regarding this subject.

**CONCLUSION:** I sincerely thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story and offering any help that you can give to me. I don't have anyone else in my life who I can go to about these things due to my fears that I mentioned above.

Once again, thank you all so much for reading, and please if you have any ideas comment below.

Also, please note that I have sought out professional help with these issues over the years but the therapy has been unsuccessful. I'm open to any other ideas you may have though.

UPDATE: I requested to follow her on Instagram but she denied it. I'm skeptical about this because I'm not sure about the exact reason. One possibility is that she doesn't know me all to well and she just denied it. The other possibility is that she just doesn't like me or something. Which doesn't make sense because I haven't worked in the same department as her since last year and we don't talk very much as it is. I'm just wondering if I should just give up at this point or keep trying. This situation is seriously making me very depressed and making me contemplate suicide.
