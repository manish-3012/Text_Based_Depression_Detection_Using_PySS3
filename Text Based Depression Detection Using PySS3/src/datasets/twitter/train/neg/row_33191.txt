Are there any other suicide websites you know of?So there is suicide watch, and a website which discusses methods of suicide. Those are the only two forums I know of. Are there any other places you know? I don't find this subreddit particularly useful, there are lots of comments about how someone will soon take their own life, which is really important to acknowledge, but I don't know definitely yet whether I will decide to end my life.

I feel quite isolated and have told no one about my thoughts. I'm looking for a place to discuss more long term issues, where people may decide to end their life in the next year, or conditional on something happening (my situation). Thanks.
