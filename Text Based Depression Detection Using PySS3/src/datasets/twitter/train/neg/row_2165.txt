coping helphi everyone, i'm sorry for posting at such a late hour, but i really, really need help. i've been feeling increasingly suicidal after a couple of failed attempts, and would like to know of any personally helpful coping mechanisms. i want help, but i've entirely lost my support network. i have no close friends to talk to anymore, and i would destroy my family by telling them about any of this. i've tried most of the mechanisms posted on the SWresources sub, as well as elsewhere, but nothing has really helped. the only thing i have left is music which, as much as i love, is becoming less and less effective in preventing me from attempting again. i'm sorry to burden anyone who reads this with the horror of myself and how pathetic this shit is, i just really need help
