I lost one of my closest friends on Sunday and didn't know until today.She was like a sister to me, and she killed herself. I knew she was depressed, and I suspected she was in over her head... But she didn't call me when she had the urge, like she said she would. She told me she would. Why the fuck didn't she call me?
