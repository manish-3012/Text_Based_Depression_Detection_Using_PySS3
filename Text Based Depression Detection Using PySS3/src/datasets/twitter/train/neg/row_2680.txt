Permanently miserable. Every attempt to break it has failed. I'm stuck in a place that I can't get out of.I'm not ashamed that I want to die. It's the easiest solution. 

I had to leave university because of my illness and I can't return. I loved studying, now I'm left without it I don't know where to go.

I had to sell most of my guitars and amps to eat. I can't gig, audition, jam properly anymore. 

I can't hold down even the shittiest, lowest-paying, bottom of the barrel job because I can't afford private treatment, government help is a long line of waiting lists away and my mood is never, ever stable.

I push my friends away during my mania and retreat from them during my depression. They're not therapists or doctors, they don't deserve to put up with my bullshit.

My family looks at me like a filthy layabout without a job, leeching off of society. 

Not only am I left without my instruments (bar one guitar, my oldest, I could never sell her) but my family guilt me into selling my other possessions. I get bullied into believing that I don't deserve to have them whilst claiming government support, that I should sell them first before using taxpayer money. 

My life is being destroyed piece by piece. 2 years ago I was studying full time, I was gigging weekly, I was respected by my family and despite my illnesses I was enjoying life. 

Today I'm tired. I know that even if I get a job I'll be tired. I'll be relegated to the next in line to the throne that's held by the desperately working woman, slaving away before returning to her castle too tired to live but too poor to even try. 

I want to hold out. I want to cling to hope, but it gets harder. Every week is harder than the last. Eventually I'll snap. No one deserves this. 

I'm pretty tired. Sleeping relieves the physical pains, but the mental pains never go. 

I don't have anything anymore and I'm losing hope.
