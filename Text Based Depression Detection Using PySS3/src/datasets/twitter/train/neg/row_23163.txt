Lost my job and my apartmentI got fired from my job last week and I was desperately trying to remain positive, applying for new jobs and going to interviews. I thought I had a job lined up but I just got a phone call saying they called one of my references and they no longer want to offer me the job. I'm beyond devastated. 

I also had an apartment that I was going to move into in 2 weeks, but since I lost my job they gave it to someone else. I don't know how I'm going to survive the next month. I was trying to avoid falling into a deep depression again but I can already feel myself slipping. I want so desperately to just jump off of a bridge and end everything. I don't have health insurance anymore so I can't even get help.
