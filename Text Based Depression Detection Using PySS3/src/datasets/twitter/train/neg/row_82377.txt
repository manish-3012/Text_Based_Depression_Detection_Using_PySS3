The HoleLife is...whimsical. Here today, and gone tomorrow. Life is a hateful, vicious, tormenting hurricane of emotional hell wrapped inside a test performed by fucking Nazis.

 I like to think of life as a cruel, wicked joke played on us, the failed experiment called humanity, by a higher power, what you would call God. And you know what the punchline to this joke is? You know what makes it really, really funny? 

Death.

Just something that I've had rattling around my head.
