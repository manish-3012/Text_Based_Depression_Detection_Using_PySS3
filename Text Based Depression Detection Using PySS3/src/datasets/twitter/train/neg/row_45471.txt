Why not?This life is beautiful. Everything is so perfectly interconnected, on levels as small as atoms, and as large as worlds. We ascribe meaning to life. I want, I do, I feel, I live, laugh, love. 


For everything that begins, so too must it end. There is no universal constant for ethics. Everything we do, say, think or feel simply IS, with no singular happening being of any greater or lesser importance than anything else. We are all the same, in that we are all chaotically different. Life is, was, and will be a perfect reflection of what we choose to do with it. The meaning is up for interpretation, and no idea holds superiority over any other. It is all, gracefully and infinitely, beautiful. It is absolutely astounding, 


And yet, it is sad. To be given the awareness of self, and to be withheld the rationality to understand it completely. It is inherently unfair, our existance. We can never know -will never know- why we are here. Rather, the answer will never be accepted, as something so exaggerated and magnificent as life cannot be here simply â€just because.â€ But that's just it, just because. It makes one wonder. The tumult, chaos, beauty, sadness of life is irrational by nature. It cannot be understood or reasoned. The only thing that can be reasoned completely, is absolute nothingness.


To not exist; to simply check out, and recede to the darkness from whence we came. To be granted infinite nothingness, and witheld the consciousness necessary to bemoan it. THAT, is real. That is something that can be counted upon. The beautiful last exhale of life, and the warm embrace of nothingness; just that, is as beautiful as anything we are given currently. 


It does make one consider. Life, death, morality and pain; all wiped and forgotten, at the moment of nonexistence. It truly is beautiful. The only real question left to death is: why not?
