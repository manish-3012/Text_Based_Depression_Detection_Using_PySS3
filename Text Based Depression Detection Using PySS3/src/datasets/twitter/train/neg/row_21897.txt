Severe neurological pain - nowhere left to go.I have severe nerve pain from surviving a car wreck in 2016. I have lived in nothing but constant pain since then. I have seen specialist after specialist and doctor after doctor. I take like 10 pills a day. Iâ€™ve tried at least a dozen different medications. I canâ€™t do it anymore. What worth do I have here in this current state of existence? I canâ€™t be happy. I have nothing.
