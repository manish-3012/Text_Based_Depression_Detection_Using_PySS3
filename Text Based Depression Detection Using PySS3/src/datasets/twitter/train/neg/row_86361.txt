I did everything I was supposed to to get help, and nothing helped.I've tried 5 different anti depressants, a year of therapy. I have attempted suicide and told the doctor and the crisis team about this. I tried to get CBT therapy but they said they don't work with actively suicidal people and the waiting list was 6 months anyway.

What the hell am I supposed to do? I don't even want to die I just don't want to be so miserable. I can't even get out of bed and it's 1pm. Will attempt hanging again today. The NHS doesn't help at all.
