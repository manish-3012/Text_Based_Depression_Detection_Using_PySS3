I'm just lying in wait aloneLying in wait for a day where I finally say "Fuck it all and end my life"

Lying in wait for a day where the suffering I'm going through becomes too much and I have to die

Lying in wait for the trigger to be pulled for me, I'm such a screwup and a lazy bastard I'd mess it up or delay it over and over again

Lying in wait for someone to find my body, I wonder what they would say, would they cry? Would they scream? I'll never know

Lying in wait for my soul to disappear forever. Maybe Heaven and Hell do exist, if they do then the latter is definitely my destination, and if they don't then eternal rest that I desire will be upon me

Lying in wait...for the end.

I am alone. My friends and family are just a variable to me, they won't stop me and I don't care what they think, I trust strangers on the internet more than them with information on how I feel, buy regardless it doesn't make a difference because I'm still alone in this shithole of a world.

Reminds me of a song

"One fine day Gonna leave you all behind It wouldn't be so bad If I had more time 

Sailing down a river alone I've been trying to find My way back home But I don't believe in magic Life is automatic But I don't mind being on my own No, I don't mind being on my own"

Nonexistence before birth was my home and I'll be coming home when I leave here. I don't believe in magic because that desire to live, that desire to become the best, that desire to be happy, it doesn't live within me. Life is automatic because I have no control over it and this escape is the one absolute choice I have and it can't be taken away, I won't let it.

And I really don't mind being on my own. I'm fine with it. Loneliness is not as bad as people make it out to be, in a sense I feel kind of...free.
