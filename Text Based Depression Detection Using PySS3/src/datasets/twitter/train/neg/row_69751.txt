Back here... Again.So I'm wanting to die. Actually that's not right I want to not exist. I want every trace of me removed from reality. I knew I was going to spiral tonight, but I didn't want to bother the person I know that could have helped me. I hope she's sleeping well tonight. We are both very suicidal. Recently I've been strong armed out of my apartment because I'm trans. No it's not in my head. I already hate being in a place alone and now I know I'm not wanted here so my self hate spiral begins the moment I point my car towards this apartment. The only redeeming quality is my cats are here. Thursday was the last time I was here and that night I wrote an email to my therapist who is basically out of ideas on how to help me. I started to email her again tonight but she's already worried about me. Then, I thought about going to my friend's house where I'm always welcome even if it is 3:30am I have a key and an open invitation. I decided not to though because I've been there since Thursday and thought I should give her break from me. So I ended up here and alone with my cats wanting to just not exist.
