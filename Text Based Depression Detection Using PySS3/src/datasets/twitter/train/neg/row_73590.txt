Seriously close to ending it.English is not my first language, please bear with me i need help.

2 years ago I started feeling that Iâ€™d rather be dead, but im open to options because u never know where life takes you.

But for the last 6 months Iâ€™ve had actual thought and fantasies about killing myself. Thou Every time i stop myself and think about or do something else. 

But every time i think about killing myself it gets increasingly more serious and more planed. 

Today Iâ€™ve been the closest, and still am. 
Donâ€™t know what to do. I feel like im new to this and suicidal people take a long time before killing them self. And it took me almost no time.
Is it normal to be this fast about killing urself?
