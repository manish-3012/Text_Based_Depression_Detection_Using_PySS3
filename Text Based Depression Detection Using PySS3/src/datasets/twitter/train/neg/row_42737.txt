I am thinking about killing myself.I can not live like this. My mind is completely screwed up for life dealing with the people around me. Multiple people with personality disorders. Regular people will not accept me in the state that I am in. Wish I could have had at least a sane person in my life, but this burden should not be plaved on anyone else.

I need to do this so I can have peace for once in my life without judgement, hatred, depression and ptsd. I believe there is nothing wrong with taking your life if there are no options you can see. Right now I am nothing more than a broken male with nothing to live for other than taking up resources.

My life is pretty much over. Can someobe guide me to a place to find a decent way to off myself? Honestly, I tried changing...I really did.   Things have only spiraled out of control when I tried to fix myself. I just want to opt out. Please help me with my request.
