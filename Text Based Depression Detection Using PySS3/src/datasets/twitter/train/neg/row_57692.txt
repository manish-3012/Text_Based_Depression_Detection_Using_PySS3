Does it really get better?I guess Iâ€™m starting to understand how having a shitty family life from the beginning really sets you up for failure. Iâ€™m trying to stay strong and bear through the pain and heal but I honestly keep getting more and more depressed. Like, I know I have the ability to just do things and be okay but for some reason it keeps eating away at me. I need to be strong I guess and do the things that keep me alive but honestly itâ€™s hard to have the motivation when all I can picture in my life is endless pain. I donâ€™t understand why I attract such shorty people in my life and when I actually meet decent normal people I donâ€™t know what to do. I really donâ€™t. I am not constantly suicidal anymore but for some reason my mental health has been going down the shitter and I honestly donâ€™t know how to get over my eating disorder without self harming and thatâ€™s just perpetuating the problem further. Idk, I just wouldnâ€™t mind getting hit by a car or falling off a building or something because Iâ€™m starting to realize that itâ€™s really only me keeping things bad at this point. I get good people wrapped up in my shit show and it just breaks me when they care. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone with how I am towards myself but it seems like i canâ€™t have any form of close relationship without damaging them with my self destructive tendencies. Iâ€™m not going to try and do it yet but itâ€™s been on my mind more and more lately and I just donâ€™t want to spiral further but I donâ€™t know that to do to feel okay. I just want to be okay
