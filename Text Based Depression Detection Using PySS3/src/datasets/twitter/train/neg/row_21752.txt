Why can't I just die already?I find life and everything pointless. I feel like everything is falling apart. Girl I loved left me, I feel alienated from my family and friends, and I overall feel worthless. I don't know how or when I want to kill myself but it's to the point where I'm about to just drive my car off a bridge.
