I have never wanted to kill myself this badly. I know that my reason is one that's been said a million times before, but I want to die nonetheless.My boyfriend is about to break up with  me, I think. He says he wants to go, but he'll be dooming me. He's my first boyfriend. He was my first kiss. He's everything to me. He's my world. I've been so lonely romantically my whole life, and he took that away. I don't want to live anymore. If he doesn't want me, than I see no point in being alive. Why should I be forced to live if I'm in so much pain? I don't think I'll be able to survive another heartbreak... He saved me from the first one... Please... Help me... I don't know what to do...
