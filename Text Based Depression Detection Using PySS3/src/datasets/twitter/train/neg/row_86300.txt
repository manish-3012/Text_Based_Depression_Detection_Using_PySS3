I'm totally empty inside.I have everything I should have to be happy. But I'm so tired and exausted with myself. With my lack of doing things for myself. I don't. I just want to not exist anymore. I want to leave my dogs with my husband and just quietly dissolve away. 

I dont feel like I can be fixed. PTSD broke me as a young person and I've never really recovered. I covered it up. I pushed it away. I hid it. But today I just am done. I'm all torn apart inside and what's on the outside is just a beaten up shell I use to keep the world out.

Nobody I talk to understands this exaustion. My body hurts and all I can think about is wanting it to end. I just want this pain to stop. I've been curled up in a ball pulling at my hair. Mumbling about how much I want this crushing sadness and pain to end. And all my husband can do is hug me and tell me it will pass.

It passes, it comes back, it passes, it comes back. Each time it grinds away a little more at me. Each time I'm desperate to make it stop.

I need to do something. I don't have the strength for passive resistance anymore. I'm getting to a point where I want to commit suicide. I'm so, so, so sick of choosing life when it's just another round of faking it for family and suffering inside.
