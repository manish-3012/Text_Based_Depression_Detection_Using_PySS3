Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m suicidal or making this upPractically, I would never do this. I know Iâ€™ll probably be happy in a few years and I would never hurt my family this way.
I just think about it... all the time. I â€˜knowâ€™ that maybe in 10 years I will be happy, but I literally have no clue how Iâ€™m gonna make it till there. Iâ€™m not gonna hurt myself, but Iâ€™m not gonna be able to survive all of this either.
Last night, I was at my partnerâ€™s house, and all I could think about was the idea to go to the bathroom and end it. I was not gonna do it. I was just fantasising or something like that. I wondered how long it would take me to die, who would knock first, who would find me, who would call my family. I couldnâ€™t stop imagining this. And I was not scared. I wasnâ€™t gonna do it, but I kinda wished I could.
