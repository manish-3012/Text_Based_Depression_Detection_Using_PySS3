writing down some thoughtsIt's currently around 12 AM writing this. i've been having a lot of aggressive thoughts lately and i know that they're harmful to other people. it's making me insanely anxious because i'm afraid i'll actually do it soon. i want to end myself just to get all of my worrying to *stop*. i've been afraid of myself for about a year when these thoughts first popped up, and ever since then i've jusrt wanted to kill myself to make my worrying stop

i have an insane amount of anxiety when it comes to these things (hurting other people, but just anxiety in general is high) and a lot of times i've wanted to kill myself because of how bad it feels to have a stomach-wrenching amount of anxiety that i can't shake

ive just been afraid of myself more than ever tosay and i'm so close to actually hurting someone (and myself)
