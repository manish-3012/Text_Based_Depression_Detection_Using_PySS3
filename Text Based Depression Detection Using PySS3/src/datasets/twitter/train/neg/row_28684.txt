i really want to do itI know there are tons out there and I won't be remembered or this won't be seen but I need the smallest bit of attention like the disgusting vile excuse I am so! I don't mean to be edgy or annoying, I truly don't. 
 
After years of physical abuse ranging to being beat bloody till unconscious by my parents, sexual abuse, tons of homophobia, failing,  taxing emotional abuse and this constant pain, I don't see a way to do it. nothing matters. I'm 16 and can't even take the smallest saying without crying and throwing up in self-disgust. there's no suicide hotline or anything. no support for the LGBT in a Muslim country with the death penalty for the LGBT. I haven't met someone disgusting like me. all I ever wanted was parents that loved me as much as I loved them. I wanted happiness and a shred of love but all I got was this. hell isn't a place, its whatever is in my chest because it doesn't feel alive and I want it to stop.  
I genuinely wish I was dead. not because my coping mechanisms outweigh the pain but because after all previous attempts, I have finally gained the courage to do it and not hold back.  
I just wish it was over and I'm going to do it tomorrow, that's all.  
I hope you all find the happiness and love you give others so selflessly because you all deserve it.
