HelpI'm 14 years old and I am suicidal, I suffer from anxiety and I'm depressed. I tried to OD Saturday night and unfortunately it didn't work.. My uncle came out as gay last week and is being persecuted by n the whole church and disowned by my family, I'm bi and they don't know, I can't stand living through this and I just want to die, does anyone know of a free suicide hotline I can text? My parents would be suspicious and probably hurt me if they knew I called one, please help me..
