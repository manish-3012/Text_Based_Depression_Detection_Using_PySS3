Pretending that everything is fine is so hardNo one has even the slightest idea that I plan to kill myself and honestly it makes it that much harder for me to get through each day as my last day approaches.  
  
I am still continuing to make plans and promises to friends and family despite knowing that I won't be able to see them through and it makes me feel like such an awful person.  
  
Though it does bring me happiness knowing that I will no longer be a bother and a burden to those around me. They will continue to live and enjoy their lives while I am burning in hell (not that I believe in heaven or hell, but that's certainly where I deserve to go).  
  
I can't keep the thoughts away. I  just want to be free.
