I hate myself.Why do I keep making the same mistakes over and over again? Why haven't I just ended it yet? I've gotten so much support from so many people, how could I ever repay them when I'm just a huge piece of shit? There's no use for someone completely useless like me. I feel like I've even felt this way before. I've gotten medication, I've gone to therapy. I'm not struggling financially. I've got family who want to see me succeed and be happy. Why do I continue to betray them like this? Sometimes I wish I wasn't born; I wish that my parents could have gotten the son they deserve instead of garbage like me.   


I doesn't think there's any hope for me anymore. I can't rely on others forever. I wish I was just normal; I wish I could get through life happy and content, not feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I wish I could be present and not worry about the abyss that is my future. I wish I didn't have to wish for things and could just work hard to achieve them. How do normal, average people function?  


I can't even type. Even writing this post feels pointless since it'll fall to deaf ears. Who would listen to a disgusting monster like me. This is just attention-seeking at its finest anyway. To anyone potentially reading this, I'm sorry I wasted your time and needlessly burdened you, just like everyone else in my life.
