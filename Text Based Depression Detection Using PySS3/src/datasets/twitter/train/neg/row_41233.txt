No one will ever love me againHe left me for a much prettier girl.  And now my boss just let me go from my job.  

I am just a failure.  I have no social skills so and I have never looked pretty, so there's no way I'll ever attract anyone again.  

There's no point in eating anymore.  There's no point in sleeping or exercising or hanging out with anyone.  They will all be gone eventually.

I should just kill myself, I am so worthless.  The only person who loved me like that is gone, I'm not good enough
