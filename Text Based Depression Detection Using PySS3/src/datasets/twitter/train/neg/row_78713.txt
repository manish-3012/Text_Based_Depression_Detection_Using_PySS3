Heart brokenI used to date a guy. I loved him, i fought to be woth him. My parents try to prevent me from getting to know him. So...we started getting to know each other. I loved him, wd had plans and everything. Then all of sudden, everything got a bit sour. I told him one night, that i needed space so i can improve myself (i thought it was me that was causing it.). He said sure. Then next day in the afternoon he broke up with me. He told we weren't ready but he still loves me. So i try to be a good best friend. He started acting weird towards me and he just avoid talking to me. I texted him a month after, i told him he was a hypocrite. Then he started attacking me calling me a hypocrite and that my love wasnt genuine. He blocked me. I cried not because of the break up, but because he just told me my love was fake. And i hate that. I still have to see his face every thursday and Sunday. And he started talking to anothet girl. I cry at times because all i want was an apology. At times i want to die, im just trying to keep a strong face for my parents. I hate being sensitive and i feel so ashamed. I blame myself for ignoring my parents. I don't wanna eat, i feel like half of me died. My mom asked me if i was okay, i told her yes. She said im beautiful and worth it. I appreciate it, but at times i just cry whenever i remember thd time i spend time with him.

Im sorry for being dramatic. I dont like to tell how i feel. I just feel like crap for the past month. I felt like i lost everything...
