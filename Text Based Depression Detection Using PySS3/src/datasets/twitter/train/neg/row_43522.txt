I feel bad for scaring people with my suicidal thoughts, but I don't feel bad for how I feel about my life.On Wednesday, I was so unhappy with getting yet another job rejection. I have been battling mental illness for months and at the heat of the moment, I wrote about how I wish I could get hit by a car on Facebook. Although I am very apologetic for having my family members &amp; other people I friended on FB scared, I feel like part of me is also sorry that I got caught. This is simply because of how I realized the hard way how gossipy my African family can be.

I feel like my family telling my mother about what I posted was justified, but I didn't expect them to run around &amp; gossip to everyone else in the family (the people who don't have a Facebook) about me. I even found out the hard way that my estranged uncle's wife added me on Facebook (I didn't know her name) &amp; she was used as a pawn by my estranged aunts &amp; uncles of my dad's side to watch my every move on social media because they know I don't like them and I don't want to associate with them.

I just realized that my family is actually *worse* than the people my age when it comes to screenshotting my social media posts &amp; laughing. With my peers, they would screenshot my posts, laugh, get over it, &amp; move on. But with family, they will never let you live it down. African relatives hold grudges from things you did from the past. I feel like my mother printed the screenshot of my post so she can bring it up whenever we argue. I don't think I will ever live this down (with family).

Lesson learned. While I was wrong for scaring people with my facebook post, I can see why some people don't add their family on Facebook.
