It's my birthday in 2 daysMakes sense to end it on the day where it all started. I will be 21 and  literally didn't do shit in my life. These past 4 years have been a nightmare for the most part. I'm a dissapointment to my family, myself and my non existing friends. Hopefully I won't pussy out at the last moment like I did 7 months ago.
