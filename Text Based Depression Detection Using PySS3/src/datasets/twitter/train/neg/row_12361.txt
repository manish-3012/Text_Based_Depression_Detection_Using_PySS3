I didnâ€™t realize that I didnâ€™t want to die until I almost killed myself on accidentI donâ€™t know how much context is necessary. But basically Iâ€™m 21M been dealing with major depression for about three years. Iâ€™ve never made an attempt on my life. A few nights ago I was drinking and then came home and took a mix of prescribed sedatives and anti-psychotics to get to sleep. Taking these together especially especially with alcohol in my system is a no no. I realized shortly after taking them that I took enough to actually do some damage or even kill me. I realized then that if I did die in my sleep, Iâ€™d regret it. I regretted putting myself in that situation, and I think maybe people in general would regret suicide. No matter how much you think you want to, in the face of actual death, thereâ€™s a moment of clarity. Something you canâ€™t realize without feeling the full weight of your very real death approaching. Maybe someone can find some hope in my experience without needing to feel it fully themselves. Part of your brain wants to live, and it can keep you alive long enough to figure your life out if you let it live.
