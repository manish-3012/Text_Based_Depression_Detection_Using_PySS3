Donâ€™t read if you donâ€™t want to I donâ€™t mean to take up anybodyâ€™s time at allIâ€™m 21 years old and as long as I can remember Iâ€™ve felt more than sad at different times. Iâ€™ve always pushed it off with games, drugs, alcohol, and other things until it inevitably comes back up and I become very unmotivated and suicidal. 

The first time Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself was when I was in third grade (8-9 years old) and I tried to tie a PlayStation cord around my neck and hang myself. My sister came up to my room and screamed. I felt ashamed. I was made to believe I was crazy or exaggerating the small event that had occurred for me to come to this.

When I was about 12-ish I can remember again trying this from something very small like my sister went in my room and played my game without asking. I didnâ€™t know why I blew up and just freaked out mentally. I now think itâ€™s kind of like â€œthe straw that broke the camels backâ€ or me pushing something deeper down when I play games or try my hardest to be happy or do drugs or something and then when it all comes back up, the smallest things will send me into a huge lengthy spiral of suicidal depression. 

I realize I try to find purpose or meaning and have all these fantastic ideas but every. Single. Fucking. Time. I lose all the motivation and all these interests I can sometimes put weeks or months of time into, and get back into this super depressive state. I donâ€™t know why. 

The other day I was in this hysterical state and I almost killed myself but I got a random text from my father, it was a reply to a message the day before. So the last 2 days I thought I just needed purpose and meaning and I just have to try harder. So I felt happy until tonight at work I just felt so scared coming into the realization that this has been the same exact cycle Iâ€™ve been stuck in for as long as I can remember. Iâ€™m so scared Iâ€™ll never be happy. Iâ€™m so scared I will kill my self as I donâ€™t think right when Iâ€™m in these states. Iâ€™m just so scared. Iâ€™m not in the place to be able to just get help. Iâ€™m just so scared. 

Anyways if you read all this thank you so so much I actually feel a lot better getting this out. Life is hard and Iâ€™m sorry for anyone else going through similar things. Please stay strong guys. Please. This shit is so hard but we have to keep trying.
