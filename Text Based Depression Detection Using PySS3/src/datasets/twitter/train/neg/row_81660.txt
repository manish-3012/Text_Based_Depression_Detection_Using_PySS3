First, I lost the ability to cry. Then, I lost the ability to feel deep emotions. And now? Now, not even the one thing that made me happy can bring me back from where I am...It might sound silly, but my entire existence was riding on a TV show. Moreover, the people who I met from that show, the friends I gained, the fact that my favorite actor was in it, the activism, etc.

Today, it just got renewed for a second season.

...And I just don't care. I want to be happy, I want to scream with excitement like everyone else, but honestly? I don't give a single fuck. I just don't.

Trauma has ruined my ability to cry. Abuse has destroyed my ability to feel deep emotions. And *I* have made myself so numb that even the *one* thing that gave me happiness, now, just doesn't fucking matter.

Nothing matters to me. I can't feel. I can't hurt. I can't smile. I can just sit, catatonic, exhausted without doing anything, and...that's it.
