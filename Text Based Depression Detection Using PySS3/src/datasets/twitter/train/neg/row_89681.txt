I don't know what to do..So, I've always had trouble waking myself up every morning and convincing myself to go to school but now it's worse than ever. My anxiety always kicks in in the morning and my brain tells me "No, you don't want to go there. It's a horrible and terrifying place." The other morning I literally put a jacket on, put a knife, my wallet, and my phone in the pockets and started walking. The night before I was planning to commit suicide but realized my mom would find me too soon if I did it in the house so that's why I took off the next morning. Killing myself often seems better than going to school so I had planned to walk to an abandoned neighborhood about 1.5 miles from my house and kill myself there where nobody could find me. I made it to the neighborhood to find that there were construction workers working on the power lines near the entrance so I couldn't get in unseen. By this time, my mom tracked my phone, found me, and drove me back home. I don't know what to do with myself now. You would think my mom would take me to a doctor but I don't think she wants to come to terms with the fact that I'm suicidal. I hate being stuck inside my own mind! I wish this could just be over!
