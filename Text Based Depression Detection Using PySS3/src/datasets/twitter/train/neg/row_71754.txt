I can't fall a sleep while thinking about my own actual lifeI can never fall a sleep thinking about things that might actually happen in my own life, I always need to think of scenarios where I am magically saved from all of my troubles and given a decent life.  
  
I should just kill myself because I completely lost hope and there is nothing to motivate me other than wanting to watch the rise of skywalker.  
  
I also have a renaissance poetry class in 7 hours and I can't sleep and I don't even fucking like literature and i am trying to smother myself with my hugging pillow. God if you exist please give me a violent heart attack.
