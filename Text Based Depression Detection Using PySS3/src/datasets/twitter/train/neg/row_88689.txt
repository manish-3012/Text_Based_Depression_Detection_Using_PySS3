My LetterHello this is my letter i havenâ€™t done it but iâ€™m almost there. lmao my 1000th time. 
I am sorry to everyone that i ever hurt. cuz it was my fault and iâ€™m sorry. If iâ€™m not here anymore iâ€™m sorry i took my own life everything was just too much. often times when iâ€™m down i just think about the sky and how i want to be just like the clouds. gone and with the wind. itâ€™s crazy how my body wants to live and survive. but my brain just wants to go and iâ€™m just tired of it. every relationship i ever have i always mess it up. and thatâ€™s what hurts me the most is hurting others. i know itâ€™s lame to think and feel sorry for myself but i really canâ€™t help it. it makes me just want to off myself. everytime iâ€™m down i just close my eyes and think of ending it all. and it makes me feel so good it makes me feel unanxious. like i can take a deep breathe and just relax and accept it all. isnâ€™t it so fucked up though that the thing that makes me feel the best would cost me my life. i think about it almost everday i just canâ€™t ever cuz iâ€™m such a coward i tried so many times since i was 6. the only thing that keeps me around is that i donâ€™t want to hurt my loved ones. but iâ€™ll just end up hurting them and anyone i come into contact with. it probably would be the best for all of us especially since iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™ll probably do it in the woods or sum so no one has to find me and be traumatized. to everyone thatâ€™s hurt just know i love you and iâ€™ll always be with you. and it was my fault sometimes this pain is just too unbearable. it makes me sad cuz a lot of people have had a harder life than me and are still going. My soul is just tired and i donâ€™t want to hurt anyone else.
