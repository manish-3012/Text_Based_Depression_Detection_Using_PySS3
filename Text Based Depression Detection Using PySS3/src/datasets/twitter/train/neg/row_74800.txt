Trusting people?Hey. I, uh, I want to share a story.

Well, first suicide attempt of mine last summer. Details don't matter. The thing is that I went rambling and venting to a friend of mine. An internet friend. The one I considered the dearest. That... might've been a mistake.
He was supportive at first. Then I was ignored for some time. Rambling depression is tough, I understand, but they never told me that they are not fine with it.
Out of nowhere.
'Your suicide attempts make me laugh my ass off'
I was... You know.
Apparently that was a joke. A joke to see how I'll react. To see if I was serious about my suicidality or not.

You know. Stab someone. Then 'sorry, I just wanted to see how you'll react'.

Then many things were said my way.
&gt;Do you even know how much you hurt me?
&gt;Get your shit together already.
&gt;Ugh, I know what's your problem. Go and fix it, duh.
&gt;Oh, you can't fix it? Well, continue onwards being the slump you currently are, waiting for some miracle to happen.
&gt;Look, I could've told your IRL friends about that. But I didn't.

That last one. Racket? Going for chantage when dealing with a suicidal person?
What is wrong with them?

Well, half a year passed, I still haven't fixed that. I still want to be friends with the person. Really do. Talked just one time recently. They either don't want to hear about that at all, or just as hostile.
It hurts, but I can't leave it.


Well... I have a few other dear friends. Great ones. To whom I can turn back to and be supported. Thanks to them, I'm still here.
Unfortunately, after that incident I don't even want to tell my parents about my mental state. I'm scared.

Wish no one of you would have to face someone like that.
