Helping a friend - or trying toI have a friend who is really struggling to believe that "everything is going to be ok".

He's autistic, and desperately sad, and I'm terrified that he's going to hurt himself.   
I mentioned that I feel helpless to help him, and suggested that I conference in a hotline, and he freaked out. Seems the 1st time he tried calling a hotline, he ended up in handcuffs and forcefully admitted to a hospital. The next time he tried, the same thing happened.   
I'm on the phone with him now. I'm trying to convince him that tomorrow could be better, but the large issues he is dealing with are not easily resolved. 

He keeps telling me he doesn't feel good. His back hurts, but his emotions are hurting every bit as much - or more - than his back.
