A message of loveI'm new to reddit, and honestly I came here hoping to get some help for myself. I don't have friends who will listen to me, I don't have family. But when I see all of you who are struggling just as much as I am, it makes me want to reach out again and hold you, and tell you that I'm here without any platitudes. I have no advice because I have none for myself. Living in this world makes it so difficult to maintain compassion because there are so many living things in need of help, it overwhelms us. But I'm glad I feel so strongly for all of you when I read your posts, it means I can't be entirely broken. The world has tried its best to take away what makes me "me," but it hasn't succeeded. 

We are taught in our society to make small talk and laugh at each other when we show passion, or any kind of emotional response toward anything. I refuse to be like that, I outright refuse. One of the things that drives us all to this point is trying to conform to this apathetic wheelhouse of consumer-supplier insanity. My conclusion now is to not do that. Instead find people who are willing to be open and kind with you. Be real with them. Surround yourself with people who are real, and don't live in this cloud of multitasking indifference that we think every day has to be made of. I don't know if that makes sense.... hopefully whoever is reading this understands. 

There are songs, movies, books that have all influenced us because they successfully described our own feelings. We looked at the endings of those things and said "Yeah, so what's the answer then?" and they gave us no answers, because there really are none. The only thing we can do is love each other, and be present for one another. 

Feel free to message me, anyone who wants to. Stand out in the sun today for five minutes and remember that I love you.
