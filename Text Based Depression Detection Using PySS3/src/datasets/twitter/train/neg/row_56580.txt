DoneBefore I say this, is this the right subreddit? 


I feel as if I am too young to die yet the pain I feel is like a burning knife through my chest. I am 14 years old and have a great life on the outside, I have friends live a middle class life and I can afford therapy. However through all of this I'm still depressed for no reason. I know the "hormone" bullshit but I know that doesn't take it to the measures I'm put through. I stay awake at night praying to Whatever god there is that I'd die painlessly and drift away. I don't know what causes this- I am becoming anti social and suicidal. Somedays I feel like putting the noose around my neck and Letting go. It is probably what I will do if this hell doesn't stop.
