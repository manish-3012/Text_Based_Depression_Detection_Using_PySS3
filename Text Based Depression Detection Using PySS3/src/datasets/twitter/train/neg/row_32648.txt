Life doesn't really seem worth it3 months ago I tried to kill myself by overdose and cutting my legs ( turns out wrist would been better however if I did survive I don't want people to know that about me). Anyway after 3 months I finally got an appointment from my psychiatrist who didn't even check her notes to see that I did in fact try to kill myself. After the appointment she had put me on new medication; diazapam and lithium for bipolar and anxiety but the transition to these drugs from my last which I am still on has potential lead to more aggressive suicidal thoughts that I might actually act on rather than my usual suicidal thinking where I don't think I will commit because I have no idea why we are here so I  might as well carry on and see what happens, but I've spent almost all my time in the past 2 years In my room doing nothing due to extreme axiety. Atm I feel ok but over the past week if anything slightly negative happens to me my first thought is self harm or suicide. I have thought about going to hospital but atm I seem to be alright but if I do see myself getting worse I will go to hospital for my own safety. I am 19 almost 20 m from the UK. Hopefully once this medication settles down I will be much more stable but atm I really don't see myself living very ling because generally I want to die. In my life I've done nothing and don't see myself doing anything and I will most definitely struggle to part take in this society we live In as it seems fundamentally flawed and I don't seem to see a way to take part or fit in. I'm not gonna kill myself today  but see it as a probably in the future which is unfortunate as there is most likely a great life out there for me to live but if it were to happen it seems so distant and not worth the wait In which I will be suffering immensely. Btw I'm diagnosed with autism, bipolar and have severe axiety problems. Thank you if anyone reads this I'm most likely not worth your time so sorry for wasting itðŸ’œ
