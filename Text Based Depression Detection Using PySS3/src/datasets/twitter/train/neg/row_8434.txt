ScaredI really want to kill myself. Or atleast I dont want to exist anymore. Im just too scared to do it. My wife, or ex-wife, is spending the night with another guy right now. I know about it. I cant stand it. Im having difficulty breathing. My chest is exploding.

The idea of taking my own life isnt new. Ive just never been this close.
