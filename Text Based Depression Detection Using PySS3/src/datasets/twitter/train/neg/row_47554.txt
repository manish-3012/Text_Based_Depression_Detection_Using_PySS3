I hate who I amEmotional wreck, depressive, anxiety filled, filth of a person. Whenever I get close to people I only hurt them. Whenever I join a team and something goes wrong I can't walk away. I cant take a breather. I'm not allowed to take a longer time to process things. I'm not allowed to explain I need to mute myself before I say something I regret. Things will never be perfect. Projects/Assignments/Games are decided at the beginning to either be a success or a failure. 

I'm a failure of a person. My parents say my bedroom is starting to smell. I dont really care. I hate myself. I do the basics. Laundry, brush teeth/hair, clean dishes, go for a walk, study. I'm so stupid. I wish there was a painless way to die. 

People only like me when I'm making jokes being excited or laughing. They hate that when I get frustrated I have to shut myself away. I need time to process my feelings and my thoughts before I react. I always rage out if I dont take time to process. I hate that I cant be normal. I try to explain how I process things but because I'm old enough I should know a better way.

I dont want to interact with people. I dont want to leave my room or house. I dont even want to be on the internet anymore. I'm only going to be disappointed and I cant process anything.

Would you like me dead Faith? Would you like me dead coach? Would you like me dead mom/dad? I'm a failure in every aspect. I cant function. I have no skills. I'm hollow. I'm empty. Nobody wants me around unless I can be normal.
