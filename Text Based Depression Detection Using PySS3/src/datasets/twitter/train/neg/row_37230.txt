I'm Disconnected Everywhere Else, So Why Not Disconnect Completely?Emotionally. Even personality wise. My friend just asked me to explain why I had suicidal intent last time (two months ago) and why things seem to get worse emotionally but with less intent (currently). The best I could come up with was this: "I feel... kind of like I have nails slowly dragging along my skin, in an emotional sense, not literal or physical. Or like I'm slowly grinding along - like when you get a rock stuck in your shoe but you can't get it out. My personality has begun to build up buffers that take the majority of any emotional blows I have, which gives me this total sense of disconnection from the world. As if I'm not the one actually experiencing life, and none of these decisions are mine, none of these actions. Even my voice doesn't sound like mine. My brain will do multiple double takes in a day and go, "Whoa, who the f* was that? That's not my voice. I didn't decide to do that." It's like this transparent wall shielding me but it also holds me back. Like I'm seeing through a haze everything thats going on but nothing is in focus. I don't know, I feel like there's more to it but I either can't put words to it or I don't even understand it myself right now."

I'm emotionally, mentally disconnected. It's not a "I feel like there's no point" but rather "I'm already dead and dragging a dead body around" kind of feeling.... I don't know what to do.
