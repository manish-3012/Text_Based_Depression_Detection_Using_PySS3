I don't get lifeI just don't get it. I don't understand how people can just work 40 + hours every week, have enough time to take care of errands, chores, and other necessities, and have time to hang out with their friends all without breaking down from exhaustion. I sure as hell can't do it. I can't even hold a fucking job. I'm too stupid to get an office job, and I'm too slow to do manual labor without getting fired in the first month or two.

Hell I don't even understand how people make friends. I sure as hell can't. Human beings might as well be another species to me. I don't know anything about them. I don't know how to talk to them or what they like, let alone how to make myself seem likeable. And don't even get me started on dating. 

Why am I even bothering at this point? Why? I have no friends and I'm never gonna get any. I have no family that gives a damn about me. I can't hold a job to save my life. And even if I could, what then? Work 5 days a week at a job I hate for the rest of my meaningless life? This is what life is all about? This is the bullshit people are talking about when they say "there's so much to live for"? Why does anyone ever do this? I know I can't, and I'm too fucking tired to try anymore. Fuck life.
