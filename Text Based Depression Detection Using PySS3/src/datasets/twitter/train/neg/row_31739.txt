My boyfriend is talking about suicide. My boyfriends last text to me was, "You know how easily suicide remedies things? How easy pulling the trigger would be instead of fighting day in and day out? I'm so sick of it all." He hasn't messaged me since. I don't know what to do or what to say to make him feel like I care. Anyone please help
