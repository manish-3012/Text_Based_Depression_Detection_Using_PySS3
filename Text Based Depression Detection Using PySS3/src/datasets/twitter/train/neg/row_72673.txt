Sometimes I think about running awayToo bad I'm incompetent with everything. I cant even speak to a cashier properly without stuttering and avoiding eye contact. Too bad I'm a girl and I'll probably get kidnapped and trafficked. I just want to escape, but I cant drive because I keep failing my driving test. I cant so anything. I dont know how to do anything. My friends don't talk to me anymore. I sometimes wonder if I ever meant anything to them or if they really even liked me. I know im a weird person and I say stupid shit. It keeps haunting me to this day. I'm too afraid to make conversation with them again. They must be having a great time with their lives (or maybe not) so I dont want to burden them with my problems. It's like everything is pushing me towards suicide, but sometimes I find myself distracted from it. When I'm doing my homework or watching online lectures from my professors. But then they come back and I feel like ending it all. I feel like tying the jump rope around my neck and attaching it to a beam protruding from the top of our house and letting go so I could leave this world. I think about stealing my dad's car in the middle of the night and driving it to the train tracks to wait for a train to run me over. I hate being a failure. I hate that knowing that people will think im pathetic because I once felt this way towards people who would joke about suicide or mention their depression. Ive read many posts here and I realize many people cope with this differently. Maybe this is karma. Maybe I need to feel it myself to know how to be a decent fucking person.
