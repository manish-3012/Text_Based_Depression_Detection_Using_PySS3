idk what to doI went off my anxiety meds cold turkey because they were just making me feel worse rather than better but this past week has just been too much for me. All I think about right now is dying and how it would be so much better for me, not having to deal with crippling debt, my mother and sister having ago at me all the time, my ex being an asshole to be because he can't take a joke, trying to get money off me.. To be honest, *anything* feels like it would be better than here right now. I'm just sick of the constant thoughts of killing myself and how I'd do it. I don't want to go back to therapy or the doctor because it's all the same. Thought I'd put my trust in the internet..
