should i tell my counselor that im suicidal?I've been suicidal since I was 8 and got sent to a mental hospital last month. that made me the worst I've ever been because I made friends there and I loved it, even if it didn't help me. I was happy-ish there, but it was fucking expensive. I want to tell my counselor that I'm suicidal, but I'm afraid she'll send me to another mental hospital or tell my parents. it's either that or start making a suicide plan, which for me sounds great. I just don't wanna spend 10,000 dollars on a week of care that doesn't do anything. 

I just want to die, honestly. fuck.
