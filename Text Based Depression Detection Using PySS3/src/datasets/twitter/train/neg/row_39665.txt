If I commit suicide it will be like I was never bornI wont remember anything. My mind will rot away, my life would never have happened... I wont exist anymore. It will be just like the space between falling asleep and dreaming but forever. That's all I enjoy anyways.

I hate myself so much. My time here has been pain and I don't want to go through this anymore. I was normal as a child but the abuse and loneliness killed me and now my body is playing catch up. I'll never be good enough for anything that I want and I'd better just die now because nothing good will ever happen.

I'm going to die one day regardless if I commit suicide, might as well cut to the end and leave behind all this misery and future futility I'm going to have to toil through for absolutely no reason other than to receive more sorrows.
