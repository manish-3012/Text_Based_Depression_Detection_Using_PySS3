I need help ASAPI know a "papa bear" type who takes in all kinds. Last night, we went bowling with a friend of his I'd never met. We've been talking quite a bit today, but it got to me explaining a past romance of mine. I know my heart will heal in time, but he *needs* to take it upon himself. 

I refused, of course, as I felt we were falling far down the rabbit hole as was but... It seems then he went on to say his only purpose in life is to help people and now he has no purpose. He says he knows how to dispose of his body and is going to disappear soon. He's under the impression that its for the better of everyone.


He's living with the papa bear and after not responding, he correctly guessed that i was contacting papa bear.

Papa bear is clueless. He has a history of being serious and needing medications, apparently. He thought this was done and passed after the guy got back from the marines. Papa has a new born though and cant afford to pay for this guy's meds again.


Please, help us.
