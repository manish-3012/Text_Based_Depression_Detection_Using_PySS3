I think I've lost itFor months for I've been losing touch with reality. Video games I'ved played, movies I've watched are mixing in my mind and reality. I think about doing bad things thinking I'll "respawn" like in a game or the movie restarts. Sometimes I don't remember my name or I'll get stuck in a past memory and I won't know whats going on. I've always had depression but I never lost my mind before like this. I don't know whats happening most of the time anymore
