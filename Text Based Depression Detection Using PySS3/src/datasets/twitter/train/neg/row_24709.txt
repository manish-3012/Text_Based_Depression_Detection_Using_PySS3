What's the pointWhy live when you could just end it right there, suffer no more, feel no more, love no more, feel like a total piece of shit no more. Everyday I look at my life and think, I don't give myself a pass on the game of life, even though I'm only 15 the world is fucking with me, school, trying to fit in, love life (I have never had a girlfriend), everyday during math class I see an alcoholic or drug addict not the teacher but future me, everyday in English class I see my old school, where I was happy, I grew up there, but my depression and suicidal thoughts started there, but in highschool I don't see shit, I only experience long term sadness and short term happiness, only when I'm in that 15 minute breakfast break. 15 FUCKING MINUTES, like school give me time to have fun expect for study like a fucking robot, I have to be programmed to learn something everyday, even though it's completely fucking useless irl, why not just end it. Why?
