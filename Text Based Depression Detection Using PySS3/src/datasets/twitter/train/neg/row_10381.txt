I feel like my life isn't the sameI tried lsd 3 months ago and it wasn't a good experience. I told my mom and she was supportive. Recently I feel as if I can't go back to my old life always feel sad. I don't know if I'm depressed or not. I've been to a therapist but she made it seem like I was an addict and came across quite rude. Sometimes I feel that life isn't good and I have screwed it up which then makes me think if i would be better off not being here. I don't think I will follow up on those thoughts as I know it would devastate my family and I want to get better. Just for some background im 16 and still in school doing my final years. I have this fear that I have ruined my life and that things don't go back to how they were. I can live with my mistake but I am just scared that I wont ever feel joy or happiness again. I still laugh and have fun with friends but my mind just keeps thinking of my mistake. Is this just a phase and my mind playing tricks or do I have a mental illness. My main fear is that I'll always be in the state I am in.
