I hate my real life32 year old loser. Lives with mother. Pushes shopping carts for a living. Can't drive. No qualifications. No motivation or ambition. No skills or interests.

Used my grandads inheritance money to go to Japan for a month. Met a girl in Japan and lied about my life to date her because I was sick of being lonely. Had a great time with her and was actually happy for once in my life. 

Came back hone to England and sunk back into severe depression pushing me to the brink of suicide. Reached out for help from mother and she doesn't care. She doesn't speak. Just wants me to stay in my dead end job because we live under her boyfriends roof and I'll be made homeless if I quit.

Thinking about handing in my notice and just going back to Japan for Christmas anyway. It might be just for a few weeks because that will be the last of the money. I'll be homeless after I leave my job, but what is the point? I am constantly depressed as fuck anyway. Maybe I should live a few weeks more of a fantasy in Japan and then just end my life.
