It's looking like a very tempting option nowHi. I'm 16/M and I have a issue with migraines. If you're familiar with migraines, they come in different phases. I'm pretty much stuck in an endless cycle of these phases. I haven't had a break since October this year(when this all started).

I don't think I'm depressed or suicidal. But opting out is starting to become very tempting. I have to take meds that have shitty side effects and I'm becoming tolerant to my pain pills. At this point I've sort of given up on getting by with the pain pills and just trying to sleep it off, since I'm a student on holiday till the end of January. My meds are losing their efficacy and I'll have to switch to stronger stuff with even more side effects soon.

A small part of me wants to opt out. I had to get a CT scan to rule out brain cancer and I wanted that scan to turn up positive so at least I'd die soon (it was clean). I don't even know if I'm trying to seek attention or not. I just feel incredibly conflicted on this. I keep swinging between 'I should just gulp all my pills and OD' and 'I don't want to die I want to live on and go to med school and die of old age'.

Over the past few months I've been in a downward spiral. I haven't had fun for ages. Video games used to cheer me up. Now I find them a chore. Books used to be fun. Everything seems 'flat'. I'm regressing into a sort of a loner

I don't want to kill myself because I don't want to upset friends and family. But I keep thinking up plans. Drafting suicide notes in my head. Who to give my stuff away to.

I haven't talked to anyone about this and this is a throwaway. Typing this was difficult; I think I'm zigzagging between wanting to do it and not wanting to do it. I don't really know what I'm doing anymore.
