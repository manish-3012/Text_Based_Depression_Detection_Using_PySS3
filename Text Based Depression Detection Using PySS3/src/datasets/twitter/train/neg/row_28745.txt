i want to end this miseryMy life is going nowhere..
I am in my fifth year in college and I am in a major that I do not like. I am mad at myself for not changing it when I had the chance and now it's too late. Not only it's too late I might not even graduate. To make things worse, my loans have piled up. And I have to idea how to repay them back. My sister and I had a fight. Now she won't talk to me and told me to forget about her. My father wants to go to back to his native country. But I can't support myself yet. He's mad at me for not finishing college. Because I am supposed to be help him and take over his responsibilities after I graduate. But I am staying for another year and he's upset because his plans of retiring has to be pushed back. I hate waking up from sleep because the first thing that comes to my mind when i wake up is my problems. I feel exhausted just by thinking about them. It seems like nothing in this world is going to make me happy. Before I was thinking about suicide but with fear. But now, it has escalated. Now I am thinking about suicide as a wonderful thing. Because if I am dead I don't have to think anymore. I want to be rested. I am not happy in this world anymore.
