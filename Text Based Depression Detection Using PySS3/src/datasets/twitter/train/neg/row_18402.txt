Been trying to get help for years. no one takes me seriously.I've been depressed ever since my rape when I was seven and struggle with PTSD. I've been homeless twice and have been poor all my life. I can't eat or sleep most days. My entire life has been shit and I don't think there has been one year of my life where there hasn't been a traumatic event.

And yet.

These people still have the audacity to tell me that I'm not serious about wanting to die. Like some how there brain allows them to tell me of all motherfucking people that "it will get better." or "it can't get any worse only up from here." 

I went to A&amp;E like I was told to and guess what this "professional" told me to do?! "drink some tea and have a warm bath" ah yeah I'll have a fucking bath all right but I'm bringing the toaster with me. Like these fuckers are some of the most useless people on the planet like you clearly don't understand mental health why are you working in this field?


The suicide hotlines aren't good either 90% of them just say shit like "think of your family." Like I hate most of my family I only like my mum, dad and big brother the others could die for all I care.


I really like it when people try to guilt trip you it really shows that they have no clue what they are talking about.


So in conclusion I want to die and no one seems to try and help when I ask for it. I think I'm gonna try and overdose in a couple hours or go to the train tracks behind my house.
