Why the fuck am I like thisI donâ€™t even want to be me anymore. I do the dumbest shit on impulse. My mom is going to be home in an hour, and she shouldnâ€™t have to deal with my mess because Iâ€™m so fucking selfish. I donâ€™t even get it anymore. Why the hell did I have to turn out like this? I have so many great friends I donâ€™t want to leave behind but theyâ€™re all I have at this point. I donâ€™t even have motivation anymore, everything seems so fake. Why couldnâ€™t I be someone else? Iâ€™lol probably just write a quick suicide note and attach the 10 dollars I have to my pathetic name so my mother can benefit from my death. I love my family so much. I donâ€™t want them. But I donâ€™t want me either.
