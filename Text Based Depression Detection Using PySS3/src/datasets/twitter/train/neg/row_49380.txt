Really thinking about killing myselfBeen on house arrest past 38 days for reckless driving. I get out and just make a complete ass of my self for the next 3 days. Crashed my newish wrx have no idea if it's totaled or not. Problems don't seem as bad compared to what else i've read but feels like life just knocks me down every single time. Just thinking I should go out into the woods and just off my self with my gun
