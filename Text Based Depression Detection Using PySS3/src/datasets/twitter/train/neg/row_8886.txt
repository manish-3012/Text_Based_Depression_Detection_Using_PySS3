This is the Beginning of the EndI can't handle this anymore. I constantly feel stressed, even started working out regularly at the gym but it hasn't changed a thing. When I'm working out I just feel depressed, I get my shit done but don't feel much. 

There's a cloud hanging over me. I'm drowning in my own thoughts. I honestly might attempt suicide tonight. Been a long time since I've touched that belt. But I always see it hanging where I left it. 

I hate being that guy but I feel like so many posts on this subreddit go without any notice. The amount of times I've written and then deleted the post because no one answers. I guess I use it to vent at this point. With the hope that out there maybe someone will read it... 

I don't even know what type of response I'm looking for anymore anyways so why should I complain? Nothing is going to change how I feel anyhow. I don't know how else to put these thoughts and feelings into words much anymore. It's like a lingering pain in my soul. 

I wish suicide wasn't hard... but hey, the longer I let this darkness spread across my mind maybe it won't be so bad after all. 

Goodbye Reddit.
