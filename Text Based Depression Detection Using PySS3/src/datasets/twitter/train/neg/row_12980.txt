My friend has been harming himself recently, and is now talking to me about suicide. How can I help him?I'm going to talk to a professional in the morning, but in the meantime, what can I do?

He's 13, still at home. His parents are split up, and he's under the impression that no one likes him anymore. He's often very happy at school, etc, but tonight he sent messages to me on FaceBook saying about he considers his life worthless, and how everyone's better off than him. He also said that he's self harmed in the past too.

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.
