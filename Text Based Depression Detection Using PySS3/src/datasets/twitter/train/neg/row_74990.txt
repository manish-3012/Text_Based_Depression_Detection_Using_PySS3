Keep me off the ledge by talking to me about the Beetlejuice musical.My life is falling apart, and I'm planning to OD tonight on my psych meds.

The only thing in the past three days that has brought me even a glimmer of joy has been the Beetlejuice musical, which I just discovered exists in a fantastic whirlwind of nostalgia. I figured I had nothing left to lose, so I made a throwaway and I hope someone here will talk to me about it, and maybe that will help to keep me uplifted enough to not pickle my kidneys in lithium.

I really like the changes the play made to the story. I like that BJ is an anti-hero in it, rather than the villain he was in the movie. I've decided he's a maladjusted, transgender slob 'cause I'm a maladjusted, transgender slob and representation is important. His botch of a mom reminds me of my own matriarch so that was a satisfying touch too.

Probably kind of sad that the most I've related to another individual in weeks, and it's a nasty, immature pervert with anger issues but do what you know amirit

I relate in equal parts to both halves of the duet "No Reason." I keep a playlist called "Yo Mama So Dead" full of songs that remind me of the fact that my mom is dead, and there is a song in the musical literally called "Dead Mom" so that's convenient.

The vinyl of the soundtrack is printed w/ black and white swirls.

I'll probably go as BJ for Halloween if I live that long.
