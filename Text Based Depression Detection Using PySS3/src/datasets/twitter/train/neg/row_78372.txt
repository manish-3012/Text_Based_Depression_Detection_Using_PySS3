Tired of living in fearMy life is just a long sad list of things I've never done or experienced. I've never been to a party, never had a relationship, never gotten drunk or high, never been to a club, never even gone out for a whole night doing whatever. 

I live my life like a scared little girl who's too terrified to interact with people or try anything new. And I'm tired of feeling this way every day. I told myself if things don't get better by the time I'm 30, I'm just going to end it. I figure if things don't get better by then, there's no hope anyway. 

I've been on 4 different antidepressants and they've all failed. I've tried talk therapy, CBT, exercise, mindfulness, yoga (ha, I know), even freaking hypnosis and nothing has really given me any relief from my symptoms. And these latest antidepressants have me thinking about suicide on a daily basis so that's been fun. 

I just feel very alone right now.
