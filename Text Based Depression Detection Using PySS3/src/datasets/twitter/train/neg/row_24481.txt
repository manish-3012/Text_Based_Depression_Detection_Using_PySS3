Don't care about anything anymoreHello, I never thought I would post something on here but lately I've had this feeling of hopelessness that won't go away.  I'm 18 and about to graduate high school soon, but I honestly don't look forward to it.  I feel that I'm doomed to spend the next few years in college preparing for a career that I'm not even interested in.  I haven't applied for any scholarships yet because I really don't care what happens next.  I no longer enjoy the things that used to make me happy and my favorite activity right now is sleeping.  Sometimes i wish I could just stay in my room for the rest of my life and never interact with anyone again.  I've felt this way for at least a year now.  I don't have anyone to talk to who'd understand what I'm dealing with, but even if I did I wouldn't want to become a burden to them.  I have seriously considered suicide, but I don't think I could go through with it.  I have trouble saying how I feel and this is the first time I've ever opened up to anyone.  Hopefully I didn't come off as too much of a little bitch by writing this.
