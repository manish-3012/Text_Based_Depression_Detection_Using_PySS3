Calling it a permanent solution to a temporary problemDoes not take into account how permanent the problems feel. Or how long they have been going on. Or how much it hurts. 

Just musing on something I heard 4 times today.  Iâ€™m so tired of hurting. Iâ€™m so tired of struggling with depression. Iâ€™m so tired of hanging on to that glimmer that my pain, the pain of my soul, can be someday looked back on as nothing more than a scar in an otherwise blessed life. 

Yet still I hang on, if only because thatâ€™s all I know anymore.
