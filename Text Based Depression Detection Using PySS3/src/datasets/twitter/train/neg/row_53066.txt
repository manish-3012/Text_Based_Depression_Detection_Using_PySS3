thanks for doing what you do - workedok , so i'm down , aids positive, not hiv and i'm not so happy about it .

it was a few months ago i even found about this subreddit , yea this is a throwaway , but , thank you , really , thank you .
short version is i was really down , and just found and started reading one night , about 3/4 lit and  3/4 serious .
It's really great so may people care and try , for no benefit .

keep trying. please .
