I need someone to talk to. :(I've been having thoughts of suicide the past month or so. I feel like I'm so alone. I know it's bad but lately I think about it so much I can't do anything anymore. I usually try to distract myself with videogames, tetris, math and talking to someone. Now they don't work and there's no one I could talk to. I've been awake for more or less 30 hours. I can't sleep no matter how hard I try.
