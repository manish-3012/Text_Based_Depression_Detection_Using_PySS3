I don't think it will ever improve cause I never improve.This isn't some sad prediction about my future, this is a realisation that nothing will change if I don't change it. For some reason I refuse to change it.

When I go out to parties I like to drink and smoke and normally it leaves me emotionally unstable and suicidal. It fucks me up emotionally for a few days. I've tried going out sober but when it comes to it I get scared and stressed so I quickly grab a few drinks and drown out those feelings. On Tuesday I drowned out those feelings so much that I had my first panic attack then threw up bile into a toilet for over two hours.

Drinking is starting to ruin some of my friendships. A girl I talk to, who I think I'm falling in love with, told me she doesn't feel that she can talk to me when I'm fucked up cause I'm so unstable. She feels if she can't talk to me then we can't be friends. I apologise afterwards every time but she is tired of hearing me say sorry and never improving so I might lose a friend forever.

I'm going out on saturday, I'm going to try and go sober. Partly to save my friendship, regardless of the fact that she has told me it can't be for her because I'm fairly sure she doesn't come close to thinking of me that way and just feels responsible for me. But also to prove to myself that I can actually try. I'm meant to be starting some counseling soon and being assessed for therapy but both of those will be fucking useless if my worthless self won't do the work.

If I fail on saturday then I'm going to finally get round to killing myself because if i can't do that then there is no hope I ever improve so I may as well save everyone some stress. It won't be the first time I've left the house with the intention of dying, won't be the first time I've stood on the edge of a train platform and tried to jump. Hopefully, if I fail at being sober, I can at least succeed at dying.
