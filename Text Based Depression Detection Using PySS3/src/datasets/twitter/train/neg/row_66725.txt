Don't want to die but don't want to exist after breakupIdk.
Girlfriend just broke up with me.
I was at her place and just got home. During the walk home I kept thinking about what I should do. I feel terrible, but everything that came into my head felt pointless.
Jumping in front of a car - probably won't kill me, and I am afraid to die and of pain anyway. Same reasons why I won't take an OD of some medicine or some shit.
I thought about just hurting myself. But why. Then I thought about was to get artificial pleasure, like buying something or taking drugs or make myself cozy and watch a movie. But why.
I don't know what to do. Nothing makes sense. I am sorry if this is the wrong sup to post to, as I actually don't think I want to kill myself. But the thought kept crossing my mind. Now that I type it out I feel stupid. Millions of people went through worse breakups and have been fine. I just feel terrible right now and am directionless. I can't find reason to talk to a friend, or meditate, or do anything to get back on course. Because.. why?
