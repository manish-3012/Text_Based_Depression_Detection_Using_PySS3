Please donâ€™t read if you yourself are currently suicidalI donâ€™t want to trigger anyone or make anyoneâ€™s suicidal thoughts worse, I just need to speak to someone, anyone. I wish there was a way for me to end my life without my family being sad. I know itâ€™s impossible, and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m still alive. I feel like no matter whether I do it or not Iâ€™m hurting people I love. And I love them so much. I feel guilty for intertwining myself in their lives to the point where my death would really negatively affect them. Especially when I think of my mam, dad, sister and boyfriend. I feel guilty for wasting four years of NHS therapy for me to still be at this point. I feel guilty for not being the daughter my parents deserve and my boyfriend is the best person I know, he deserves the world. My OCD holds me back in life, it affects my whole family and also my boyfriendâ€™s life. The irony is, my OCD centres around the fear that people I love will get hurt, and yet by worrying about it, I end up hurting the people I love because they have to deal with my constant anxiety and depression. Itâ€™s an endless cycle. I really really want to have a positive impact on people and it seems like Iâ€™m negatively affecting people every day. As my depression has gotten worse Iâ€™ve gotten more withdrawn, meaner, more selfish and I donâ€™t really know why because in my head Iâ€™m screaming at myself for being this way. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m planning on achieving with this post, Iâ€™m just hoping someone can help somehow. I really want to be a good person my family can be proud of.
