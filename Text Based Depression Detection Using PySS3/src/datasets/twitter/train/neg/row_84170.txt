I just don't knowHello I suppose 

I've kind of traversed this sub before, reading and whatnot. I just wanted to talk to you all, or maybe no one. I don't know. I don't know if I care. I just want this to exist

I actually hate myself. I look everyday for something that I enjoy or something that makes me feel happy and I just feel empty. 

I was a lot worse off ~6 months ago, when I practically lost all communication with everyone... Basically the only person I had communicated with just kind of up and left never to speak to me again and I just spent a lot of time alone. I thought about suicide a lot, about how I'd do it, the best way, the quickest, the cheapest, the least painful, etc. I never really got around to doing anything because I lacked stones. I suppose that's a good thing.

Anyway, fast forward to now, after recovering slowly in that time, I feel it all slipping away again. I shouldn't because of the whole "you've got your whole life ahead of you, you have nothing to be worried about. You don't deserve to be depressed." And I get that - I don't. But I am. And I'm sorry. This has gone off topic. I think. I don't know.

This probably isn't even the right place to put this. Now I sound like I'm playing the sympathy card. Sorry.
