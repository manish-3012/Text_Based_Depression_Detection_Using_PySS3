Nothing seems real anymoreTitle says it all. I've been feeling like this for a few years now. I don't feel alive, I just feel blah about everything. I always find a hobby that I get good at doing and then I just burn out on it and never do it again. I often find myself thinking, "Why should I be here?" 


I am constantly thinking about suicide, but I just don't want to leave my wife behind with nothing. I had tried killing myself several years ago and after that I met my wife and things started getting better. But now I'm just heading down that road again. I'm scared Reddit. I don't know what to do anymore.
