Idk what to doI'm not gping into detail to keep this short but basically I've been suicidal for years and it's only gotten worse. I have no one i can really turn to and I've lost everything that mattered to me also all interest in everything. I've been on several different meds and tried therapy several times, nothing helps everyday i plan different ways to do it it's really all i can think about. All my problems just keep getting worse
