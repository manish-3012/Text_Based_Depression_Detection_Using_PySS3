I feel like a 'joke person'\- and eternally unwanted.

I just switch between hating humanity and then realising "I'M the problem. I'm the piece of shit. I deserved it. All of it" because I just think about all the times I have been mean/offensive or used as the butt of a joke and how none of it can be undone and also never taken back.

And I've said this before, but I feel like life is an inside joke that I'm never going to be 'let in' on. For starters, I'm fucking 20 years old and have never been kissed because of my what I believe are called "mommy issues". Only ever had friends who just used me to avoid their problems because I've always been a painful people pleaser (or I pushed them away.)

The truth is I'm fucking garbage who was only put here to make other people feel better about themselves when they compare themselves to me. Fucking great. Well, it's finally time to throw out the trash - trash that would otherwise only ever amount to getting raped over and over :)
