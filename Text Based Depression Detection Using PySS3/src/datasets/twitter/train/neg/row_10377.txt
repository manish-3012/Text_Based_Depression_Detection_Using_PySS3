This is it.Well tonight was the night I guess I found what I was looking for. Itâ€™s been ~2 months since the breakup and I have gone no contact for the majority of that time but I still check up on her social media anonymously. Today I went to pay a friend on Venmo when curiosity got the best of me and I looked her up; she paid someone for a â€œclassâ€. I looked this person up on IG and found that the class is some sort of â€œfellatio learning classâ€ to which was already a punch in the gut because it feels like sheâ€™s learning for someone else. It didnâ€™t end there because I just love to make myself miserable. I watched the live feed of the class and saw her there in a room full of 20 other women and one guy, one guy who sorta looks like me sitting right next to her.  

Iâ€™m devastated but I guess I deserve it for stalking her. Reality is a punch in the gut because I havenâ€™t wanted to let go. 

Iâ€™m afraid of myself right now, my mind keeps telling me to just end it all already because Iâ€™ll never find someone I loved as much as her. Only to be thrown out like nothing and replaced. Iâ€™ll never be as happy again.
