Tonight..I'm so done. I hate everything. I have no friends. I don't get any enjoyment out of anything I do, besides sleep. Tried to make a throwaway, but even reddit doesn't like me. Who cares. It's not like anyone knows who I am anyways. I have a pretty bad medical problem going on right now. Potentially life-threatening. But I'm too embarassed/stupid/guilty/ashamed to seek help for it. I was even just in the ER. and nothing. I'm just done. Peace.
