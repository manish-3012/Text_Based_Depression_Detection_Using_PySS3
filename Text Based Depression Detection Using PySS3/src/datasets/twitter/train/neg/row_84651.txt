Homeschool makes me want to kill myselfI'm crying while writing this and I'm just writing what comes to my mind 

I'm isolated in a rural area with no real friends. I struggle to complete my daily schoolwork without going in my bathroom to cry. I feel hopeless stupid and alone and i honestly dont know if I can continue this without trying to kill myself. My parents tell me about how "X got all her homeschooling done in a month" and that just makes me feel like a massive fucking idiot who cant get anything done. I'm also completely friendless and that makes me wanna die even more. I cant go back to regular school because I struggle 10x more because of my anxiety and I cant be not weird to the point I make people uncomfortable. I honestly just feel like a disappointment to everyone and massive fucking waste of human flesh.
