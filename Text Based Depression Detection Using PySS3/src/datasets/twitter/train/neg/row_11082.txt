It's confusing to live when you didn' t expected thatI don't have any dreams, any plans, hobbies. There aren' t things i wanna do, there aren't people I want meet. I never supposed I will make to 21. Life is to hard, not satisfying, and harmful that I really didnt expect that. Living this emptiness is pointless. We were supposed to be higher than animals, yet I am just even worse, since I don't have instinct to live. It's confusing to live without anything..
