( just for discussion )1) I wonder if there r ppl in this world who have never considered suicide or know what it's like to feel suicidal.

2) I wonder if everyone is this world were given an option to leave this world legally and without pain.   . would they consider it?

What do u think? Can you recommend any other place ( sub ) where it would be appropriate to ask this?
