Canâ€™t Think of a Title ATMI felt the urge to search for this subreddit tonight and browsing through the post of others having similar issues had open my eyes, but I sill need to get things off my chest.

I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m really suicidal or if Iâ€™ll ever go through with killing myself... I just know that I have persisting thoughts of my death being the answer to my problems. Those problems, that youâ€™re probably familiar with, being jobless, having social anxiety, feeling guilt of burdening my family, and living with nonexistent self-esteem.

I know that things will get better EVENTUALLY... as long as I keep taking steps forward. Or try to. Iâ€™m on quite the rejection streak for my job applications. Iâ€™m applying to go back to college as like a last gamble (hello debt). 

I currently have a dog who Iâ€™m emotionally dependent on, which I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s a good thing or not. Heâ€™s what I look forward to the most each day and has kept me going lately, but my family says he has got to go. What hurts the most is that I know I have no right/say to this matter. I canâ€™t support him. Heâ€™s still currently with me until Tuesday or so but Iâ€™m going through separation anxiety just thinking about it. What depresses me about this is that theyâ€™re sending him to live with a relative (who doesnâ€™t understand that you canâ€™t feed dogs certain things, like chocolate or cooked bones, and the consequences arenâ€™t just a little stomachache. This person also lets their own dog wander off to the next town over and had to be contacted by a shelter who found him) for a while and then back to his previous owner who neglected him outside (I was told he was tied up on a short chain and covered in his own feces) which is bringing me endless worries. This is a dog who had laid beside me every night for the last half year. Who I had spent so much effort to teach basic commands like stay, shake, and roll over. Who I greet with hugs and kisses every time I come back home from an errand. At this point I guess that itâ€™s obvious whatâ€™s got me so riled up tonight. Iâ€™ll try to convince them to find a more qualified person to take him in.

I love my family. They put up with a loser like me, but I canâ€™t help feel frustrated. It doesnâ€™t help with comments like â€œstop overthinking (Iâ€™m not) and grow up, hurry up and get a job to support yourself, itâ€™s just a dogâ€.

I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going with this.
