I donâ€™t want school to startMy mental health is finally getting a bit better, that school gave us a break. But I know as soon as I have to go back Iâ€™m gonna fall right back, school drained me so much and I remember staying up till 4am to complete my assignments because it got so overwhelming somehow I still have received all Aâ€™s since the beginning of quarantine. I just know Iâ€™m gonna start going back to the asshole I was and that scares me. School is not useful half the 3/4 of the things they teach we will never use, itâ€™s just draining. Itâ€™s all about grades not learning. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m learning to try and not take it so heavily
