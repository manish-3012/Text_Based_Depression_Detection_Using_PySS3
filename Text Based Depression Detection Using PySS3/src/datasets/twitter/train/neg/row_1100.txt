Job slavery increases thoughts of suicideI donâ€™t see a point for working for a living at some dead end job that I wonâ€™t enjoy doing for my whole life. My life projection consists of staying at my dads place until heâ€™s passed away then it will probably be a matter of time until Iâ€™m homeless unless my sister gets a job. I just feel like a burden at this point amounting for nothing. 

I got in contact with disability employment services to find work just to keep my dad happy. So Iâ€™ll just ride it out with this employment crap while my dad is alive then after that just die from starvation out in a secluded area in my town. And Iâ€™m surprisingly comforted with this thought that one day this rat race will be over.
