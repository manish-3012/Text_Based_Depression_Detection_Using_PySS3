Yeah I want to go.I have no job, no friends cus my mental illness has pushed them all away out of paranoia that they'll leave or do me wrong, no education because I left out of immense depression, no drive, no potential, no nothing. I'm not going anywhere. 
As a woman I've had my struggles. All that makes me happy is my video games but that love is quickly slipping away from me.

I've made attempts in the past. Overdosing on naproxen, drinking a whole bottle of sleeping medicine... but I never followed through because I'm a God fearing coward.
I'm a disappointment. Everyone around me is happy and stable while I'm crumbling and yeah I'm crying for help but maybe I don't want it.
Me and my old best friend don't talk anymore. He was the one that hastily drove to me when I told him I drank a whole bottle of ZZZquil while walking during late hours of the night in NYC.
I miss him.
I'm sad that I'm in a shitty place in life and all I can do is cry about it.

I miss my old job. I used to work at Best Buy and I loved it but I left because I was heavily pushed around by my direct supervisor at the time and a coworker in my department who also molested me but I didn't say anything at the time because I didn't want drama. I loved working there. 

I want to curl up in my bed and cry. I'm not going anywhere in my life. I want to take this whole bottle of muscle relaxers and call it a life.
