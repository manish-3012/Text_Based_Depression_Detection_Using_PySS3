So pretty sure I am going to do it now. I cant get help.There are many things worse than death and one of them is the psych ward.

I want and need help but I cannot get it because of fucked up duty of care. That would mean I would go to the psych ward - aka mental health drunk tank - and get beaten up by the arseholes there and 
treated like a 5 year old by the staff.

I am so, so tired. I just want out. If I cant get help to fix it I'd rather just end it.

I am a proud person who would rather die then be belittled by these psych ward dicks.
