I wish there was a way to dissappear completelyThis was supposed to be the best time in my life. I've always been depressed but recently it's gotten worse. My boyfriend of four years who I was sure I was gonna marry broke up with me and my favorite grandma died. I'm not going to transfer schools like I originally planned because I'll lose my mind. My family has been busy and so have my friends. I can't take it anymore. 

I wish I could just dissappear... Like go missing and never be found. I think about booking a plane ticket somewhere and just not going on it and instead buying a bunch of sleeping pills and passing out in some forest somewhere. My family won't know although they'll be worried. I'm not scared to die but I don't want to hurt my family. They're all I've got even if they're not very supportive.
