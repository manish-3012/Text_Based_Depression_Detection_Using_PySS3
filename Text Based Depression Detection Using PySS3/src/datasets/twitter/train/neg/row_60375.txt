Finally doing it tomorrowOr at least, driving and trying muster up the courage to jump again. Been a few years since my last "attempt" (chickened out last minute) but I think this time it'll finally happen. My parents are older, I no longer have any friends IRL, my siblings are more self-sufficient than ever - no one truly needs me, at least not for much longer if they do at all. Everyone will survive if I go, but if I stay my suffering will just continue endlessly. I don't see [another good day](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ijdxh) ahead. Just wanted to say thanks for the help you've given me over the years, truly helped me prolong my life...even if it was pointless.  

Not like I've done anything truly good with my life in the past 10 years since my first attempt. Just alienated friends, hurt people that cared about me, and just been a general dick to everyone who ever took the time to get to know me. Wish I could change but I honestly don't see the point. Not like there's anything I want to do in this world that I haven't been able to. I just don't want to do anything period. So fuck it.
