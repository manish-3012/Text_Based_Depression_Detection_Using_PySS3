Realization of DepressionImagine this, imagine that you finally get that engineering degree from college after 6 years of fighting only to find out that the real world has nothing for you. That it was completely meaningless in the first place, that all your hard work, everything you've ever worked hard for meant nothing. It was a waste. I can't get a job because I have no experience and I can't get experience without a job. Degree was just a piece of paper. And now depression/anxiety got me in it's grasp and I know if I talk to people I will choke or lock up. I can't do interviews because I'm depressed and I'm depressed because I don't have a job. I have nothing going for me; No friends, no career, and no fun. I just work this shitty job as a substitute teacher's aid for for special needs kids and I totally hate it. Been working this job for 4 years now, and it has gotten me nowhere. I wish I could just die. The agony that my dreams have been crushed by my inability to progress and proceed for the next step. Everything I've learned in college has faded away as everyday I watched YouTube videos. I have lost all motivation to live. I used to have a drive, passionate, to get out of bed every morning and enjoy my day. Now, it's me in my bedroom, dark, cold, alone with my phone and my thoughts of the future. I want to end it all, but if Hades is real then fk. I want to numb the pain. Taking antidepressants but they do nothing. I'm lying to my mom that they are working. I can't live on like this.

I want to die because I cannot live. 
I'm sorry, I have failed you. ðŸ”«
