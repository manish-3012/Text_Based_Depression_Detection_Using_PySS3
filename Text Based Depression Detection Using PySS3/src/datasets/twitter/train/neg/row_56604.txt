I seriously donâ€™t want to be aliveSo many thoughts are going through my head right now. I donâ€™t know how to handle it. I canâ€™t even distract myself. There are so many things that I want to do. Iâ€™m done feeling this way. Everything hurts too much. I canâ€™t take it anymore. If I donâ€™t end up killing myself, my thoughts will.

I canâ€™t keep going on like this. I just need to be gone.
