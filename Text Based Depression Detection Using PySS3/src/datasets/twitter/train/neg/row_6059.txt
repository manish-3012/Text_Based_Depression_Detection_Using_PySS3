I have a deep pit in my stomach that craves affection from a woman the affection even though Iâ€™ll never get one since Iâ€™m a horrible person, and itâ€™s driving me off the railsToday I got kicked out of a store after I saw an adult couple making out in an isle and I started screaming and threw a tantrum, I tried to punch the guy but he was way stronger than me and just pushed me off. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can live like this
