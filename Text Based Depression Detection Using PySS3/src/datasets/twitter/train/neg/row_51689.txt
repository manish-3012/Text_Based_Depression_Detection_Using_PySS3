How do I learn to live for myself?I'm somewhat of a suicidal person.. But my main reason for not killing myself is that fact that I have others to live for. I've attempted once and have been so close many other times. I understand it may be selfish to be unhappy even though I have those who love me, but if anything it makes me feel even more guilty that I can't be happy for the ones I love.

I've heard it might be a good idea to live for myself (not from those around me, but from internet sources and such. no one knows these deep thoughts I have) .. but I don't really know how I would go about doing that.. I feel like I can't just get up and leave what I'm doing in order to find "happiness"

thoughts and advice would be appreciated.
