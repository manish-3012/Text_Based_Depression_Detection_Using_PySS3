Two Dead Kids.Recently my seventeen-year-old cousin killed himself. It was a violent and foolproof method. He was my favorite. It'll be two months in 9 days, and surprisingly killing myself is all I can think about. It was a normal Friday, but after five, that's it. He was gone. It was that simple. There is no afterlife, no reincarnation. He's dead. I was lost at first, wondering why I had ever considered doing that to myself, but after enough time, I realized. I think the only reason I haven't done the same is that at my cousin's funeral my brother looked at me and he said, "I'm so glad that wasn't you."  This post isn't to be positive. I'm still struggling and I still wish I was dead. I was grounded recently and by that I mean all I have is my computer for school, but I'm abusing that. I live away from family and friends, so technology was all I had. All my resources, glued to a screen. This is my own personal hell. No one to talk to. Nothing. In the process of being grounded my parents told me they would no longer give me the things I want, which is fine. I have been awful to them. All I could hear the whole time was that I was a burden. No longer providing, treating them like shit, our relationship is awful and it's all your fault? They just told me they would be better off without me. I hadn't cut my wrists in two years, but I snapped. It was my proudest achievement, as it was a monumental spot and I still can't believe I fucked it up. The only reason I'm still here is because of what my brother said. We're ten years apart so we never spend time together, but I wait for the day we will.
