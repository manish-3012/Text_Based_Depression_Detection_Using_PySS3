I don't know what to do anymoreI want to apologize in advance for this jumbled wall of text.

I've tried to commit suicide twice so far, but couldn't bring myself to it. My anxiety has gotten to the point where even stepping foot outside is a major struggle. I feel like a useless piece of garbage. I read somewhere - if I remember correctly - that you don't want to actually die, you just want things to change. That's definitely true in my case. There are days when I'm all fine, doing well, but then I just spiral down the drain again. I've become numb and alien to my own feelings. Most of the time I just want to lie down and stay like that until I die.

I just typed this out in a sudden urge to somehow get a hold of myself. 

Thank you for reading
