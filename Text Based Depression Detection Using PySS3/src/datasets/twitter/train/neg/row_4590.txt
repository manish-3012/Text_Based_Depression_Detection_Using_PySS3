My ceiling is nice.Do you ever just sit in total silence in your house/apartment by yourself because nothing brings you joy anymore. You have a multitude of gadgets and other things within armâ€™s reach that could occupy your time, but you chose to just sit and stare at your wall or ceiling? Maybe after a bit, youâ€™ll start to cry? But no, most likely you wonâ€™t, and youâ€™ll just continue to stare ahead until the image gets fuzzy because you arenâ€™t blinking. This might go on for a few minutes. Whoâ€™s really counting anymore. Itâ€™s just you alone with your thoughts. Like it has been your whole life. And how itâ€™ll be until the end. Silence.

Then youâ€™ll get up and make a sandwich for lunch.



I canâ€™t wait to fucking kill myself.
