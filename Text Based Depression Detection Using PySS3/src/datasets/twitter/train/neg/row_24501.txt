LostI have the â€˜lifeâ€™ people dream about.  Wife, kids, house, job.  We have our needs covered and for the most part we are ok.  THe issue is I am not.  Work has beaten me into a shell.  I sit here in the early am and the thought of working feels me with dread.  I know I am depressed I know i shouldnâ€™t be but at the end of the day I have been pulled so thin.  I understand my parents now and why they made the choices they did.   I recorded good bye videos for my kids and my wife this morning.  Honestly it felt good.  It feels like closure.  I felt like i was on a solid path.  I had planned to hang myself.  Not the cleanest or easiest death I know but again something I control. i would do it in a place my family didnâ€™t have to deal with it.  Anyway I got to it and I chickened out of the pain to come.  I know it is short term pain but I didnâ€™t want it.  Maybe I am failing at even this.  I dont know..  

I just donâ€™t have anyone to reach out to.  Honestly if i talk to my wife she panics about our lifestyle and so on.   I donâ€™t sleep, I donâ€™t eat.  I am ready to move on as it were.  See whatâ€™s next.  My kids would be young enough they would get over it.   

I wonâ€™t lie the feeling of control and closure was the best i have felt in months.  All it needed was one last step and I failed and now it is back to dread and pain.
