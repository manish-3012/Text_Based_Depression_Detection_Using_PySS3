Feeling like I'm at the endSo I've been suicidal pretty much since I was 20. I'm 41 now, and after yet ANOTHER failed suicide attempt, I landed in rehab. Then I had another one and my already angry family isn't talking to me. 

Alone, no spouse, no kids, fairly low-paying job with not much future, a history of trauma, in SEVERE benzodiazapine withdrawal with not much of a good prognosis, lost my driver's license (forever unless I can borrow money and no one is giving it to me). And I'm on drugs for the withdrawal that erase my once genius-level IQ. 

I was an extremely gifted writer with a promising future. Very good education, but all I really want now is peace. I don't see much happiness coming my way, and that's not depression talking. Lonely holidays. I don't even have money or energy for a cat (sad). 

It's fairly extreme. I just don't want to keep doing this.
