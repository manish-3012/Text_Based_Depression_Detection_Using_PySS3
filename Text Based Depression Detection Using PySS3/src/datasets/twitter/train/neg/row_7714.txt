Failed my Senior Class. Won't Be Graduating On-Time. Came Close to Ending It.Just a vent.

I couldn't complete my project, despite having months to do it. So, I had to sign up to re-do the class. Because of the absolutly stupid way the classes are being offered next semester, I won't be graduating until this time next year....IF I don't fuck it all up yet again.

I'm so anxious and brain-fogged. I don't want to do anything except sleep, and the future feels too much to bear if I keep going like this.
