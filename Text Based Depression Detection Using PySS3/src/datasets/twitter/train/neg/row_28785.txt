Idk manI think Iâ€™m going to off myself, I havenâ€™t figured out how but Iâ€™m in college, not doing well socially or in a highly competitive organization Iâ€™ve joined. I can be socially awkward and have a bad time with self criticism (partly due too parents) I never had the opportunity to flesh out my quirks irl so they just cling and I seem to only find out through the pain of social backlash. Iâ€™m agnostic so I donâ€™t have the â€˜securityâ€™ of an afterlife and frankly idc at this point. Iâ€™m just too damn poor to buy myself a faster means of death and jumping.
