I dont want to die, but I cant stand to live anymoreI dont know who to turn to. My parents really dont care about my well being so I cant reach out to them (Last time I was suicidal, I told my mom during a breakdown and she laughed at me) Ive asked to see a therapist for years, but they think its a waste of money. Im a 16 year old thats not allowed outside the house to be able to get a job, so I cant afford any services. I honestly dont know how much more of this I can take. I dont know when things are going to get better or how much it will get better. I dont know if its worth it to endure everything im going through this just to get to a slightly better version of my life right now. I can only imagine more struggles in the future. The only reason I havent tried to commit suicide in a long time is that I will feel bad for my friend who will blame herself. I cant tell her much about how im feeling though because she will worry, and she doesn't deserve that. She has already had to help me through so much. She even let me in when I was homeless. I cant hurt her by putting this all on her but I dont want her to feel the blame of my death either.  Lately though the thought of her upset has not been enough to keep me from wanting to do it. I know thats selfish, but I cant stand this anymore. Everyday I feel like im going more and more crazy. The only crutch I have right now is drinking. I cant think of any reason besides hurting my friend to not do it. I cant think of any reasons besides missing out on future memories to stay alive, but I wonder is it even worth it to bear all the pain I will have to face to get to the few good moments in my life. I dont want to die, but I cant stand to live anymore.  I know I need help, but I dont have any money and I have no close friends to turn to. I feel like ive faded from reality already. Not many would really notice if I was actually gone
