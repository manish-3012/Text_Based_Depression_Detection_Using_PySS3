Stupid shitHey guys so Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for a bit now (since I was 7) and have attempted suicide once. I just built a garden bed and was doing fine after switching meds but now I just feel dead inside. My social anxiety makes it so Iâ€™m really loud and never really try on anything so people donâ€™t take me seriously, on the outside I seem happy whilst still planning my own death. I was doing really good for awhile but I started to sink into a hole again and having feelings for someone who hates me doesnâ€™t seem to help. I skipped 2 grades so Iâ€™ve been around older kids my entire life which Iâ€™ve fucking loved. Does this moment even matter, it is so insanely small on the grand scheme of things. I mean everythingâ€™s pre determined by the infinite amount of variables in this exact moment. Life is just a shitty illusion. Sorry for the horrible grammar I didnâ€™t really want to revise it too much.
