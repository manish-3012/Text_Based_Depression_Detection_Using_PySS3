That post-suicide fuck i survived guiltI mean when does it ever end. Its been a year. I've made dumb mistakes and fucked up worse after the attempt trying to handle the situation. I still get flashbacks from the hospital or time after. I still feel guilty and upset. I still feel disgusted. Thst my family knows. I feel sad. I feel ashamed and i just feel like a mess. Not to mention im just as depressed and suicidal so ugh.
Does it ever get better?
The guilt really does suck. I stopped going to therapy too because of the guilt.
