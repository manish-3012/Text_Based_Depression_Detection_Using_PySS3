Almost thereTwo days ago I wrote my suicide note. Today, I grabbed the pills. When I'm ready, I can end it. They don't care about me. They left me here to die for days. Not talking to me. They only fucking ask for me when they need something from me. Nothing more, nothing less. I want to escape. I want my revenge, my feeling that I have some power finally over them. Nobody gives a shit about me anymore, so why should I give a shit about anybody anymore. 

Soon, I'll be dead and I won't be a burden and everybody can finally forget that I ever existed. They can dump my body anywhere they want. If they cry, I'll only laugh since they had their fucking chance. I'll laugh because it's all fake. They didn't care about me. Nobody has ever cared about me. It was all fake for them to feel better about themselves. That's the only thing they cared about. Themselves.

What needs to be done, will be done.
