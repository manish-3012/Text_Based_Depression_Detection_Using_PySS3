Gonna attempt suicide. Might fail like every other time, but who knows? Maybe I'll be delightfully surprisedI love someone who will never love me back. That's the only good thing I had in my life and I fucked it up. I thought I can live with it, guess I'm wrong 

Turn 18 in 4 days btw. Funny, as a kid I never wanted to grow up. I guess I won't now
