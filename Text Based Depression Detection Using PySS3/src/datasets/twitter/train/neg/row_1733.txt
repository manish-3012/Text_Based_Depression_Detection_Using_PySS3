I only have a future of suffering ahead of me. I will do nothing but suffer and struggle and in the end I will be broke, alone, and spiteful. Why wait when I can end it now?25, no degree, no career, dealing with mental illness.  I take medicine and it doesn't help.  I can't drink alcohol or coffee because it would interact negatively with my medicine.  I can't have friends because I will provide no positive reason to be in their life.  My parents did nothing but make my life hell and they stole my life savings.  My brother doesn't acknowledge me.  The only comfort I have are my pets and I regret not being able to bring them the happiness that they deserve.  Once I find a way out, I can't bring them with me unless I find a way to afford it.

I had such a negative experience growing up and it continues to this day.  People tell me it will get better and I have a whole life ahead of me, but to me those are just empty platitudes.  
I know that I can find a way out of this but I don't believe it will ever make me happy, it can only make me slightly less miserable.

I don't have anything that brings me any kind of motivation.  I don't care about material goods, or visiting places, or being around people.  I don't care about parties, bars, or volunteering.  I don't care about any social cause.  I just don't care about anything.

I want to stand on a cliff and have one last look at the beauty in this world that will eventually be destroyed by man then end my life right there.

I'm not made for this world.  If there is the possibility of reincarnation, who knows, maybe I will have better luck then.
