My life went to shit in 3 monthsIn just 3 short months,  my life went from the best days of my life to a living hell. I developed chronic pain, anxiety, depersonalization, depression, OCD (I swear I'm not making this up, it's all diagnosed) and now... fucking tinnitus. I can't handle this anymore, every second of my life is a torture. I can't think of one good reason not to kill myself... my life is fucking ruined, in every way possible.
