Please help fellow RedditorsIâ€™m done. I canâ€™t do this any more. Hereâ€™s a little background for yâ€™all. Iâ€™m 12, and I have bipolar depression. I was diagnosed with it when I was 11, and I havenâ€™t felt happy since that time. Iâ€™m bullied at everything I do, even at the things I used to love, like gaming and music. When I was 4, my dad died of brain cancer. It was hard for me, but I pushed through the pain. But this year, it all came back. Everyday at school, Iâ€™m bullied because of this reason. Anytime I make friends, it blows up in my face, and I get beat up. A few weeks ago, we had a day where everyone could get in comfortable clothes, and watch a movie in the auditorium. We were allowed to bring a blanket and pillow. I brought a blue blanket, and a pillow made out of my dads shirt. It also had some text of his last words and his last heartbeats, I would send a picture if I could, but I decided to bring that. It was a big mistake. When we got in the auditorium, I settled down in the corner. I was fine for now, but then the kids that bully me came. They asked what the pillow was, and they all laughed. They took it away and ripped it up. Right then and there, something changed, part of my soul was lost, just like the pillow. I turned around and there was a pair of razors. I grabbed one and sliced one of the kids arms. They all ran away, but then the teachers came. They were running at me, and something in my mind said â€œdo it nowâ€ so I did. I slit my neck. I felt pain, and then just everything going dark. I woke up to my mom screaming at me but I didnâ€™t care. I wish they would have let me bleed out. But now its time for real. At least I think. I really want to die, but I everyone is keeping a close eye on me, and Iâ€™m keep being sent to mental hospitals. Please help me Reddit. Help me change whatever Iâ€™m thinking of doing and hurry. I donâ€™t want to, but part of my mind is saying to. Any help is highly valued. Just comment if you see this please. Just help me. Thank you.
