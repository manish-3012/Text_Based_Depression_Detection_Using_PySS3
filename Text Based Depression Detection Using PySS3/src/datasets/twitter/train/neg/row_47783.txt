What's the point?I'm on medication but i still feel like shit all the time, if i miss my medication one day I'll get a nervous outburst and almost kill myself if nobody stops me, i can't get any help from professionals because they just put me on hold or in a nut house, I'm already beyond saving so what even is the point in continuing
