I've taken my family's gun and am trying to find the strength to use it.Throwaway acct for obvious reasons.

I've taken my family's handgun. I have it in my room, and I plan to use it, but I'm scared. I don't want the shame of being found. I don't want the shame of ending my life. I don't want to be remembered for this. I don't want anyone to accidentally get hurt. I don't want our animals to get hurt. I don't want any of this. I never did. Everything fell out from under me, and there's no going back anymore. Just a matter of time now, I suppose.

The people here do good work. Truly, you do. I've popped in a couple of times to look through posts, and I have nothing but the utmost respect for those of you who respectfully try and help. Y'all are saints. Thanks for putting that effort forward.
