Going to fail my college classesLiving at home and having to do online classes is gonna make me fail. I was doing so well this semester actually and now i cant focus on lecture and I just sit around and think about how much I want to kill myself or am wishing I could go out and get some alcohol for relief or fucking something. But I'm stuck alone with my thoughts with no escape and it's really painful and I'm still expected to do all my class work like nothing has changed. If I fail these classes I think I might kill myself because then I am ruining my future and theres no hope for me to have money and therefore be happy and stable (yes money "buys" happiness because rn I cant even afford a therapist and my family has been through alot of hardship like not even having enough food to eat)
