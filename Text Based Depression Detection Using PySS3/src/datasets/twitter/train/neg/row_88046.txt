One last timeToday I went to see a play. After the play, I needed a ride from my roommates. They couldnâ€™t or wouldnâ€™t give me one. This brought me back to a crippling realization that I am alone. I have no friends, and I never will. This is something Iâ€™ve struggled to grapple with for many years. Iâ€™ve begun to accept it the past month. After I spent two hours walking home, I bought a knife from a Walgreens by my home along with some school supplies so I donâ€™t appear suspicious. I need to kill myself now. I canâ€™t take this crippling loneliness anymore. It tears me apart how empty everything is. Iâ€™ve posted earlier on here saying that I was going to shoot myself, but I didnâ€™t know gun laws in my state. I found out I canâ€™t get a gun if Iâ€™m under twenty one. I just dealt with the pain, and pressed on. Now itâ€™s just too fucking much. I only feel poison and toxicity from me. I canâ€™t get better. Life is just a pitfall right now. There isnâ€™t going to be another day. This isnâ€™t a call for help by the way. This is a note. Goodbye.
