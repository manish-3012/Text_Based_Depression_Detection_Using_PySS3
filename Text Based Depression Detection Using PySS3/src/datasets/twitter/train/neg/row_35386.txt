Just wanting to end the anxietyI'm sorry to post I know there a lot of the same stuff out there but I feel like my only out is suicide.
I booked a trip for next week with a friend that I now can't afford and don't know how to tell her that I can't go now
I've tried picking up a side gig to earn extra money and it's basically just hopeless because their customer service won't help me at all and there was an issue submitting my background check.
I've never been in a relationship and I'm 30.... I'm terrible with people and not attractive at all
My job is not important and I could be replaced in a week.
 I haven't been sleeping because I'm so stressed about everything. I just don't see another way out. I don't know how to pretend that there is a bright side anymore
