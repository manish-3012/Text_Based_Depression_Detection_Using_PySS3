I feel worthless when compared to my friendsI love my friends, but I feel that I can't engage any of them in conversation for more than a minute before I start hating the sight of them.  This isn't because they are assholes.  In fact, they are some of the nicest and best people that I have met.  All of my friends and I are in college.  When I get angry with them, it's because I know that I am not as good as they are.  They are all better than me.  I am a fat 20 year old lazy college student that can't even handle four classes a semester due to horrible procrastination.  They are all able to go to the gym, handle their classes, and work (some working late at night and somehow operate with very little sleep). 

 Instead of studying, going to class, getting a job, or even just going to the gym, I will spend all day sitting at the computer looking at Reddit or Netflix.  Most days, I don't even shower.  Hell, I don't even like being on Reddit or Netflix.  I want to study, go to the gym, work, and function like my friends, but I just can't get away from the computer.  I want to hide from the world and waste away.  I am scared of being judged.  I hate how I treat my friends.  I hate what I look like.  I hate what I think about.  I hate how I act.  I hate that I am writing this.  I feel like I will be judged as an attention seeker by posting this, and that makes me scared.

I've tried to kill myself before, and that was at a time when I was feeling more content with life.  With a huge exam coming up in this next week, I should be studying, but I feel like I shouldn't even bother.  I almost expect that I will be dead within the next few months anyway...  I'm just rambling, but I don't really care at this point.  I'm going to just hit submit before I back out for the umpteenth time.
