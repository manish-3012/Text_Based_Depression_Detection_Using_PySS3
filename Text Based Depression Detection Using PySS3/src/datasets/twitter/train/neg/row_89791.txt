I wanted to share that i'm no longer suicidal.Sure, I'm still depressed and I have thoughts of suicide, but I have found a reason to live. My girlfriend is my drive, she is my motivator, I am grateful she is in my life and has chosen not to leave. Eleven days from now marks our one year anniversary and I couldn't be happier. So instead of planning out suicide, my thoughts are focused on paying off my credit card so I can meet her in person again. Because if she leaves, that's it. I won't be able to go on. I won't kill myself, but I will give up on anyone and everyone. I will never find another like her. I will spend every last cent I have, max out my credit card and go homeless until I die of starvation or get arrested. But hopefully that never happens.
