Trapped and quickly reaching the end of my optionsI have battled depression for almost my entire life. I have PTSD because my parents were abusive monsters on top of that. 

I have tried a slew of drugs. And for many years one helped me through. It didnâ€™t make me happy but provided a reasonably high floor. But that drug has become less and less effective over the past 2 years. I have been clinically depressed for almost year straight. 

I am finishing up a trial for a new drug, but while itâ€™s effects are quick, they are not long-lasting. Not a viable option, long term. I am now moving on to TMS, which is partially covered by insurance but will still cost me over $1,000 out of pocket. ($1000 I donâ€™t really have) I am told my next option would be ECT (electro-convulsive therapy) which is hardly ideal. 

I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. I canâ€™t seem to stop feeling bad, so I just want to stop feeling anything. 

But I have two beautiful kids who would be devastated if they lost me. They are the only reason I push on. But it is becoming harder and harder to stay. 

For now, I will push on. Hoping the next treatment is the one that finally works. 

I feel trapped. I feel sad. I feel empty. 

I want to die.
