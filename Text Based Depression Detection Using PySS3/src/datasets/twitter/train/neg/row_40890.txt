I contemplated suicide earliermy grandma who has been the closest, best person in my life passed away on April 21
I have been I shock until last week
I canâ€™t breath I canâ€™t move I canâ€™t feel
I feel only sadness
I put on this fake mask because I go to therapy 2x a week.
I thought about killing myself.
I didnâ€™t have a plan, but  I wanted to die. To stop the sadness and to be with her.
I have a phobia of death, so I never went past the though. 
can someone please give me any advice?
