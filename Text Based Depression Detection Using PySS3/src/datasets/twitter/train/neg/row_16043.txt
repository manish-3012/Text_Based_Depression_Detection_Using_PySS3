Thereâ€™s so much sad here so I want to add some happy :)I love my girlfriend so fucking much. She gave me a reason to live, she gave me everything. Itâ€™s my first proper relationship and itâ€™s amazing. Iâ€™m clean and I havenâ€™t had a suicidal thought in a week or so. Sheâ€™s amazing and beautiful and fucjing gorgeous and I love her. She accepts me for who I am and I accept her for who she isðŸ’•

Just a reminder that I was suicidal and self harming everyday a bit ago, it may not seem like it but thereâ€™s hope. Thereâ€™s a chance it can get better, keep going. You wont regret it :) Iâ€™m here for you and Iâ€™m proud of you
