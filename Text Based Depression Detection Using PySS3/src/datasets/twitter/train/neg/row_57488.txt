Im ending itIve been misÃ©rable my whole life, been living with depression and stress for several years. Ive managed the anxiety and stress. But fuck it, if i had a gun right now i would do it(theres no.coming back from that). Im exhausted, i know i still have a lot to live, but if everythings gonna be like it has been i just dont want to wait anymore for sething good  to happen in my life . im tired, im alone, my family wont understand, but the first thing im.gonna do is get a dealer for a gun and go straight for it. Im a good person, truly, but the law of attraction has been the most ridiculous law that ive been following. Ill post the day, the hour, and tell you where to check. Good bye reddit. Ive been a lurker for 5 years, and i was contempt with ur advices. But fuck life, im not living anymore. Sorry father, sorry mother, sorry brother, its not your fault its my destiny.
