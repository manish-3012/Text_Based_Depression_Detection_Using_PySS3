so im pretty sure i'm going to die tonighti'm a little drunk but i haven't wanted to live for a long time. it's been just under a year since my last attempt (june 10th) and I want to die. i wish i wasn't alive. I hate myself. I don't think I should reproduce. I literally have all the stuff laid out in front of me. I worry that my roommate will find me. i don't want that. I don't want to live.
