I hate myself and I want to dieEver since [this](http://redd.it/p7fgv) happened. I just can't feel better. She was everything. I spend all day entertaining dark thoughts, I haven't been eating much I close my eyes and hope with all my will that I won't ever open them again. I just want the pain to stop and I don't want it to ever repeat. I tried alcohol but that doesn't really help once all the other people are gone and I'm left alone with my thoughts. I just want to violently attack myself and I would but I'm too depressed. Or maybe I'm just a coward. Or maybe this is also part of that curse.
