Just a voice within the voidIâ€™ve realized that I donâ€™t have the resources that would make a suicide successful, and I donâ€™t want to end up trapped. I just need to let things out thatâ€™s not on my main socials because Iâ€™m tired of my impulsivity getting the better of me and being embarrassed later on. I feel so stuck and itâ€™s almost like thereâ€™s something sitting on me and it wonâ€™t let me up. I know itâ€™s only me, myself, and I who is doing this to me. I just want the hole to go away or to at least become manageable. I spend my paychecks on weed and things I donâ€™t need because shopping and feeling disoriented for a bit make it easier. I had so much time for school and now itâ€™s gone, I have so many things to do and itâ€™s like Iâ€™m frozen and all this shit is flying past me. I donâ€™t have any real stable friends anymore, besides ones that live in other states. My room is so bad, itâ€™s disgusting. Every area of walking space is filled with things and trash, same as my bed. The only section of my bed thatâ€™s clean is where I sleep. Itâ€™s been like this for so long now. I guess I keep expecting it to just go away but it never does. I know what I have to do and that Iâ€™m the one who has to do it. I just needed to let things out. Thanks for the ears Reddit
