How do I tell my fiancÃ© that I still feel suicidal?Iâ€™ve been dating my fiancÃ© for 10 wonderful months. We met through a suicide/depression support chat. He has given me happiness, stability, unending love/understanding, and future goals (something I never thought I would have). He has truly changed my life. However, I have been passively or actively suicidal since I was 14. I have a genetic illness that affects my joints which makes everyday life painful and has limited my abilities. I used to be athletic, busy, and slim. Now I can barely walk and have gained weight, though Iâ€™m still skinny so really I shouldnâ€™t be complaining. The worst part is that my illness has ripped my vet tech career right out of my hands just as I was really gaining traction and found my dream job in a ER/ICU. My career is my passion, itâ€™s one of those â€œwho I amâ€ jobs. Not being physically able to do it has honestly devastated me. I go through phases where Iâ€™m ok, and phases where I feel like Iâ€™m mourning who I was and what couldâ€™ve been. My condition has gotten worse, I have been stuck at an intern-level position at my dream job (because I can physically do it and my employer has been AMAZING and worked with me to make sure I have income until I can go back to being on ICU floor). 

I have hit one of those bad phases. I want to self-destruct everything around me so that I wonâ€™t hurt anyone but myself. Because of this, I second guess my fiancÃ© for ridiculous and illegitimate reasons and I want to push him away so he wonâ€™t get â€œinfectedâ€ by my hurt. He has changed my life and I love him with all my heart, but I canâ€™t keep going through phases of needing to destroy myself and everything around me without him knowing. How do I tell him? I donâ€™t want to make him feel like he isnâ€™t good enough or something like that. But I also donâ€™t want to force all of my problems into him and be a dark cloud in his life. I donâ€™t want to die right now, not really. I just need to tell someone, especially him, that my heart squeezes every day with the need to self-destruct and I lay awake at night second guessing everything. How do I word it to gain support without pity or hurting him in the process?
