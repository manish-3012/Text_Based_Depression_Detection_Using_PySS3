Fuck lifeI was getting out of it, I stopped watching porn, hot back with my old friend. Everything was getting back together, but FUCK NO I had a test from maths and I couldn't do it. I just couldn't think clearly, I'd probably done it but I couldn't fight of the stress and the spiraling thoughts. I am now crying because I gave up, I completed one exercise without breaking down, but when I did I said fuck it and send it back. I probably won't pass in math. I feel like I'm good at it but the stress and the thoughts prevent me from doing it. It doesn't get better with time belive me. I feel like a bomb- I can try to get my life together but when something bad happens it just all goes to shit. I'm 16, don't have a gf, performing worse and worse at school, my parents don't understand me and only want good grades. I think every single day about suicide because I see it as the only option. I can't love my parents for the shit they did to me, I never loved them, I just want to escape all of this shit and be alone, without my family and without anyone.
