I been lurking this sub on and off for the past 4 years.I suggest everyone get therapy treatment.
Venting about killing yourself on a masked world we call the internet does you no good at all.
I mean at ALL.
People are savages in a bad way.
So get professional help or call a helpline because this sub is going to only make things worse.
And I am coming from the side of been there done that more than anyone else, or at least the top 1% of this category.
You can get out of hell, once you do even the smallest things in life will feel like heaven.
So STRAP THE FUCK UP and let's get some sessions done.
Best of Luck
