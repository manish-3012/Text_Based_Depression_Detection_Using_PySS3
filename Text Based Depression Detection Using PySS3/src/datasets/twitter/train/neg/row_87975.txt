LonelinessI donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll handle the real world. Iâ€™m graduating tomorrow and I just feel lost. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll find a real job or anything. I donâ€™t know how to navigate the real world at all.   

Lately Iâ€™ve also been craving more romantic intimacy- which I canâ€™t get. I feel like Iâ€™m incapable of ever having a partner who really loves me. Iâ€™ve never had a real relationship in my life. I have lots of friends, but lately I just really want something romantic. Iâ€™m not ready for it anyway, but Iâ€™m still sad that Iâ€™m graduating college and still havenâ€™t really dated.  I just feel lonely.
