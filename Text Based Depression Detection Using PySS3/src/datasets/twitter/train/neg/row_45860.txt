I just don't know what to do. My question is suicide or not?Note: I'm *probably* not going to commit suicide
The thing is.. I'm sooooooo tired (not physically) and I don't know what to do. Every day I'm dragging myself up the stairs to my room. I have a pretty good life. I've not really gone through abuse although my childhood was a little rough. And no, my parents are great and they can't exactly be blamed just... it wasn't the best experience. In these past few years, I've been constantly stressed and worried about my life. And for some reason, I have become less and less responsive. I used to cry a shit ton, not going to lie. Now, I find myself extremely sad, but unable to cry because I am so tired. My self-hate definitely doesn't help with how sad I feel. The pain seems limitless like I'm pulling it up from an endless hole. 
I always feel horrible to my parents and anyone on the planet because I have such an easy life compared to what others or even you who is reading this post. And sometimes I wish I could just take everyone's pain and bear the burden of it because I know how much it hurts. I often feel like I don't deserve to be alive and that I'm just a horrible person in general. 
I'm really lazy, and I don't do what I should. I know I, even at this moment, should be studying for stuff and learning/doing more practice for standardized tests. And I hate myself for not being able to do it. What I realized recently is that... I hate myself more for doing the things I love and I hate myself less for doing the things I hate. It kind of sucks. 
If you bothered to read this to the end, thanks. I hope whatever that's happening to you gets better or is already good. Sorry if any part of this makes you mad, I really just needed an outlet.
