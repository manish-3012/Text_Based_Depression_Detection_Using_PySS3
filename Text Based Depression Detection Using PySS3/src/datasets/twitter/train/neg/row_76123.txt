Hi, I'm a piece of shit and everyone else is a bigger piece of shitI don't see the point of living when I a huge piece of shit feel morally superior to 90% of people. Everyone is so fucking cruel, everyone just cares about themselves and wouldn't lift a finger to do good if it doesn't help themselves in some way (either by making them look good or otherwise lifting them higher up from the position they were at). I hate everyone, there are only a handful of people who are genuinely good and do good to this world for the sake of good.
