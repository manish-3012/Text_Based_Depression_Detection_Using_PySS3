Running out of hope4 years ago I started getting serious help for my depression. I did Cognitive Behavioral Therapy weekly for almost 2 years. I did medication trials for over a year. And I am just finishing up TMS therapy. None of it has worked. 

4 years ago was the first time I felt actively suicidal. It was a clear shift in my thoughts. I still remember the day it happened. It was a truly awful day and I was just standing around in a classroom and the thought popped into my headâ€” â€œyou could do it tonight.â€ It just felt different. 

Back then I browsed â€œright to suicideâ€ forums almost daily. I read so many heartfelt stories, many of them from people who had undergone years of treatment with no results. I decided a year later that I wasnâ€™t going to end my life without seriously trying to get better. 

I want to make it clear that I know being able to get this treatment is a privilege, especially in the US where healthcare is treated as a commodity and not a right. I also think that everyone should try treatment if they have the means to. 

My point is, 4 years later, and Iâ€™m still as sick as I was then (and many thousands of dollars poorer, might I add). But now I donâ€™t even have hope that I can get better. I didnâ€™t realize how much the hope I had kept me going, because it never felt like I had much. I donâ€™t think I did, actually. I think I was running on fumes, but now Iâ€™m completely out. TMS was my last hope, itâ€™s framed as the holy grail of treatment. And it isnâ€™t working. 

All I can think of is suicide. I want to get better so bad and I just canâ€™t.
