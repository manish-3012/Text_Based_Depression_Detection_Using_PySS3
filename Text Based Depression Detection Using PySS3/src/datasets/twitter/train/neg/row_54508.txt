I keep going back and forthNo matter how much my life gets better I keep leaning towards suicide. I don't want to sound ungrateful for all the opportunities I've been given but I just wanna die. I love my family and my friends but recently I feel like I'm not meant for this world no matter what happens. I feel selfish for thinking these things as people around the world are in terrible situations but I think that I'm not meant for this place and have done my time. I don't know what to do because medication doesn't work. I'm in high school and people say its stressful but I don't think I can do this. I'm a fucking bitch to people so who the fuck would even miss me other than my family. I talk shit and can't handle the comments back like an idiot. I'm constantly lying to others, I refuse to eat nice food, I'm just an asshole. I'm so young but I have been given so much bad news in my life already and was diagnosed with a rare form of fibromyalgia called amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome (AMPS) and I'm in the 5% where the ridiculously expensive treatment didn't work. I'm tired of mentally and physically being in pain and don't know what to do. Help me please.
