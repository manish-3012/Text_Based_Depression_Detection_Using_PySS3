Out of place I guess?(18,f) I tried to kill myself when I was 15.  I never imagined i would live this long. Last year I was in a really scary place in my head and I thought I would kill myself but i couldn't cause there were too many people interacting with me at the time. 

Now, I'm still alive and not as depressed as I used to be but I can't help but feel like I'm too inadequate to be alive. There must be something inherently wrong with me...I keep thinking back to that time I was throwing up, bleeding in the bathroom when I was 15 and I think if I had just gone through with it and ended it right there I would have finally done something right in my life...I still feel like shit being alive...does anyone else feel that regret? How do you deal with that?
