Life is toughTomorrow is my birthday but i don't feel like i belong anywhere. Everyone treats me like a ghost whenever i talk to someone they ignore me or get mad at me. But whenever someone needs me im there for them always. I never understood what its like to be wanted by anyone. I've never had a chance to find love out of twenty years of my life. I never knew what it's like to have a friend. I never even met my own dad that died years ago. I just want to dissapear. I feel as no one would care anyways.
