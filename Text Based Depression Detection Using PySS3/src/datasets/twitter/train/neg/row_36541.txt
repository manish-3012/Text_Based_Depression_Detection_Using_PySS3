Hello..I am not sure I am in right place...but I just feel so toped on the edge.
Was a very bad week, (hey Christmas), stress and all. 
Good thing - got a therapist at last, after 14 months,  he seems nice.
Then, ha, despite knowing better I just had to go andengage in some shite Reddit post and comments, which I thought I related too.

 Ending up triggered, miserable and ...things. 
What is wrong with me..
