it's almost like a physical illnessmy grandmother died and everyone has been saying they're relieved that she's no longer suffering because she was in so much pain for the last few years that there was no quality of life left for her.

i realised this is how i feel about my life. i have melancholic depression and have no means of feeling real happiness without feeling sick or sad as a result. when i'm really stressed out i relieve the feeling of the noose that i tied around my neck once and almost lost consciousness, and then i remember what made me get up and my responsibilities to the people i care about continue to keep me alive in this in between state. i don't want to burden others with my death but i can feel the insides of me carry this sickening feeling as if it was rotting away. the only thing that helps me feel better is knowing that i can kill myself when the time comes but i just can't deal with leaving my parents behind.
