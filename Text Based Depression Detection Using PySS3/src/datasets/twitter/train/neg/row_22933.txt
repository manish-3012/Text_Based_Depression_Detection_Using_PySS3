How to say goodbye.So many people are so sad.  I am tired of waking of each day to this life.  The last 3 years have been hell and I am to the point I am done.  I have a serious brain condition that leaves me with great pain.  Living a life of pain is not a life.  I am just worried I dont know how to say goodbye to my Mom.  I dont want her to find a mess but I want to say goodbye cleanly. Sadly we dont have assisted suicide in US.  I dont know how to handle this but everyday I wake up is just another day of torture.  This is my life and I am the one who has to live with this daily.  I am a 30 year old male and I'd love to live just not with this pain.  I tried numerous things for 3 years and nothing is changing.  At some point when the negative outweighs the positive you have to face the facts.
