NOT THINKI am brave. Or so I though so. Iâ€™ve been to war, Iâ€™ve gotten shit and gave shit back, military woman that walked the walk and talked the talk. Recently, I feel like I have lost more than I won.  I feel like I lost my way. I feel like maybe those whom I love and love me back canâ€™t keep
up with my sadness and stillness, I sure donâ€™t want them to. I want them to fucking live. 

Never before have I seriously thought about taking my own life until now. Iâ€™m in my late 30s. My laugh is gone, and I get lost in my sleep, in my thoughts. I feel like taking a nap and waking up when I am no longer an asshole and I can be who I was before.  Why do I cry. Why do I fucking cry when I sit. When I walk. When I drive.  I went to the VA about a month ago with my therapist, he said towards the end - I have to see this next guy, he always cries - fuck, I though, I think a couple of tears came out. I just hate to leave my house, I just want to hug my kids. I want to stare at them and smell them.
The other day I took a 9 and felt the steel against my cheek, but then thought of the mess, the expense and how undignified death is when self imposed. It wouldnâ€™t look neat, What if I shit myself. I still think of it, everyday maybe my dad will be there. He left early too.
