I canâ€™t settle downMy mind is all over the place I canâ€™t settle down or really live with myself happily. I have a really loving family who do anything for me and vice versa. I quit my job recently (I wonâ€™t go into why) now I do nothing all day. I have bad anxiety and I was supposed to be going back to college but I just couldnâ€™t walk in. Iâ€™m 25 and college kids were just everywhere. Iâ€™m in UK so college kids are 16 here. 

I just canâ€™t be happy with myself, I wouldnâ€™t say I hate myself Iâ€™m just not happy at all! It feels like Iâ€™m only here so I donâ€™t hurt my family and friends. I couldnâ€™t do that to them, but how scary is that. Say my mum and dad were not here, I donâ€™t think I would be. I donâ€™t want another job. Iâ€™ve lost interest in everything. I just sit inside all day doing nothing and Iâ€™m scared. 

I do get happy and laugh still but it feels fake like Iâ€™m pretending and I sort of am it feels like itâ€™s temporary blocking out the depression. I just see no reason to live apart from my family. Iâ€™m going on a date with this girl I seriously like on Friday. I really want to go and I am doing but I just feel so shit at the moment and donâ€™t feel any joy or nervousness from it. I liked this girl last year but because of me been so down she ended it with me which made me even worse. 

Iâ€™m struggling with erections and a porn addiction which I am actually kicking pretty well. Iâ€™m also a virgin, and I need a circumcision. Iâ€™m a mess, I want to have sex with her but with my mind the way it is and other things Iâ€™m scared she will leave me and again I will be destroyed.

I canâ€™t see a way out my mind is screaming at me everybody to do something but I donâ€™t no what. I come out of it on occasions and feel well. But recently been stuck in the house all day itâ€™s awful. I try to get out but I donâ€™t want to do anything and my anxiety stops me from doing near enough anything. I just donâ€™t see the point in surviving like this, I get people survive but they are normally in the right frame of mind. I feel almost insane and I donâ€™t want to live feeling like this whatâ€™s the point in struggling so much just to survive?
