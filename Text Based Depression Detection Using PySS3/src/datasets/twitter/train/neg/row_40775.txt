I've accomplished one of my new year resolutions earlier than expectedI had a new year resolution to hopefully quit the self harm, and just push those negative thoughts away.

2019 was one of the most difficult years for me. My most stressful and most negative. I barely scraped through sometimes, even if I had a friend to talk to. But I did it. I broke through and now I finally feel free from it all.

Anyways I hope things get better for anyone out there struggling, please know we are all here to support you. 

Have a great 2020!
