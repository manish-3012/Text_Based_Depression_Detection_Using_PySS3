Iâ€™ve lost my will to live years ago.(M13) yep thatâ€™s right. 13. It started when I was about eight when my mom decided to separate us from the family and take us away for money. Four years later Iâ€™m drowning in tears because of how much I hate my life. Iâ€™m bullied daily by my brother and dad because of how fat I am. Iâ€™m being called big tits, Fat Ass, and a lot other things. My brother and sister get away with everything too. They can tell me to kill myself and no one would care. On top of that school has been stressing me the fuck out so much. I have chores piled on me, I have to take care of a dog, do my and my sisters homework, my brother and sister to take care of, and a shit ton more. Iâ€™m so stressed and when my dad finds out Iâ€™m falling behind Iâ€™ll be killed. Yea sometimes I play video games, but I still get it trouble for being on them too much tho Iâ€™m getting beat up during school because my brother wants the computer. He plays for hours and hours at a time. Iâ€™m trying to take a daily walk around the block to get fit yet Iâ€™m still a fat ass and Iâ€™m still lazy. Anything my brother and sister do is on me. Itâ€™s me who eats everything in the house, itâ€™s me who didnâ€™t let the dog out, itâ€™s me who didnâ€™t do my sisters homework. On top of all that I have terrible social anxiety, stress, trust issues, and Iâ€™m suicidal. By my moms isnâ€™t good either. She is a alcoholic/druggy who lives with a child rapist and they hate us. They just keep us for money. The only way I wanted to live before was for my grandparents. I loved them with all my heart. Iâ€™d die for them. But now, 2020 comes along and in February, my grandma passes away. Earlier in March my grandpa passed away. I donâ€™t have a will to live. 2020 has been the worst year of my life. I wanna cut my throat and drown in my own blood.
