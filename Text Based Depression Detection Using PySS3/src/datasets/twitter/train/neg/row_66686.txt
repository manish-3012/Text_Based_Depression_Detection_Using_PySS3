2017 will be my last year.My depression gotten worse and I've always said if I'm not happy and don't have my life together by the end of year 12 then my life is already over. Yes I'm talking to someone but it's not help. Yes I've though it out but it's still how I feel after years. It's not far to be this sad all the time, but life not far.
