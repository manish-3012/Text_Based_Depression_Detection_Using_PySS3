extreme mood swingsi can go from crying for multiple hours straight and planning suicide to feeling amazing and being energetic in literal minutes by small things happening like seeing a picture i like,,,,, the same thing can happen in reverse by minor inconveniences or just looking in the mirror and feeling bad about myself.

how can i stop this and help with this ?
