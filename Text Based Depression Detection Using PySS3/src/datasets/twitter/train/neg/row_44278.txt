It was me.Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Tl; dr: read the last paragraph. I want to OD.

 About a year ago I got out of a very manipulative, emotionally abusive relationship that became physical twice (in the span of 3 years so not that bad violence wise). I've been dating my current boyfriend for almost 9 months. Healthy, happy relationship. Some bumps up and down but nothing extraordinary.

But the arguing. Is constant. To me it's normal. I always had that in all my relationships but hes so tired of it he wont talk to me now. I blames the arguing in my last relationship on the abuse. But its present again. And again. And again. I'm the only constant factor. 

On top of this my depression this year is the worst it's ever been. Therapy, antidepressants, etc didnt work. I have no desire to do anything but stare at a wall if I'm not talking to my boyfriend. He made me feel guilty in the beginning of the relationship about hanging out with my friends and though he apologized, realized it, and changed his behavior, I left the group. It was the same group my ex made me hate myself for hanging out with them. I even blocked my best friend on social media. I have no one. I have no one else left. And I did this. Me. Not my boyfriend. Not my ex. I engineered this.

So I'm sitting here with a bottle and thinking about how I'm mediocre at so many things but not good at anything at all. That my grades are shit. That school is destroying my body because my chronic illnesses make it hard to keep up. That itll only get worse this fall semester. And I'm alone.

I'm alone except for this bottle. I've not once turned to alcohol as a solution, I barely even drink. But here I am. I dont have enough pills to OD without the bottle.
