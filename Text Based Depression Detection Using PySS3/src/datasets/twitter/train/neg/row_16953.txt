I seriously wanna go soonI seriously want to die but I'm kind of waiting to see if something will change, but nothing is so far everyday is the same just a repeat.  I feel the same feelings all the time I haven't changed at all. I'm failing all classes because I have no motivation and it doesn't matter if I fail or not cause I doubt I would even make it passed 17. I lost self love and I'm constantly putting myself down I'm so miserable I'm just waiting for a right moment to actually end my life. I cant do any of this anymore, I don't want any help I tried but nothing is helping at all. I thought about taking 5 pill bottles of different kinds of pills and I think that will take me away quick I'm just waiting till I'm alone so I can do it . Nobody knows about this plan so I don't have any troubles maybe this week will be my last week I don't know but I'm not that afraid to do it I know I'm gonna go through with this plan. Third times a charm
