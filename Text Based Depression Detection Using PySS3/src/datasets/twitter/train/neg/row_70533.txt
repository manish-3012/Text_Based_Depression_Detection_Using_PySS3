i was groomed by a pedophilei met them on twitter. i was 14 and they were 18. they said sexual things to me and manipulated me. i donâ€™t know if i should tell my parents. probably not but it just adds to my massive list of problems. iâ€™m keeping in so much. one of these days iâ€™ll kill myself... i want to say iâ€™m resilient but what the fuck do i do now? who do i go to who arenâ€™t my internet friends? i donâ€™t know i just wanted to vent.
