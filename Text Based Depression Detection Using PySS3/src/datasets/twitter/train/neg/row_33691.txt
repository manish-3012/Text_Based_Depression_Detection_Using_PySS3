I'm not who I want to beI've been addicted to Xanax for the past 6 months. Before this I had very bad social anxiety to the point where I would hide from people. I grew up with a dad who was drunk every chance he could get his hands on alcohol and a mom who struggled every single day to support her children.

Xanax opened a door to a new me, where I went from a close group of 4 friends to a whole lot of friends and girls. But in the end, it reallt fucked over my life. I'm a straight fiend for it now, I feel super depressed every single day, I haven't had a steady job for 6 months, I've lost 2 of my Bestfriends, one the other day because I fucked his girlfriend while off Xanax. 

I'm not who I used to be. My mom doesn't deserve the burden of me being 19 with nothing going for myself except for a pill. She doesn't deserve anything I've done to her the past 6 months. My Bestfriends don't deserve the harm I've done to them. I feel evil..and lately, I've just been thinking I don't wanna be here anymore. If all I'm doing is harm, why should I even be on this planet. The only thing keeping me from offing myself is completely devastating my mom. But I'm starting to think it just doesn't matter anymore. 

I'm sitting here staring into a bottle full of cymbalta which I don't even use to help myself. And I just want to take every single pill and just end the pain. I'm a fucking devil and no one deserves the shit I've done.
