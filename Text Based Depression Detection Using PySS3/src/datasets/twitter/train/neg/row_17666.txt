I can't die, but I can't live eitherI think about killing myself every day, but it means nothing. I'm not actually gonna do it. I can't get away from the guilt and anxiety of some of the really stupid mistakes I've made. I'm nearly 30 and I am ashamed of minor things I have done unintentionally that have hurt others. I hate myself, and every day I obsess over the anxiety of one of these things coming to bite me, making me lose what little I even have in life. I wish I could just end it now but I can't.

I don't have any kids or SO, but I also have no siblings. Ending it, or even dying in an accident would kill my parents too. They aren't great people but I can't have that happen. That's all I really care about at this point, so life is simply a waiting game until I get to off myself. Until then, I don't know how to cope...
