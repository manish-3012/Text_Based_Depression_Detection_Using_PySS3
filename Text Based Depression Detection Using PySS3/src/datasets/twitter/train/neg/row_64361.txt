No idea what to doHi, recently I've just felt like everything about my already shitty life is collapsing and I don't see a point in carrying it on.

Some backstory:

* I'm 17, never had a girlfriend in my life.

* I've been overweight my entire life, not excessively fat but still noticeably larger.

* I go to a grammar school(it's a free school which requires passing a test to get into)

* I struggle a lot with writing/reading/spelling/knowing what a lot of words mean, but always been too scared to ever approach anyone about possible dyslexia.

* I would probably rate my looks 2/10, curly hair along with generally looking shit.

* I've had problems sleeping for 3-4 years, but again too scared to talk to anyone about it.

* Hunched back from a video game addiction.

* Really limited friendship circle and even them I manage to push away.

* Failure at any sport I've tried in my life.

* I seem to constantly end up lying to everyone I'm around.

And recently something else has happened, there was a girl who used to live just down the street from me, we were always quite close and about 6 months ago she moved away, but it felt as if we got closer, like I knew after about 4 months if I asked her out she'd 99% say yes, but scared me strikes again and I never tried it. Yesterday she texted me saying she was out drunk with her friends and ended up making out with a guy and giving him a blow job. She apologised a lot and kept putting herself down "I'm a cunt" etc. Before this I felt as if I was in love with this girl, she was the only thing I cared about and would constantly check my phone to see if she replied, and now I feel broken as if I don't give a fuck about her any more because quite clearly she doesn't about me.

To add to this I'm in the middle of my exams, my video game addiction basically means I haven't put in anywhere near enough revision as I should have done and I'm going to end up doing terribly in all of them and not getting the grades which I want, meaning everyone in my life will just be disappointed in me.

I have no idea what to do, my life ahead of me has nothing good coming, I'll end up scrounging off the state living with my parents doing absolutely nothing in my life, I doubt anyone would notice me if I did go, what's the point any more I just don't know what to do.
