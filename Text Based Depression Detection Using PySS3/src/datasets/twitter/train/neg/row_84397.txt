There is nobody left for me to tell this to. I can't have anyone worry for me. I want to fucking dieI don't want advice I just want to get this out. I have a great family and good friends and a good job (for now) but I am constantly fighting this feeling of less-than and it's consuming me. I feel like I am one unkind word away from harming someone and I feel like I need to take myself out before it comes to that.
