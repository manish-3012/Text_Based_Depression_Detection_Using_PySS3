I got help!! And I think that I might want to die some day in far away future for nowSome good day I started to feel the need to scape, I couldnâ€™t breath, focus and nothing that I do felt enough, everything that I do I considered crap and I was an awful person and friend, and boyfriend, and basically I star to look for reasons to go cause I considered that die would be the best for the people that get to know me. 

But I get help cause some other part of me was piss off, and know that something has to make sense in all this haze of feelings and suicidal thoughts.

So I went to the psychiatrist and she evaluated me, and diagnosed me with depression and pathological anxiety , what it means is that basically my brain was overload with neurotransmitters that make you feel the need to survive all the time, they never went off like in most people, and now I have to take some ansiolitics (I donâ€™t know how to write them in English), they are not addictive and I started to feel normal, I didnâ€™t think that someday I would feel like this, sometimes I still have bad days but now i have the strength and the ideas to deal with the world.

I tried to tell you this so you know that whatever happened to you, it will never go the only thinking you can do is learning to deal and face it, now you might feel that thereâ€™s no exit but thatâ€™s your brain once you get a little help at that molecular level you star to see the solution
 
In another words there is hope and not everything will be perfect but you will have the power to change it.

Now I hope that some of you read this I star you journey to heal, and if you need someone whom you can talk about anything you can reach me.
