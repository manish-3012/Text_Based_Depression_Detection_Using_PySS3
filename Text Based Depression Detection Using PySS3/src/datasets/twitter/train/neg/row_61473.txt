I feel like im the one that makes everything bad happanI feel like 90 percent of all the bad things that happen in my family is because of me every time my parents yell, it's because of me even for the little things they yell at me even if I'm not directly involved they yell at me like when my little brother gets hurt my mom tells at me saying why I wasn't there to not let him get hurt . I have a lot of anxiety when in crowds and I told my parents and they just yell at me especially my mom my dad is calmer but still just doesn't give any help. I feel like if I would just kill myself there life would be easier
