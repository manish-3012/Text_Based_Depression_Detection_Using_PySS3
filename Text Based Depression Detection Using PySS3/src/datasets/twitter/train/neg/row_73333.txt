Please, helpI've contemplated suicide for years now. Even when I was sober it was a constant thought.

I've called the suicide hotline more times than I'd like to admit. Part of me wishes I'd just gone through with it. 

I applaud those that work at the hotline because you've helped me many times from finally going through with it. 

It's been a constant thought lately. Nearly all the time. I don't want to do this anymore. My mind is on the brink of not being able to do this anymore. 

My family, my precious daughter; my only reason for living at this point, is the only reason I'm still alive. And unfortunately even she isn't enough sometimes. 

The hurt I'll leave them is what keeps me here. But my hurt is still here, I still suffer with it everyday. Everyday I don't want to be here and I'm still here for them. 

But God dammit I just want to stop hurting, I don't want to feel this pain anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't. I give up.
