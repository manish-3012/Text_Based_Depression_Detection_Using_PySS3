I thought I had got past these thoughts....This might sound weird but my Dad passed away quite suddenly two months ago. I did get to talk to him before he died but it still hurts. I had been quite suicidal prior to my dad's passing but for a month after those thoughts hardly entered my mind. But now they seem to be the only thing that occupies my mind. I been trying to deal with my depression with therapy and meds but I don't think they are really working. 

This all came to the forefront since I quit my job to start a business with two friends but everyday I feel like we made a huge mistake and we are going to lose everything. The business is puttering along but it has not taken off enough to pay us a wage. Every month I juggle figures and hope we have enough money and credit to pay our bills.

I hate being the boss, I wish I had never quit my job. Sure you deal with the crap managers give you but at the end of the day you can go home and switch off, unlike now where all I do day after day is worry about losing our home.

I really wish I could go back in time and undo this decision. If some one presented my with a button that said it would kill me in my sleep in 24 hrs I would push it and be thankful.
