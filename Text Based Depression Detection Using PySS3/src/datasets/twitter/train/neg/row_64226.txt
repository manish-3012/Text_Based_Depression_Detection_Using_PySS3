Feeling violent thoughts towards womenI'm so tired of no woman viewing me in a romantic way. No woman likes me because I'm a fucking ugly mess. I keep having violent thoughts about women in my life and can't stop them. I'm so fed up. I'm not owed sex or a relationship, I'm not entitled to it. I've lost so many friends and burned so many bridges now. I can't even fucking masturbate without feeling a mix of anger/sadness. I just want to be fucking 21 so I can buy a gun and end my life.
