I cant do this anymoreMy name is Elliot J****** (M15) and this is my last note. Today a breaking point hit me. I'm so done with everything. The stress, the anxiety, depression, thoughts, everything. I've been trying so hard for years to pretend that it was all okay. That my family was okay. That whenever I saw my brother I didnt want to kill myself. It's not. I'm never okay. Nothing goes right for me and I always fuck something up. The only thing that has kept me alive til now has been my boyfriend. He means so much to me and hes going through the same shit as I am, I'm just weaker. Dumber. Stupid. I dont deserve him. I dont deserve to feel happy when all I feel is numbing emotions and self hatred. I'm done. I give up. After years of watching my family destroy itself, i admit defeat. I'm sitting in my bedroom getting ready to pop 12 pills of ibuprofen and hoping I never wake up. Goodbye.
