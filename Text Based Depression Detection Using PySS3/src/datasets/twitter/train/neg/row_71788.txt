I canâ€™t keep living like thisI have been suicidal for so long and my depression has stole away my life from me. I feel so weak and defeated by my own mind. I had a suicide attempt a few months ago and self harmed a lot. My parents were so heartless about all of this, when I reached out for help they yelled at me all night because I was just trying to get â€˜attentionâ€™ and when I tried to get help from school then my parents were called and there was another night of getting yelled at because apparently I â€˜liedâ€™ to them and betrayed their trust by trying to get help from someone else. When they found out that I had a suicide attempt the first thing my mother said is that Iâ€™ll go to hell. My friends are the only reason Iâ€™m still alive to be honest, without them I wouldnâ€™t have lasted this long. One time my best friendâ€™s mum told me that Iâ€™m always welcome to stay at their house for as long as I need. The fact that I trust her more than my own family is truly so sad. If things werenâ€™t bad enough as they were I had to watch my grandma get hit by her abusive boyfriend (I had to live with her for a few months), I hated seeing someone who I love get hurt and I was too weak to help her in any way. I always asked her if she wanted to go on walks with me or go out so she could be out as much as possible. I recently moved to a different country and Iâ€™m stuck with my parents neglecting my needs all the time. I love my friends so much and they support me 24/7. I feel like such a burden. I stay up almost every night thinking of ways to kill myself or the things to write in my suicide note. Every day is torture and I just want to let go already. I feel so empty but full of sadness at the same time. I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel like I have nothing left on this earth.
