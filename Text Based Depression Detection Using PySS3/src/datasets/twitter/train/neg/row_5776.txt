Best Intense treatment for BPDIâ€™m desperate right now. Iâ€™ve been battling with BPD my whole life. Iâ€™ve been a pretty volatile person since I was rather young. Iâ€™ve been suicidal since age 9 and Iâ€™m still dealing with those thoughts. Iâ€™m at a pretty difficult time in my life. I feel like if I canâ€™t find a way to cope with this my only option is ending it. I have my â€œfail safeâ€ if recovery just isnâ€™t something for me. I donâ€™t want to die, but I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore. Is there any method of therapy that really works for this? Iâ€™ve been in therapy for over a year and went to an intensive outpatient program for six months that I was discharged from in early February. What are my options at this point?
