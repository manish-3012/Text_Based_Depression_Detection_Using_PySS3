Best place for drop hanging apart from tree or homeAnyone have any suggestions? Obs need somewhere that's basically a gallows. Somewhere to tie the rope high enough to provide enough drop to break the neck.

I've looked at a lot of trees but don't think i could climb it.

I was thinking a bridge but don't want to get disturbed with passing traffic.

Looked into swings and climbing frames which are possible but again don't want to be disturbed and its not ideal where kids play.
