Even when I should have a soul crushing weight I still feel empty. I still feel nothing. I am nothing. I was born nothing, I lived as a nothing, I'll die as a nothing. As nothing. Nothing. NothingI think I might do it. I think I might kill myself. I have nothing. Nothing I can hold up and say "this is it". Nothing means anything to me. My father just left my house and said "I love you I guess. Maybe."

And no weight. Why can't I have the weight? That weight I felt a few days ago when for the first time I thought "wow, this must be what most depressed people feel like every day. goddamn, i feel so bad...how the fuck are they all still alive...? so many people with this ten ton weight and they're alive and breathing, like me..."

That's what I thought. I still think that. It depresses me that I'm not regularly depressed. I'm just fucking empty. I broke myself a long time ago. Reality was a toy and I played with it until it broke and then I tortured myself. Then I was happy. And then I wasn't. And I'm still trying to figure myself out. And I'm still happy some days and bad the next but in the end what's it fucking matter. I'm gonna go for a bike ride. I hope I get run over. I'm gonna go for a bike ride without a helmet and I'm gonna stop somewhere with a suicide note no my phone and try to get run over. I don't know if I'll actually do it. I have no clue. I have no clue. I have no clue. I have no clue. I have no clue. In my head, I was thinking "wouldn't it be a cool moment if every time I wrote that, I'd get more suicidal? I'd be fighting myself". That didn't happen. I just said it based on a delusion in my head. I'm obsessed with feeling real, subconsciously. And that isn't even the tip of the massive, obvious iceberg that is my life. Kill me. My mom just texted. I FEEL SO EMPTY I DON'T EVEN FEEL ANYTHING. I FEEL NOTHING, NOTHING IN THE STUPIDEST, MOST SUBTLE, IDIOTIC WAY. I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE I FEEL NOTHING. I FEEL SILENCE

IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT ME TOI SAY? ARE YOU TPYING THIS IN A NEW PARAGRAPH FOR EFEFCT? FUCK YOURSELF, SILENCE, SILENCE SILENCE I DONT
