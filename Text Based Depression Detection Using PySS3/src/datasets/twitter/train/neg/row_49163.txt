27 M , I ruined my carrierI only have a stupid degree in mechanical energy with low GPA , zero work experience I tried to get a work but I failed in every interview , at the moment am doing cs engineering this is my first year , and am doing very bad in study  unlike  my classmates (who are younger 19-21) ,I just feel am joke.
I think this is enough reason for me to do it  , my life is a joke.
