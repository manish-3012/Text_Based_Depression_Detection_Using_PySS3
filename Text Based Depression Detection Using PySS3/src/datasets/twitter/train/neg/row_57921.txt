Iâ€™m so fucking close to ending it (17F)I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s just the stress of my first year of college but even though I have a light workload I still end up being a fucking failure. Every time I hand in an assignment, Iâ€™m met with disappointment. Not to mention my body is going to shit. I feel big and disgusting and have been living off of energy drinks and no food. Iâ€™m too depressed to motivate myself to get off my ass and actually exercise. I used to be a varsity athlete. I was varsity captain last year. I was always an A+ student. Where has it all gone?

All I have is a bottle of Zoloft, but if it comes down to it, then Iâ€™ll make the best of it.

Hopefully someone will take care of my cat if I ever decide enough is enough. She keeps me going.
