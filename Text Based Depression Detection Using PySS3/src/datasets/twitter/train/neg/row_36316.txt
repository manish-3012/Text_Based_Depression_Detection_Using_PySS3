GuiltWhen my abuser realized I was about to tell someone what she'd done, she killed herself to avoid facing the consequences. She messaged me out of the blue years after the abuse ended and I kinda froze up and panicked. I told her I wished she was dead, and that same night she was gone. It's been almost 20 years and I still feel guilty even after all the years of hell she put me through. Maybe because I found out shortly after she died that she had the same childhood as me. I don't know. I haven't figured out how to accept any of it.

I doubt anyone can relate very much, but if this resonates with any of you, I'd love to talk more. 32/m if it matters
