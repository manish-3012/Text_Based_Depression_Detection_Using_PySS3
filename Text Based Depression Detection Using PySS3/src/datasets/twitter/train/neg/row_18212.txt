I should not have to reach crisis for you to believe my distress.Iâ€™ve been casually suicidal for years. When I go through a period of feeling actively suicidal, everyone pretends to care. But once Iâ€™m out of the hospital they expect my suicidal ideation to just go away. They think that the medicine is helping, the therapy. I guess it is in a way but mostly I just wish they would let me go. Just let me cease to exist. Let me be free.
