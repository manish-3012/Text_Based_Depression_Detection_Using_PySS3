Was Adopting My Dog a Bad Idea?There are a lot of things keeping me from killing myself despite my profound desire to do so. There's the fear of death and what may or may not lay beyond (something for one reason or another I'd hope to overcome), the fear of pain and the concequences of failure (hence my reasoning for waiting until my 21st to purchase my own gun), the knowledge of who I'm hurting (something which in my deepest bouts of depression I can figure out how not to care) and the possibility of having a smooth future (which, so long as my depression exists, will not be a happy one).


One reason for the hesitation that I keep coming back to might be stupid, but I can't help but think about it anyway: of all the things I'll hurt, my dog is one that I can't help but think about the most. How my parents would undoubtedly put her back under adoption, of the pure abandonment she'd undoubtedly feel and the sheer fact she might very well not get adopted with her age.


Its stupid because I originally got my dog to help out with my depression -- and admittedly she does help and is fairly perceptive of my depression despite it being essentially all she knows. She's patient, she's smart, she's a fantastic dog. The sheer fact I'm thinking of doing something like this makes me wonder if I even deserve her. Not to mention it puts people like my parents or the one friend (all of whom I still care a lot about and love dearly despite their innumerable faults) I still somehow have on the back burner for a fucking dog.


I don't know. Was adopting my dog a bad idea?
