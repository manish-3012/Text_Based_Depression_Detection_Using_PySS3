I've lost my closest friend due to alcoholism. After seven years of depression I think it should end.I don't know if I can go on anymore. I've been up and down (really down) over the last few years, but my actions never help me. I've "feigned" suicide before and ended up in a mental institution. It is the worst place to be, worse than jail. I will never go back. I will end my life before that happens. I'm done.
