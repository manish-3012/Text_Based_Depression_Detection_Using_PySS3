I want to go back to the hospitalI was hospitalized in the psych ward back in January for about a week and it helped a lot. It got me on track with finding an appropriate therapist for dealing with infant loss and helped me find a medication combo that helped instead of causing worse symptoms. I had tried to kill myself and reached out to my doctor, who sent me to the ER.

Now I feel like I am at rock bottom again and struggling to make it day to day. I can't concentrate on my work and I've just been avoiding it and pushing it off. I think about suicide or violently injuring myself at least hourly. I can barely bathe and get dressed. I asked my husband to hide my medication because I'm having strong urges to take it all. 

I want to go back to the hospital but I'm afraid about the financial and emotional toll it will take on my family. My doctor recommended a separate outpatient program that is 6 hours during the day, but there is a 3-4 week waiting list. I did get put on the waiting list but I feel like my brain is fracturing now.

When is it too much? They say to go to the ER if I'm afraid I'm going to kill myself but I don't know if it's that bad yet. I'm afraid I can feel it getting that bad but I don't want to wait until my life is at stake because I might not have the mindset to make it to the ER at that point. What do I do?
