My BDD is so bad i canâ€™t tell whatâ€™s real and what isnâ€™t anymore. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do, itâ€™s making me want to die.Iâ€™ve suffered from BDD for a year now, it started when I lost quite a bit of weight and ever since I have been obsessed over how my body looks. I hate my legs, my hips and my thighs so much. I pinch at them until theyâ€™re sore and will spend hours every week just staring at them, trying so hard to convince myself Iâ€™m skinny. I hate it. People tell me I am slim and that what Iâ€™m seeing isnâ€™t right, but I canâ€™t see myself any other way. I just want to be like the others girls my age, theyâ€™re all so thin and tall and look like models, and Iâ€™m just here all chubby and short and sad. Iâ€™m so jealous of my friends, theyâ€™re all so much thinner and taller than me yet talk about how they need to lose weight to fit in their prom dress. It makes me feel ashamed of myself â€” I feel bad enough because I know I stress my mum out a lot with my condition. She gets nervous and I know she really wants me to like my body. I feel awful that I despise it. Whenever I think about it, all I want to do is curl up and die. I stopped self harming when I was 13; I was bullied when I first went into secondary school, luckily Iâ€™ve grown out of that. I was happy for so long and Iâ€™ve fallen back flat again. Iâ€™m repulsed by myself. I donâ€™t know who else to vent to, Iâ€™m sorry if this was tedious or didnâ€™t make sense.
