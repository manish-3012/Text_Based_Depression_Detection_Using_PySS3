My 16 yr old lil bro hung himselfItâ€™s been exactly 2 months since heâ€™s hung himself at home. My older brother and I saw my lil brother hanging lifeless from a rope when we opened the front door. Heâ€™s had severe clinical depression (first diagnosed from doctor last year) and damn I just canâ€™t believe my baby bro is gone?? :â€™â€™(( Why did he have depression in the first place?? Whyyyy I donâ€™t know and he didnâ€™t even know why. Fuckkkk I miss him so much I just literally want to see him and hug him. Why does life suck so much? Why wasnâ€™t I a better older sister??? I hate myself. I hate my damn parents for always saying that my lil brother was â€œgetting betterâ€...when in fact my lil bro was planning his suicide for a long time every. single. day. And he even wrote in his suicide letter that â€œpatience is key otherwise I wonâ€™t achieve what I wantâ€...that boy!!! Ughhhhh I love my older brother, but heâ€™s always out of the house hanging out with friends. Iâ€™m just stuck home with my frickin mom bothering me. Sometimes I just want to scream at her and choke her, but I know I obviously canâ€™t lol. Iâ€™ve been pretty suicidal these days, but ofc I know itâ€™s only normal because I just lost my loved one. I just donâ€™t see any positives coming. Iâ€™m starting community college this fall and I feel like if something just doesnâ€™t go a certain way Iâ€™ll lose it and end it all. My family just feels sooo empty cuz Iâ€™m the middle child (older sister) to my lil brother and then I have my older brother. Sometimes I just pretend heâ€™s there. Someone else have similar experiences or any advice? Please.
