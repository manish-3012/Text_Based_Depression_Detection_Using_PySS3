I always come back hereEverytime I feel suicidal and like total shit I say "it's going to get better" and guess what? It does For maybe a few weeks. And then I'm back to feeling like garbage. When it's good, it's not really good. It's just not completely awful. Then I come back to feeling depressed and it's fucking terrible. What's the point in waiting for things to get better if I always come back here. "here" meaning this shitty place where depression a d anxiety controls me.
