I want to die, but I'm scaredI know I have so so much to live for. Like I have exciting things to look forward to, but it all just seems so small when I think about what's going inside my head. How my body feels, how I feel sick, how depressed I am. 

I'm tired of feeling unimportant to those I feel are most important to me. I feel like all my friends hate me. Like everyone is appreciated by everyone else, and I'm just dirt on someone's driveway, that everyone just walks all over. 
Everything I try to achieve, I end up falling every time, and I'm sick of feeling like I can't do anything right. 

I'm still in love with my ex, and there's nothing I can do about it because he doesn't want me anymore. Every time I think of him, I think of happier times, and wish I could be that happy again. It's that kinda happy that you feel invisible. I want that back, but I'm lonely instead, it's the loneliest I've ever been. This is sending me nuts, but I don't know how to fix it. 

Thing is, I thought I was smarter than this. I've been depressed so much in my life, and I've always been able to pull myself out of it, but for some reason things have been so dark as of late, I just cannot. Its too hard and too draining. I just can't be fucked anymore. 

I cannot wait to die. I'm suicidal and I have been for a while. I just want the ending credits to roll already. I'm sick of putting up with everything in life, like nothing seems like such a big deal, but to me it's an ocean full of problems and it never ends.
