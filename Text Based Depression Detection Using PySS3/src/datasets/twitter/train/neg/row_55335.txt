Sometimes I just go outside in middle of night in the hopes that I get murderedI seem to be too much of a coward to kill myself. Sometimes Iâ€™ll go on walks at 2am in sketchy neighborhoods, sometimes I stand on the train tracks and imagine how quickly itâ€™d be over Iâ€™ve been thinking of just speeding and crashing my car in a wall but my car is in my mothers name and I donâ€™t want her to have to deal with the rest of my payments and/or debt. If I could get my hands on a gun Iâ€™d definitely be gone by now.
