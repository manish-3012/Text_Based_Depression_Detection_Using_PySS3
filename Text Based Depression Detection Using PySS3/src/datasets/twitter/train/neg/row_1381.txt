please helphi. this is my first time posting here. i just wanted someone to talk to after feeling high anxiety and shame at remembering things from the past. i am in my mid twenties and i can't stop thinking about things that have happened in the past whilst i have been drunk, or the bizarre ways in which i used to respond to things when i was younger.  i always think that nobody remembers, until my friends bring things up and then i feel so ashamed. i have changed a lot as a person since i was a teenager and it makes me feel so uncomfortable associating things i did with the person i am now. i dont feel any connection with the me of now and the me of the past and i feel huge anxiety to think that anyone would think of me as that person. i am still good friends with the same group of people that i have been friends with since i was a teenager including my ex boyfriend who i still have residual feelings for.  he saw such a strange side of me (one i feel like i cant even comprehend) and i hate feeling like i cant control the negative memories him and others have of me. similarly i used to fight and argue a lot with my mum and i am extremely ashamed. i feel no self worth and i keep thinking there is no point continuing to live when i feel this bad. in my mind suicide represents a relief. has anyone else felt like this and knows how to make it go away? 

(im sorry if this sounds like a non-problem)
