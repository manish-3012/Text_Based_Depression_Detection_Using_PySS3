What are yall fighting for?I mean seriously? What? What's the purpose of living depressed with all the things that people deal with, even you would stop if you wanted something but it doesn't make any sense to have it. You would stop because It makes more sense stop losing time on stuff you can't have, It's how we feel, It's like we're stopping being pathetic for something we could never get and that's life. We can't live alone without anyone noticing us, we're just like you, we're just like the dead aswell, we are the children of the universe and our dying won't change us, we'll keep being that, we just won't be around you, feeling the war in our heads, In the end all of us die, so I guess It's fair for everyone to live their lives until they stop having any fun. It's selfish asking someone to live their lives in the misery they're in.
