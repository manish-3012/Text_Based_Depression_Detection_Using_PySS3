im not happyThere's no other way to put it.    
It's simple, it's concise and it's true.     
I'm so deeply deeply unhappy.     
Somethings very wrong in my brain and I can't fix it. Everything makes me cry now for some reason, and as a 24 year old male, it's kind of embarresing when i'm in public. Fuck, I was just looking up [Paul Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kelly_\ (Australian_musician\)) on wikipedia and it made me cry, and i have absolutely no explanation.
