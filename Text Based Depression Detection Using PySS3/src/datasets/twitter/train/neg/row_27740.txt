i hate being so unhappy with myself13/M

I hate being so emotion and sensitive, makes me feel weak, just so happens that i disappoint everyone and i hate myself, i hate lying awake at night thinking about my pathetic ugly body, i wanna carve the word ''fag'' into my leg so i can look at the scar in the future and know how much of a stupid piece of shit i am, i hate being gay, it makes me feel so fucking alone and different from the others and i feel so disgusting about it, killing myself is mostly on my mind all isn't that a shame haha
