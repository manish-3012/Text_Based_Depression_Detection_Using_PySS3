I'm ready to end it all.I lost my job three years ago because of depression and since then it has only gotten worse, drugs don't work, only self harming worked, but now that isn't working, I just want to die.
I lost my dream job and I can never get it back and getting it back would be the only thing to 100% cure my depression.
