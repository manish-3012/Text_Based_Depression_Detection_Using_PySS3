I should honestly just kill myself now but I don't have a gunI'm 23 male gay,disabled work at a grocery store part time and haven't been in a single relationship in my,life I feel like everyone is just putting up with me,to there no obligated to anymore I love life but I just feel like a burden on everyone else not to mention I seem to be at a point in life where I feel this is as good as it gets I feel I made some good memories so,maybe if I end it now it won't be as hard on my,family
