My friend wants to end his life and i feel powerlessOne of my friends (my former high school classmate) had tried several times to kill himself in the last 7 months. I don't know what to say to him,  i feel like i can't help. In three days I'm going to the hospital to see him 'cause he tried to kill him again (i know I should go now these are really busy days for me). I want to help him. I don't want to lose him
