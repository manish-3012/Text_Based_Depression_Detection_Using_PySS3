No one gives a shit about meI have no friends who would really care if I died. I guess my family is the only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet, but I think in the end they could get over it. I am so fucking alone. Tonight I was going to go out with my roommate and she left me behind, probably because she didnâ€™t want me around in the first place. She texted me where she was going, then changed her mind and didnâ€™t tell me where she was so I just went home and itâ€™s very clear she wonâ€™t ever give a shit about me. I very rarely get invited anywhere, so I usually just tag along with whoever I can and I constantly feel like a nuisance. I have made no friends in college and I moved away from my hometown so I donâ€™t even have my old friends to fall back on. I havenâ€™t talked to my ex who was my best friend in more than a month and it hurts so bad. Everything just hurts so bad, I just want someone to really truly care about me and itâ€™ll never happen because for whatever reason people donâ€™t like me and I probably deserve it. I donâ€™t know the point of this post, I have no good way to kill myself right now but if I did I would 100% do it. I might try to call my campus crisis line but I doubt theyâ€™ll help. I just wish everything could stop. Thanks for reading if you did and Iâ€™m sorry for wasting your time.
