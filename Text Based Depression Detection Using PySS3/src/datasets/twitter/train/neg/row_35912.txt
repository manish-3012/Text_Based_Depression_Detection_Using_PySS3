out of optionsim 25 male. i should have my life together but.. im working at starbucks. im married to a wonderful woman. but i have no degree. my dad kicked me out of his toy store mom and pop store, so i could see the world. well, my house is $300, internet 60$, food $200/month, energy 100$ in summer, house gas $20 summer, car gas 150ish a month, car insurance 100, car payment 160$, tuition for community college 1300, wife's education 500$ and i see a psychatrist once a week, but im still under my moms insurance. that ends this year or november. so i wont be able to see a doctor for my bipolar 2. i have a good chance of giving bp2 to my children if i had them. so it'd be nice for humanity if i left the gene pool. i can't handle this. insurance will be 200$, wife's insurance is $150. she works more than i'd like. she makes the most money. as a waitress. i should have my shit together and be taking care of her. but she says im a child becuase i dont want to work at starbucks. she may be right, but she still loves me. she could find a 30 year old and have the kids she wants. he would have a good job and she wouldn't have to work so hard.  i can't cope, i just don't have the money, i'm disabled i guess. but my parents are fed up with this bp2 stuff. im just  a regular guy in their eyes. it's tough for me to keep a job. i have a bad past with quitting. my dad is nice enough to let me live in a house for $300. i feel they expect me to be like my brother who is almost done with his phd in psych.  im working toward a msw in social work. but im not even done with my assiosates in liberal arts. my wife may be better off with out me. i'm holding her back from a good life. if i go, she could move back to her country and find a real man who makes money. she'll forgive me, won't she.  i'll die because i love her.
