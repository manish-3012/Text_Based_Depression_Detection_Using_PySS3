I love life, but I don't deserve it.I have squandered the many opportunities in life that I have had as an attractive white middle class male in the 1st world.  Because of my demographic, I believe any failure is completely my fault.  I have no great oppression to fight, and no story that deserves to be told.  

The only thing I hate about life is myself.  My carbon emissions and human waste are my only contributions to the world.  I want to kill myself and donate my organs and my place in life to someone deserving of my opportunities.  I hate myself for being so terrible at things.  I have a great work ethic... but that is easily surpassed by someone more deserving who has natural talent and doesn't need to pour their life force into their work just to reach the lower middle.

I've:
-Dropped out of music school
-Tried to learn Spanish for 9 years, yet still am not fluent
-Desperately hemmhoragged any extra spending money to save an emergency fund that can't seem to get above a pathetic 2k
-squandered social and life opportunities  in hopes of building a larger emergency fund (to no avail)
-consistently been dominated in my hobbies (chess, MTG, any videogame)

   My friends graduate college with half as much effort as I put in to failing.  I've seen people get better at spanish in 6 months than I have in 9 years.  
   I don't know anyone who can scrimp and save as much as I can but I certainly know people who never turn down a drink at the bar or a new expensive amenity for their house(which they own) who make LESS an hour than I do.
   Even hobbies, which I thought were an escape, offer me nothing but defeat despite my passion and effort towards learning them.

   I feel like Rudy, and I hate it.  I feel like a novelty story about the principle of work ethic for a real "do-er" to admire.  "Wow, look at how hard he struggles to get nothing..."  Like my point in life is to die in vain so better people can be impressed by my effort and not my accomplishments.
