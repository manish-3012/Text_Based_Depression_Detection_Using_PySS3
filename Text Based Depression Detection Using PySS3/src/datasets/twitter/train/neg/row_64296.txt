What happens legally after a Suicide attempt?Iâ€™m seriously considering ending it all after the semester ends, but Iâ€™m afraid because I donâ€™t know whatâ€™ll happen legally: are the police gonna search my things? Go through my room? Asking because Iâ€™m trans and I need to keep it a secret from my family, so if they do that, my family will find out.
