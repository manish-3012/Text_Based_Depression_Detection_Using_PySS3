This quote made me feel better...Written in the 1800â€™s by Danish philosopher SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard...

â€œHow did I get into the world? Why was I not asked about it and why was I not informed of the rules and regulations but just thrust into the ranks as if I had been bought by a peddling shanghaier (enslavement) of human beings? 
How did I get involved in this big enterprise called actuality? Why should I be involved? Isn't it a matter of choice? 
And if I am compelled to be involved, where is the managerâ€”I have something to say about this. 
Is there no manager? To whom shall I make my complaint?â€

Makes me feel better that people were having these thoughts way back then.
