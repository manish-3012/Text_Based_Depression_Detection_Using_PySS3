People will only care about me when I dieThis sounds really manipulative but in the past I have always dreamed about people caring about me, cuddling me and playing with my hair, then I slowly shifted towards failed suicide and then someone loving me out of pity I guess but now I am completely unable to imagine a human being to love or even support me without me violently killing myself.
I am not going to kill myself in near future but I constantly dream about shooting myself in the head and slowly bleeding out (unfortunately I live in Germany where guns are unavailable) or setting my self on fire but I am afraid that I will somehow survive it in my panic
I dream about people realizing that I just wanted someone who would care about me afterwards and caring for me after my death if that makes any sense. Sadly I wont be able to experience that, also most people will probably be sad for 1 or 2 weeks but will then move on with their perfect lives without thinking about me in years.

I think its really sickening how my perception has changed in a way that I think that I will only achieve this basic goal by dying. Sadder than that is that I am probably right.
