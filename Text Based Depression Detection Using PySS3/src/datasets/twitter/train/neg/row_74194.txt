Should I talk to the girl I am dating?I am really suicidal because of the things that have happened in the past few months and I want to talk to somebody that has gone through the same things. 

Long story short, the girl I had 3 dates with tried to commit suicide a few months ago because of her mother, and I am willing to talk to her, because i feel that she is the only person I know that has gone through the same things I'm going through rn. 

The problem is, she does not like me the way I like her, and that really stops me from opening myself up to her. 

Reddit, is it ok for me to talk to her about my suicidal thoughts?
