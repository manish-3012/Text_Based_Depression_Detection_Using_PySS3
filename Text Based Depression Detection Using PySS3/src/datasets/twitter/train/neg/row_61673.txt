Every night I think about doing it. Every night, the list of reasons not to gets smaller.Iâ€™m so lonely, Iâ€™m directionless, I have no goals in life. Iâ€™m sick of feeling like Iâ€™m just floating through each day just to get through work and go home, have a drink or two, and then go to sleep, and repeat it the next day. Last time I got to this point, I imagined the notes Iâ€™d write to the people I think are close to me. Now Iâ€™m imagining who Iâ€™d want to see one last time. Wonder what itâ€™ll be next time... if there even is one...
