The end.its over for me

its over for me

i remember a simple boy

happy as a child

where did the good times go


im not brave

im not clever

another xanax, that'll save you

take a couple more, hope someone rapes you


face down in a gutter like the piece of shit i am

parents went separate ways

friends got distant

I been alone for the longest

my desire to live fades away

i cant continue on this path


it is no fun

nothing can save me

nothing can stop me


i hope that bullet courses through my drugged out brain

blood on the floor

each drop a reminder

of all those sins

of all those mistakes


this fucked up world

i know you can relate

but its over for me

its over for me


no family

no friends

the last good one is dead

6 feet under


I have
 
no job. 

No money. 

No friends. 


confused about reality

confused about my sexuality

i hope i burn in hell like the faggot i am

fucking loser



i deserve it

i deserve it

this world is worthless

nas said "the world is yours"

yeah its mine, but i look in the mirror

and see no one there


no soul 

no heart

not a feeling in sight

just grief and sadness all fucking night


i cant sleep

i cant sleep

these meds dont work

THESE FUCKING MEDS DONT WORK

I JUST WANT IT TO END

I CANT DO THIS


skin and bones, a slight resemblance of who i was

but something good happened


i made a friend, his name is colt

he's 45 and can stop me from being alive

load the chamber

say a prayer

oh wait, god doesnt love a faggot like me

a sinner like me

a liar like me

a thief like me

so the only hope i have

is its like sopranos
and just fades to black

Goodbye, cruel world.
