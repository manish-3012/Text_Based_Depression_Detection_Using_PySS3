Not Suicidal, But..I just donâ€™t feel like I have a clear sense of purpose anymore that compels me to want to partake in living. The things I want to do and accomplish in life feel doable for me, as I truly believe I could achieve said goals, and yet I have no idea how the hell Iâ€™m supposed to align with whatever it is I would need to do in order to get there and make it happen, leading me into the world of my frustration. I donâ€™t have any clear orders, nor proven instruction, and I barely have a map of the territory. Itâ€™s also not like I can get access to the thing itself so easily, and the other thing is that I also really canâ€™t talk about it with people for personal reasons. I guess itâ€™s all just starting to feel like life is next to pointless when your dream is the only thing you want to live for, though youâ€™re never willing to settle for anything else... 

I would turn to prayer and affirmation, though I have for months and months, years even, and Iâ€™m not getting the result I want, and I absolutely hate this feeling of existing in a sort of isolation purgatory. 

Any advice? Maybe Iâ€™ll turn to prayer again, Iâ€™m just the kind of person who can only ever be happy with the desired result, and anything under just never feels acceptable for me.
