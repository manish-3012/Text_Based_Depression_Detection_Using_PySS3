I just don't care anymore.For as long as I can remember I've never been happy. My heart feels empty and I don't know how to change that. No matter how hard I try to be positive  I just feel this weight  over me telling me I'm not worth it. All I've ever wanted is to be happy and I just cant. I have no friends, my job sucks, and my family isn't there for me. I have my  boyfriend  and he trys, but I don't make it easy for him. I can't even  have sex without feeling  pain. I've had chronic muscle  spasms  for years now and there's nothing I can do to control them and it's not helping  my depression. I tried talking to someone about how I am feeling and they just don't understand. Every morning I wish I didn't wake up. I thought  about getting help but if I take time off work I'll get fired and I can't loose this job. I just don't know why I even bother anymore. .
