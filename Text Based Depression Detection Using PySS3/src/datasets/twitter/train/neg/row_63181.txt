I've been fighting it, I know most y'all in the same boat so I don't expect much.I've been suicidal for about ten years but I think I'm finally at that point. I think my wife hates me, she hasn't touched me in 6 months, like even a shoulder brush let alone anything else. My "homies" all made it clear that they give zero fucks about me. I hate my job. Cherry on the top, I have lost the ability to walk for the most part. I get about 300 steps a day but after that I collapse. 

.

So... shit... I literally have nothing. No friends, Wife hates me, Can't move, job sucks. I can't think of anything positive. The only love left is music but that is a stationary object that can't reciprocate, even if it feels like it does...

I don't expect a response, I know y'all in the same place, which makes me sad. I guess this might just be the found entry.
