Family - you should see a therapist, Me - I donâ€™t have the money. Family - .......I think how interesting it is when your telling your loved ones that youâ€™re depressed they donâ€™t do anything. They have funds to support me seeing someone. Go out and run they say.  Iâ€™m already paying for antidepressants, and doctors visits.  I feel like people wouldnâ€™t extend as much help as I would to them. Then when Iâ€™m dead they will stand around and say why? Only if we could have helped.
