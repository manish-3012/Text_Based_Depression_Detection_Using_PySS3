Suicidal ImpulsesI've been struggling with depression and anxiety for I don't know how long anymore. I've tried countless medications but nothing helps. I'm at the end of my rope. I get frequent panic attacks and during these panic attacks I often get strong suicidal impulses. Last Wednesday I had a panic attack when I was waiting for the commuter train and it got so bad that I was planning on actually acting on these impulses. I was taking the step off of the platform infront of a train but an older gentleman pulled me back at the very last second. This isn't the first time that I've been about to commit suicide just to be stopped at the last second but I'm afraid it won't be the last either. I don't know how I can stop my suicidal impulses and negative thoughts but if I don't find a way soon I will probably find myself 6 feet in the ground.
