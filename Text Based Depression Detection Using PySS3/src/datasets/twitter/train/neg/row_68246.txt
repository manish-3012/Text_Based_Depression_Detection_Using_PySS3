Maybe everything doesnâ€™t work out in the endI canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m tired of feeling useless, I thought if I found someone who loves me l the suicidal thoughts would go away but they didnâ€™t. All my problems are still here and I canâ€™t seem to find any solution. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll make it to Christmas but at least Iâ€™ve held on for this long
