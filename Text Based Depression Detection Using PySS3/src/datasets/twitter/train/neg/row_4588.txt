I want to kill myself but I scared of deathI am sorry if it sounds disrespectful but I have to let this out.
Every night I think about killing myself, my thoughts take over me. I have tried choking myself but as I mentioned I get scared. I don't know how to explain this. I am sorry. I wake up and I think about killing myself. I do not think about it when I do things that's why I am able to keep my mind off of it. But the moment when I am alone or not thinking of about any work the idea comes back in my mind. I don't know how to approach this. I need guidance. No. I don't have money for therapy. I am sorry.
