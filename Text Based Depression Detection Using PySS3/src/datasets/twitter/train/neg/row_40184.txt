ADVICE IF YOU EVER FEEL SUICIDALOkay, so, when I was about 15, (currently 17), I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADD &amp; many more disorders. I felt insane, so different, I couldnâ€™t handle it. It became to the point where I would wait for my mom to sleep so I can cut myself without getting caught.. one day, we got into this huge argument over something stupid &amp; I was so much more heart broken that I ran out of my house and I went to the closest abandoned grain elevator &amp; I made my way to the roof. I walked to the edge, stood on the peak, was about to jump before I realized I had a dog that saw me leave &amp; would be devastated if I never came home. So instead I chose to text a random number, just put in a bunch of numbers and to my surprise, I got an answer, I texted â€œidk if anyone is ever going to answer but Iâ€™m going to kill myself in 5 minutesâ€, the number texted back almost instantly saying â€œplease donâ€™t, I know what youâ€™re going through may be extremely tough but just because you end YOUR pain doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re not passing it to someone elseâ€ and so I took the opportunity to ball my eyes out and talk about EVERYTHING. To this day, heâ€™s my bestfriend, my life, my lover and my whole entire reason Iâ€™m still here... donâ€™t ever give up, youâ€™re more than welcome to text me. I donâ€™t ever want you to think that suicide is the only option. When I went back home, my mom had the police there and everything, just seeing her crying that hard and begging for me to come home really gave me a different perspective in life. Value what you have.
