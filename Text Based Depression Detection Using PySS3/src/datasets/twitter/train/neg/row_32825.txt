I think this is itI think this is the week I finally kill myself. Either that or I get put in a hospital for a few days again. I just can't go on like this anymore, there is just no energy left in me to go on. I hate my body and pretty much everything about myself. My so called "friends" all take advantage of me in every way, insult after insult from them makes me hate myself even more. My parents yell at me everyday and I can't sleep at night, and when I finally get some sleep I have no dreams at all. I fell like if I don't kill myself I'll probably die from natural causes because I'm so sick.
