I want to die, but I'm too much of a coward to do it myself.I've set up a great life for myself. I've won a lot of bullshit scholarships and gotten good internships, so I could probably go to a great grad school. But I fucking hate it. I've wanted to blow my brains out every single fucking day for the past year. 

I don't know what I'd do if I didn't go to grad school. I'd be destroying the life I've built up so far. I've won out the competition so many times when it turns out I didn't deserve any of it in the first place.

I want to die, but I'm too scared to actually do it. I just hope that a bus will hit me when I'm not looking or I'd just have an aneurysm while I'm asleep.

I've peaked, my life can't get objectively that much better, but I hate it. It's all downhill from here and can only get worse.
