FoolproofI know they say there is no 100% foolproof method but i think this is as close as it can get really.  So going up to a very tall building and sitting on the edge.. then putting a gun to the roof of my mouth and firing. If it doesn't kill me on impact(which i doubt) the fall 40 stories down will finish the job.  And hopefully i won't be conscious to experience the fall. And just for fun take a load of barbiturates before i do the deed. Pretty foolproof right? 

No need for suicide hotline numbers or anything like that. Not acting on this until later in life. 

Opinions?
