I have an important announcementTo everyone feeling lonely and neglected I love you and so does this whole sub/community. I hope you find happiness and that you don't let anyone or your own actions define who you are now.  Today's a new day and you should focus on that. No problem is worth your life,  you're better than that situation and you will overcome it. If no one has faith in you know that we do,  and we're rooting for you.  Love and support :)
