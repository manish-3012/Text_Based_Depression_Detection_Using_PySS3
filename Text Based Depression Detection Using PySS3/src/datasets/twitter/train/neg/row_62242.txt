AloneFeel so trapped..

Nobody truly cares, even when I make it obvious.

Even when I make it obvious I just got done bawling.

Even when I never smile.

I really have nobody. Nobody checks on me, only when I check up on them..

I would say I'm truly the only one who cares.. but I don't. I don't care what happens.

And neither does anyone else.. and I'm left alone, all the time. I feel trapped. I would run my car into a tree, but I don't wanna somehow survive and become a vegetable.

I was recovering from my horrible depression, but I'm slowly falling back into it..
