Not enoughIâ€™m a failure and I hate myself so at 20 years old I just want to fucking kill myself.I donâ€™t want to die and I want to have success in life and not hurt people I love.
But at the same time I wish I could just end it with no regret/worry.I wonâ€™t allow myself to do it but I want to so badly.Its a problem Iâ€™ve had before where I canâ€™t logically come to kill myself but emotionally I crave it.It makes you wonder if you never try are your suicidal thoughts even serious.
