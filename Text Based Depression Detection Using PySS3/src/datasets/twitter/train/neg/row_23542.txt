EmotionsI do not know what is going on at this point. I used to be so sad and depressed and i cried almost every day from stress, but recently its like my emotions have shut down. I know i'm very stressed and want to die, but it is like i cant express it anymore. I cant cry or get mad anymore. i just feel like an empty vessel with nothing to live for or think happy about. People have noticed that i haven't cried in a while and have "congratulated" me on "getting better", but i know that its because i cant cry. Anyone experiencing even close to the same thing?
