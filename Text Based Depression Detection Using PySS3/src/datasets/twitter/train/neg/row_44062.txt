Itâ€™s so hard to cope with being uglyThe feeling of knowing youâ€™ll never be appealing to anyone is soul crushing. It literally makes life meaningless. 

My parents let me keep a 9mm in my room in case thereâ€™s a break in. Iâ€™m not suicidal right now, but sometimes Iâ€™ll just stare at the weapon. Itâ€™s a black piece of metal, but it has the power to relieve me of all my suffering in an instant. Iâ€™d never do it, but the prospect of no more lonely nights, no more crying, no more self hate. This small efficient weapon can save me from all that right now if Iâ€™d just pick it up and end it.
