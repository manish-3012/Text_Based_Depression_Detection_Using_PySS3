EpilogueI fantasize about gouging my neck open and bleeding out in the bathtub

I want to crush my skull to pieces in one of those hydraulic presses on Facebook

I want to lay in the street in front of my house in the middle of the night and wait to get run over

I want the bullet I put through my temples to be firmly lodged in my bedroom wall

I want to see what I need to do to make a police officer shoot me

I want to finish every pill bottle I own and then get so ridiculously high that I can't feel myself dying

I want to starve to death so my weight finally won't be the problem

I dream of being in an active shooter situation and acting as a human shield, not so much as to protect others but so my "early" death won't be criticized

I think the worst one of all is that I daydream about everyone I know being gone, so I can do it without a guilty conscience

You're keeping me alive, but not for the reason you think, and I although I hate it there's nothing I can do to change it

If there was a button that would erase any trace of my existence, I would push it in a heartbeat

Every step I take prolongs the inevitable

I have nothing, and that is what I will be
