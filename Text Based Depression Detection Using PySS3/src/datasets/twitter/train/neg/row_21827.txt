Im losing everythingPTSD,Agoraphobia,Psychosis and a bunch of other none sense diagnosed. I lost my mom a year ago....lost my first home 5 months later......live with family things start to look up, getting treatment, not stressing for 4 months.....finally got our own place to rent and because i messed up with the rent being late im being evicted without cause and no correction. It took me 4 months to find my daughters and wife this place and now were losing it and will have no place to go at all, my wife will end up leaving me because of all this since its my fault. Its all this stress, and i cant stop crying now, im so tired of trying, im so tired of failing everyone, im at the end of my rope....i dont know what to do.....
