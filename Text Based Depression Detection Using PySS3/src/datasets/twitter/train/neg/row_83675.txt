I'm going to give it my all to fix things with herI've posted here before and I just need to get this out there.

We've been having a hard time because of my depression and suicidal thoughts for so long. 

I finally told her when she told me she wasn't happy with us.

I've been pouring my heart out to her and making legit promises to get help and give her my everything. I started seeing a therapist this past week and plan on sticking to it. 

I wrote a meaningful, heart filled song on my acoustic guitar and if she'll let me, I plan on playing and singing to her when she gets home later.

She's wanted me to write her a song for over 10 years and I finally did. I hope it's not too late to salvage our relationship. 

I just needed to get this out there and for everyone here at r/suicidewatch to wish me all the luck in the world. I need it.

Just one more thing: If your depression is bringing your relationship down, don't keep it from your SO. You don't have to do this on your own. Get help. Please.

Peace and love.

Edit: She never acknowledged my email that I wrote her a song. She came home, took a nap and then went to Walmart to get a cot to sleep on in our spare bedroom. I'm pretty down right now.

Thanks all for caring.
