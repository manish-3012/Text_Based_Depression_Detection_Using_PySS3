First part of my note.First I would like to address the Veterans Affairs clinic in Colorado Springs on the health care side. You guys are mostly awful people. I do not know if this is a result of you being jaded, is it an us vs. you mentality? You guys are horrible at your jobs. How can you live with yourselves knowing you leave people that absolutely need help in a constant state of having to jump through hoops to see a doctor that doesn't give a dam about their patients. I'm sure there are some good doctors out there but if one bad apple spoils the bunch what does that make your bunch. I'm tired of fighting with you. you are all unprofessional unethical bad people. So as I lay here in agonizing pain I'm thinking of you first. I am willing to bet you guys will come to the conclusion that you were in the right. I'm just some crazy Vet being a crybaby. That's ok, one day you might need help and no one will even give you a thought. But I honestly wish you no ill will, i just hope that one day you will wake up and remember that you are medical professionals and then decide to act like it. 
The rest of this is personal. I will sit here and think about what my best course of action is. I'm very tired of this pain and I'm tired of trying. Thank you all for the opportunity to use this as an outlet for my voice. I will not check this account anymore, this is my decision to make as it is my own life. I am seriously considering it but as of right now it is only one of many options. thank your all.
