I think I'm gonna hang myself tonightIdk where else to turn right now. I've got no one I can talk to, literally. 
I feel so useless. All people ever do is get mad at me. I find it so hard to make friends and when I do they all just back stab me 
anyway. I try so fucking hard to be liked. Not even my fucking psychs like me. I've been to four different ones and they all leave me and forget about my appointments. My first psych moved states and no one told me, she didn't even hook me up with another one. You know you're a piece of shit when even the people who are supposed to help you forget about and abandon you. 

Edit: my parents just kicked me out. I didn't even do anything wrong I don't fucking understand why I'm treated like this
