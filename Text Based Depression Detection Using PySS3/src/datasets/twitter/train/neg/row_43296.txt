I want to stop existingTrying to act strong and hide everything is tearing me apart. I don't want to die. I want to be happy but I can't be. I feel as if there was a hole in my chest where my heart once was. The feeling of complete emptiness. I live one day to another, numb. I can't do the things I used to enjoy so much and it's killing me. I loved to write, but I can't put a single word on paper now, when I used to write thousands of words a day. It's all gone. And I can't talk to anyone. I have no one. I've come to realize I'm completely and utterly alone. I was unwanted from the moment I was born.
