I'm sorry, I can't do it anymore.Guys, it's time. I just can't do it anymore. Today (Thanks to own lazy ass fault) I failed an assignment that will now require me to stay back. No make ups, nothing. I honestly do appreciate everything you guys had said on my previous post, but grades aren't the only problem. I just can't fucking stand to be myself anymore, all the lies, failures, disappointments have just been building up over the years and all I do is get others angry with me and I get there hopes up, saying that things will change but they never have. I just wish everything about me had never existed, my birth, my memories, nothing. I'm tired of trying to put a smile on everyday to make people think I'm okay thanks to sense of pride that never leaves me alone."Don't let them see you weak."  It'll always say that to me. This is going on a lot longer than expected, so I'll just keep going. All throughout Elementary school I was bullied and kept as an outcast and the one nice kid everyone came to with there problems abd of course, with the hope I could finally be one of them the "Popular" kids I would just go back to being treated as a outcast. So believe me or not, I've been depressed since 2nd or 3rd grade. So with that, I've grown up to be the asshole who people still come to for help but just leave me in the dust. I don't like who I am as a person. Thanks for listening to my ramblings. I've got the pills and I'm ready.
