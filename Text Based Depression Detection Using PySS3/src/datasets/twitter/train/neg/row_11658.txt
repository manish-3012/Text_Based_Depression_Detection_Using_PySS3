Are we making excuses?I accidentally left the house keys at the door and my housemate is not happy. She told me that I left them at the door and that this past week I've been behaving strangely and distracted. And it is true I have been very distracted because of the pressure of paying the room rent and many other things, and I'm starting to realize how much tougher it is to be 21 and be a full grown responsible adult. Everytime I respond with "oh, I'm sorry, I just started taking my antidepressants" or "forgetfulness is a consequence of depression/schizophrenia", I feel like I'm making excuses and I don't intent on making people take pity on me. That's why I always take the blame and admit my mistake and suppress my negativity, and then I have to beat myself up in privacy, and the whole process is just so sad. I'm not getting younger and I'm tired everyday. How do we do it?
