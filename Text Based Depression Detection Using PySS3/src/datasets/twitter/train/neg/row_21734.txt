Feel sharp pains where I used to cutI used to cut myself quite a bit starting about 2 years ago, Iâ€™d cut myself once a month at least , up until maybe 7-8 months ago now. Sometimes I feel a sharp pain like sensation in my wrists now every once and a while, like I had just cut myself, anyone else ever feel this? Or is this something thatâ€™s common and everyone feels that sometimes?
