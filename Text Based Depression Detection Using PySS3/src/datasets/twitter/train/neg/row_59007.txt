Feels awkward to some regard but, I am feeling pretty down.I kinda just googled, "does life ever get better" and well it took me here and I read through some posts from other people. 

I really don't know what to say to be honest. I just feel like a mirror shattered into a lot of lil bits. Or, like there's just a weight in my chest that hurts from time to time. Maybe even a bottle that is close to bursting. 

Thanks for reading my random outburst.
