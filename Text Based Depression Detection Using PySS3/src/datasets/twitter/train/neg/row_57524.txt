Girlfriend experiencing depression with episodes of extreme sadness and thoughts of suicide since she found out she's pregnant. She does not want to see a specialist. I need advice on how to help her and ensure she's safe. Please advise.She was shocked when she found out she was pregnant. She was not ready and feels like she does not want to have the baby but could not go through abrtion. She has mentioned several times how she feels like she's dying, how I would be better off without her. I keep telling her that these feeling must be hormonal and things will get better but she does not listen. I don't know how to make her feel better. She does not want to see a doctor. it seems these symptoms get worse at night. She has been feeling really weak and nauseous all the time. I don't know if i should tell her family (we don't currently live together) but that might betray her trust. She won't go to doctor. What should I do? How can I help her? Please help.
