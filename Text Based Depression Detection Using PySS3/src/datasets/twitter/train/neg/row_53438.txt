entitled millennial hereits always fun to watch people share suicide phone numbers like â€œhereâ€™s a bandaid for your everlasting, unceasing hemorrhageâ€. i used to call my local one everyday. i liked when i got a girl cause i could flirt with her. one time the police just randomly showed up and said i could either stay at a friends house or the station for the night because theyâ€™d received a tip from the hotline saying i was a threat to myself. after that i never called again.

it just feels like itâ€™s all downhill from here, ya know? even my therapist agreed with me. itâ€™s depressing. i donâ€™t like the idea of my splattered brain material on the wall or visions of making my mother and father suffer. so i guess iâ€™ll wait it out for their sake? that sounds pathetic. maybe iâ€™m just believing â€œthe mindâ€ and what â€œthe mindâ€ is telling me. if i disassociate im just a camera that looks at a thumb writing out some dumb drivel.

i donâ€™t want to be a part of a mob society where everyone is wrong and people dont have any humanity or compassion or forgiveness in them. but im not gunna kill myself so i guess its time to practice my disassociation techniques
