What Really Keeps You Here?I've tried a couple times but I chicken out at the last second including last night. I felt like a failure so I went to lay down and I heard my daughter whimpering for her mother in her sleep. I'm not gonna go into but that stung. Anyways, I picked her up and she stopped crying and said "thank you Dad".

I just started bawling like a baby and realized that she's the reason I can't. Daughters need their dad even if other people don't think so. Even if life keeps railing me, she still deserves the best.

What keeps you guys around?
