I WANT TO DIE.Iâ€™ll be 23 in a few hours. For as long as I can remember my birthdays have been absolute shit. Iâ€™m wondering if I died on my birthday in my past life because every year like 2 days leading up to my birthday a cloud of sadness embraces me. I want to die most days and I wish the world could atleast give me one thing tomorrow which is my death. 23 fucking years old and I havenâ€™t made any marks, I havenâ€™t done anything memorable and Idk where tf my life is going. I feel like such a waste of space and air... Plummeting into the deepest, darkest abyss.
