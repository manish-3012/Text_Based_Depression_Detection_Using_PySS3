just want to pour whatI feelI don't want to die, I want to stop existing. If I die, mom would cry. I don't want to bring pain with my death, and maybe that's the only thing that stops me. I don't have someone to hear me out, so I wanted to share it here, knowing that nor my friends nor relatives will find that post. I could have tried sharing it with someone I know, but it won't help. Everyone has struggles, why should I worry them?  
I was sure that it's just a teenage battle or something, but... seems like nothing has changed and I still can't breathe or feel happy. I don't know, what is the reason to get up. What is the reason to breathe?   
My grandmother died and I watched it; she was slowly collapsing to disease and her mind wasn't stable for a year. It feels like I'm about to repeat her fate, but I really want to ger better. I want to stop cutting my hands, I want to stop being a bad daughter, I want to feel the passion for life. I'm still young, but it's been years since I was ok.   
I needed to write it, that's all   
have a good day :)
