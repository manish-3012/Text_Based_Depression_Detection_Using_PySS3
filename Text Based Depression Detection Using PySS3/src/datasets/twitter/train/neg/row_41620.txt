HeartMy heart is like glass, it is so beautiful I think but it is so easily broken and when others try to pick it up the end result is them gauging themselves on my shattered pieces. How do I keep getting hurt and dragging others down with me? Will taking myself out of the equation entirely remove my glass safely before someone else needs stiches to keep themselves from bursting sure the seams? Please help, my head hurts from trying to understand how to get out and protect those whom I've already evicorated with my worthlessness.
