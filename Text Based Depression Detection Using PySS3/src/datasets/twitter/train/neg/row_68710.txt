Feel myself moving closer towards committing suicide. Please help.I won't get into my current life circumstances, but I feel myself fantasising more and more about not existing. There is currently a big part of me that wants to end it (I've been methodically planning my suicide), but there's still a tiny part of me that has some sense of preservation and is concerned about my current mentality.  And it is the latter part that is posting this and saying: please help.
