Trying to get happyI'm not going to do anything terrible. Just need to let things off of my chest.

I really haven't been able to get happy. I've been putting on a facade for the past week and it's already hurting. My friends/relationships are the most important thing to me, and I try to make people happy. The problem with this is I began believing that if I don't make people happy I am nothing. I spend 8 hours straight a day planning how to fix my friends problems and making jokes and all the while telling myself "your not doing enough." It's been intense self hatred. And I can't ask them for help, because I don't want them to worry about me and in hand make their lives more stressful.

I just need to vent, not planning to do anything. Does anyone have an answer? How can I make other people happy without sacrificing my own?
