Is this considered suicidal?I'm only 20 years old and am currently on Celexa. To make it clear, I do have suicidal thoughts and have been suicidal at times. However, when I am at my best I feel fairly back to normal except with this lingering suicidal thought in the back of my head. I'm not 100% prior to depression but I'd say 70% back to normal. And during this time I can say that I feel fairly ok with the exception that I have this pestering and lingering thought in the back of my head that disturbs me. It's sort of like, I'll be enjoying myself and then the thought will come that says like 'I could just jump off this bridge right now or jump in front of traffic and this could all be over'. It's nowhere near as intense as when I'm doing terrible but it's still there and it's still very disturbing and it sort of brings my mood back down. Would this still be considered suicidal or just suicidal thoughts? Will it go away over time(fingers crossed)? I'm assuming that my anti-depressant would help combat this thought and feeling but it doesn't seem to be doing much. Should I switch anti-depressants or increase dosage? Thoughts?
