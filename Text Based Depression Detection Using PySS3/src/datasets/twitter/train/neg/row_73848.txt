I'm just so disappointed in myself.I've been thinking about suicide for about 5 or 6 years now and honestly, at this point, the only thing keeping myself from actually doing it is the pain that it would cause to my family and friends. I've even thought about walking into a train or bus just so it seems like an accident.

I'm 21 years old, enrolled in college but doing horrible each semester. I have to live at home now while I go to school which just makes matters worse. I'm always depressed when I'm home and the emotions are becoming harder and harder to control. For the past few hours I've been holding back tears while I'm with my family so they don't see that I'm being torn apart inside. I guess pride is what's holding me back but I just cant bring myself to get help. I'm happy I'm here writing this right now because I'm along and I can finally cry.

I'm stuck in a cycle where everything is going great for all of my friends but I keep holding myself back. I hate it all.

All I want is someone to tell me it will be alright.
