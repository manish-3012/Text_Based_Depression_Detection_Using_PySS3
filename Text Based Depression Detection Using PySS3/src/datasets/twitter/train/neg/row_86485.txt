Tomorrow after I finish work I won't return home.I've always wanted to take my own life even from a young age I thought about it. This is something I absolutely have to do because I'm a really disgusting person. I'm 25, never accomplished anything, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin loser. 

I'm not like anyone else I've ever met. Nobody has the same interests and nobody can relate to me.

People keep parroting the same thing to me in that life gets better. Well I've wanted to kill myself since I was very young and nothing had changed for me so its bullshit.

Tomorrow I'm leaving a note for my roommate and heading out to finish it.
