I found the note my mom left meMy mom has been really struggling with depression and anxiety. She canâ€™t live or function on her own anymore so she lives with me and my dad who got divorced when I was 6. Iâ€™m now 20 and home from college bc fucking corona. Anyways she left at like 5 am yesterday and left a short note and all her cash. We called police and spent all day looking for her. I was finally able to track her to a hotel where we found her sitting in the lobby. She was hysterical about wanting to die etc. The police showed up a little bit after us. How pathetic I was able to track her before them. 
Anyways the paramedics showed up to take her to the hospital. I had to go get her purse from her room- the only thing she brought with her. And in her room I found thick computer cords that she took from here to do it. And I found her letter to me. I read the whole thing and I donâ€™t know how I can ever be the same. I havenâ€™t stopped crying since then. I donâ€™t know what to do or how to go on. I have no idea if this is the right sub but I just donâ€™t have anyone to talk to about this 
I havenâ€™t seen my mom in the person she used to be in years and Iâ€™m just so alone. All our extended family is in another country and I have no siblings. Iâ€™m just so horribly upset. I will never be the same after that note. Her saying to keep whatever clothes I like of hers, how proud she is of me, how she hopes I donâ€™t think it was my fault, how I shouldnâ€™t feel guilty that I didnâ€™t get to say good bye. How do I go on after all this. I miss her so much but sheâ€™s nothing like who my mother was. Iâ€™m so sad I canâ€™t stop sobbing
