Suicidal thoughts.Does anyone else think of death all the time. I have maybe 1 day where im ok then all of a sudden im convincing myself to end this experience, I watch alot of morgue documentaries etc I've only just realised most things i watch is to do with death. I do find death peaceful. Will i ever stop thinking about death so deeply?
