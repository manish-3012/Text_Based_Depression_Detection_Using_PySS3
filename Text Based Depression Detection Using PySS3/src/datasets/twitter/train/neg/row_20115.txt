I never thought Iâ€™d be posting here but I think Iâ€™m finally losing itIâ€™ve been bouncing between clinical depression and anxiety since I was 12 years old (Iâ€™m 20 now).  I was always extremely apathetic towards life, and have had recurring thoughts of suicide for years. Iâ€™ve been too scared to commit to the act fearing the pain and uncertainty that comes with death. For all my teens I was alone and insecure and had zero purpose of prospect in my life. Things finally started getting better when I got into a top school on a full ride and got into the most beautiful relationship of my life. 

For 2 years I woke up every single day looking forward to some element of my life. Whether it was talking to my partner, or working towards my career, I loved my life to the fullest. A Love Iâ€™ve NEVER experienced before. I had purpose, drive and motive. 

And then my partner left me. 

During our relationship my anxiety was at an all time high, and I constantly feared everything. â€œWill my life finally work itself out? Will they leave me? Where am I going?â€ But I could live with that. I was in therapy and it helped me manage my thoughts. I kept reminding myself that the labors that I am currently committing to in life will lead my to the life I dreamt of with my partner (beautiful house, beautiful kids, beautiful love) 

Now I am utterly excruciatingly alone, i am in pain every single day and I am struggling to get out of bed. My relationship provided me a consistent reason to wake up and work hard every day because the life I desired was on the horizon. Now Iâ€™m back to hating myself and am reminded that I am a piece of shit who doesnâ€™t deserve life and will never lead a fulfilling one. I hate my life once again and I am reminded of the sweet joy and relief that suicide brings and itâ€™s all one step away. I wish I had done it sooner. 

I never have to suffer again if I could just commit, maybe itâ€™s time.
