If anyone has a minute for me, I could use someone to talk to.I'm not an "emergency" of any particular kind, and I hate using "suicidal" as a term for how I'm feeling but I've had this sinking and letting go kind of feeling lately. Almost as if I've stopped caring about things that are important to me as well as given up trying to whine to my friends, because the conversation is always the same and I can't seem to break out of this cycle. 


If anyone could let me explain my situation to them just to get it out I'd be forever grateful. If there's anything I'm at my breaking point with it's feeling like a burden on the most important people in my life.

Thank you, in advance for your time and consideration. I really appreciate it.
