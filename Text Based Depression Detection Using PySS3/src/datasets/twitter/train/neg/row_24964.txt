Pills, stab wounds, getting hit by a car, just thinking of ways to get hospitalized.I'm a 19 year old female, I was excited to move out with my boyfriend 8 months ago after graduating high school, but since then, I've had an uncanny balance with happiness and extreme depression from time to time. 

It's hard to see my family, see my friends and keep my s/o happy when I have to worry about bills and my job. I understand we all have to grow up at a certain point, but I've been experiencing some seriously unhappy shit. I'm not used to the catcalls, I'm not used to an asshole landlord, and I'm definitely not used to being a target for humiliation at my job. I'm your typical happy-go-lucky young woman who's trying her damn best to be optimistic in this screwed up planet, but it's getting old really fast. 

Arguments keep spewing with my boyfriend, he thinks it's unnecessary to find a better place while I'm busting my ass trying to keep our shit hole of a basement suite clean for his happiness. 

I've gone on birth control for him, I regularly do dishes and laundry, I don't mind being his little clean up girlfriend but I do mind when he clearly doesn't see how shit our landlord treats us. 

I feel like I'm being taken advantage of, and I really think getting hit by a car wouldn't be so bad. Or taking a number of pills just enough to hospitalize me for a little bit would get me away from this fucked up life I've created. 

Stabbing myself is the last resort, I'm really grossed out by blood but if it takes me away for 3 months or more, I will fucking do it. I want to be hospitalized, I want people to notice what I'm going through. I know it's selfish, but I'm so tired. 

Sorry for the long post. I just don't know what to do and I don't know if help is what I need.
