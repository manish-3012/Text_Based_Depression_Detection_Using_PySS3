I have been feeling suicidal for a few years nowI'm only in middle school so I can't do much. I have read about studies proving that my school system makes many people feel the same way as I do - suicidal. I dont know what to do, because I feel like my parents will laugh at me if I tell them, since it's not like they haven't done that with something serious. I get so much homework when I come home, and in school I am forced to do gym. I am not even that athletic, and my leg had broke due to me exercising too much last year. I also am bullied for my appearance, and that I can't run very well, while I get good grades.

The fact that I can't even do what I'd like at home makes it worse. My schedule when I get home is to literally just study, even on the weekends. I usually only get 1 hour of screen time on weekends. Over the summer I only got 2 hours a day, which is quite a bit, but with games like fortnite, you need at least 3 hours or something to even play a game. 

I'm not sure what I want, but it's helped me to vent out when I have been debating on suiciding and not suiciding. Thanks if you actually read the whole thing.
