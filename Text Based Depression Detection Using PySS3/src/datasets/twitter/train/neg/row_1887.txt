I am so petty and stupid.Understandably, I don't deserve any sympathy for this. 

So, There's 3 of us living together. Almost 6 years. Related. We share rent and pay bills 3 way. Person 1 gets along with everyone. Person 2 and I hate each other. I 'financially' support Person 1 - my sole reason for living there. Anyways I don't go out much, I don't have much of reason to anyways thanks to depression and anxiety. I don't have (m)any friends, nor am I close with family. Person 2 is more outgoing, carries a huge narcissistic ego and loves gossiping and driving around town with their shiny toy car. Person 2 loves to put me down for never going out which keeps their ego afloat. For years this has been Person 2's go to attack. Finally I snapped, I spat on the front windshield of Persons 2 car while they weren't looking. Yes, very childish. Immediately I regret my decision, not because I did it but because it left an obvious mess that points back to me. So I thought I could clean it up and Person 2 would be none the wiser. Hell their window was already do for a cleaning, I'd be doing them a favor. Wrong. Oh how very wrong I am. Possibly the worst seemingly innocent items in existent. Windex and beach towel. I dread this. what was a simple spit mark barely noticeable and easily have been washed off by a light rain turned into a 'cover the whole fucking window with a very obvious permanent smudge and swirl marks that will probably require a window replacement. Now, I will never hear the end of Person 2.  What the fuck was I thinking, I'm so stupid. 

I deserve this. I hate my life. I'm so very tired my existence.
