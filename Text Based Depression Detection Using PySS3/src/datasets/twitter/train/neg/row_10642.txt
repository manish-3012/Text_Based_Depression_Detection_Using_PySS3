Just need someone to talk toI was in a bad state of mind and I'm back. My family asked me to get tested for Bipolar Depression but that was negative. Instead, it's Severe Depression, but I just started going back to therapy as well. I had a job for 2 days, then I stopped going. This has been a pattern in my life that has stuck with me. I'm not sure what to do.
