Just Donâ€™t Ask.I sit here in the dark, Rain pouring down, Thinking about you.

I never asked for your love, I never asked to be with you, I never asked about you, So please donâ€™t ask how I feel, Just donâ€™t ask.

I donâ€™t have any idea how much you want me, No Ive nothing to say, About you and I wanna let go for good.

I never asked for your love, I never asked to be with you, I never asked about you, So please donâ€™t ask how I feel, Just donâ€™t ask.

I never asked for your love, I never asked to be with you, I never asked about you, So please donâ€™t ask how I feel, Just donâ€™t ask.

I was doing just fine? You ruined my life, I never needed you oh no, I was fine alone I need nobody to get by.

I never asked for your love, I never asked to be with you, I never asked about you, So please donâ€™t ask how I feel, Just donâ€™t ask.

I never asked for your love, I never asked to be with you, I never asked about you, So please donâ€™t ask how I feel, Just donâ€™t ask.
