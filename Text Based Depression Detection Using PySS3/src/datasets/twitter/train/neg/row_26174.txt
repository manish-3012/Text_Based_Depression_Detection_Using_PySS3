I've decided to do it in a weekI'm mentally fucked from bipolar and ptsd. I had a rough year and I hate living. All the things I used to enjoy I get no pleasure from now and I never will again. I can feel it and I can't stand feeling that way. I'm also fucked financially. I'm going to get some money together for my business partner and my mom to leave them. Either than that I'm just leaving my cats and my nieces. But my nieces have moved across the country. My cat will miss me.... But he is good and I'm sure he will find a good home. It's not that I really want to die... I just don't know how to go on living anymore. I am afraid of death. I am afraid of eternal nothingness. But that's how life already feels. I don't see how I could feel worse than I do now... So that means it can only get better from here even if I am dead. I wish I could do it in away that will leave my organs donatable :/ but I'm too chicken for the methods that would leave a chance for that.
