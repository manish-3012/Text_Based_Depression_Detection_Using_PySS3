I feel like my life is a cycle and I'm tired of living it. There's only one way I can think of to break itI'll get super close with someone then they'll hurt me in some way or I'll hurt them which just makes me feel like shit. I'll get super into something all at once and just completely lose intrest in it. I find myself just wanting to be alone more and more my family just annoys me even when they just want to talk to hang out or do something fun and I feel awful for feeling annoyed by that. I've probably had 5 or 6 different illnesses since November and I'm getting super annoyed with it these include: an upper respiratory infection that landed me in the er, an uncommon and very contagious skin condition, an extremely bad sinus infection, and some other minor stuff. I'm tired of being sick and I'm tired of people coming into my life, making me happy and having hope and then either crushing it themselves or having me crush it by fucking up. I don't know if I have the strength to kill myself but I think about it every day. I've planned it out but I don't know if I could ever go through with it. I've had depression on and off for my whole life and it just gets worse. I've developed some pretty bad anxiety as well but I just don't think that I want to live like this anymore.
