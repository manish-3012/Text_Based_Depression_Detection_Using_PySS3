I cant forgive myself for what Iâ€™ve done in the past and thereâ€™s going to be a day where I kill myself because of it. Iâ€™ve realized it too late. I need help.I had a troubled past and the things Iâ€™ve done things that are inexcusable. Even with my mental illness thereâ€™s no way I will ever forgive myself for the things Iâ€™ve done. I was a shitty human being and I bullied a lot of people. Iâ€™ve made countless mistakes where it benefited me instead of everyone elseâ€™s wellbeing. 

Iâ€™ve probably made other people depressed and suicidal and I acted like a good person. And Iâ€™ll never forgive myself for that. Iâ€™ve been trying to fix all my mistakes but I canâ€™t change the past and I canâ€™t reverse the damage to the people Iâ€™ve hurt.

No matter what I do and try, my reasoning for killing myself feels justified because I canâ€™t get over the fact that I was so malicious and spiteful. Iâ€™ve realized this later in life (Iâ€™m 21 now), and I really canâ€™t comprehend why I was like that. 

Iâ€™ve been trying to be a better person but the weight of all my wrongdoings are getting worse and itâ€™s feeling more justifiable to end my life the more I realize how bad my wrongdoings were.
