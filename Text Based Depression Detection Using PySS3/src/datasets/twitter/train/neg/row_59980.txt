I'm at peace with suicide.Living 16 years is a lot. I feel like in those 16 years I laughed, cried, and enjoyed myself so much. However this past year I've been in a depression almost this entire time, and I'm starting to think I died somewhere a long the way. Maybe it was a slow death, but I really do think I'm dead now.

I'm at peace with suicide, I feel like it's my time to go, physically and spiritually. I have a gut feeling that I've reached the conclusion of my life according to my destiny. I think to myself 'maybe my destiny is to kill myself now'. It's such a strong feeling, like I really do believe deep down that there's nothing left for me.

Yes, i get it. I can achieve so much more if I lived. "Just start a hobby, reignite yourself!" But there's the problem; what happens after you run of matches to ignite with? what if you can't even pick up the match? Besides, everyone, at every age, has dreams they never accomplish.

And the weirdest thing is, I've felt suicidal before, but never before have I ever been so conclusive about it than now. I always pride myself on my instinct and natural wisdom, however I used to think suicide was never the option, while simultaneously thinking i am always right (I usually am heh). So what makes me wrong now? Throughout my whole life, I've never once struggled with a decision before, so why am I debating something that seems so logical now? I really think it's just society's "don't kill yourself!!" thing.

So yeah, long story short, I have a gut feeling I should kill myself, and I think I'm gonna follow through. If I die, I won't regret it because I won't be alive anymore. And if I live, then I won't regret it either because I am at peace with my choice to kill myself, and surviving just means that God doesn't agree that now is my time.

I'm going to follow through on that gut feeling. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, but I know it cannot be avoided. Not anymore, anyway.
