Iâ€™m not scared for the first timeAll the other times iâ€™ve said i wanted to die i wasnâ€™t sure or ready to leave my parents or anyone else because i felt bad. My life has absolutely no meaning anymore and the people i loved who were also support systems for me are gone. 

I think about killing myself rn and iâ€™m not scared to do it at all and that kinda scares me but i wouldnâ€™t want to do it impulsively i would want to write out notes and everything. I just canâ€™t see a light at the end anymore and thereâ€™s nothing keeping me here . everyone will be fine without me and i donâ€™t know why i keep putting myself through this misery and pain everyday just so i can try for other people. I donâ€™t wanna be here anymore and iâ€™m serious about that and i guess i just wanted to get it off my chest
