I just want to sleep, to be in a reality where I'm needed.For the past two years of my life, I've been told the same things over and over again. 
"Anon, you don't know what you're talking about, you're just a child!"
"Anon, you can't think like this, you're too young!"
I'm honestly just tired. I'm not mentally or physically unstable, just done. I don't want to be hear anymore, I just want to sleep. I have nothing to wake up for anymore, just the same cycle every single day. This isn't how I want to live life.
Is there any way for me to just sleep, and never wake up again?
