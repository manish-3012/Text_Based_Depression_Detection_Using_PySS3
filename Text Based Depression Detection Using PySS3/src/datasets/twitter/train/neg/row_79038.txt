just one more dayI've been hospitalized already once. Severe depression and anxiety. 

Ever since I've told myself just live life 1 day at a time, but why ? what's the fucking point ? why live for tomorrow, when its the same shit show over and fucking over and over again.

Besides freezing to death, what's another way to go when you have access to no weapons/sharp items/etc.
