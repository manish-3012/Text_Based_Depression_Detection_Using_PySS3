I think I'm finally done... (x post /r/depression) [Wall of Text]I was always bullied as a kid, told my hair made me look like an "emo" because it was slightly longer than the public school kids expected, I didn't fit into their Ralph Lauren themed life styles. They would slip knives under the table to give to me and then scream at the teacher that I was going to kill myself.

I almost got expelled twice because of that. Weird to think I almost got punished for getting told to kill myself.

Of course, chance would have it that a year later at 15 my dad, after years of alcoholism and vacancy from my life, hung himself. He hadn't been able to get over his depression for 30 years after his own dad had taken his life. 

Now my class mates just saw me as the suicidal poor kid who's dad committed suicide because their dad committed suicide. 

My *self fulfilling prophecy* was I was going to be an academic failure (which I was, unable to even complete my A-level - Equivalent to American AP's I believe) and that I was going to kill myself.

Right now... My self fulfilling prophecy is looking, well, pretty self fucking fulfilling.

My Dads parents (well, his mother and my Granddad) noticed my early onsets of depression back when I was 17. Although it was way past early stages by that point, they tried to cheer me up. Sent me to Kenya for 3 weeks to see how bad some people have it.

All I saw was 3 weeks of the most dire, arid and deadly place to live. Regardless of my attempt to help build a school there all we saw was death. Kids with eyes more yellow than Bear Grylls piss, their livers completely destroyed by Malaria and AIDs, kids who would pass out in the sun because we tried to play football with them after they hadn't eaten for weeks. I got sent into a war zone against an enemy I couldn't fight, or even see. And even ended up getting Malaria during my 2nd week which removed any possibility of me donating blood something I had been keen on doing since I was 14...

And yet, even in that situation the other people that had come with me in the group volunteering project were homophobic and rude. In a group of people that have paid to travel half way across the world to build a school and help these Kenyans I still found the hatred and ignorance in humanity that upsets me.

Fast forward a couple of years and I had dropped out of college twice more, failing to even get past my pessimism and finish the year let alone attend the exams at the end of it I even got an A in my Sociology exam after no revision or sleep and I managed to convince myself that there was no way I was going to complete the course.

I was (and still am) in a Music Tech course, but again I'm stuck in a loop of pessimism and defeatism. I'm apprehensive to wether I can complete this course to an acceptable standard. For once I've found something that I actually enjoy, but I'm just fucking awful at it.

But I found my first love there, the first time since I was 15 I had been happy. 5 years of searching for a girl friend who I liked, instead of someone I was just dating out of pure desperation. I also got given a ticket to go to Ghana and repeat my work from Kenya.

And it was bliss. I was finally happy, the 5 weeks I spent in Ghana were amazing, it was so much more wealthy there the kids were better fed and slightly better looked after (minus a day where the head master just beat the shit out of all of the kids with a stick and we had to just sit and watch) the school we taught at was on a white sand beach. It wasn't perfect of course, marred by my girl friend flipping her car (and walking away unscathed) and she constantly was worried I was going to cheat on her. I was there with 18 girls and 1 other guy, but she never trusted me.

Of course... it all changed when I got back home. I helped move my girl friend into her new flat in Cardiff where she was going to start uni, she had 2 female flatmates and 2 male ones. And pretty much instantly she was over me and was already looking at this new guy. She told me in November that she had miscarried in July just after I left for Ghana, she had never even told me she was pregnant just sorted it herself as she didn't trust me. Stopped talking to me as much and when she did she was always rude and aggressive despite my best I could never make her happy. And then on Christmas Day she told me she wanted a break, which was actually just her telling everyone we had broken up, but not telling me. Turns out she had been sleeping with the guy from Cardiff since October, but didn't want to break up with me and instantly go out with him as that looks bad. Come January she finally tells me she only dated me to get over her abusive ex and was done with me, I said I was thinking of taking my own life, she said I was pathetic and immature for saying that. Next day, exactly a week before the 5th anniversary of my dads suicide she starts dating her room mate.

It's now March, I've spent every day since then unable to sleep properly and fighting with myself. Forcing myself to stay in bed and try and sleep instead of just going downstairs and grabbing a knife. I'm failing at college and months behind on my work, any hope of handing my work completed and on time now is practically non-existent and I haven't even begun to think about handing it in and it being of the exceptional level I need to get into Uni. My will to live has shattered.

All I do now is sit in my bubble of depression, scowling at the things I have grown to hate in our jumbled group we call a "society"

**Greed**, **Misogyny**, **Inequality**, **Aggression**, **Exploitation**, **Racism**, **Homophobia**, **Ignorance**, **Patriotism**, **Nationalism.**

***Injustice***

I know life is going to get better, you don't need to tell me that. I understand that life is a roller coaster. I'm just saying I want to get off.

I can't live in a world where people do not see that when we bleed, *we bleed the same*.

I tried to stand defiant against the waves of *prejudice* and *hatred* this species seems to thrive and feed off. But I've got nothing left to give.

I've broken bread with our future CEO's and upper class ass hats.

Had a beer with the next middle class office workers.

And shared my food with the next generation of working class slaves.

I see where I fit within this world. And it is not within the class hierarchy.
