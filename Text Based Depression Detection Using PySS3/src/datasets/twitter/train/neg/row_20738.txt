When I dieMy dad will be the only one who truly gives a shit.

My mom will be glad I'm gone. No more useless daughter.

My friends will be relieved that at least they don't have to pretend to like me anymore.

My former classmates and teachers will remember me as a useless outcast, "she probably deserved it"

My doctor will only give a shit about their fucking paycheck, not about the patient that died while under their care

Everyone else will pretend to care for a day, then forget i existed the next


Overall, everyone will be better off when I'm dead. Nothing will change, people will move on with their lives.
