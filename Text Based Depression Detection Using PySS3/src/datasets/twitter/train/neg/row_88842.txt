My husband told me odI've been detoxing and trying very hard to get clean. My husband told me I'm doing well. Well Saturday he got blackout drunk and hit me hard and me to od, hang myself and slit my wrists. This is very unlike him but now I don't know if I can save my family after I've put myself through hell of detox and then got hit by a man almost a hundred pounds my weight more.
