I'm 25 and literally dying inside every single dayI just hope this pain of life ends, I just wanna be done with my responsibilities in next few years! I am surviving, I'm not living, and I don't wanna survive.

This whole world is just toxic, especially when you're from a third world country. 

Fuck the world, really if corona is the end game, I'm happy that it happened.
