RantI feel like my life is a nightmare and I belong somewhere else. I'm so disgusted by every aspect of my life; my mother, the food that I eat, my house, myself, my experiences. 90% of my time is spent daydreaming about what my life could and should be.

I feel so bad for my mother, for trying so hard to give me a good, fun life, but instead she messed me up like her parents messed her up. I wish I didn't hate her so much, almost everything she does makes me feel sick. 

I rarely have an appetite anymore, today was the first time in a long time. As I sat down, a bunch of flies flew into my bowl. I really can't believe how fucking disgusting my life is. I wish I could get the courage to kill myself and finally put this trainwreck to a stop.
