Feeling awfulI've got some anger problems, I haven't been working on them. I don't know how to do that much to fix them in the first place though. 

I keep hitting and hurting my husband and it's like so much rage builds up and then I attack. But if course when I can think logically again I feel awful about it. He says he's going to leave if I keep pushing him and I believe it. That alone makes me wish I was dead. 

More than that it's so messed up because I love him and we've been through a lot and I know fucking this up is ruining the best relationship I've ever had. 

I just really wish I was dead though. 
So bad.
