I've been depressed for almost 7 years and it's only gotten worseI'm failing out of college, I got fired from my job, I'm living at least 3 completely different lives, I'm extremely in debt and broke, my girlfriend of 3 years hates me now and I deserve it, I'm objectively a terrible terrible person. Seriously I've done so many awful things no one knows about and I hate myself. 


I just keep using drugs as much as I possibly can to shut up the suicidal voices in my head but that just makes me hate myself even more. 


Despite all the different methods of treatment I've done, nothing has worked. I've been depressed since I was 13 and I'm close to 20 now.

So I guess it's it. I'll be gone soon.
