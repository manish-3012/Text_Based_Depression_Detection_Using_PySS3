I hate seeing myself in the mirror. and I can't stand being aliveI look like a man let alone pretty. and I'm a 21 year old girl.

my dad said to me a year ago that i look like a boy too. I know it's shallow and people give me so much crap for it. but is it too much to ask? to be normal. I'm trans and I wish everyday that was normal :(

on top of all that i'm a lesbian in a country that makes it illegal to be trans and doesn't make things super easy for trans people (Iran). I dreamt of leaving here ever since i was little. and I don't know how I can. I can't do this all by myself. and I have noone to help me. I'll probably just die in here. things are so hard in Iran specially ever since trump came. my dad also doesn't take me that seriously and dead names me. he gets angry if I ask him to use my correct name. and my amazing girlfriend lives in the US so it's very very very hard to deal with loneliness. all I want is to be in her arms and hug her.

there's no way i can ever ever afford 40,000$ for my surgeries either. it's ridiculous. I have barely saved 1000$ and I don't see how I can save that much. and I have zero self control so I spend my savings. I had 1600$ until i bought a vr headset.

I'm 21 and I don't even have a job. I'm trying to study programming (my dream job) at home but depression makes it so hard. before all this I used to read books and code for up to 12 hours a day. sometimes I was so excited to learn a new things that I stayed up all night. i even skipped sleep 1-2 times a week. now I can even study for an hour a day.

I've tried so many therapists but non of them were nice or helpful. the latest one is the only sane one but all she does is to throw pills at me thinking they solve everything. all with different side effects

I have no self-soothing methods and when I feel dysphoric i panic and i freak out and i get so so anxious and i have no choice but to start talking to someone, even then it barely helps. I don't know what to do.

I get paralyzed to the point where I can only type.
