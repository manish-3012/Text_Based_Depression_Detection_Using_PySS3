I donâ€™t want to die todayMy friend tried to kill herself a month ago. Another friend tried last night. Iâ€™ve been suicidal forever, but they broke the mental barrier I had built between me and suicide. Now I canâ€™t pull myself away from the medicine cabinet. The plan is pills. I know it probably wonâ€™t work because all we have are weak painkillers. I know how much it hurt me when they tried to kill themselves and I donâ€™t want to put them through that. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here instead of talking to my friends or my family. I love them. I donâ€™t want to hurt them. Iâ€™m not really even depressed right now, Iâ€™m just sad.

So someone please talk me down. I think Iâ€™ll be okay if I can make it through the next 3 days. Please give me 3 days worth of strength. Please. Just let me get through this without hurting anyone.
