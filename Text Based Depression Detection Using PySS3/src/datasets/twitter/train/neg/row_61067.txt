Iâ€™m afraid that if I get out of bed Iâ€™m going to seek out a way to kill myself.I hate my life. Thereâ€™s nothing Iâ€™m good at. Every single day is a struggle and a disappointment. Nothing is ever going to get better or change and I just want to die but Iâ€™m too much of a coward to die at the same time. Iâ€™ve already wasted so much of my life that thereâ€™s just not any point to continuing. Iâ€™m in some kind of physical pain every single day that no doctor has had any ideas with. There is nothing that I enjoy, nothing that brings me happiness. Hell, when I started crying this time even my dog got up and left. My husband told me heâ€™s tired of taking care of me and heâ€™s all Iâ€™ve got. No friends, family hates me, and the one person whoâ€™s supposed to be there through it all told me Iâ€™m ruining his life. Which I kind of get because Iâ€™m negative all the time and emotionally shut off, but thatâ€™s just how it is. I canâ€™t be fixed. Iâ€™ve tried therapy, antidepressants, regular exercise and all that long list of shit thatâ€™s supposed to make a person happy. But it doesnâ€™t. I canâ€™t feel happiness and I never will, and I believe that if I get out of bed I will go get the gun out of the dresser and just end it all. I donâ€™t fucking care anymore. No one cares about me, no one loves me, Iâ€™m just a massive burden on everyoneâ€™s lives who has to ask for help with every little thing because Iâ€™m stupid and emotionally incapable of processing anything more than a toddler can. Thereâ€™s no fucking hope, and thereâ€™s no fucking reason to continue til old age just to die and look back at how I accomplished nothing in my life. Why not just go ahead and end the disappointment now. At least I could finally succeed at something.
