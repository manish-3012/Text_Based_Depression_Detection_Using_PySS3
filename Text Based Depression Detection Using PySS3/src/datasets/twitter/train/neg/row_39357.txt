Love my life left meGirlfriend of 5 years tells me she's just not happy anymore. She was dating a friend of mine when he passed away from a heroine overdose. I've done everything in my power to make her happy but I've failed. I feel like a failure. I don't want to feel like this. I have zero friends at this moment and she was the only one.  I honestly want to end my life. I really am tired of feeling this way. I don't know why I'm posting honestly probably because I have nothing else to do and don't know where to go.
