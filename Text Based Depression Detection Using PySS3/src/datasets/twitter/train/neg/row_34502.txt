What should I doRecently My depression has gotten worse and worse and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve made multiple plans to kill myself but I have a lot of things in my way. My friends need me, my mom would be completely sad and I donâ€™t want to do that to her. Iâ€™m also concerned about the body, my original plan was to swallow a bunch of pills and go into the woods but it would take too long to find the body and once they do I donâ€™t know what the hell it would look like, I also thought about the same tactic but to just let it happen in my bed but than I thought about my moms reaction, so now I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m thinking of going to the hospitals and doing what the suicide hotline told me but than again I have no form of transportation and the hospital closest to me is a few miles. Itâ€™s all just dumb and hopeless.
