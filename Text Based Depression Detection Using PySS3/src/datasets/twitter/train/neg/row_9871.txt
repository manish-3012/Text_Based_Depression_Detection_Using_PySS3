Hard work is the only way to live and I don't like itI am a spoiled 19-year old brat with a lot of opportunities in life but I don't have the patience and motivation to fulfill them. I have a lot of interests, but when I start doing them, I get bored easily and  stop developing.  The only exceptional hobbies I have is playing violin and... (over)thinking but they were just inherited from my family. I realized that when you want to success and be good at something, you need to work hard and be patient. I don't have these qualities. I'm lazy and get bored easily. I don't stay constant and I'll be a mediocre person without any special qualities. I don't like this unwritten rule of life. And if I don't like the rules, I don't play the game. Why everyone value this life, even if the only way to survive is working hard? If this is depression, then why it is abnormal condition of mental health? Disproportion of the neurochemicals? But isn't this sense of "right" and "wrong" proportion subjective if it doesn't inflict any direct damage to the tissues of my body but only the mood? What's mental health then? What's mood? What's sane and insane?Why suicide is wrong?
