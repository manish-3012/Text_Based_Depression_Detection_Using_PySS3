I should have the option to choose if i want to dieThere is no viable way now for me to kill myself if I want to, not without not being certain of the outcome, suffering greatly, or creating an excessive trauma to my family. 

I am bummed by the fact I am here struggling to find an option, that I am not even certain I will take advantage of. I should have a choice. I shouldn't be finding it so hard to find a way.

I just want the option available, that's all.
