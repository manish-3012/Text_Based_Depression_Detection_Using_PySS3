I think I have a reason to live now?Because of her, I have a reason to leave my bed, to smile, to feel. Because of her, I think I am happy. Actually, I'm not sure. I don't know if I'm really happy or am I forgot why I am sad. But they are quite close, right? I haven't feel that way for a very long time. She makes me wanna give life one more chance. It may be painful but I want to try, I want to learn to live with it. All because of her.

Is that a good thing though? Depending my life on her. She has no idea she is that important to me. It may be unfair and too much responsibility to her? What should I do?
