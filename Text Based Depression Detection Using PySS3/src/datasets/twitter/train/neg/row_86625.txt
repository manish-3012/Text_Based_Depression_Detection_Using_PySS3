I don't know how to tell my SO that I'm suicidalI love him so much and I don't want him to blame himself if he ever knew that I was suicidal. I also can't let him know that some days, he is the only thing keeping me on this earth. That's too much pressure to place on a partner. 

My suicidal thoughts feel like a secret. He knows so much about me, but he doesn't know about this demon looming over me at all times.
