GuiltMarried, early 40s.  Three kids, adore them and they adore me.  Wife diagnosed with rare disease about four years ago.  Long story short, lost attraction, and felt guilty for it.  

Longer story shorter, recently began an affair with a co-worker.  Not a meaningless fling, I've truly fallen in love with her.  I have a close-knit extended family, with traditional midwest values, everyone in my life would be devasted.  

Divorce is not an option, I either end the affair and be miserable without her or keep the secret as long as possible knowing it's just a matter of time before it's discovered.  I feel like I've already ruined everything and I daily contemplate suicide as an alternative to the shame of being discovered as a cheater, fraud, asshole, etc.  I'm not afraid to die, but I'm afraid to live with the guilt of disappointing so many I love.
