I really, really fucked upI am an English major. English has always been my thing. I love writing. I want to become a professor. I'm always helping my friends and family with papers. I identify myself by my ability to perform at school.


And I accidentally plagiarized a paper.


I had no idea that I screwed it up so badly. I didn't know that the source I had pulled from was more than paraphrasing general knowledge. My professor called me into the office and was really merciful. The essay was dropped but I did not have to appear before a court of students or deal with the dean or anything else. I cried a lot in the office and went home. It's over and done with. I can still pass the class and be ok.


There is no reason I should be feeling the way I'm feeling right now and I'm frustrated that I want to self harm. I've been thinking about suicide since it happened. 


I keep thinking about what had happened if I got kicked out of university. Then I would have just ended it and not posted here. I would not be able to live with that reality.


But I feel the need to punish myself for this. I hate myself and I want to die. I am so angry. I keep thinking about how death is the only way out and I've never felt like such a failure in my entire life. 


I've dealt with a lot worse things than this and I don't know why I feel the need to kill myself over it. But it's here and it's really strong. I can't talk to anyone about this because I feel so humiliated, but I can't deal with this feeling alone. 


Update: I'm still feeling horrible but I'm here. Thank you for talking with me.
