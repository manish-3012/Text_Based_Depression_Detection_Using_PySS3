Severe Depression taken away my will to live (24/m).It is very hard for me to believe that this is actually happening to me again. 

I dwelled on this event all throughout the summer of 2011 and most of the fall of 2011.

I'm getting a set of extremely negative thoughts that I can't do anything about. This event is from a certain date in the spring of 2010 when I was still only 14 years old. 

almost a year-and-a-half later, when I was over 16 years old, I still had uncontrollable and unwanted ruminating and dwelling thoughts of this event that I cannot control. 

The odds of this event happening is the same luck equivalent to rolling Snake Eyes with Dice 25 to 30 times in a row. 

Because of the beyond ridiculously poor luck, this is why the event had me ruminating on it for so long. 

now that it's fucking 20/20 and the The unwanted and uncontrollable thoughts are coming back now that I am sober. 

I am now sober, but very very depressed. 

I have a strong will to die in a very weak will to live. 

I'm in a great deal of pain and agony mentally and cannot do a single thing about it.
