Why Not?I've given up anymore. I can't stand it. I can't stand being alone, I can't stand working or studying or doing anything. What's the point of going to school, racking up thousands in debt, just to work and hate working until I die? Why not just die now, if that's all it's good for, if all I'm going to cease to exist eventually?

I truely am forever alone. I scare everyone away, no one really gives a damn about me. I'm just here. Living. Wake up, feel exhausted, no one can even care to ask anything. I scare anyone away. I'm okay with life, if I can just experience the feeling of someone caring. Someone to come home to, lie next to. But I don't. And I'm too depressed to even try to find that, find a way of functional relationships. I don't even know how to introduce myself to strangers. 

It's just one last adventure that I can afford. See where I get, and end where I end. 

Because, what's the point of trying? What's the point of continuing when I have no one I trust, no one I can be fully open with and talk to whenever? It doesn't help whenever I get this way at night, no one gives a damn to reply to my texts.
