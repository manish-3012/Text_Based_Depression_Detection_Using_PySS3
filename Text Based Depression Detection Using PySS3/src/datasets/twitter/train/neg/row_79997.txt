I'm doneI can't take this pain I'm in all the time. I don't want to be alive anymore. I feel like I'm losing my mind and I can't stop making mistakes. I have to go get my things in order.. there's a train near where I live. So that should work. I just want this pain to end. What is so wrong about wanting to end your own suffering? I can't do this anymore. To anyone reading this..thank you. Thank you for everything
