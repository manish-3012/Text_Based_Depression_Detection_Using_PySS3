I failedI failed at everything. 29 still living off my parents. Got degrees but no skills to actually succeed in a real work environment mostly due to my crippling social anxiety and freezing bcos my mind gets clouded with useless thoughts. Feel like i chose the wrong career path and its too late to switch. Besides, i probably would not succeed in anything else either. Failed miserably at a relationship. Cheated on the person that i loved the most and got caught/destroyed another persons life. Now i just feel like a shit person who doesnâ€™t deserve to live. I should not be existing. I am just a waste of space.
