I need to talk to someone...My fiancÃ© and I just split and I have to up and move out of the state I love, because Iâ€™m all alone here and canâ€™t afford it on my own(I have to go back to my parents house). My family doesnâ€™t care what Iâ€™m going through and I have no one I can talk to. I just need someone to tell me everything is okay and life is still worth living. Everything just feels so hopeless and painful. I donâ€™t know how much more I can take. Iâ€™m terrified of being alone and Iâ€™m having constant thoughts of just putting a bullet in my head to end all the misery. I donâ€™t want to be alone..
