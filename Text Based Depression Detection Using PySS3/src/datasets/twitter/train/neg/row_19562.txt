If I'm not happy by age 25-30, I think it's best that I just die.I am 19 years old. I've had anxiety my entire life and depression since I was 12, and it's gotten worse and worse over the years. Add misophonia to that and it makes life torture. It's especially bad now because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing in life. The only reason I have to live is for my friends and family, and because I'm too scared to die (which is ironic because I wish I was dead most of the time, or at least I wish I'd never been born). But life is scary, too. Anyway. If things don't get better in the next 5-10 years, then I fucking quit. Or maybe I'll pussy out like the pathetic, piece of shit coward I am. I don't know.
