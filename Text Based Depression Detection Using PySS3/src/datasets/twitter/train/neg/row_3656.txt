...Iâ€™ve been reading a bit, and am not sure if I tell people about this whole situation. On one hand it would mean I could get proper help, but Iâ€™d feel selfish. Also, as I mentioned in a comment, that would involve my mum finding out, and Iâ€™m not sure about it. Should I seek medical help/ a therapist?
