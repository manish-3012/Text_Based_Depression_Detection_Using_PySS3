I'm about to be homeless with 2700 dollars to my name, if not less.I quit school because of depression. I have found no job due to corona, but I doubt having a job would make it better at this point. I still live at home with my dad, but seeing as I'm technically an adult (19), he is about to kick me out for not being able to contribute to rent. I can't even be mad at him for that.

I had a note ready two nights ago. I was gonna get so incredibly drunk I could barely process pain, then slit my left wrist all the way up to the elbow and then dunk that mess into a big bucket of warm water. I accidentally got so drunk that I lost the knife, and I couldn't physically get out of bed to try and find it. I passed out for a couple hours, and by then I was sober enough to get on my feet and throw up the entire contents of my stomach. Glad I got to the toilet.

I still couldn't understand what was going on, so I just ended up calling my mom and crying on the phone for 2 hours. 

My dad came home the day after (yesterday), and all he said was that he was angry with me for drinking his expensive rum. I have rewritten my note.

I don't know where I'll go. I will probably go pick up my cash from the bank, gamble it all away during this week while in a motel. I'll end it somehow when I'm out of money, which I think will be about a week and a half from now, if that.
