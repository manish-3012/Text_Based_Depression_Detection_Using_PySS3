I'm scared to die but I don't wanna liveI'm still a preteen and I've been experiencing this thing called depression.

I'm quite a quiet, lazy and not socially active girl.

Anyways **today**, me and my mom had a fight. I'll not explain why we had a fight for some privacy reasons. My mom told my dad about the fight and I'm guessing my father just assumed I'm the wrong one, he grabbed my phone and yelled at me which really shook me.  

&amp;#x200B;

He told me two sentences that made my depression just grow.. He told me these; 

&amp;#x200B;

"Your quite useless for a girl."

"I think it's better if we disown you."

&amp;#x200B;

It really hit me like a truck and I started to think about how useless I am. I wrote a note today too, I'm planning to kill myself but the thought of my grandparents, death and hell makes me scared..
