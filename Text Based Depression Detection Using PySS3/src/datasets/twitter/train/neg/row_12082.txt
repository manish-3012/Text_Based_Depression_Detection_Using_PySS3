Impending shit stained future, hopelessness, considering death as an alternativeI dashed through highschool depressed as hell. As the years were slipping away, passing by the unaware me, my success in school was gradually dropping. And it dropped to the lowest point I'd theoretically consider it to. And now, at this very point in time, I am slowly acknowledging that my future is undeniably doomed. Even if I manage to go to the college (which my parents will obviously need to pay for me), I will fuck that up as well, as my depression is literally eating more and more of my will to do anything at all, let alone working on my future. Daily. I'm perpetually staring into single points in space with nothing but recursive, draining thoughts on my mind. I can't fathom concepts and can't force myself to think and process information anymore. Even if the circumstances somehow happen to turn out survivable, I will still have to live my life for decades afterwards with a consistent and immortal voice in my head that will remind me that I never managed to reach my full potential in life and that I will never get a chance to reach it, or restart my schooling years.

I never knew a place so hopeless and dark even existed. Well, now I know. To my misfortune. That will ultimately kill me - either by life circumstances or suicide.
