I tried to kill myself last night and I donâ€™t know how to feel about itIâ€™ll probably end up deleting this because I donâ€™t want people to really know but I tried killing myself last night for the 3rd time ever (first 2 times I couldnâ€™t really bring myself to doing what would actually kill me) but I took a bottle of vyvanse and some other drugs and right after doing it I regretted it. I was having a huge panic attack so I wasnâ€™t really thinking straight and I didnâ€™t want my parents to know, although they would kind of have to if I was going to die, so I went and basically just started texting my ex (who still wanted to be close friends) all the things that were just me repeating the same things over and over and just hoping sheâ€™d still care enough to respond and she did and I started to feel worse and worse so I tried to call 911 (like my parents somehow wouldnâ€™t notice and ambulance when it got here) and tried to tell them and stand up but I was very dizzy. I thought I was gonna die so I basically just told my ex that she was the most amazing person ever, and everything was just so confusing and I feel HORRIBLE for throwing that kind of burden on her, but everything is so difficult because I still want to die, and it doesnâ€™t help that but parents are mad at me for trying to kill myself and my ex who was the only person who brought me happiness isnâ€™t with me anymore and I just feel alone and empty. Everyone says that after you try to kill your self. You will realize its not worth it. But I still want to be dead and, if anything, I want to be dead even more
