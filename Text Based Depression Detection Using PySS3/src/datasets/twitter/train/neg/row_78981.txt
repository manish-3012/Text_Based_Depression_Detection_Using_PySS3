I have a plan.6300mg of Quetiapine, 1125mg of Venlafaxine, and hard liquor. I feel like I'm fucking going insane, death by overdose is one with very low death rate, which fucking sucks. 

If I had a better way at hand I'd do that right now instead. I hate the thought of overdosing and waking up still alive with a long term disability that would make it not possible for me to attempt and succeed "next time"

I'm going to start drinking and hopefully when I'm pissed I'll have enough nerve to down all the medication, as it's a higher chance of death when mixed with alcohol.
