My story, and know weâ€™re all here to helpA horrible relationship nearly ended my life. I was a 15 year old who never faced anxiety, depression, or ever had to hold onto someoneâ€™s life. I gave up myself for that girl and became someone I wasnâ€™t, I was trapped. Trapped in a bird cage with no exit, but thereâ€™s always an exit. I kept looking and found myself contemplating in my room listening to music. I was listening to Kid Cudi, he says â€œthis ones dedicated to all the kids like me.â€ I was one of those kids like him, lost, looking for an easy escape whether it be suicide or drugs. I escaped through neither, those lyrics put me into prayer. I knew I was dying of thirst, I needed to look into myself through god. I meditated and told myself to get help. I called a prevention line and saw a great man at psych ward. Iâ€™ve improved greatly and am on track through this wild ride. The point is, you the reader, you are my brother, you are my sister. In this family we help each other out, we care and love one another. Talk to me, find a friend in the comments, we are here to love, not hate.
