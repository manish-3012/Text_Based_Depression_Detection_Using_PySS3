I have a plan but I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m waiting forIt sucks, waiting around for something you donâ€™t know what it is or if itâ€™ll ever come around. My plan is somewhat feasible, I imagine if I ever hit that point where I need-need it then it shouldnâ€™t be an issue. Itâ€™s not hope for the future pulling me back but more like...missing the past?


I miss who I was. I was annoying, loud, zero self awareness, cringe as fuck but as least I was happy. I can count on finger notches how many times Iâ€™ve spoken out loud today. 


I was looking through old pictures and it struck me how my circle dwindled to so little people and these people I cared about dumped me or maybe my shitty friend tendencies reared their ugly head and they were the only ones smart enough to get the fuck away from me.


I just want it to be over. I donâ€™t want senior year, I donâ€™t want to go to university, I honestly want to lie down and never get back up.
