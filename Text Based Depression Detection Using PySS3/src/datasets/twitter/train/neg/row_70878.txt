when the one person you want to care about you doesnâ€™tI donâ€™t know if this is the sub for this kind of post but Iâ€™m going to write it here anyways. 

A few days ago I tweeted about wanting to end my life. I was having a horrible day and someone I loved committed suicide a few days before. All of my mutuals tweeted and messaged me if Iâ€™m alright but my only friend who also has a twitter said nothing. 

Itâ€™s been four days and she has only said I love you once. No â€œare you okayâ€ or even a â€œmerry Xmasâ€. but all of my other mutuals who I barely talk to are still checking up on me and trying to make sure Iâ€™m okay. 

Sheâ€™s my only friend and I feel she should be more concerned. I mean if I saw that she was contemplating suicide Iâ€™d not only reach out to her but family and other friends too. Am I being selfish and too sensitive? 

I honestly donâ€™t think she cares about me anyone because whenever Iâ€™m upset sheâ€™ll say I can talk to her but then doesnâ€™t respond to me but posts things on twitter/Snapchat. I always care for her and asks if sheâ€™s alright and I just feel like I deserve that care too ? Am I wrong for being upset about it ?
