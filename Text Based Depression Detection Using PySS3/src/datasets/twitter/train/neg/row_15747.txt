Ill probably do it eventuallyI know that Iâ€™m weak, that my situation isnâ€™t all that bad. But i am constantly thinking about ending it, why i should do it, how much easier it would be. It wouldnâ€™t be difficult to, it would be easy. I live on the 14th floor i could just jump in the middle of the night while everyone is asleep. I have no one to talk to about how Iâ€™m feeling but theres still apart of me that doesnâ€™t want to do it, i donâ€™t want to hurt my mom. Shes my only reason not to do it. But Iâ€™m worried i will, even if its not today it will happen. I dont really know my reason in posting this, i dont want to be told to talk to someone, or told not to do it.
