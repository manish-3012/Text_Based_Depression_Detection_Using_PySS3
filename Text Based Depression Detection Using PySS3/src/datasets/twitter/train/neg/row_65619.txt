Recently sexually assaulted and too alone for my own good.Recently I was sexually assaulted by what used to be a very good friend of mine. I invited her into my room not knowing her intentions and she threatened me with violance and defamation if I did not allow her. University has been a horrible experience thus far and despite having sought help, have recieved little to none. I have no friends that are willing to sit down with me and let me cry on their shoulder and am just too torn apart to go one night without crying. I'm afraid to tell the world because it's far too embarrassing and I just really need to let out what's happening. I have a history of mood instability and get very depressed easily (mild bipolar). Im afraid it's going to become too much for me too quickly and I'll take my life without realizing what I'm doing.
