CryingEvery day, all the time. As usual. The norm.

Right now Iâ€™m crying because I was tired after my shift and wanted to take a power nap so I could stay up. Wanted to be up by 11:00 so I could get some stuff done and celebrate midnight with my sisters (who I live with). Ended up passing out until 2:00 in the morning and I guess they tried to wake me but I donâ€™t even remember it. Not that I want to blame them, but as usual, no one to blame but myfuckingself.

So now Iâ€™m crying in the bathroom while they sleep. Itâ€™s so dumb too; I needed sleep and got some and itâ€™s simply not a big deal in the grand scheme of this hellscape... but Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself for over five years now and every goddamn thing feels like the biggest deal. I lost hours of my precious free time! Time Iâ€™ll never get back and that I wanted to utilize! And now Iâ€™m wide awake at 2:30am, nothing done, midnight gone, and sobbing in the bathroom because itâ€™s the only place I might not disturb someone. Of course my lazy, exhausted, sad, and stupidddd ass kept sleeping and ruined my night. 

I have no idea how Iâ€™m still alive. I guess itâ€™s just the fear of any attempt not working. Right? It must be. Even without the real life horrors that make up this miserable society weâ€™re trapped in, the self-loathing levels are so off the charts I wish I could rip my own head off. Iâ€™m so tired.

Just venting. It really helps me to post here when I donâ€™t know where else to go. Sending you all love; Iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™re stuck here too.
