Death and pain shouldn't exist.Pain, suffering and death should not exist. It's disgusting that it exists in our world. The fact that I can imagine a utopia with no suffering, death and endless creativity, joy and peace makes me wonder why this world exists in the First place. There has to be some justification for all of this suffering? Otherwise the only hope is technology eliminating disease and stopping aging and Ending suffering.
