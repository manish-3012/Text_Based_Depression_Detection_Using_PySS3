I was raped in June and I am going to Jill myselfI was raped in June. Iâ€™m not ok. I have been in therapy but itâ€™s not helping. I want to die. I canâ€™t seem to find a way to do it. Iâ€™m thinking of hanging myself. My ideal way is to OD on heroin. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair for me to live in pain everyday.  Some people cannot handle the pain of life and thatâ€™s ok.
