I just feel there is no reason anymore... I feel like I am  stuck in a dark room with no way out. I see nothing in the future for me, at all. I cannot even handle the little piece of reality that my teenage life deals to me.  I have been through therapy, on medication, but nothing is helping. I just want to curling into a ball and fall asleep, never waking up again.  My friends don't understand how bad my depression is getting, and they have no idea how to deal with it.  I can't go to my parents.  I feel too bad for all I put them through already in the past year.  They did not ask for a child like me, full of problems and mental issues.  My brother is the perfect child, why can't I be like that?  No one wants me. I'm useless.  So why should I take up space on this Earth, while others are dying and want to live? I don't deserve life, so I'm giving back this gift.
