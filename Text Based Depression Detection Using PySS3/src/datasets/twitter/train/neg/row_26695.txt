How could therapy even help?I've tried to talk to people, but they just try to pawn me off to therapy.

But how will that help?

These are the facts:

1. Everything is pointless
2. I'm normal; I don't have any extraordinary gifts that entitle me to live and flesh them out.

3. I don't want to help others; no soup kitchens or a life of seeking out the needy.

4. I can't just "enjoy it" How absurd!



Given those facts, how is therapy supposed to make me less suicidal? This isn't some temporary chemical imbalance or a state of panic invoked by a series of unfortunate events.

I'm currently being guilt tripped into not committing suicide via a non-consensual suicide pact, but I'm so numb/disconnected to everything by now that it's starting to just "So what?" and lose all of its power.
