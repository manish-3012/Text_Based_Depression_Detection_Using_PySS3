I had a dream that I was young again.Last night I had an odd dream. I was my youngest self, though with my retained memories and experiences. I was in elementary school and was hanging out with my old friend group that I had back then. We were all best friends until High School came around, since then we've never spoken aside from small bits here and there. I miss really miss that. The innocence and naivety of my prior situations are something I wish I could attain. To be able to go back in time with the knowledge and hindsight I have now would be a dream come true. However, dreams seldomly come true if at all in this world. I don't know. It just got me thinking back to my younger years of when I had absolutely nothing to worry about. When I had many friends and was liked. Now I'm a recent High School graduate (class of 2020, yaaaayyy...) with no direction, no motivation, hardly any friends, no girlfriend, and the list goes on. Things seem very bleak and hopeless for me. I wish I could go back to those simpler days.
