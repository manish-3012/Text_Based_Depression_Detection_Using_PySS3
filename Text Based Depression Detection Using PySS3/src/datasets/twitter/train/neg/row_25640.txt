my life is a joke. need to talk to someone.bullied and regularly stuffed up school. parents aggressively screamed for me to drop out and go do art at community college - but only let me stay after teachers saaid it was a bad move. they didn't care about my opinions; just how they looked to other people. it was disappointing

ended with no qualification. got pushed into art course at community college,  iwas told all my life community college is for losers so i was just full of rage for 6 months and failed.

did university preparation, finished it fine.

didn't know what to do. wanted to work. but parents pushed me into art again. i dropped out of it after the first year.

finally, at 21, i was finally doing a course i wanted to do. computer science. passed all the courses for first year, got 2 awards at the same time. organised a $5,500 conference with my country's former prime minister. it was a great comeback. second year, i'm struggling to keep up.

it is upsetting me now at 22 to see all my peers from my school and university hall graduating and getting into jobs and lives, and i'm here struggling surrounded in kids.

i hate how connected we are now online and everyone can see what everyone is doing. i got on linkedin, saw people i lived in a hall with while doing university preparation and i feel pathetic

most people finish school fine, do 3 year degree and get on with life. instead for me, i fuck up the whole process. 

i almost got there now im fucking up again and at 22 i just feel like a colossal manchild now and kinda just wanna kill myself
