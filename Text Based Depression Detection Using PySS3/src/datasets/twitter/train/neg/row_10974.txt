Im at the end of my rope and im only 18.Ill make this quick because it really isn't that complex. I have a chronic illness called POTS syndrome and CFS causing me to feel tired, groggy, and like i have a fever and cant focus almost 24/7. Ive seen over 10 doctors and they all concluded I will "just have to live with it the best I can" but what kind of life is this. Im not depressed at all and i've never once contemplated suicide untill i my doctor told me theres nothing he can do for me and i would feel like this indefinitely. I can't fathom functioning like this, the only time my symptoms arent bad is when im on my computer playing games or doing something to take my mind of things but theres no future or money in that. Im ready to kill myself even though the last thing i want to do is die all because western medicine has failed me.
