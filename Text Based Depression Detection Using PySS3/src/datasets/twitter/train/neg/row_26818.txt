Iâ€™m already dead.My life might as well be over. Iâ€™ve done nothing with my life. Other people my age have had multiple relationships, marriages, divorces, kids, vacations, traveled the world and experienced so much. Iâ€™m not saying I want to do all those things but Iâ€™d like to have the chance to do something. 

My life feels like itâ€™s already over, I have no desire to do anything alone, I hardly experience happiness and if I do, itâ€™s always a temporary distraction from my own life. I never get to live in the moment and enjoy my life because thereâ€™s nothing good to celebrate. Iâ€™m just so tired of being the anomaly in life, everyone else has *something.*
