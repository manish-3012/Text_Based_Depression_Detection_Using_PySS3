I am crying so hard right now, this is so painful, I don't know if this is normal.I have considered my life as hell, repetition is so painful, I am so weak. I think I want a way out. I want to cry for my mother, which does not love me anymore, I think I want out. I think I want out, you are thinking I am mentally ill, I am completely sane. I have only ever been diagnosed with depression. 
I don't know what to do, holy Jesus, son of god plesse help me. 

I am down to the fate of others. I am defenceless, if they are ignorant, I will cry and maybe die too.

What is the right way to feel at this moment? I'm so lost guys, please, I need to talk to someone. If they are nice, my day is made. I can only form relationships if others feel pity upon me, or if we went through pain (physical). I am nor charismatic nor attractive to a wide extent. My saving grace is my big shoulders and wide back, my blue eyes and dark blonde hair, and thick neck. That is it. There is nothing more. This a disaster. God help me.
