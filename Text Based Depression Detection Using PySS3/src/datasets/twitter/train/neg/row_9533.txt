I have a 94% overall average in school but Iâ€™ll probably kill myself once Iâ€™m done school thoIdek why Iâ€™m choosing to do my work in school, I guess just to graduate from high school finally. But I donâ€™t have any plans for the future, nothing interests me and it has been like that for 2.5 years since my diagnoses of clinical depression. I should be enjoying my life at 18, almost 19, but rather I focus on wanting to die almost everyday. I literally have the highest mark in one of my classes and Iâ€™m above average in marks in my other classes but little do the teachers and students know that Iâ€™m wanting to die every moment, and being numb to life.
