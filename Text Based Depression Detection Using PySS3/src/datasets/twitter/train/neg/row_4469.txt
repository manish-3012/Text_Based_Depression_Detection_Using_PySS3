Chronic illness is way too much for me to handle. Need advice on humane way to go, please.Repost per redGPz's advice. Thank you, friend.

I've had a chronic illness for the last 8 years - symptoms include extreme unrelenting fatigue, terribly distressing digestive issues, muscle pain, constant headache, confusion, blurry vision, sensitivity to strong smells and feeling as if I'm 'daydreaming' constantly.

Depression and anxiety disorders have been ruled out multiple times by multiple doctors. So have common digestive disorders such as Crohn's, Ulcerative Colitis, Diverticulitis, Celiac's and others. Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, MS and other autoimmune disorders tested negative. The only vitamin/mineral I was deficient in was D, but I've taken nearly 250,000 IU's (yes, you've read that correctly) in the last year without help.

The only diagnosis I've received is Chronic Fatigue, teetering on Fibromyalgia.

Several doctors have taken me off any form of pharmaceuticals, including aspirin due to severe reactions to medication. I've tried a HELL of a lot of alternative/holistic treatment which helps very temporarily but doesn't last.

I owe thousands of dollars trying to support myself through this illness (can't work much because I was too sick) and I'm too tired to keep trying to pay it off - it's been there for years and hasn't moved. It's only $4,000, but after years of trying to pay it off only for it to 'stay' feels insurmountable.

Please, somebody tell me an encouraging story about your chronic illness or direct me to a humane way of ending this. I don't want to do this any more.

Edit: Obviously a throw-away account.

Edit 2: Thanks everyone for your responses, I'm sorry I was MIA for a few days - massive blizzards where I'm at and I was having difficulty getting onto Reddit. I appreciate everyone's responses, kind words and encouragement! Thank you!
