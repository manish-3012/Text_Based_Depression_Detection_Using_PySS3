I'm deep in credit card debt, can't get a job, don't have a family, I have been digging this hole for a long time. I live in a small town, I dont want to be news. I just want to die peacefully, that' all.  I wish I got a job so I wouldnt have to do it, but its been months now... I just needded to get this off my chest. Thank you
