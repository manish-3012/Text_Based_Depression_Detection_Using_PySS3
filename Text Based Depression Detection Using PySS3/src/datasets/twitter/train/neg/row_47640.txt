convince me to take medstldr: im afraid they'll make me delusional/religious and im afraid i cant be happy but they'll just keep me perpetually just ok enough to not kill myself 

i feel like a perpetual failure with no chance at happiness. speaking with professionals only makes me want meds less, not that i ever really wanted to. the more i try to get better the worse i feel. i feel mentally ill people are just bad people who deserve ro suffer, then again it seems so is everyone (not that we should do bad things to people, just saying justice is stupid because were all evil). whenever i try look into psychology in some futile happiness grab i end up finding something that ruins my mood for days. like reading about treatment i read something like  "delusions in patients are fine if they conform to society". it made my fucking skin crawl. i cant trust the positive things they say, though i dont reasons for them to lie about the negative. i have yet to hear a satisfactory answer on how i could be happy, jut dodges or things like no one is happy.
