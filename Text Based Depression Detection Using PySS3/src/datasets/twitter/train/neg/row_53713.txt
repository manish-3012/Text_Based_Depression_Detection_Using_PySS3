â€œDarkness is such that I really do not see â€“ neither with my mind nor with my reason. â€“ The place of God in my soul is blank. â€“ There is no God in me. â€“ When the pain of longing is so great â€“ I just long &amp; long for God â€“ and then it is that I feel â€“ He does not want me â€“ He is not thereâ€¦â€â€” Mother Theresa
