I'm probably gonna kill myselfI'm 16 male, I tried to kill myself last year, I failed.
Last year I saw counselling, I tried to repair relations with my parents, to me it waste of my time, to me my parents don't fucking care about me at all.

For the past few days, I've been severely depressed, I haven't ate properly, I slept 22 hours yesterday, I've lost all drive to continue.

My mother came in and confronted me, I talked about how she failed me. For the past year, I've tried time and time again to trust, she's failed me every time. She came in, she mocked me, she made fun of me, essentially called my a pussy, how I should just end it, how I was "weak and dumb", how I am a waste of space. 

Now I'm just sitting here, I can't trust myself, I can't trust my family, I can't trust the world who has forsaken me, I can't trust councilors, I can't my anything anymore.

I don't have a drive to continue and I'm seriously thinking of ending it.

Update: Literally no one to help, No one to call, Youthline and lifeline are too fucking busy, just sitting here staring at my knife and bottle of pills.....
