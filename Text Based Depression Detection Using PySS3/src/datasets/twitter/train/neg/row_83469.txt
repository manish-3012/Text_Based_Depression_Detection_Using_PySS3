very depressing feelingsIâ€™ve been very miserable and keeping myself in solitude most of the time for about the past 2 years. I have been thinking about suicide for many reasons like what if I donâ€™t have any meaning, what if I just never find someone to love, and why do we try so hard to survive when we all die in the end. I just do not understand why people are scared to die, and at this point iâ€™m ready to end it.
