I have a bunch of pills and I'm back to seriously considering ending itI'm so over it. I can't get a job, I am in constant pain, it feels like my husband hates me, my kids would be better off without such a complete fuck up as a mom.... I just can't think of a really good reason not to do it. The only thing I can think of is that my cat would be lonely if I was gone. I'm the only one she trusts. But really a cat isn't a good reason to continue wasting space on earth.
