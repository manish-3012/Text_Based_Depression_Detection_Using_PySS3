Iâ€™m 14 and my whole family is depressed so my problems get undermined.When I was 9 my father made us all move to California, from Canada. Ha almost immediately divorced my mom. She was a wreck, saying sheâ€™s a horrible person and doesnâ€™t know what to do. She had no friends or family or anyway to get a job in California. I got used to comforting her really quickly. I was the only one out of my 2 sibling to want to comfort her. For context my brother is 2 years over than me and my sister is  4 years older than me. After 4 years we moved back, my dad stayed in California. None of us had friends. My brother got super depressed, taking it out on my mom. My mom would then try to hide crying from me but Iâ€™d find out and have to comfort her. My sister used to be sad but honestly sheâ€™s the only one thatâ€™s doing fine and is oblivious to any of our problems. My dad I rarely keep in contact with but he always complains about being lonely and sad. Now to me. Ever sense I was 11 Iâ€™ve been suicidal off and on. Iâ€™ve held a knife to my wrist but nothing more than that. I really want to die though Iâ€™m just a coward. Iâ€™ve let out really obvious singes but I guess nothing less than screaming it in there face would work. Iâ€™ve seen a physiatrist whom though I was stupid, I honestly think he was depressed too as he said his friend died and he got gradually more messy and mean. I guess this had all been a cry for attention cuz I donâ€™t get any. Just tell me I matter
