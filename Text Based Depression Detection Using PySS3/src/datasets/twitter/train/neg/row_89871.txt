Please give me a fucking reason why, because I don't have any..I'm 24 a college graduate, I run 20 miles a week and bench press 275.  Yep you guessed it I'm a guy.  I want to be an actor I've been in a couple independent films but nothing has gone anywhere.  Finding an agent is the hardest shit in the world because I have yet to succeed.  I've written a novel a fantasy novel which is my best work ever and its been rejected by Daws books twice.  My dad says to stop writing and focus on something else.  I'm an artist and I make video edits, Im the guy who made that modern recut on Aladdin in November.  Everything I've made after is total fucking shit.  I've had 11 jobs since I graduated college in 2013, I'm working a temp job now where I package mail.  I live in a state away from my friends, my family doesn't give a shit about me and just fucking lectures me of about fucking everything.  Ive been alone since 2013 because a stupid girl broke my heart, I've tried everything I'm still alone and with no friends and its killing me.  I'm the son of an alcoholic, so I can't stop thinking of taking a train ride this weekend to NYC and drinking my head off because what other good am I to society.  I'm a fucking useless person whom no one wants to give a fucking chance!!! I fucking hate everything!
