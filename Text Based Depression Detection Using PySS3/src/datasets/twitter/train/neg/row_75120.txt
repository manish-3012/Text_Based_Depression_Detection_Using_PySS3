Daily suicidal thoughtsEvery day, when some minor inconvenience or something happens, I'll think about suicide.  Like if I spill a little of my drink, or stub my toe, I'll immediately think or say 'I should hurry up and shoot myself'.  It's just one of the minor things, but I still find myself thinking of suicide every time something small and insignificant happens.

I also drop little hints to my family about my suicidal thoughts.  Sometimes I'll post a depression meme or some stupid shit like that on facebook, every now and then one that mentions suicide.  And yet still nobody asks if I'm actually okay.

I'll pad my jokes with 'holy shit just kill me', or 'end my life'.  Still nothing.  Do I have to outright say 'HEY I'M THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE ALL THE TIME'?  Because the last time I did that I got locked up in a children's psychiatric hospital (Pinnacle Point aka Hell on Earth).  I can't fucking trust anyone.
