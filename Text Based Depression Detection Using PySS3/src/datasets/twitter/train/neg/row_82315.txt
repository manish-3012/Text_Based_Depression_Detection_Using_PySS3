I canâ€™t handle it, I really canâ€™t.Iâ€™m so broken, I canâ€™t do it, I just canâ€™t. Iâ€™m isolated, broke and batshit crazy. I ruin everything, and people constantly invalidate my feelings. I literally have no one besides my family, and theyâ€™re not able to help me/donâ€™t care. I canâ€™t make people care about me. 
Please send any good vibes or prayers up for me. Last year around this time I promised myself I was going to commit suicide by my birthday. Itâ€™s coming up. I want to hold on, but my emotions are maxed out and I just canâ€™t cope anymore.
