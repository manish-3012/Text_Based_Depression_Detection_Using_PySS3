TiredI have a successful career, I have friends, I have no sex life issues etc.

None of this seems meaningful, everything feels bad, every set back feels more immense knowing that the outcome is going to be death anyways.  I have people that depend on me, but due to circumstances the only thing I provide is a paycheck.  I just don't really see the point of continuing to survive when everything feels so bad on a bleak "chance" that things get better, knowing that the inevitable outcome is going to be the exact same anyways.  I haven't been happy for years, I doubt anything miraculous will change that in the future.
