How did i end up here?I shared something on the unsentletters Reddit a day ago and i think it's really messed me up. Then I shared something on a medical Reddit earlier, and that's messed me up even more. 

I have a devoted wife and wonderful son and all I feel is cold, empty and alone.

I feel like I want to rip my skin off to wash myself. Everyone else is asleep, I've drank what little booze was in the house, and now I'm restless, like I should be doing something.

I'm sure people will think I'm being selfish.
