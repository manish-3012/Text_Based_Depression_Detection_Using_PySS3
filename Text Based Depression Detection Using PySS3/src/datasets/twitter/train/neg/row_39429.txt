I don't see it getting betterUp front: I'm trans, MtF. 6'2", 44" chest. Big. 

My body makes me feel physically nauseous and I get anxiety around women thinking about differences between us. 

I'm 6 months on HRT but changes are slow, it feels like nothing's happening any more, like I've stalled or something. 

My main issues, though, are my size/voice/genitalia. 

My size I can't ever change. Ever. I can't change the shape of my body. I'm stuck being massive and wide and being those things makes me feel awful enough without the knowledge this is PERMANENT, this is just my body. 

Same issues with my height. I tower over almost everyone I know, and it makes me feel terrible.

My voice isn't as terrible as it could be, but I still don't like it. When I try to do voice training it always results in me crying because it's difficult to do and my voice always ends up cracking or something.

My bottom dysphoria's been bugging me recently as well, and I have the worst size distribution to tuck with. My t*stes are too big to keep in my inguinal canal and my p*nis is too small to deal with appropriately.

I'm at a point where I don't see a point in carrying on. I just want to throw myself off a bridge and end my suffering. I know some cis women are tall and big but that doesn't help with my constant comparisons to 5'6" cis women I'm constantly around at work.

Any help is appreciated. I just don't want to feel like this any more.
