Planning on making my third suicide attemptSo this is going to be a grammatical mess and I dont know how much sense it will make but I want to say somthing I guess to anyone who will hear.

So im certain im transgender and have suppressed these gender issues up until now (19).  after my previous suicide attempt (paracetamol overdose) I decided I couldn't carry on the way I had been and decided I had to talk to my doctor about transition, I've made an appointment but the more I think about it the more I feel I won't be able to live afterwards because of a multitude of factors; im poor af so won't be able to afford any kind of treatment, im not attractive and doubt anyone would ever find me as such, the general hatred towards trans people.

Frankly it feels unfair I don't feel like I can go on before and I cant go on after, seems like a cruel joke. I would really rather not die but I cant see a way around it at this point I simply can't go on anymore id rather die than carry on suffering.

This is an extremely concise account of how I feel and I can expand on it if anyone wants to know anything, but right now im planning on another suicide attempt
Im a bit of a coward so I dont want to hang or cut myself so plan this time is to gather enough money for a drug overdose although id rather not be found like that but fuck it ill be dead right.
