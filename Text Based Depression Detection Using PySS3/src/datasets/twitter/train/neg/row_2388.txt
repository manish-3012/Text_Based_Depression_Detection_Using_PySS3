i dont know what i am doing anymoreI dont know what im doing with my life anymore. I am losing the ability to focus on anything or work on anything, my grades are droping, i'm being teased taunted and bullied every day. and no-one cares, i have two friends one of which i am drifting farther and farther away from and im scared im gonna lone one of the only friends i have ever had. i am constantly worrying about my school work or how i'm gonna try to avoid the people who are bullying/harassing me, its gotten to the point where its almost hard to remember a time when i was happy and not just pretending to be happy so people dont get worried about me. there has been so much shit thrown at me that i dont know how much longer i can keep pretending to be happy and im scared that when somebody places the straw that breaks the camels back i wont be able to take it and the kid who is allwase bullying me is going to go home in a cast and ill end up killing myself.the only reason this has not happened already is that i dont want to hurt the two last friends i have but i fear it will get to a point that that wont matter. 
if you were/are in a similar situation pleas leave some advice on how to get through this, thanks.

thanks for reading, sorry for my grammar and spelling i'm a slightly dyslexic and dysgrafic 8th grader who cant spell for shit.
