Running AwayI'm going to run away after I save up some money, and make my way across the country. Maybe stop somewhere up North. The voices have gotten too loud and it'll just be better this way because I'm losing my fucking sanity and I don't want my family to see that. Maybe kill myself somewhere beautiful, maybe up on a mountain watching the sunset. Maybe I'll find help out there on the road. Either way I'm going out on my own so this will probably be my last post here. I just have to run I can't sit still with these voices in my head telling me to do these terrible things. If anyone I know reads this, don't come looking for me, you won't find me. I'm sorry, it's better this way. I always knew I'd end up alone at the bitter end, and this is it.
