If we die anyways, what's so bad about dying early?Just wondered what people's thoughts were on this. If we were immortal, then it would seem sad that someone gave up that gift, but life ends regardless of if we want it to or not, so why does it matter so much if someone chooses their own time? 

And if the reason is "there's so much to enjoy still", then doesn't that just make a later death worse? Higher you climb, the harder you fall?
