I got in legal troubleI recently got in some very major legal trouble that could potentially put me away for a couple decades. I live in a basement and no one checks on me. I have been struggling with alcoholism for over 20 years. I have no job. My daughters mother successfully filed a restraining order against me so I can't even contact my 8 year old daughter for at least a year. Having no job and no medication (bipolar disorder), I turned to stealing mouthwash from local stores and drinking it in order to just pass out. I feel so utterly hopeless. I always kinda knew it would end this way. I feel so close to death.
