Need someone to help me stay rational tonightSo yeah I don't know who else to go to with this. I'm alone in a foreign country staying with family friends and I feel desperate and trapped. 

I'm a student in the middle of a competitive application process for residency programs, I just sat my final board exams last week (pretty sure I tanked it) and I'm trying to make a long distance relationship work. I'm so so tired and hopeless and just want it all to stop. Everyday I pretend its all fine and that I don't mind having no friends or being the bottom of my boyfriend's list of priorities (he's doing the same application process). 

I've completely isolated myself over that last few years through having to focus on school, withdrawing from everyone when my depression was at its worst and giving time to my boyfriend. 

 I just don't have the coping mechanisms right now to cope with anything going wrong anymore and I just want to end things now. The only thing stopping me acting on these feelings is that my dog would miss me. I've been in this position before and attempted suicide and have realised it maybe wasn't the best route after being found. However, right now my brain is too clouded and I can't see how anything will be okay or that there'll be a time I won't have this constant deadweight of depression hanging over me. I just need someone to help me stay rational or something..I don't even know.
