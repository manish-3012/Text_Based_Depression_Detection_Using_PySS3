I don't care anymore. I don't.I am already wanting to f**king end it all, at such a young age. Being a typically comedic and funny 14 year old makes people think that I'm faking it. Not even my parents understand how I feel. Everything In this dull existence is loud and scary and I can't handle it. I know I am overreacting, but I don't f**king care anymore. This is the last goddamn straw. I am ready to an end to my useless f**king life. I can't handle it. It feels like nobody would even notice if I was gone at this point....
