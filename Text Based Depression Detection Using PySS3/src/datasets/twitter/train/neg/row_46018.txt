3 years after my last postMany of you have helped me overcome my last rock bottom 3 years ago and I would like to share an update:

I am still alive, still constantly thinking about ending my life. Sometimes i manage to distract myself but never for a long time.

Today, I ordered helium tanks. I feel like I have really tried for 22 years to find happiness, find a way to accept my scars and find a way to fill this endless hole inside of me, but I just cant, everyone tells me give it another year, but I am so tired of trying - I just want peace. 

So in a few days helium tanks will arrive and I will finally end this sadness of a life. For those that remember me, I just want you to know I really tried to overcome this for 3 years extra and thank you for investing your energy in time trying to save me.
