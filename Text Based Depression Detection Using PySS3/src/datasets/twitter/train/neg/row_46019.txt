I hate the feeling of my pulse.When I'm laying in bed, and accidentally touch a part of my body that has a pulse, I get intensely sad and immediately pull away from that area. I cant stand the feeling of my own pulse, because it let's me know in still stuck here on this world. Anybody else feel this way about their pulse?
