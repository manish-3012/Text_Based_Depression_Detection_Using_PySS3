I don't know what to do.The love of my fucking life refuses to understand me. She means the world to me and I've put everything on hold for her. I've thrown things in the past out if anger and we've discussed it, and resolved it. Now it's time for us to move back in together and she's bringing it all up again. I've lost friends, brothers, jobs, and opportunities following her career choice. Now it's over. 

Please consider this my cry for help. I've dedicated my 20s to her. I've lost so much life following her. She's done equally bad stuff if not worse to me. I don't hold it against her. I know things happen out of frustration. I just want to die. I don't like my life anymore. It's not her fault. 

I feel like a fucking teenager. But I honestly don't want to live my life without her. She's the only thing I like let alone love. If there's a chance ill be with her in whatever afterlife awaits. I think I'm willing to take that chance
