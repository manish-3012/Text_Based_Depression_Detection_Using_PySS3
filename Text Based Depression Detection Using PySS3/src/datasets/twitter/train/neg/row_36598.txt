I've ruined my lifeA while ago i took options in my sixth form because they went well together, its too late to change them and I've realized that I'll never be happy and always stressed out, I'm responsible for the life of a depressed friend and all I want to do is hang myself, I'm lonely, hopeless and worthless, I want to kill myself so fucking badly yet even then I need to consider others before myself.
