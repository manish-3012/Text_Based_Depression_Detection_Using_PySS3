I fucked my life upI was abused/neglected growing up by my mentally ill single mother. I am smart, but as you'll see I have made stupid decisions in my life. After being taken away by CPS when I was 16 I went from badly depressed to suicidal. I had mental health intervention but was put on medication that seemed to make things worse. I started self harming. I thought about death all the time. One day I got in an argument with my sister and I made the worst decision of my life: I, a 17 year old boy at the time, instigated a physical fight with her. My mom was there and called the police. I later received a conviction for domestic assault. 

I have since become much healthier mentally and my relationship with my sister is very strong. If you were to ask my family they would describe me as a soft-spoken, kind, introverted person. At least that's what they tell me. 

However, my dream is a job in healthcare. It's nearly, if not outright impossible for someone with my background to enter that field. I guess there is a slim chance. But honestly I think it is a foregone conclusion. 

I've been contemplating the ways my life could go and I see two options: either I beat the astronomical odds and somehow jump every hurdle designed to keep people like me from taking care of other people, or someone along the way (rightfully) doubts my character.

I don't know what I will do if I am barred from my dreams.
