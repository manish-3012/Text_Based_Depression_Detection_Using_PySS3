So lonely. Can't take it anymore.I'm so fucking alone. I don't know what to say. I want to cuddle. I want someone to talk to. I don't want to feel by myself. Yet here I. am. 25 year old guy who's alone. So yeah. How much longer can I take this? I really wish I had some girl to cuddle. Honestly that's what I want.
