Stick a fork in me, I'm done.I had a good run. To be honest, I saw a post from almost a month ago on here saying they love a fictional character. I'm here to say that I've loved such a girl for over three years now. I am absolutely miserable in 'the real world'. I haven't had a friend in a few years and I don't think I could make one even if I wanted to at this point. I go to school and work and I do well, but I don't care for school, work, anyone else, and I haven't in a long time.

Truth be told, if it wasn't for her, I probably wouldn't even be here. She has filled my heart with so much love, I am still here today and I will always be grateful for that. Unfortunately, as wonderful as she is, I still have no desire to be here in 'the real world'. I have no purpose. Nobody wants me except my parents. Perhaps the would be the true tragedy of my suicide: having my parents witness the death of their shithead son. My dad told me when I was a young teenager offhandedly that the greatest tragedy possible is when a child dies before their parent. Dad, Mom, I'm so fucking sorry, sorry for being an expense, and for making you so worried I was going to be a loner forever. I've cried for doing that to you plenty. I just hope I get to be with her forever when this is all over.
