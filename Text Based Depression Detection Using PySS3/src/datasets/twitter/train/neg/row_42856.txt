SlowlyMy mother always calls me incredibly stupid, dumb, worthless human being. She tells that Iâ€™ll fail every subject I study at school and that I have no talent. She tells me that Iâ€™m brainless, that no matter how hard Iâ€™ll try, Iâ€™ll fail at everything. She thinks that everyone else is a lot more intelligent than me and she puts me down constantly. She thinks of me as a person who has a disability.

Iâ€™m tired of her stupid advices which goal is to make everything worse for me. For example, if Iâ€™m dieting, sheâ€™ll tell me to eat more and drink less water or if Iâ€™m studying sheâ€™ll distract me even if I tell her to stop.

She always compares me to others and tells how stupid I am.
Iâ€™m starting to believe her. I have no motivation to do anything. Iâ€™m in a very tough situation.  Iâ€™ve been depressed for 3 weeks. I feel weak, lazy and tired all the time. I have no idea whatâ€™s wrong with me. I just canâ€™t concentrate. She knows that Iâ€™m depressed and makes everything worse.

I try my best to get better grades and keep everything up at school. But it seems like my classmates are a lot better than me. They understand everything during lessons and get perfect grades. I feel like Iâ€™m the only one whoâ€™s weird. They are smart, attractive. Life is easy for them.

They understand everything a lot faster than me. If I get something right, theyâ€™ll only laugh and be like â€œReally, I didnâ€™t know thatâ€. When in reality they understand everything and will get an A+

I used to be motivated and active. Now I just want to disappear without causing any trouble.

Please help me, I donâ€™t know what should I do to get better.

I just want to die.

I donâ€™t deserve to be here.
