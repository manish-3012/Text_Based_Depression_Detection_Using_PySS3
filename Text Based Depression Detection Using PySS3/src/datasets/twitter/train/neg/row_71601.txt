erm, hi.Iâ€™m contemplating my suicide. I donâ€™t really like pain.. but I can take a good amount. Iâ€™m thinking about going to a beautiful lake.. or something like that.. to drown. seems poetic being the fact I love water, I love to swim.. and being submerged in water seems like a really beautiful way to fade away. contemplated it for a long while... I donâ€™t really care about leaving people behind and all that mess. most people donâ€™t even know what theyâ€™re stuck in and are delusional assholes. Iâ€™m ready to go though. I was gonna wait until every dime from my bank account has been expended before I did so.
