I want to make my loved ones sadI'm not actually serious about committing suicide, but I've had thoughts... and I find that whenever I think about it, besides thinking about the idea that I can finally end my undiagnosed chronic pain, I usually think about how my friends and family would react. 
And I want them to be sad. 
I want them to think that it's all their fault and that if they did something different, like believed me and been supportive of me getting tests done and going to doctors then I wouldn't have done it. 
Has anyone else wanted this to happen? It seems like normally the idea of making your loved ones suffer deters people from suicide, but it's kind of appealing to me and I feel kinda mean....
I know they all care about me a lot, but it feels like just telling them that I need help, medically and emotionally, is never really enough. Whenever I try to get my parents to take me to the doctor they're obviously concerned but they also brush it off, say it's all in my head, and that I'm stressed and just need to take a break. Sometimes it feels like dying is the only way I can really show them how much pain I'm in and how serious this problem is to me.
