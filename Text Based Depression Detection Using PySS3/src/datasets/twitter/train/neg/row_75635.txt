A lost soul in the world of life...I don't know how to start this so I guess I will just go for it. I am just done with life. I have failed out of college two years ago and I can't even get through a semester of community college without failing a class or withdrawing. The only friends I have are from high school and I only ever see them when they are back from break. I have documented ADD/ADHD Depression and Anxiety and I don't feel like I have any sort of handle on any of them after trying counseling for the past 3 years and a slew of medications. The best year of my life was my senior year of high school and since then I've done nothing but fail. I don't know what to do I'm stuck at a job I don't want to be at and I just feel like a burden to my family. I feel done with life and I'm only 20. And to top it all off the one SO that I cared about in my life left me. Heartbroken, lost, depression, Anxiety, and a running string of failures I don't know what to do. Thanks for reading this I just felt like I needed to get something out there
