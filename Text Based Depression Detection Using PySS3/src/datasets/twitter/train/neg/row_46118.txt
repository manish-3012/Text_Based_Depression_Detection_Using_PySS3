Has anyone found an online/remote therapy option helpful?Iâ€™m struggling, but I also have a deep set fear/anxiety of being judged, or talking to someone about my ongoing suicide ideation. Any suggestions are welcome. I do not have anyone in my family or social circle I feel comfortable taking to/reaching out to. F/30s/Veteran
