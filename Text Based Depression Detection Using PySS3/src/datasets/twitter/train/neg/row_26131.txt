Does anyone else â€œtestâ€ people by talking about trivial problems to see if you can trust them with the major problems?Like for example, you go up to your friend and youâ€™re like â€œmy bf just cheated on me and Iâ€™m upsetâ€ and your friend responds with something like â€œoh yeah I know how you feel, except my experience was wayyy worseâ€ 

So you deduce that you shouldnâ€™t talk to that friend about your sucky job and how it makes you feel about life because they might â€œ1-up your painâ€ (if u know what I mean) and it feels invalidating.

I do this all the time and it makes me feel like I have no one to confide to about my actual feelings about stuff. Maybe itâ€™s a trust issue thing? I feel like everyone Iâ€™ve â€œtestedâ€ about trivial matters have invalidated me in some way about those trivial matters. So Iâ€™m like can I trust them with the more serious matters?
