Out of optionsI've tried everything that I can. I've gone to individual therapy, group therapy, a partial hospitalization program, taken meds, exercised, got a pet. Nothing brings me up for more than a week. Then I'm back to my depressed self again. But it's worse now because I have evidence that nothing I try works. 

Why am I responsible for others' happiness? Why should I suffer so they don't have to? I'm ready to go now. What do I do?
