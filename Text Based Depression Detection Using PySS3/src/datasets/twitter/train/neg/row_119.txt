i dont want to live anymoreI'm having a hard time because of my mother. I try to make my own things and she gets mad at me if she doesn't like it. I don't do things that are generally bad like skipping classes or failing my classes. I study a lot and get high grades but when I do one small thing she doesn't like she shouts at me and she takes away things of mine.

I usually walk home in my area to save money and she got mad at me for it. I really wanted to save up to go to a workshop because I dont want her to take overtime or work a part time job to get me that thing I can honestly save up for. When she knew about it she got mad at me and will take away half of my allowance that I need for other things. 

It honestly feels horrible at this point because it keeps happening over and over. She doesn't care about what I say about it at all. She just gets mad at me. I can't go to my other relatives because they'll send me back. I can't run away because running away in my country isn't really a good idea. I really cant take it anymore. I really just cant.
