I don't know what to do in life, and I just want to end it.Hi. Title really says it all. I'm starting my sophomore year in high school and I used to have a clue as to what I want to be in life, but I'm starting now to realize that it is impossible for me. My step father pushes me to be the best version of my self but I just don't want to continue. I get good grades in school and I excel in sports, but every single time it's never enough for him. I'm afraid of going downstairs for the reason of being yelled at every single time. 

He'll always figure something out to just lash out at me, and I can't take it anymore. I really want to leave and just not have to deal with him. Everything I do is always below his expectations for me and I always get yelled at because of it. I do everything by the book and how he wants me to do it but he finds a way to insult me and say that it's pathetic. When I try to explain that I feel bad that day or sick, he shrugs it off and says that it's pointless and that since I am a child I should not feel tired or bored. 

I know this sounds pathetic because this issue is not as serious as everyone else's, but I have had these thoughts for a couple of years now, because of him. I've researched how to buy cyanide pills, and all I have to do is earn some money to buy them. It's pathetic though, I am on a foundation for success yet I don't feel any of it. I'm constantly reminded that when I feel satisfied, that it's worthless and amounts to nothing, and that I have to do even more. I just get so so tired of doing more all the time. I'm expending myself, I get pains in my legs because of all the extracurricular activities I have to do in order for my step father to feel proud of me. Everything I do is just unacceptable to him.
