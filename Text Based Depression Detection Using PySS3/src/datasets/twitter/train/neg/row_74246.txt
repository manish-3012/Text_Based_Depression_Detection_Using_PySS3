The light has left my life.My girlfriend broke up with me today - I was shocked, it came out of the blue. Things were so good. She said she loved me and cared about me and was proud of me but couldn't be in a relationship. 

She's been the only reason I've not killed myself over the last 2 years.

I have a plan, I know what I'm doing, I wrote her a letter. It's just all about counting down the days. I just wish I could make the time go faster.

I would die 1000 times just to wake up next to her one more time. At least I'm only going to have to die once.
