Disgrace to My FamilyI'm 21 years old. I live in a town on the opposite side of the state from my family, and they're providing me with the funds to complete my education at the university near here. I've been here almost a year now and I've done nothing but waste my life away. I get piss poor grades, have dropped two or three classes, failed a class, am about to fail the same class again and two others (which will officially put the knife in my federal aid, and my education), pissed away tons of money on textbook answers because I can't bring myself to do anything to help myself. I'm a failure. I'm watching my life fall down around me in flames and I can't muster the will power to do anything about it. What's wrong with me? Why am I such a failure? Why can't I just do what's best for me? Instead I sit around and do nothing all day, get stoned to avoid my problems, and cause pain to those who love me. What am I even good for? What's the point in my existence? I act like I'm some kind human being who wants to help others but do I really care about anyone other than myself? I'm a manipulative, lying good for nothing who is going nowhere fast. I'm a disgusting, ugly loser who can't even help their self. I'm a waste of existence. I'm a disgrace to my family, to myself, and to life itself... what's the point anymore? What's the point in living when there's nothing to live for? I don't deserve what I've been given. I've wasted what life I could have had. I don't deserve a second chance, I deserve to die like the waste of air I am.
