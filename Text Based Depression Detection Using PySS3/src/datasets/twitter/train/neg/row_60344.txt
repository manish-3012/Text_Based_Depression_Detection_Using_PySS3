I love you, but I'm drowning. I whisper into the faceless sea of the internet, such words that could never be given voice

I love you. I really do and I've known you such a long time.

I wanted to tell you those months ago. I've wanted to tell you all this time...and now you keep on hitting up my phone, like I'll be working in the city next year with you. 

And all I can think about is what would it be like?

It hurts - to feel your lungs fill up with water? Agony. But only for 10-12 minutes? It can't be worse than say, giving birth, can it? People deal with that. Would drugs make drowning less painful?

What about bodies of water? I could never drown in the ocean - too terrifying, surrendering to that immensity - twice over, not for me thanks.

A frozen lake could be better. The cold would freeze you so fast you wouldn't even feel the icy water seeping into your lungs.

But what about mom? and grandma? or even Dad, even though I hate him? Or the dog?

God I love you, that subtle way you flirt with these messages, you, laughing at my stupid jokes and me, so impotent, so awed by you that I cannot act. You are beautiful the way you are now.

fuck, maybe ill buy a rope
