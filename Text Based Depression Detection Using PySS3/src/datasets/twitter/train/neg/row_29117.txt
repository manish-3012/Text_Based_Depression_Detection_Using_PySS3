Sometimes, just one thing is enough to live or die forI honestly feel like *"people never kill themselves because of just \[X\]"* or *"you're looking for excuses to live, you don't really want to die*" is such dismissive rhetoric.

For some people, if that one thing was resolved/didn't happen/was attained, they would be able to live.

For some people, if not for that one person or that one hope, they would be able to die.

Like many people, I'm enduring this purely because of my family. It's destroying me and it's not sustainable, but they're not my excuse, they are the sole reason. It's not the case for everyone, but sometimes, one thing is enough. Just a thought.
