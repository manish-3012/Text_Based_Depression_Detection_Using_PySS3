Itâ€™s back.When I was a teen I became quite depressed for a number of years and thought about suicide from time to time. Not too unusual I guess. I was a terrible student and in a fair amount of trouble. My parents were both successful and loving, but for some reason they just seemed to sit back and watch me fail. I never graduated high school, but somehow managed to teach myself to code and have had a relatively successful career. I have a wife and two teenage boys. Recently Iâ€™ve been circling the drain. I quit my job. Last night I went into an uncontrollable rage with my family. Nobody got hurt, but the neighbors called the police. I hate myself. Deep down I always have if Iâ€™m being honest.
