Hi everyoneSo, I've felt myself declining fairly quickly over the past few months. Alcohol seems to be winning the battle. I've been drinking daily for over 14 years now. I've tried many times to quit.. hell, I couldn't even quit after rolling my Jeep drunk with 3 people inside. I received probation and cheated the system for 6 months. I figured out the days they were gonna test me and just didn't drink after 7pm the night before.. Anyhow, things at work have been breaking down. I'm probably gonna be laid off soon. My wife and 3 kids love our new lifestyle cause I've been making $60k plus for the last 2 years after being a $35k a year guy for so long. If I get laid off, unemployment is like $500/wk and that won't  even pay rent. I have no savings, I drink away my spare money. They don't know I'm about to lose my job and I don't have the heart to tell them. I constantly skip out on anything that I don't absolutley half to do in life. I heard my 7 yr old daughter tell her friend "I wish my dad would do stuff like that with me" the other day. Yeah, that pretty much crushed my soul. My older kids are 18 and 16, boy and a girl. They pretty much ignore me. I feel like I cheated them out of having a father. I was there physically for them growing up, but I never did anything for either of them.. ever. My wife seems happy, but we haven't had sex in months.. it used to be every day almost.. even after 18 years of marriage until about 6 months ago.  I have it all planned. I carry a customised Glock 23 .40 cal pistol on me most of the time. It's a cool gun. I've put thousands of dollars worth of upgrades into it. The day I get laid off, (or maybe sooner) I'm gonna go to the bar and have a few shots of Bullit Frontier Whiskey, then I'm driving up to my favorite overlook. I'm gonna put the car in drive and pull the trigger. Anyhow, if you made it this far, thanks for reading. After 38 years, this guys gonna check out.
