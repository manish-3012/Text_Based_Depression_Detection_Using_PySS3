Not really me attempting suicide but just wanting to vent things :/I tend to get in arguments with my mom often about random things. I have slight anger issues and when she yells at me for something small I either get angry or break down into tears. 

I have had times where I cut myself after these arguments, which she doesn't know about, and cry my heart out.

Today I had a bad day and was trying hard to not go into the kitchen, grab a bottle of random pills, and swallow them all. My mom started getting mad and yelled about how my brother, dad, and I are giving eachother weird and stupid things for Christmas. 

I got triggered by how she was yelling at me for something that she is insisting my dad thought of but it was me. She kept saying how he was using dating sites and shit that are expensive and kept ignoring what I was saying. 

When she left the room, she closed my door and I just started sobbing. I've been able to quiet my crying so she nor my brother could hear me.

 I'm now on my bed crying while physically and mentally straining myself to not go to the kitchen to either slash my wrists with a knife or like I said at the beginning to swallow a bunch of pills.

I don't have any razors in my room because I usually cut in the bathroom to avoid any blood on my bed.

I dont usually cut to the point it bleeds but just to know that I'm feeling pain and can see the short slashes.

I don't have anything to do to sleep from how I feel but I shouldn't be using my phone.

I mostly cut to get myself to sleep but now I can't.

I've tried scratching but it doesn't have the same effect.

the most dangerous thing I have with me right now is my mind and what I'm thinking of.
