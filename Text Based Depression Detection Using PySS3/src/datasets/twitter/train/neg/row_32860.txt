how would you react / what would you do if you friend said he wanted to attempt suicide (again)?I'm not planning on doing anything right now but Im curious. 

i recently had a breakdown so bad that i feel it changed me more than I'd like to admit. what am I supposed to tell the people I know when they wouldn't care one bit?
