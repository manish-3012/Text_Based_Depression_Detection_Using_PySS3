[Serious] What are responsible ways to prepare for my death that makes the transition easier for the folks around me?I am a 33 year old male with limited resources. Honestly about 5kUSD in credit card debt and $6k left on my car. I have no major assets except $4k tied up in a 401k type thing. I do have some videography equipment slowly depreciating probably valued at less than $3k at this point, but I was hoping to leave that to a friend to help him carry out his artistic aspirations, so I really don't want to sell that.

That's about it. (I went through my savings and sold through all of my major posessions after leaving my job about a year ago and having to pay off psych and hospital bills, etc etc.)

I know I'll need a will of some kind. I don't have life insurance. And I never taught high school chemistry so I can't make meth. What do?
