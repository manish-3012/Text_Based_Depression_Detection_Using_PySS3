Is it possible to be worthless?I apologize for posting this but I'm honestly unsure where else to let it out. 

I'm a 28-year-old woman working on her Master's degree. I've struggled with self-worth through much of my life and recent events have me seriously questioning it. My dear friend, who was a brilliant scientist, passed away a month ago. She unfortunately decided to end her life. She was an amazing person and I saw so much potential in her. She was intelligent, kind, beautiful, and gifted in so many things. Yet, she passed, and the world keeps turning. I feel like it shouldn't. I know realistically it will, but I feel like it shouldn't. To see the world not react to someone who could do so much good disappear, it makes me wonder will it even matter if I die. 

I'm struggling to find work for my degree. I've applied to five places so far, and all of them have put a hold on new hires until next year. It has me concerned if I'll have a job that can pay my bills and help my family and I pull through this. I want to be able to do this on my own, I want to prove I can be of some worth to this world. 

I'm not extremely intelligent, nor am I beautiful, athletic, or even that young anymore. I'm single and haven't yet met that special someone in my life (if they even exist). I'm scared of letting this all out because I don't want this to affect other people. It's painful and I don't want others to have to endure these kinds of thoughts. 

I swore I won't end my own life, but I know if I do get sick, it will be likely that they will let me die. It's crazy, I spent all my life fretting and fighting to be of some worth to society, and none of it changes anything. Is it possible for a human being to be worthless? Would it be right to let myself die just so I no longer burden people?
