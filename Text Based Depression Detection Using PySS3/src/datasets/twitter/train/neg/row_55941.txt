Lost everything.4 kids, one by one. My job. The chance to finally complete my undergrad. I was inducted into Tau Sigma. I served in our state defense force and was decorated multiple times for my work. Nobody will ever remember that. Theyâ€™ll remember what my soon so be ex has accused me of, regardless of the concrete video evidence to the contrary. Iâ€™m going to lose my home and car this coming week. Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t make enough money to keep her happy. Iâ€™m sorry, yâ€™all, but I honestly canâ€™t do this anymore. Be good.
