I feel really guilty and badHi, I'm a girl. Around 4 years ago I was 13 years old and I was starting to discover all about you know the sexual aspect of my body and sexual pleasure and I always kept it to myself. I always believed myself to be a good and kind hearted person I always help everyone with my best will and I really hold strong good positive values and beliefs. But back when I was around 13 years old I did something that I can't live with and it's eating me up. I have a 6 year old brother and back then he might've been around 3 years old one day I don't know how might've been feeling horny or whatever but I used his hand to touch my breasts for my own pleasure I used him as another person giving me pleasure It was just this time and I did it for like 2 or 3 minutes and it wasn't until last year that I turned 16 and since then I've been thinking about it, I love my brother to bits I wouldn't be able to live without him and this thing that I asked him to do for me is just chewing up my brain I feel horrible and I keep thinking this might have a bad effect on him. What do I do? I feel horrible and I keep fighting with myself for what I did and it's killing me. What do i do?
