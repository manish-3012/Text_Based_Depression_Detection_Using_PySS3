I want to do itHowever, I'm scared. I don't want to know what the after life is like if there is one. I don't want it to be a failed attempt and have to live with the aftermath. I don't want to feel pain when I do it. 
I'm just tired of having to live. I've been depressed since I was merely ten years old and I am 18 now. College is so difficult and I just want it to be over with. I'm tired of feeling like a failure. I help everyone with their problems 24/7 but the moment I need something I literally get ignored.
