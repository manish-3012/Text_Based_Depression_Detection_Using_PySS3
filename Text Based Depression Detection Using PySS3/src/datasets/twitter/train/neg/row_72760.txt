I posted to all my social media that I was going to suicideNobody cares. Not a single person. 2 people even liked the status. No messages. They will regret it when they see me on the news tomorrow.

Why am I still living. Nobody will miss me. My family is abusive, I have no friends, and I'm a failure at life. Unemployed college dropout, unwanted by all. Maybe I could survive on my own if I just had a good job. But I have nothing. I have no place in this world. I am done.
