Life is beautiful.I don't really believe there isn't innocence, deep beauty, or meaning to be had. There are good people. Good deeds seem to have a healing effect.

But I know that I am not worth any of it. I know I am not a source of this goodness. I know it is beyond my scope of healing.

I see the inherent beauty of life, but it is not for me.

I think because I see it and appreciate it, this makes the pain I feel more accute.

With all my heart, I want to die in peace.
