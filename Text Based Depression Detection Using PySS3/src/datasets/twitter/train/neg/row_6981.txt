I really want to die, but I just can't bring myself to do itI got home from work today, and I spent about 2 hours just rolling around in my bed half the time napping and half the time punching myself. My fucking legs look beat the fuck up and it hurts and I hate it. I know I want to die, but I also know that I can't kill myself. I just can't bring myself to do it. I hate it so much. I've been depressed for almost a year straight. It's so fucking exhausting. I'm tired of it. Every time I think I'm close to getting out of it, bam I'm fucking myself up again. The most mundane shit tips me over the edge, and I'm ready to just end it. I hate it so much.
