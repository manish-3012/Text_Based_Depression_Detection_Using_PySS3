Telling someone not to commit suicide because their loved ones will miss them is fucking horribleI hate it. I hate the thought that my mom will miss me if I ever committed suicide. I would die feeling selfish and knowing I let everyone down hard. It sucks. It makes me feel guilty for feeling suicidal. It pains and scares me.
