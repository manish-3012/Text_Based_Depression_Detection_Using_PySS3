I shouldn't be like this.I shouldn't be here. I don't have a bad home life right now (I did in the past). I'm not the victim of bullying, I'm just a normal, well mostly normal, 17 year old. I've been in marching band for 7 years now, and I'm somewhat musically talented, yet, I struggle with suicide often. I was cutting back in February but someone took my blade and I can't find another one and I think that's the thing that is pushing me over the edge. I have no reason to feel suicidal other than past traumas, which aren't nearly as bad compared to others, so why should I feel like this? I've planned suicide multiple times and have attempted once. I draft suicide notes somewhat often, and I just want to get out of here. There isn't a good reason, I know. I try to ask for help in real life, and while some of my friends do offer legitimate support, others just believe I'm begging for attention, and honestly, at this point I wish I was just begging for attention, but I just want it all to stop. I'm in constant mental pain, and the only time I'm not is when I either cut or am with the ones I love the most, and with spring break being this past week, it's been the worst it's ever been. I've tried to choke myself, since I don't have any way to hang myself, but I can't go through with it. I need help, but many thing I'm just a fucking liar..
