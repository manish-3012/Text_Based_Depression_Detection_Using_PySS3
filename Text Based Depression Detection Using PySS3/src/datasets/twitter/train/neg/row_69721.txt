Getting Ignored All The TimeI canâ€™t remember the last time I ever approached anyone nicely on this damn reddit account. Everyone just pisses me off. This whole world is filled with nothing but entitled motherfuckers

But for once I decided to actually approach someone with respect and just be nice

Twice actually

And guess what?

I got left on read both times after a few days

So it really doesnâ€™t make a difference if Iâ€™m rude or nice after all

People are just assholes

Alright then, FUCK YOU. Fuck youâ€™re supposedly personal problems you can shove them up your ass. Why do people think itâ€™s so amusing to leave me on read

Then I ghost one of them and they act like theyâ€™re worried

Lies, nothing but pathetic lies

Hereâ€™s an idea..

IF YOU DONâ€™T LIKE ME SAY IT

Say it so I can block you and move on

But nobody ever does that.. they have to make it more complicated than it needs to be

Ohhhh.. but Iâ€™m the bad guy

Iâ€™m the bad guy for calling out you idiots for youâ€™re actions

Ok then

If ANYONE dares approach me Iâ€™m blocking you. Donâ€™t try to say youâ€™re different or convince me Iâ€™m wrong because YOU ARE WRONG

I said what I said. Donâ€™t like it? Oh well
