Want to suicide badly but afraid of how my mom will live onI'm an 18 yr old and I think that suicide is the inevitable path for me. I have tried to get better and have shown progress but I still really want to kill myself. I hate myself so much and there's been a lot of things I've done wrong that I feel can only be made up if I end my life. If I were left alone, I would have done it already but what stopped me most as of recently is the local gun stores not taking transfers and since I'm 18 I can't really just walk up in the store and buy a gun right away. But my mother deals with several health issues including chronic pain due to her degenerating spine, she's so fucking strong so sometimes I feel like my death won't matter much to her but I know she also loves me very much, and I too love her so very much. But I feel like everything would be better if I just ended it, and I really wanna end it soon before the school year ends to make an impact on the community, I don't want to die if nobody gives a shit. There's only 21 days left so I'm really running out of time. I'm afraid my mom is gonna be struggling so much without me there to help. Sometimes we have arguments and then I get into that mood that tells me that I should just forget about how she feels, she pissed me off so if I die I won't have to be pissed anymore. I'm already certain I will kill myself and I especially wanna do it before the school year ends. I have fantasies about being like the only kid not walking during graduation and then the whole school being in shock cause I'm dead.
