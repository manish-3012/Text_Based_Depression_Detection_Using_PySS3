Serious advice on my situation (PLEASE READ THE WHOLE THING) I know itâ€™s longI ruined my exâ€™s life and his college experience. Itâ€™s crazy how ONE event changes your life. I decide to go to college and someone from elementary school sees we are going to the same college so last minute she asks to room. We do and I love her I love her as much as I did when I was 10 or 8. We get bored easy and get on tinder we match with a guy and he brings white claws to our dorm. He brings a friend. Me and the other guy hit it off and start dating I wear a lot of makeup at the time and kiss Iâ€™m femme at the time. The boy is obsessed with me after time I tell him in questioning my gender and think Iâ€™m trans. Itâ€™s literally mostly because I hate my period I hate blood fucking coming out of my vagina. I go on testosterone and he is supportive and loved me. He cries and says heâ€™s bi. If I transition I am still his. His mother finds out because I post a tik tok about being FTM. His mom finds it and shows him in the car. He freaks out and denies it. He breaks up with me after two years being together. I made him question his sexuality and ruined his life. My ex roommate also didnâ€™t know how to relate to me when I started wearing baggy clothes and cut my hair and started testosterone. I talked to her about it and sheâ€™s very accepting but she also is very girly but maybe I wanna be very girly too. I miss boys. I miss them chasing me. I miss my ex. I miss freshmen year of college. I miss my old life. I went off hormones and my periods are back so I just want to kill my self again. He will never love me again and my friends say he doesnâ€™t ever think of me. I made him question his sexuality and ruined his life. Iâ€™m scared of death like ETERNITY!! Itâ€™s scary. Idk. Advice? Idk. Anything? Please donâ€™t tell me Iâ€™ll find someone who truly loves me because it doesnâ€™t comfort me.
