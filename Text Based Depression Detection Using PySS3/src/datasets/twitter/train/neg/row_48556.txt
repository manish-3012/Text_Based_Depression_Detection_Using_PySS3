I want to die tomorrow.I've been out of a job since COVID-19 first sprung up in Canada, and I haven't received any financial assistance. I've applied for EI/CERB in March and haven't seen a penny even though everyone I know is living their best life. I haven't eaten a meal since last week and I barely have the energy to even try to live. I honestly just want to walk out to the woods and hang myself rather than starve to death. Nobody gives a fuck anyways
