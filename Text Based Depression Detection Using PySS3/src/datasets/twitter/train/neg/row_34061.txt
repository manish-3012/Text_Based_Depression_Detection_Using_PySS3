I really dont know how much longer I can hold on for.I feel like this is all my life is going to be, I have bad cystic acne covering my forehead that constantly hurts and wont go away no matter what medicine I use. My best friend died of cancer. The girl I had loved treats me like shit. I brought up that I felt like killing my self because she had dealt with those feelings in the past, I get no nice words, no attempts at stopping me. And I know I probably sound like an attention whore now but when I told her that if she really didnt care, she could block me. Well, surprise, she did. I talked to a mutual friend about this, one who I had known longer than her, and he picked her over me, despite what she had done. Basically, my best friend died, my other best friend abandoned me chasing some girl who almost got me to kill my self on multiple occasions (yes there was more, I dont feel like typing so much though), im in constant pain, discomfort, and humility due to my acne. And frankly I would rather this just be the end, im so sick of people treating me like im some fucking leper just because I broke out on my forehead. I think most of all, Im sick of people treating this fucking girl like some princess just because shes somewhat nice in person, because when you actually talk to her, shes a selfish bitch (my "best friend" even said it). Im really sorry if this comes out as hateful or attention whory, I just want someone to know the truth I guess. I really dont feel like doing this anymore. 



Edit: Well I've made my decision, I just wanted to say that this sub is amazing and all of you are beautiful. 

Edit 2: Probably shouldnt have been so vague in my last update. Im fine, I meant I had decided against it after reading some comments on other posts. And I just wanted to thank the people that commented
