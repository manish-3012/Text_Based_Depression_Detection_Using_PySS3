I don't buy in to these reasons to livePeople are telling me the same things again and again. "You have a family and they need you." Type stuff. I was laid off from my job in August and after well over 100 applications, career coach, professionally made resume, no gaps in work history till now, 13 years with the same company, and referrals to certain positions I'm still hopeless. I'm contributing nothing to my family. I provide nothing financially and emotionally I'm angry and not supportive. I see my wife walk around on eggshells and now my daughter because they don't want to upset me. 

I'm an alcoholic on and off. No legal troubles or abuse. This has made my wife want to send me off to rehab for as long as it takes. I have distanced myself from my friends because we would all drink and I can't be around that. 

Other things, mom died in August of last year, Grandma who was basically my mom died in September,  dad was diagnosed with cancer two weeks after that, a few weeks later he was diagnosed with another cancer, I mentioned being laid off, I caught my wife talking to another guy, and most recently I totaled my car. So a lot has happened in the last year. 

I'm done with it. I'm tired of waiting for the next bad thing to happen and to just be a drain on my family financially and emotionally. 

The other day I slit my left wrist but it wasn't deep enough. I hear hanging yourself is the way to go. I have written most of my suicide letter so I think that's about it. 

Can anyone change my mind with some original thoughts?
