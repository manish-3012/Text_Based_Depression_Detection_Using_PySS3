At the last of my willI once had everything I wanted. Military career in the reserve. Beautiful fiance. A job that payed $16 a hour. I was happy. Then a 14 year old girl got a crush on me. I rejected her as nice as I could. She went and told her friends I slept with her. A year later I was convicted of sexual abuse 3rd degree. Lost my job. Discharged from the army. Few months after that the fiance left and hasnt talked to me since. I miss her with all my heart. Bad things keep happening to me. When she left she took everything. Im 6000 in debt and rising. Crummy job that I work 40+ hours at yet still cant pay the bills. Iv got nothing. Started cutting, Tried to kill myself once. I feel myself going down that road again. My friend and family dont know. Last time I told my family it blew up and did more harm then good. My friends im afraid to tell. I take meds. I see a counselor. I started drinking alot more. I dont know what to do anymore and Im slowly starting to believe that it would be better if i died. I dont believe in god or a higher power. Im at a loss at what to do.

*edit* I would put up proof but I'm not sure what I could put up to prove my innocence. I have plenty of paperwork saying I was convicted but nothing that would prove my innocence. I might be able to find the full court transcript. I also don't have any paperwork on the polygraph I passed because my PO said that he cant hand out that type of documentation. If any employer wanted proof they could call him but beyond that no paper work can leave his office. Also my friends haven't abandoned me. Its just most of them our guys and they don't really know how to deal with this type of problem and my family just tend to throw allot of religious stuff my way. Also the fiance left because after the conviction I withdrew emotionally and just wasn't quite all there.
