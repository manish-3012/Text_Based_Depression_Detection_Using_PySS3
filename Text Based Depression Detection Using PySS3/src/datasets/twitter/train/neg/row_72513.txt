Do you believe in reincarnation?I believe that I was someone evil enough to be reincarnated in this life where I get all I want, but never what I need (basically, a genie's deal). It is quite frightening that it can become 10x worse after death and it sort of keeps me here still. Anyways, what do ya'll think?
