The pactAbout a year ago, I was suicidally depressed (actually, most of my life). I decided to write a pact with 3 attainable goals:
1. Find a job
2. Find someone 
3. Become fit (I was normal/skinny)

If I failed I decided I would kill myself to stop being a burden on my family/society (they have enough burdens as it is)

A year has passed, I finished college and my internship, but I've been unemployed for 6 months (I've lost count of how many jobs I've applied to in many different fields). I'm about to run out of money and I'm 18k in debt (thanks school). 

I have a family but I can't return back home, mainly because of my deadbeat alcoholic father who doesn't do anything, and tells everyone else in my family that they're not doing shit (can't say anything about it to him, he's extremely mentally unstable, will snap and take it out on my mother). It makes me physically ill to be around him (hes put my mother and my sister through hell). Every time he talks to me or even touches me a killing intent rises in my body.

I'm more alone now than ever, I've actually lost the bulk of my friends (they moved, found jobs, etc), and I'm nowhere close to being mentally stable enough to sustain a relationship with someone. I have self-esteem and confidence issues even though I've been told by several people that I'm physically attractive (even other guys tell me I'm attractive). I am more muscular than I was last year, but I'm not fit, In fact I feel like shit most of time and I was actually more fit last year (cardiovascular wise). 

I'm 23 now, I'm socially retarded, unemployed (seemingly unemployable), in debt, all the standard depressed reasons. I don't really want to kill myself, but I know exactly how and when I'm going to do it. I just don't know what to do anymore, and I know its my fault. I didn't work hard enough in school, I didn't do anything to change my family, and I didn't develop my social skills. I failed.
