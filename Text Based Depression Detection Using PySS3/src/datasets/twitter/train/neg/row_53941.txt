80 hour work weeks until I'm deadTired. I'm So fucking Tired. I know there is nothing for me. The only thing I am allowed to is to work every second of my life. I will always been alone, always made to sacrifice everything, to be worked to death. I don't fucking care. Anti depressants worked for a while, but they can only do some much. 

I have heard every piece of advice, I tried everything I can. I can't be happy, I can't be allowed to work less. I just want to die. I know nobody cares. The best anyone can give is their sympathy. There is nothing for me in the real world, no one here cares. 

Just let me die.
