I keep constantly thinking about what would be people's reaction to my suicideSometimes there are days when I'm somewhat aware my parents, brother and the rest of the family would be devastated, and my friends maybe too.

But then there are days when I convince myself nobody would care. My parents would still have a kid, and they would have one less burden to carry. My friends would be glad to get rid of me because all I ever do is annoy them with my presence.

And I just can't decide one way or another. It's one of the things that keeps me from actually killing myself.
