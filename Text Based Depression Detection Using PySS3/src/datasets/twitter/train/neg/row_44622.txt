I want to dieI have thought about suicide for a long time, i am 23 i have thought about it since i was at least 12-13 i have been severely depressed for all that time as well and the more every day creeps by i realize it isnt getting any better and i dont think it ever will, and people tell me you cant kill yourself things are bound to turn around, but they fucking arnt i mean in 10 years everything is still the same i have no friends going on 20 years now i never had a friend threw all of school i was alone for all that time, my only real friends are online and they have all outgrown online games, starting famlies and such so i dont even get to talk to them anymore and they were all i really had, sure i have some family members but besides my mom i am not really close with any of them, and i can tell when talking to any of them that they just want to get out of any conversation they are having with me as soon as they possibly can.

Ontop of that i am 23 and have never even kissed a girl, and i dont know how i could ever even talk to one now, just imagine how fucked a girl would think i was when we talk about past relationships and i tell i am basically in 6th grade, never talked to a girl never been on a date anything, i am just a sack of crap that needs to die so things can finally stop being horrible, at least when you are dead there is nothing, no good no bad, that sounds alot better then all bad all the time

i just want it over, thats all i want, why put myself the shit i would have to deal with for the next 60 years to just be in agony for all that time...
