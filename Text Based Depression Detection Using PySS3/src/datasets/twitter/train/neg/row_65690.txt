It's been two years since I worked a day or made a good decisionAnd probably a year since I had any kind of optimism for how my life is going to end.

I'm just useless, I can't seem to begin to make a decision that leads me to a better state of life, I just sink further into this bed that I spend 99% of my time in.  I know I should get a job and I want to get one, but I haven't.  I sent out tons of applications at the start but never got so much as a response.  I don't know how to be proactive, I'm in one of the most economically depressed places in the country so options are scarce, and I don't have any qualifications to get a decent job anyways.  High school drop outs who have been working at a restaurant or retail would be more qualified than me at this stage in their life.

So I've spent all this time with no income, leeching off my grandfather for utilities and my mother to pay for things like my car and food.  I don't know how I ever got this bad.  When I first realized I had lost m GI bill income, I thought I'd immediately go out and get a job, and I just had to borrow money from my mom once or twice while I got established.  It's been 14 months, I can't even know how much money I've taken from her and given nothing in return.  I'm a 26 year old man and I'm useless to anyone.

I'm just sitting here with another check to pay my bills for a month and a knife.  I don't know if I should use one for another year of sleeping and jerking off (god, I wish I could just sleep for the rest of my life, I have nice dreams and nothing to do then), or if I should just finally cut both my radial arteries in the bathtub so that I can spare my family the expense of supporting me with as little mess as possible.
