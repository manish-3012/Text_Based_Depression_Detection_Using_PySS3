Back again.I posted here a lot on a number of other throwaway accounts in the past few years.   I've been suicidal for a long time.  I haven't gone a day without seriously considering killing myself since I was in 8th grade.  I'm going to be a sophomore in college this fall.  I'd type everything out again but it's no use.  It's a pretty generic story of shitty friends and heartbreak.  I want to be in a relationship so desperately but it will never happen.  I've been trying since middle school but social anxiety gets in the way.  I'm not even that bad looking.  I'm just blank.  I don't have a personality.  No one can love someone like me.  No one will ever be excited to see me.  No one will ever feel for me the rush that I've felt for people I love.   I hate people so much because of it I'm so jealous of every happy couple I see because I can never have that.  And I know that makes me a fucking degenerate piece of subhuman trash but I fully acknowledge that's what I am.  They fucking flaunt it while they live their happy fucking lives and cuddle and fuck and all the shit I want but can't have.  The worst are the young couples with kids.  I want to be a dad and husband so bad but no one will ever want to marry me.  I'm pathetic.  I obsess over the concept of my own gore.  I love the thought of blowing my brains out with a hollow-point round so shit goes everywhere.  Or using copious amounts of explosives to annihilate myself into a red mist.  (In a secluded area, of course.  I'd never hurt anyone.  I'm emotionally incapable of hurting people.)  I'd also love to just jump off a high structure onto concrete, so I'd make a big mess of blood and organs and shit.  The more pieces I end up in, the happier I'll be.  I just don't want to exist anymore.
