I don't want to go onI hate life. I'm so lonely yet I can't speak to anyone. My anxiety stops me doing anything and I'm the most uninteresting, boring person to live. I'm not interested in anything. I don't do anything. There's no point to me being here. The only reason I keep on living is to keep my family happy, but I'm miserable being here. I don't know how to be happy. I want to go.
