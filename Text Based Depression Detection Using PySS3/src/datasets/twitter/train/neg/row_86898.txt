My body dysmorphia has ruined my life and I will end up in an emergency clinic for severely disabled because of itI have body dysmorphia and my biggest problem is my hair. I am constantly afraid that they will break and get damaged, which is why I shave them off every few days. My mother found the whole thing so bad that she has now found a hospital where I will land on Friday. It is a hospital with severely handicapped people from all ages and it is considered one of the worst here ... I would have understood a normal therapy in a clinic but this is just too bad .... My life is over and I just want to that the whole thing ends. I'd rather die than land there...

I am a guy and just 20...I never wanted my life to end like this but it seems like fate/god whatever just didnâ€™t want me to be happy and live a normal love, I just wish I was dead!
