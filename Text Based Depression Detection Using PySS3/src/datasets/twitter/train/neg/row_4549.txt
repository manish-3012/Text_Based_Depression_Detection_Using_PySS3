I think I'm going to kill myself at schoolMy math teacher hates me. I never do anything. Yesterday he gave me detention for playing with string. Like wtf. I have a razor blade and I plan on going to the bathroom during math and cutting until I bleed out. I'm going to put him in my suicide note and I hope he gets fired. I'm actually scared. I've been getting better for a while now. I haven't been having many suicidal thoughts lately and I've been clean for 3 months(?) but I am failing school and life in general honestly why do I even try. Please help.
