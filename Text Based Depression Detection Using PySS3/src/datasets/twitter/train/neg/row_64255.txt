Here there and everywhereBeen struggling with depression and severe anxiety my whole life. I've attempted 4 times my most recent being a week ago. Bipolar as well and showing signs of schizophrenia which my mom believes I have haven't fully bought into it yet but now I'm seeing the symptoms and it's scarring me. 27 and also  a recovering addict and a current alcoholic. Just need some words of encouragement maybe someone to tell me it gets better. Thanks for your time guys God bless
