i miss himdoesnâ€™t feel the same anymore. maybe iâ€™ve just kept on bringing him down with my subtle threats and obvious negativity. 
i donâ€™t blame him. he deserves better, as always. 
my letter to him is 8 pages long but it keeps getting longer. i have so much to tell him and so much to apologize for. 
heâ€™d always tell me not to say sorry unless i really mean i wonâ€™t do it again. because past times when iâ€™ve apologized i kept doing it again, misunderstanding him and taking offense unnecessarily. but this time. every apology i make, i literally will not do it again. because i wonâ€™t be able to. 
i miss him. i love him. i need him. he needed me. heâ€™s better without me. he needs to be with someone happy, someone who still makes him happy. instead of me. fucking worthless piece of shit. i wasted his time. iâ€™m so sorry, iâ€™m sorry
