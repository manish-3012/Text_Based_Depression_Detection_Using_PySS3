Why ending your own life is a huge deal?Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a long time and i know Iâ€™ll just end up doing it.
I believe suicide can be the only way out for some people, I donâ€™t get why others try to stop them when they know theyâ€™re living in hell and probably will continue living like this their whole life like why would you stop them from ending the pain? And Iâ€™m talking about people who can not be saved in any way
