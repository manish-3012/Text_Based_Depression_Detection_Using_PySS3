Tired of being strong, just want to give up.Whatâ€™s the point of me fighting everyday for a life that seems impossible to reach. 

Iâ€™m so tired of feeling like the universeâ€™s punching bag, nothing is going my way. Iâ€™m honestly tired of trying, maybe I should just give in and give up. As of right now, I have no purpose in this world Iâ€™m just here taking up space. Iâ€™m living day to day making no impact or progress towards anything.
