My friend committed suicide. I can't live with the guilt.I had a really close Internet friend who I met in a game. We used to talk to each other everyday, watching movies together. One day he started talking to me gradually less and told me that he was clinically depressed. And I promised myself to not give up on him no matter what, just to show him that he had someone who truly cared about him. He was too unstable for me however, he'd be really nice again for a very short time before ignoring me or acting rude toward me for no reason. Regardless, I tried to hold onto the stale friendship, for all it's worth he was still my friend.

2 months ago he lashed out at me and told me to "stfu" when I asked him if he wasn't feeling okay. Struggling with severe depression myself, I decided that it was time to cut the toxic friendship out of my life. 2 days later was the last time I saw him logging in the game, which he said "if I haven't logged in for 1 month, you know I'd be gone".

I'm feeling extremely depressed. If I hadn't stopped checking up on him completely, is there any chance that he wouldn't have taken the last step toward taking his own life? If I disregarded my dignity and feelings that time, would he open up to me? Maybe the last time he lashed out at me was a cry for help and I turned a blind eye to it. The guilt is eating me alive.
