Can't do this anymore.Just have to say something. I don't know when exactly but I know how. I know it will hurt maybe 2 people, but they have people to live for, and they'll get over it soon enough. Maybe it'll give them a deeper connection with life and what time they have left, because we all die sooner or later. My life is hopeless and has been for a very long time. I really try be positive but dealing with this constant dread every day is really taking me under. I've posted here before and it always seems like I'm being vague but I'm really not. I feel like it's dooms day every day. I can't even leave the house. I can barely muster enough energy to do things like brush my teeth. It took me a long time to realize that normal people don't experience this intense anxiety every day. I live in a wretched hole and I can't get out. My family think I should get a back-bone. They think I should just get on with life. But I can't anymore. I'm grateful to them for feeding me and giving me a roof over my head, but me being a good-for-nothing leech is taking it's toll. I'm being selfish expecting them to look after me. It's been years and I can't afford to get help. It takes every ounce of energy I have just to exist. I love my family and I love this earth and I think there's something really sacred about life, it's really wondrous to behold but maybe if I go now then I can see and understand things better from the vantage point of whatever comes after this existence. Maybe doing it is a sin, but this seems to be my only option. I'm not worth it. I'm really tired of it. I'm pathetic and I know that and that's part of why I want to go. Thanks for reading. I wish you the very best and hope whatever you're going through that you find the strength/or get what you need to get through it.
