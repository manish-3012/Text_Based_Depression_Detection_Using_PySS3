I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m 15 and have been dealing with major depression since i was around 13, but got officially diagnosed about 6 months ago. iâ€™m on antidepressants that arenâ€™t working. I have an appointment with my physiatrist in a few weeks to get a new prescription, and my mom is getting me a therapist soon. I honest to god donâ€™t think i can wait that long. my parents are the best people in the world and truly care about me but i hate opening up to them and always downplay my feelings. it took so long for me to get diagnosed because i kinda gave my mom the impression that my depression was beatable without medication. i feel so fucking annoying because my life is kinda picture perfect but i want to kill myself so bad. my mom talked about hospitalization and i feel like thatâ€™s necessary but iâ€™m super scared to have to talk about how i feel with other people considering i keep everything super buried. iâ€™m also scared about what my friends will think or say if they find out i was hospitalized for depression. i really donâ€™t like people feeling bad for me because it makes me feel so selfish. i really donâ€™t know what to do anymore, these past few weeks have been the worst depression episode iâ€™ve ever been in and my thoughts are going from wishing i was dead to actually considering methods. does anyone have any advice? iâ€™d literally take anything right now.
