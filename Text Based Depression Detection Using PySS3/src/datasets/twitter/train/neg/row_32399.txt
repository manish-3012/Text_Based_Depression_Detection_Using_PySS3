wow yeah that sounds greatalready been in therapy and taking meds for 4 years doesn't help at all can't wait to live another 5 decades wow im so happy
can't wait to get responses like "hang in bro is get better" "hey im twice your age and still miserable but once 5 years ago this kinda pleasant thing happened so dont kill yourself" "read this book it literally changed my life" "have you tried physical exercise" "just remember to smile :)" 
idk that's kind of passive aggressive but i know i will kill myself not posting for help just venting
actually here's something really passive aggressive, follow my account if you want to know when i kill myself. i'll post "i did it" on one of those shitty subreddits where people catalogue their death. kinda funny how many of them cop out but those are cries for help rather than people who know what they're doing and have just given up entirely
