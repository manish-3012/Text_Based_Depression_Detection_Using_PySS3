Why should I even live?Nothing really makes me happy, not long term at least. Had some issues as a kid, now I'm just past my teenage years and things aren't going in a good direction. Is there any actual reason I shouldn't off myself? What's the point of living a life I'm not enjoying?

Please, don't say anything about love(I don't think I'll get any of that, but it seems too much of a struggle anyway) or some pseudo-inspirational bullshit. I quite don't bite that.
