The world is a shitty place of my own making.Over the last 3 years or so, I have spiralled. Some points have been lower and higher than others, some have even been nice.  However, I have a very destructive nature of procrastination.  Because of this, I can't live up to my own expectations.  I had started to tame my procrastination and set the goal of going into law enforcement.  It was working out okay.  

My migraines have started getting worse though, and after a period of denying it, I have decided that I can't in good consience go into law enforcment or any similar field where that may not only impair my ability to do my job, but put others at risk.  Now I don't know what to do, or what I can do with my life.  

I feel like if I leave, a lot of people will be sad, dissapointed.  My girlfriend's life will be unravelled.  My parents, I don't know what they would do.  Even so, I don't think I want to be here anymore.  I don't know if I'll turn it around, off myself, or just disappear.  But I need to choose one of the three.
