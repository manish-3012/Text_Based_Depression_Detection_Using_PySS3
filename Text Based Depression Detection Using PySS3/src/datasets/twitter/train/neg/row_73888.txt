I guess I'm transgender.I'm not trying to offend anyone here. I only just realized a few days ago that I might be actually transgender. I'm 21 (born) female. My family would never accept me, which I'm not too worried about.

I just want to run away. Really, really far away and live my life how I want. But I feel like that will never make up for all the life I've missed so far. And that there's no point trying.

Sorry.
