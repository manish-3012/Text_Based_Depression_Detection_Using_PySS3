Ayo What title would make YOU want to stop ME from killing myself? I can't think of itSo I'm just after spending the whole day today crying.
I've also spent it looking at articles from people who claim to have the magic potion of information on how to stop feeling bad and not want to kill yourself anymore.
Reading these articles made it so much worse and I'm much closer than I've ever been. The cynical person in me doesn't respond to corny, scientific-void sayings like "you never know what's around a corner" and bs like that. 
I'm literally so fucking pointless in every dimension of life right now.
An example would be the fact that I'm currently not attending a college course which could set up my life and instead I'm staying at home playing video games promising myself I'll start work next week.
It's been 6 months since that started and it's almost too late to do well / pass in the course.
I'm so lazy that it's actually so bad. 
Listen, everyone is lazy.
Everyone.
That's normal. 
I am LAZY lazy.
Like so fucking uselessly lazy that I can't even do what I know would help me and my mental state (go to college) because of how lazy I am. 
This makes me depressed and that loop keeps happening and happening and it's made me 95% ready to go.
That's one.
Thats just one aspect of why there's no reason I should go another day through it.
And realistically I know I'm not talking to anyone here and I've just wasted 10 minutes of my life typing this out because let's face it, none of you are licensed psychologists or anything and won't be able to help me with Jack shit.
You might recite some bullshit you seen on the internet that worked for you but you don't know me.
You don't actually know what would work for me or what type of person I am. Like what is the actual Point of this
