Some words of encouragement would be nice?I'm starting to use this throwaway more than my main.

I had a call with a suicide hotline. It was nice and I'm calmed down, but most of the conversation was silence or them just saying "mhm." Or "suure." Or "that must be tough."

I might not be a crying mess, but I still feel bad about myself, especially about now wasting the callers time. I'm glad I managed to convince them to do a text check in rather than a call- It just wasn't a very pleasant.

Just any kind of support or uplifting comments would be nice, or general positivity to get me out of my horrible state. If you want you could even share a story if you've had similar experiences to mine, idk. Just something to cheer me up after such a rough night. 

Forgive me if this is the completely wrong subreddit for this, and if it is, please redirect me to a proper one-
