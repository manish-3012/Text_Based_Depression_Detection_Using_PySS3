I am so lost.I hate that I even feel this way because I have many people in my life who love me. On the outside, Iâ€™m sure my life looks just fine. But I am feeling so lost and so alone. My anxiety is off the charts and every day is a struggle. I want to die. I cant live this way anymore. And Iâ€™m just really fucking tired.
