Childhood trauma ruined any potential I had to have a happy life.I used to be really numb to all of it, and while I was I was able to be really level headed and successful and logical. But now itâ€™s been around 5 years since I was in the throes of it all, and slowly things are started to be unearthed and I canâ€™t even describe how painful it is. 

Iâ€™ve had little moments over the past few years where it was like I was almost reaching catharsis, and just almost going into an episode and re-experiencing trauma, but it was like my brain would shut it down before it could fully happen and Iâ€™d be fine again. 

But now my PTSD is on full blast and I donâ€™t know if this is just the beginning of the glass spilling over or if this is the dark before the dawn. 

I had a really traumatic experience back in April that set things in motion it seems, and ever since Iâ€™ve been going in and out of severe ptsd episodes from my childhood and unearthing memories I didnâ€™t even know I had. I moved away from all my family and friends last year so Iâ€™m here renting a room in a different state with acquaintances and brand new friends and just my cats. All of this re-experiencing of my trauma is so extremely painful and exhausting and Iâ€™ve been trying to find a therapist but I know I also have trust problems and wonâ€™t even be able to open up to the therapist for awhile, since thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happened with every therapist Iâ€™ve had. 

Iâ€™ve never felt so alone and in so much pain and so much like I want to kill myself. I havenâ€™t been suicidal in a long time. I was doing relatively well, hanging on relatively well, staying afloat and making some kind of progress. 

But now I have no motivation to do anything and I cry all the time, Iâ€™ve had more panic attacks this month than Iâ€™ve had in years, I feel like Iâ€™m being tortured mentally and everything is so so so impossibly painful
