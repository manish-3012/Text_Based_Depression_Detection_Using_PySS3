So it goesI'll just write, I guess.

I failed at a startup because I didn't work hard enough. I failed at a relationship because I wasn't good enough. I failed at college because I'm lazy. I failed my parents because of all of the above. I failed myself now, as the problems before this compounded and turned into social avoidance and then social anxiety. I left all my online communities. I have no real world friends left. I still live with my parents in spite of having money, because I've been too damn afraid to move out. Too damn afraid to talk to other people. Too damn afraid to live.

Why is a gun less scary than a person? I'm a twisted mutation of a human. I can't live.
