Iâ€™m a ticking time bombThrowaway account. I wrote this to pour out my sadness. I feel so alone while Iâ€™m surrounded by people that love me. Iâ€™m so broken. 


I feel so lonely, not because Iâ€™m alone in this particular moment. I feel alone, in this world. Misunderstood. Forgotten. 

I have two close friends, maybe just one. He recently got into a relationship and Iâ€™m happy but Iâ€™m sad. Iâ€™m sad because all of his attention will be hers. He wonâ€™t be available to hang out with me. He doesnâ€™t reach out as often as he did. He leaves me on read for hours even days. 

I think of dying probably more times than I actually think of surviving life. I think of dying while Iâ€™m cuddling with my boyfriend late at night. I think of dying when Iâ€™m having a good time with friends. I think of dying while I laugh so hard I start crying. I think of dying. 

I feel like thatâ€™s my only way to actually be happy. I love my boyfriend. I love him more than life itself. More than my life. 

I fantasize about killing myself. How would I do it? Would it be effective? Will i survive and live with the guilt and have everybody around me know how broken and fragile I can be and keep a close eye on me that I cannot breath? Will I kill myself after a bad long day at work? After I take my kids to school? After a wonderful date night with my husband?

Iâ€™m broken and sad. I donâ€™t know what to do. I walk around with all these suppressed feelings so I donâ€™t make my mom sad. I have these thoughts in the back of my head as I force myself to get up and go to work every cold morning. I feel this pain in my chest that just keeps growing like a stubborn weed pushing itself through concrete. 

I want to be happy, I donâ€™t like being sad. I canâ€™t help it. 

I think of all the people that will die. I think of all my close friends and family members dying one day. Having to bury every single one and not being able to take it. Every death chisels a piece of my broken wall. Tearing it down piece by piece until I disappear and become an empty shell. 

I need help

I canâ€™t get help because only crazy people get help and Iâ€™m not crazy. I donâ€™t need someone to tell me how to live my life or what to think. I pave my own path but I donâ€™t know how to pave. I donâ€™t know how to paint a pretty picture or how to craft. 

Iâ€™m a ticking time bomb. My hands are the matches and my brain the fuse. I want to light it so I donâ€™t have to think or ever feel sad again. 

I think of dying.
