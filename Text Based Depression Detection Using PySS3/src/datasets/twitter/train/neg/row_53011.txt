Can I get in trouble for talking about my thoughts of suicide to others ?If I try to talk to someone about my thoughts/plans of suicide can they turn around and get me forcefully checked into to a mental facility ? I have enough medical bill debt as it is and I have some serious shit on my mind but I'm afraid to talk to anyone in my life about it because I don't want them to get me put somewhere.
