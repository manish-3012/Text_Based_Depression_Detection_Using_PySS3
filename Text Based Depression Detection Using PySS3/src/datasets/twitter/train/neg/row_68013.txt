Lying down waiting to dieThe last 4 days I have felt the worst I've felt in a long time. I keep having large chunks of time where the only thing I  think is I wish I could die. My depression has me so low that I don't think I am a person worth existing. 

Last night I was trying to keep busy by putting together a large exercise machine I purchased. I am pretty good at putting things together, so I thought it would be a good distraction. When I reached a point of frustration I just curled up on the floor and wished to die. I am not actively suicidal, I just wish it was all over.

My husband knows I am depressed but I haven't been able to tell him I am suicidal. He doesn't understand my depression so I just stop trying.
