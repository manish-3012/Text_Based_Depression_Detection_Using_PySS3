Fading in and outMy best friend just decided that she doesn't want to be friends any more, and ever since, I've been fading in and out of a desire to live. We used to talk all the time, and now there's nothing, and it's all my fault. 3 years, best friends, and now nothing. I feel like nothing, like I have nothing, but the ironic this is I have an amazing life. I can't stop thinking about it, and even when I do, and start to feel a slight tinge of not sadness, it just creeps back very soon and even worse. I don't know what to do. Please help
