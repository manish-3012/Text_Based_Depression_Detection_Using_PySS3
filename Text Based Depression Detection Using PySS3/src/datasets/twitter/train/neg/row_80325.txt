It didnt work.I'm so embarrassed. I had to tell my new boss I tried giving up. I got to say and break down like I've been wanting to in front of those closest to me. I felt awful for telling him what I had done and how I can barely move around. None of my friends or family know. Just my new boss and counselor. I don't want to be the miserable friend and bring others down anymore. There is so much pain I dont know what to do with and just want a moments peace. To feel good about myself and feel wanted by others around me. It feels like I'm always holding on to the pain and suffering and just realized... cause it never leaves. It always by my side.
