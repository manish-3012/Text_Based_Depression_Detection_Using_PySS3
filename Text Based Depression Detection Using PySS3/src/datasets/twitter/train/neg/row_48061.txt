No photos allowed? This subreddit is supposed to help.I wanted to share a post of the cuts I just made on my thigh and hoped to get criticism and tell me why I SHOULDN'T do this, but this subreddit is text posts only.. I feel guilty and sick to my stomach. I thought this stupid fucking subreddit was supposed to help, how am I supposed to be judged? How am I supposed to be told not to do this if I can't even show my self-harm? This subreddit is so fucking pointless. This sub is so fucking pointless no one ever gets help here. All of these posts are so similar it's so fucking fake. This is bullshit.
