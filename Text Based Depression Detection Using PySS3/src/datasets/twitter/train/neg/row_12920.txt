Being told to kill yourself...Some anonymous person keeps messaging me to kill myself. They are making fun of me because of my BPD. And now they have told me has been lying to me all along - he doesn't want space, he's gotten rid of me because he's seeing someone. My best friend hates me, I thought space would make things better but it turns out he just hates me. I have no friends. All I have is someone messaging me, telling me to kill myself. No one likes me, my best friend won't talk to me and the only person who does talk to me tells me I'm better off dead. If that's what makes everyone happy...

I tried to make things right. Over a month of being alone, being told no one is interested in being friends with you, and abuse, really gets you down.
