Reported to the police for suicidal thoughts (paranoid)I made a mistake today.  I lashed out at someone online and they said they reported me to the police because I mentioned how suicidal I am.  I'm terrified.  There's so many stigmas and I don't want anyone to know but I'm an idiot.  And I let it out and now I may suffer the consequence and honestly suicide seems like the only way out
