Life really isnâ€™t worth livingI donâ€™t know what to do. I really hate my life and I know itâ€™s not gonna get better. I just want to feel like Iâ€™m worth something but thereâ€™s nothing valuable about me. I just donâ€™t wanna live this life anymore. I use to tell myself itâ€™ll get better but now I tell myself one day Iâ€™ll be free of this life. I have no one. I just really wanna let go.
