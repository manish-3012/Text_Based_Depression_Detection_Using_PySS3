It's my birthday..I posted something over at /r/depression...
But.. It's the end of the day, the only thing I did was sit here, trying to get people to come over.
Nothing.
The one girl who makes me feel okay (I don't rely on her ever) is too lazy to text me back.

Nobody knows the severity of the situation.
Just sitting here with a razorblade and enough pills and alcohol to finish it off..

Why don't I do it?
I hate myself.

Is it possible to obtain a gun while having been admitted into a hospital for depression in California?

Edit: I also have posts in /r/stopselfharm and /r/depression if you care to read more.
