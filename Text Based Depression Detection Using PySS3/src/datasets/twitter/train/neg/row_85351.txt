I fixed everything,and I'm ready to go,I will take those pills soon,wish me good luck suicidal people's.Yes,it's true.im being a kiddo, leaving world by doing overdose on paracetamol.i just brought 75 paracetamol,maybe 41gram. I know this is going to be the worst way to go and painful. But im so broken,I m failed at hanging myself,I'm failed at everything, I wish I get liver failure and die in front of everyone. I don't know how to say Goodbye to everyone,I wrote a lot of suicide notes,I don't know if I should leave a note or not,I don't know I don't know. I just want to go.please help me anyone, anyone tell me how should I say goodbye to everyone,how I'm gonna see my parents blaming me for my foolish act.they just don't care about mental illness.they say some spirit took over control of me and my suicidal thoughts are just nothing.im being attention seeker. This is so frustrating to live here
