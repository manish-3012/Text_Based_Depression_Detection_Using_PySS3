I don't know if this is the right place for this.back story: I was born with a renal disorder that required me to have a kidney transplant when I was nine, and must take an extremely expensive  cocktail of medication daily to prevent rejection.

I should probably say that I'm 20, living with my parents, attending community college and jobless. 

I feel clueless, as if there was some great piece of info or advice that everybody got in highschool and I just missed out on. Everyone I know has a plan for their lives, and I have no idea what I want or where I'm going, I study computer science to appease my father, but I kind of hate it. I understand that if/when I graduate college I'm going to need a job with health benefits to help pay for the meds; but I can't find anything I enjoy studying. As a kid I wanted to be a soldier, like my granddad and two brothers, that was the plan I had; but you can't be a soldier with one functioning kidney. So now I'm aimless.

I've been playing with the idea of taking the meds I have left with me on a road trip. Just get in the car and get out of this hell hole, go somewhere different see something beautiful, and expire.
