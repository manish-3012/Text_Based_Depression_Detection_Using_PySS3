No one would miss meI've struggled on and off with suicidal thoughts since I was 15. Attempted 3 times at 22 and 23.

I'm about to turn 26 now and I've wasted 8 years in a relationship that ended up abusive and I had to leave, now my family just seems annoyed with me all the time and I'm incredibly lonely.

I have a few close friends I met over the internet but no one in real life. I'm pretty sure at this point if I killed myself people would just be relieved.
