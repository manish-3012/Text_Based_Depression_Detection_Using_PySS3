I donâ€™t see the point anymore, please helpLife is starting to drag, and I donâ€™t see the point. Iâ€™m so bored all the time, and I only feel alive when Iâ€™m with my gf. She is the only thing that keeps me sane and keeps me feeling alive. The problem is that I can only see her an hour a day and none at all on weekends. Me and her are both under 18 so her parents control her very strictly. Next year Iâ€™m going to be going to a different school, so I wonâ€™t be able to see her even at school. So why not just end it all? If I kill myself, I wonâ€™t feel bad anymore. I mean I just love her so much, Iâ€™m in constant pain when Iâ€™m not with her. I have a loving family, but I think they would be better without me. No one ever has any answers to how I could help myself feel better. So please just help me
