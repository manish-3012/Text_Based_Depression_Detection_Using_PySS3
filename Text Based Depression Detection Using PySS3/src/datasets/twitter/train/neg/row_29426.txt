I always end up here sooner or laterNo matter how many times I feel like I can do better I always end up here. I have so many things in my mind i don't even know where to start. I still have assignments to finish. I hate that I share a room can't even fucking cry anymore. I hate the world, I hate me, I hate everything. I hate how others are so selfish and I see the same selfishness in me. I hate how disgusting the world is and how I'm similar. I hate how I can't reach for help. I hate I'm so picky. I hate how there's no stability in my life. I hate how I complain. I hate me so much. I hate it all. I wish I could have ended it all. I wouldn't mind upsetting anyone. I just think that all the stuff I have should be donated/recycled I feel like it would be a waste to have them just thrown away. I would have given all my stuff away/sold them if I could do it unnoticed. I really wish I could just end it all. Please why did my parents bring me into such a fucking hell. I know people are supposed to be grateful about that but it seems selfish to want to have a child in such a horrid world and then deny them of their feelings and just say that everything is a phase. Well I wish my life was only phase in yours. I want to die. I mean you are right if I really wanted to kill myself I would have done it. You are right. I'm just too much of a coward to stand up to hang myself or to keep on living. You're so right that I hate you too and the child u gave birth to. I fucking hate everything. Someone please run me over. I can't wait anymore. I. Just. Want. It. To. End. Please hear my prayers please kill me soon. Or I might as well just go in a selfish manner. I'm happy there's a bridge near me.
