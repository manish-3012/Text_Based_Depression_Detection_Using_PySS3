Need an adviceSo I will keep it short.
A little more than a year ago I had a plastic surgery. It wasn't for vain reasons, I am a trans woman and I felt dysphoric about my forehead. And I decided to have a rhinoplasty also because everyone was saying if my forehead will be reduced, my nose will appear bigger.
It's not the problem that I am trans, I had dealt with that. The problem is that the surgery was botched, the surgeon left me practically with no tip of the nose, curved forehead, damaged my hairline and left bad scars on my scalp. Since I had that surgery my life became hell, I tried to kill myself many times but couldn't, I was hospitalized, I am chronically suicidal. 
I don't like how I look, I could be pretty if he didn't botch my face, I can see it. At least I want to look normal.
Maybe it's not that noticable but it makes me feel very ugly, unwanted and unlovable. I dreamt about love as my real self but I can't put myself out there because I have no self esteem. I am extremely lonely and sexually frustrated. I don't value life without intimacy, it's so depressing to think that I have to be alone it at best used for unsatisfactory sex and discarded.
I need to feel attractive and wanted like every other woman.
I don't know what to do. It's crushing my soul every day with the same wave of despair and pain.
What should I do?
