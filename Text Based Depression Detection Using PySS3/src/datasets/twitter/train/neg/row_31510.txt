I donâ€™t know what else I can do anymoreIâ€™ve been living with my mental health for about 7 years (official diagnosis)  but I think much longer than that. Iâ€™m in my mid 20â€™s and this year has been awful. Iâ€™ve gone from moving in with my boyfriend to us recently breaking up. Everything I had hoped for, a place to call a home, a loving partner, has been taken from me. Iâ€™ve cried everyday for the passed three weeks and I canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™m waiting on referrals from my gp to more specialised people. But itâ€™s taking so long. 
If I could, I would take time off of work and spend some time in an inpatient retreat type. But quite simply, I just donâ€™t have the money to do that. 

Iâ€™m at a loss, my medication doesnâ€™t seem to be doing anything and I thought my local A&amp;E could look into other medications but apparently not. 

I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m lost. And Iâ€™m getting closer to not being able to carry on. I donâ€™t know what more I can do, if anything
