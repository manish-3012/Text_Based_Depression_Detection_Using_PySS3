I want to die and I have no hope, but Iâ€™m scared.Iâ€™m almost done with my degree. Iâ€™m 30,000 dollars in debt with a degree that is almost completely worthless (Biology). Why did I do this to myself? How am I ever going to get a job or pay off my debt? All I can think about is how much I want to die. 

What am I supposed to do? I see my therapist in a few weeks. I do well in my degree but itâ€™s all for nothing. My life feels like itâ€™s already over and Iâ€™m 22.
