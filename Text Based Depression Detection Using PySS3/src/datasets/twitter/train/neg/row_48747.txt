Nobody to talk toI broke up with my first ever boyfriend a few weeks ago and Iâ€™ve been lonely ever since. A lot of my friends have moved away from where I live and I now realize how much of my life had centered around having someone around that I loved and felt had loved me. It wasnâ€™t exactly the best relationship so maybe itâ€™s for the best that weâ€™re not together but being single again is bringing up feelings of inadequacy and general insecurity. I was okay being single before I met him and now I feel like it was all a sick joke and that I should just die. It would have been better to have just been alone. If I didnâ€™t have my dog to take care of, I would have probably killed myself by now. Feeling lost. Just had to share my thoughts.
