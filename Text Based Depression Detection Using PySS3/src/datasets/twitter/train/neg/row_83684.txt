Extorted and DepressedI cant take the messages anymore. Started with pictures of me. then of my family. then of my girlfriend. Demands of thousands or they hurt me and my family. I called the police. then the FBI. no help. Found one of the people doing this. But not the one who said he would send pathogens to my home with pictures of envelopes filled with powder. Im done. Out. I cant take it anymore. all of my energy day in and day out has been to trying to find these people, and frankly I cant take it anymore. I have a gun to my head. if youre magically out there...I hope it was worth it
