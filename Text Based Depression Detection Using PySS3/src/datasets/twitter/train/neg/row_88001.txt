On The Edge and Contemplating DeathI want to cry, but I just can't thanks to my depression. I want to find enjoyment and distractions in the things I used to do before, but it all seems hollow and empty. I'm facing the howling void, perched on the precipice of oblivion, and I'm considering taking that final step and hoping something better -- or at least nothingness if anything else -- awaits beyond this life.

A quick rundown: I'm getting divorced, my wife of six years is leaving me. I have severe depression and anxiety. I have a young son who I barely see thanks to this, only once a week for a few hours at a time. I had a mental breakdown when she told me she was going to leave me and got hospitalized. She wants nothing to do with me. My soulmate is gone. Worse, all of this is my fault. All of it.

I'm lonely, I'm scared, I'm exhausted, I'm sad, I'm nervous, I'm lost, and I'm ashamed. I could have fixed this but I failed, and now I've lost it all. I'm subconsciously seeking death, I think -- not caring for myself, eating badly, drowning in my own sorrow. I just wonder if it wouldn't be more prudent to just end it, rather than hope I die in my sleep from an aneurysm or get hit by a massive truck while driving.
