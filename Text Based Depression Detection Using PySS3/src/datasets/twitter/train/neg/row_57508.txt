Everyone hates meI hate being so emotional. i love so hard. i bought new razors and have been drinking a lot more lately and going out hoping someone hurts me. Iâ€™m so alone. always. iâ€™m hard to be around. iâ€™ve attempted twice and i know i could do it this time. i just need one more push to do it. anything. i feel like itâ€™ll happen soon
