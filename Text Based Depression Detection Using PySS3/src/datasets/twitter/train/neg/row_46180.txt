Needing something to make me stay and not give up.Iâ€™ve been suicidal for so long now. Been cutting since 8th grade, already went through hospitalization, PHP, IOP, rehab. Nothing works, no medication seems to help my depression. I love to destroy myself and the things I do. I hurt everyone I let get close to me because Iâ€™m a selfish fuck. I just have been making plans and thinking about how much I donâ€™t care anymore. Iâ€™m just done with life, I suck at it anyways. My boyfriend hid his gun, all the knives, and my pills. Iâ€™m about to just drive my car into a tree but I donâ€™t think that will do it. I just feel bad to be this selfish and leave my family with all this bullshit to deal with. Idk. I just want to be with my dad. I canâ€™t think anymore
