Things only get worse and I just canâ€™t handle this anymore.I didnâ€™t have a good childhood, even worse teen years, and now when im bordering adulthood everything seems to be crumbling down, I got a degree that I figured out way too late that I fucking hate, my family is in so much financial trouble right now that we donâ€™t know if we will be able to pay the bills next month, I have no real friends, my dreams are impossible and to boot my countryâ€™s economy is in fucking shambles because of the pandemic, Iâ€™ve been looking for a job since February because I needed the credits for university anyways, got ghosted multiple times, didnâ€™t even manage to land an interview.

For context Im on the Autism spectrum, and my country does not treat neuroatypical people very well, Iâ€™ve been shoved around and mistreated my whole life, and its easier when youâ€™re a kid, living as an ASD adult here is a fucking nightmare, I get told to â€œshut upâ€ and â€œgrow upâ€ constantly, I feel like I genuinely have no place in this society, to make matters worse I will probably have to stop seeing my therapist due to lack of money, we are cancelling our insurance this month.

I have nothing to look up to, the future just looks bleaker and worse, I think not living is better than living this terrible and cruel life.

I tried so hard to hold on the little things,  but as Iâ€™ve gotten older and responsabilities pile up its too much for me to handle, I break down crying every week, life has completely lost its joy and I donâ€™t think I can ever regain it in my situation, I feel like dying is the better option that I have.
