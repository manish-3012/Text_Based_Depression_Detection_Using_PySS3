I CARE SO MUCH WHAT PEOPLE THINKJust once I want to have a day where I'm not **FREAKING OUT** whenever I talk to another person, where my emotions don't factor into anything, and I can finally, **FINALLY** enjoy my fucking life for just **ONE** day, that's all I need! One day where I can gather my thoughts and be Anxiety-free, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?? Please please stop talking to me, everybody, stop talking to me, I can't handle this fucking shit
