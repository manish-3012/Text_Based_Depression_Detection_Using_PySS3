Thrown out of school. Lost.I'm 19, and in my third year of Sixth Form/High School, in the UK. I've failed academically, and as a result of this I'm being asked to leave school. 

My friends are all at University training to be doctors, lawyers and businessmen, and I've allowed myself to get left behind. Both my parents went to University. I have no idea what to do. Contemplating just leaving.
