An instant away...I was supposed to have a date night with my girlfriend; see latest StarnWars, dinner, go home and smoke, whatev's, etc... (Originally, we were going to see The Shape of Water, but release dats are off some, it's limited). 

She had a bit of a panic attack two thirds through the movie, these things happen. I was a little upset, but oh well. We get home and she decided she wanted to cook some food... I definitely do most of the cooking, so I jumped in a moment. This upset her and we had a bit of a collective breakdown (couple of gay ass lesbians here). And we each had our moments. She cleared up and went to the bathroom.

I've had issues where I hear voices and/or lose myself altogether. We've discussed this. We both have our own issues. But I had a pretty bad episode where I was talking to nobody and she was scared and literally ran down the street (about three blocks) to a co-worker's house and brought her over. When I came to, I was unaware of where she was and panicked.

My knives are so dull, I didn't get any further than carving a Jackson Pollock on my arm. My GF and co-worker bursted in the door as I was around cut 15-20 (honestly don't know).

The booming sounds were what saved me. No, embarrassment is what saved me. We all talked, co-worker went home, and now my GF is in my bed, passed out, and I still have the urge to keep going... I won't. But the urge is still there.

Long story short, I just needed to be verbal about this. And I still need to go visit family for the holidays tomorrow. Aaaaaaagh. I just need help as to how to help her when she wakes up. I'm broken enough, I don't want her to feel any guilt for this.
