it is what it isim upset all the time, don't even know how to put into words why I'm upset all the time so I dont talk to anyone about it. for a couple months I was doing better and now I'm right back to where I was. its been 2 years since I last tried to kms and I'm real close to just doing it. i don't matter to anyone. I have disordered eating and have for years and I'm still fat. I'm ugly. I'm generally not likrable because I'm quiet and sad. I have no motivation. what's the point
