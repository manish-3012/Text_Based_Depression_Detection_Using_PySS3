First good cry in a while.I just cried in my bathroom because I can't except when people don't need me anymore and when they change. I get upset when I can't explain how I'm feeling and I made them mad because of what I was saying. I hate when people change. Especially this person. Even if there family I still hate that they focus on someone else other then me. I'm alone other then them. It helps me get threw my shitty and intrusive thoughts when they are with me. But it's not like they even know that. Or fucking care.
But in reality maybe it's better if they don't give a shit about me. No one will come looking for me when I fucking kill myself.
