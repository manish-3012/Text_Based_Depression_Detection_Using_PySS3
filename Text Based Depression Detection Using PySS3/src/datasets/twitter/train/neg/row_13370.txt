Is there ever going to be a light at the end of the tunnel?Usually things in my life arenâ€™t that great. Recently though I feel like there arenâ€™t even parts of my days that are bearable. I donâ€™t know why I feel like this. I hear so many things like donâ€™t give up better days come or thereâ€™s always a light at the end of the tunnel but is that just bullshit? Because I see no light. For as long as I can remember Iâ€™ve been unhappy and I just for once want to feel happy. I want to end it I really do but Iâ€™m too scared and there is one thing that holds me back entirely but I donâ€™t want to discuss that. Just please someone tell me is life even worth living or is it really gonna be a never ending tunnel with no light at the end?
