Any Last Words? I've got a few:I feel depressed
So empty inside
From these feelings
I cannot hide

I feel such strife
So much unrest
I can honestly say
Iâ€™ve done my best

Now Iâ€™ve struck gold
The blood so bold
Onto this blade
I dearly hold

As life leaves me
I must beseech thee
Will you come
Come and meet me

Will you take me
Take me far away
These the only words
Iâ€™ve left to say

Take me take me
Oh dear God
For Iâ€™m no longer able
To hold this faÃ§ade

Whether thereâ€™s a God
Whether thereâ€™s not
It doesnâ€™t matter
So many sins Iâ€™ve got

Too many to count
Too much to forgive
It doesnâ€™t matter
I donâ€™t want to live

Death will be easy
Much more so than life
When I can finally end
This pointless strife

As I prepare
For the end
This blade here
My only friend

Thank you for getting me
Through so much
Now all I ask
Is for one last touch

Now cut deep
Strike blood rich
Leave no room
For a single stitch
