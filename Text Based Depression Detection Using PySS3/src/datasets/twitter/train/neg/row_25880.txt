Birthday painToday, May 24th, is my birthday. I'm turning 16 today and none of my friends remembered my birthday. After having a shitty day of finals at school I go home alone and play video games. I break down and cry, and realize I don't want to exist at all anymore. Live is a repetitive struggle of me gasping for the air of happiness, even though I will never reach the surface. I just feel so alone in this world.
