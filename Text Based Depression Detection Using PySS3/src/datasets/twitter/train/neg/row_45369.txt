GoodbyeTonight, I drive until my 300 mile full tank runs out. Wherever the car stops is where I'll end my life. No one knows, not the people I love, my family, friends. Anyone. Except all of you. And you don't even know who I am. I'm not trying out to be saved. I just want someone to know I'm doing it someone who can't stop me.
