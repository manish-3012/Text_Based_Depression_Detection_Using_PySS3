Iâ€™m aloneIâ€™ve already posted to this subreddit before but I guess this my way of dumping all of feelings. 

When Iâ€™m asked where are you from I have no answer most of the time. Do I say where I was born? Where I was raised? Where I currently live? I just get flustered and say the first city (Iâ€™ve lived in) that comes to mind. This causes me to have trouble getting close to people because everything is temporary for me. I guess having no real place to call home really got to me because I tried to kill myself a few months ago. Which made me have to relocate again, but a part of me couldnâ€™t handle anymore awkward introductions and small talk. So I stopped going to school. So now Iâ€™m in a new place with no one to connect to. Whenever I bring this up in therapy Iâ€™m reminded that I did this to myself by dropping out of school. Making friends is so hard for me and keeping them is equally as difficult. I guess some people were meant to be alone.
