Wanting to be dead but just not having the courage to commit suicide.How do you do this? I just don't have the balls for it. Tho I am so tired that if I could just off myself with a button I would do it on a heartbeat. 

I guess no one who was successful in this endeavor obviously can be here to tell the tale, but how are you other folks coping with this dilemma?
