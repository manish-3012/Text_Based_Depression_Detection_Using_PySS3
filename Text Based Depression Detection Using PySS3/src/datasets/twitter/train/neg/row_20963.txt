I don't fit in in every way, what's the point?With everything going on in the world, what's the point to my life? I don't belong anymore and never really did.

 I feel like I'm the wrong race, the wrong gender ( it doesn't exist??), The wrong age, the wrong face. I'm afraid to think honestly and be genuine because if it's not the "right" thing I'll be called "cancelled", which to me is "kill yourself."

Im in the arts and have surpassed the age of the new kids coming up. I'm not trendy, part of an organization, im afraid of who I am and what I feel and all I've ever wanted to do since I was an angsy lonely artist was get to be myself. And with age, I'm further and more afraid than ever before.
