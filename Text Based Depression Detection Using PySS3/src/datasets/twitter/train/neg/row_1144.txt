I feel like every road leads to suicide for meI'm 27M. 
I was a moron. I went to college and got a degree in a useless subject and I've only earned a mountain of debt from it. I had that wake up call conservatives talk about where I realized that none of my interests will ever lead to a paycheck because they are useless in the business world. I decided not to go to grad school and just worked in gas stations and offices. 

I've spent a lot of time trying the self improvement thing and even anti depressants. I always find myself alone and hating every moment I'm at work. I've been fired once and quit two other jobs in the past year with no notice. I'm subject to being addicted to things like books and video games to escape from reality.

I don't know if there's a lack of people I can relate to on this earth or if I'm just autistic or have something else wrong with me. I can imagine the sort of people I'd want to hang out with and they don't really exist anywhere I've looked. I settle for what I can get and find people who I find grating in some way, who never want to leave me alone. I'm an asshole, and I should just kill myself. I feel like it's something that's bound to happen, because I can't take even five more years of this life, much less 50.
