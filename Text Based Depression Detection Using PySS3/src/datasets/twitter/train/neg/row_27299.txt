I'm currently sitting in my car on a mountain trying to talk myself out of jumping off the tower.I've had enough of this life. I have set a date to end it but I feel it's too far away and pointless. 25 years is enough time to endure the suffering and I'm half ready to do it. The only things stopping me are my kids. And I'm scared that I'll survive and be even more of a burden.
