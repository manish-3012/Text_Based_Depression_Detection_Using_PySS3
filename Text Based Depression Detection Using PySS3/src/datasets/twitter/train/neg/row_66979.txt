Advice on talking to people about suicidal feelings?Hey yâ€™all, I recently told my teacher about my suicidal thoughts and he said I can talk to him anytime. The problem is Iâ€™m like really, really awkward and I donâ€™t know how to? I know it seems stupid but like Iâ€™m terrible at socializing and opening up. Any advice?
