iâ€™m ranting srryoh and you. you just make it so easy. i can be myself around you i can do whatever i want when iâ€™m with you. i donâ€™t need anything when iâ€™m with you. you make me feel whole. literally i donâ€™t want to fucking kill myself when iâ€™m with you and pretty fucking much only you. i donâ€™t want anything els when iâ€™m with you. but you donâ€™t deserve that. youâ€™re driven strong you donâ€™t let anything stop you not even yourself. it seems easy for you. i feel like shit compared to you. i feel like i hold you back. you can do so much without me. i mean imagine you doing the amazing things and i just see me there fucking nervous and having a fucking anxiety attack. when we go out youâ€™re so full of life you always know what to say. i feel like i just stand there searching for the right way to act trying not to let my fear and depression show. i donâ€™t want to make you look bad. and iâ€™m trying to tell the truth right now iâ€™m over beating around the bush convincing myself all of this isnâ€™t true. trying to be more confident which i have been doing and honestly itâ€™s been working i do feel a lot more confidence, on the outside. i know im beautiful now i reached that. but on the inside  i still donâ€™t feel like iâ€™m enough. i feel like iâ€™m not doing enough.  no one really knows how insecure i am about my life. how fucking ashamed i feel about myself. and itâ€™s a different kind of shame that you wouldnâ€™t want to tell ANYONE. i donâ€™t want people to know that iâ€™m scared to be rejected i donâ€™t want people to know that i wish i had better things and lived in a nicer place and had more options and had more courage. you canâ€™t tell people that because theyâ€™d think youâ€™re just weak and should just fucking get over it. no one literally literally i stg i canâ€™t stress this enough no one understands. no one that i know. and when you tell them well they never help even if they care. not really. so why the fuck would i express this to you. of corse iâ€™m terrified TERRIFIED of the worse which is if i express this to you youâ€™d just say i need to figure it out and leave my life. and thatâ€™s scary because when iâ€™m stuck i think of if all the wonderful things we could do together. i think well i can figure it out. i can learn to be whole and feel peace and confident in every way and be truest happy because you will be there and the end of it all. iâ€™m literally holding on right now because i know youâ€™re staying. and if i complexly myself i get the grand prize which is happiness with you. the literal thought of going out and not feeling like a hidden piece of shit plus being with you is GOLDEN. if i can accomplish that that would be literal gold. to thrive with you.
