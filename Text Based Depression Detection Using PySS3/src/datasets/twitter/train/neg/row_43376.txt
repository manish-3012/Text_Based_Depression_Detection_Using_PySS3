At a really low point and scared as hell...This is my first post here, but I feel it won't be my last. Or maybe it will. I don't know. 

Long story short, the only girl I've ever loved and my bestfriend who kept giving me hope that she'd leave her boyfriend for me just told me "Forget about me. I'm staying with him. You mess with my mind." 

All I've ever been was good, nice, and there for her. She's pretty much my whole world.

And now it's crashing down on me. I've been really depressed lately and suicide has flashed through my mind, but this is the first time I've really concidered it.

I've always felt that suicide was the chickens way out, that I could tough it out and make it through this.
Now I'm not so sure.

I'm terrified and unsure what to do. 
Any advice? Help? Anything? I'm going crazy here.

Thank you in advance, anyone who helps.
