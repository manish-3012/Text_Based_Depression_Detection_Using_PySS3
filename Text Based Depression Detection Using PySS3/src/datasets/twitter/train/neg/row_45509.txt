I thought shit was fixed, but its worseEverything was fucked I lost my fiance. I was eating percocet like they were gonna stop making them. I was going to kill myself, but she texted me. We met up. I told her I needed her. We kissed. She hugged me. We called each other for a few nights. She called me crying. She told me she loved me and wanted me back, but everything was fucked up. We met up. She told me everything. She had gotten a new boyfriend in the 7months we were broken up. She said she thought I hated her. He just moved into her house, and she fucking co signed for the motherfucker's new truck. I told her I'd be patient with her. She said she would break up with him, but needed time. That night I went home okay. 

All night I kept thinking about him touching her, fucking her, living in her house with my cats and watching my motherfucking TV. So I went outside and I texted her about how fucked up I was. I waited 20minutes. Then I put a pistol to my head. Her text came through as I was squeezing the trigger like a fucking movie. I can't tell her because that won't help anything. Tonight I broke a week long sobriety streak after a 2 month taper. I'm so fucked up over this. Part of me wants to drive to her house and drag this motherfucker into the street and forcefully expel him from our lives, but the other half of me wants to drive my motorcycle into on coming traffic. 

I've been dealing with these suicidal impulses and racing thoughts since I was 12. I've never asked for help from anyone but her. The last time I asked her for help she told me she would never leave me, and then broke up with me a week later. Now here we are and I need her the most and I can barely reach her. I can't tell my family. I can't go to anyone. What can I do?! Don't tell me to excise her. I can't do that. I CAN'T DO THAT. I WON'T DO THAT.
