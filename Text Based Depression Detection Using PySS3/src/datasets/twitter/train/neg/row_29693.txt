Done on TuesdayMolested as a kid leading to a variety of issues . And you know what? I donâ€™t care anymore. Iâ€™m done trying, Iâ€™m admitting defeat, itâ€™s just not fucking worth it anymore. Every time I think things are either looking up, or are semi decent life just screws me and I just canâ€™t bring myself to care anymore.

So fuck it, who cares anymore. Lifeâ€™s always found one way or another to fuck me and that trend wonâ€™t end anytime soon so why bother anymore. I think Iâ€™ll do it Tuesday night, seems like enough time to get my affairs in order. first Iâ€™ll try and become the first person to OD on pot but if that doesnâ€™t work Iâ€™ll just stab myself.
