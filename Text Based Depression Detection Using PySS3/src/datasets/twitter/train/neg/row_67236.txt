suicidal ideation at nighttime + mood swingsrecently especially because of quarantine iâ€™ve been struggling to fall asleep, and iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts every night and theyâ€™re scaring me. i donâ€™t like to think about death but a part of me really craves it for some reason and i donâ€™t know why. i have a nice group of friends and a great boyfriend and a promising future ahead of me... but somehow i canâ€™t let go of those thoughts. whatâ€™s most annoying is i could wake up one morning and feel really happy to the point where iâ€™m energetic, then seemingly randomly i fall back into a hopeless/sad state of mind and become suicidal again. the mood swings are exhausting, and iâ€™m thinking maybe itâ€™s because i canâ€™t see my therapist in person that itâ€™s getting worse. i just want to feel happy for more than a few consecutive days but somehow i always fall back into thinking about suicide. thanks for reading everyone, itâ€™s my first post on here :)
