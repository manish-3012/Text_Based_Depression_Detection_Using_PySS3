July 25th.Is when I will hopefully have the stones to take my own life.

I have found that through a multitude of therapy and psychiatic help being ultimately useless and there being no form of support from anyone I know, I've found myself at a point I originally always thought I could keep at bay.

I've been able to unzip the darkness time and time again, but now the zipper is jammed.  It will not move, and my eyes are flooded with black.  My willpower has been broken.

Those around me recite words of worry, of concern.  They tell me to think about those around me, but what about myself?  What about thinking about myself? Am I here only for them? For their peace of mind?  For my support when THEY are in trouble?

Emotion has become null, nonexistent.  I feel adrift a sheet of thoughts and memories that no longer tickle or comfort my skin.  I am numb.  My own heartbeat infuriates me, because I only maintain my existence for others.

Stop beating.  Please stop beating.  Please stop beating. Just stop, I hear you pumping away everlasting life through my body on repeat, and I want the cycle to end already.  Just stop.  Please God stop.
