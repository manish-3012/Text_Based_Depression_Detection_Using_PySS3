i'm a wastei dont know why i even bother. i hardly have the energy anymore to do much but when i do, what i get accomplished is never enough. im doing really bad in pretty much all of my classes and at this rate im willing to sabotage myself for the rest of the semester so i get dismissed, and the worst part is that i honestly feel like this would make me happier

i dont want to do this anymore. i dont want to be here anymore
