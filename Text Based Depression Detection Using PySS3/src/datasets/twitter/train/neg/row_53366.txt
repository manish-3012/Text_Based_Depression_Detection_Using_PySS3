I don't know what else to doI live with my ex still because I can't afford a place of my own. I split up with him in October because I've been feeling increasingly sure of wanting to die over the last couple years, the last 6 months especially, and I think maybe I need some time to be single and ground myself. I'm messy, (mostly) financially non contributing, and bipolar, so I know I'm not easy to live with. The only place I could go with my dog is my grammas house 60 miles away from my work and school. That situation would be very bad too. 


Anyway He just woke me up to tell me that the place is a mess, and he would never live like this if it wasn't for me. It's not filthy, it's just not tidy. But we started talking about why we're separated and I said I needed space to grow up a little and he said"you're never going to change. I've already given you space." when I said that I just couldn't spend 14 out of every 28 days actively contemplating suicide anymore and I need to try anything to stop it, and that I still love him and I don't want to burn our bridges he said "Im depressed too and I think about it every single day. I'm too depressed to even do anything about the squalor we live in", and "you're never going to get rid of this feeling, it will follow you everywhere". 


It will. I've never been able to support myself. I want to die. I just wish I could have an apartment and pay my own bills, but even when I have enough money I can never do it. I don't get to make it to the next round. I just want to stop being a drain on everyone and everything around me. It would be so easy. He could keep taking care of my dog. My family all have a good support network, they would be fine. My friends have all been through this with other people, they would be fine. I wouldn't be a problem anymore and it sounds so nice. I don't have any good reason not to do it now, really.
