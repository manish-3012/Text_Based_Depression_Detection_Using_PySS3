Will it ever?????I donno if I'm suicidal. I mean, I thought about it in the past, but, I don't know if I have since years ago. I just have questions:
1. Why is it a crime? Yet people who die naturally are not seen as criminals?
2. Why do we say "commit" instead of take his/her own life
3. Why do we always say it's going to be okay, that things get better. Do they ever?
4. We keep telling people to do for others acts if kindness. How do these even help
5. Is it a disease or a symptom of a disease?
6. Why is it so hard to talk about it but easy to talk about death by accident?
7. If you lost someone to suicide, how do you feel?
