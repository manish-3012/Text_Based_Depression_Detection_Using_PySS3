I feel like a burdenI have psychosis and severe depression. I live with my mother and my grandparents. My grandmother calls me a stupid attention seeker because I self harm. Today I feel at the end of my tether and I don't feel as if I can cope anymore. I just can't help but wish myself 6 feet under. I'm so done.
