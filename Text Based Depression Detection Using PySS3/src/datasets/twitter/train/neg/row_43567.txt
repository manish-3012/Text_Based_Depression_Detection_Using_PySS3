this week was the first time I have felt suicidal in 6 years. and I dont know if I can survive againso as the title says, six years ago i was in a very bad place and attempted suicide twice. I was put into a 'stress center' and taught coping skills for my depression/anxiety. and over the past few years i have actually grown to really love myself and enjoy where i am going in life. 
But then this week happened. I cant even tell you what it is, but for some reason every night around 8 pm i get cripplingly depressed. usually when i wake up in the morning i feel better and it doesnt come back until later, but i woke up feeling exactly how i did last night. I can feel my mind and body change, its like everything positive is just robbed from me; and i cant find the motivation to move, but if i could it would be to end it all. And it only makes it worse that the only thing stopping me is that i have to be at work in a few hours and i dont want to make anyone mad. I feel like i shouldnt want to kill myself for reasons involving good things about myself, not outer stimuli. it scares me that im convincing myself to stay alive for things outside of me. I should want to stay alive for reasons involving me, not others peoples feeling/situations that i may be involved in. I just feel so lost, and alone. And i AM alone. I work around 9 hours every day and have two friends locally that i could actually hang out with; but i now have no car. 
has anyone felt similar to this and what did you do to help? i forgot what this pain feels like and im really scaring myself. i dont want to go back down that road because i know i shouldnt, but i feel myself slipping, fast
