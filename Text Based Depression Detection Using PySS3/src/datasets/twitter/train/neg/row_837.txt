Today is my 20th birthday.Everyone in my life hates me. My dad felt annoyed when I reminded him, my sister will spend today elsewhere. Iâ€™m sick with what could possibly be covid, none of my old friends will text me because we fought and they rightfully hate me. I just wanted my own special day. Iâ€™m really a grown woman now. Theoretically. 

I was waiting for today though. Finally I have nothing to look forward to lmao.
