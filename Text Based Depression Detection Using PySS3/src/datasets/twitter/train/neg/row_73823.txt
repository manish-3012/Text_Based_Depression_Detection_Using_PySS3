People just pretend to carethey listen to you, give you false hope and at the end just suggest therapy. 

I just want these thoughts to stop. I'm scared i might give in one day. 

I cant find happiness in anything that I do. im not motivated to do anything. 

i cant find a reason to believe that life will get better

it will only get worse, im sure of it

if i can make it seem like an accident, hopefully my parents would forget me sooner
