I'm tired of fighting for something I can't win.The insurance had cut my medication and there's no way we can afford it now. So lately, I've been focusing on how I can get through my illness. Truth is, no matter how much I've tried to hold it all in and focus of different things, I can't. I can't do it like I thought I could. I feel so selfish because I know my mom loves me so much. She has gone through so many things for me and bought me school clothes the other day. But she has wasted so much time and money into me. And I'm so sorry. I'm sorry to everyone. I have wasted your time and your energy. I tried so hard to get better and it doesn't work.
