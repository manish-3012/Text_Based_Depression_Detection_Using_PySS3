I am tired of survivingI don't feel like I have really lived this year. I've just survived. When my husband lost his job, we survived. When my baby didn't have a heartbeat anymore, we just survived. When my FIL got diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, we survived. It's all we have done.

But now, my due date is a month away. And I don't think I can survive anymore. I really don't. Everyday, it hurts. I should be getting ready for being a mom and instead, I'm laying in bed imagining ways to hurt myself. I have to see my friends get ready to have their babies and hate that it's not me.

 I just can't any more. I hate not being pregnant. I hate not being a mom. I hate that my baby is dead. I hate that my body failed me.

And I hate that I have to be strong. My husband is watching his farther die. I can't give him more to worry about. So I haven't said anything to him about this.

 I haven't told me that I've relapsed back into my eating disorder. It's so bad. My throat aches, my voice is going out, my chest hurts. But I can't stop purging. I know it's killing me and I can't stop.

And I want to self harm. I can't because it would kill my husband, but I want to just carve out all the bad stuff. I just want to die. I want to stop hurting so much all the time. I want to stop surviving. 

He's gone this week and I am so close to just ending it. I'm not living anymore. I'm just surviving. What's the point? I hate myself for even considering it, but this isn't a life.
