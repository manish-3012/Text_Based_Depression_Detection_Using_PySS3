I think itâ€™s time... Iâ€™m tired.Like everyone else, the idea of the world slowing down wasnâ€™t horrible. Now the years coming to an end  and Iâ€™m just feeling more and more depressed than usual. At the beginning of quarantine i was on my anti depressants and something else for my anxiety. After one missed appointment my psychiatrist dropped me. Since June Iâ€™ve been off my medication and back to smoking weed. But since I got laid off and started going back to school itâ€™s not really something I can support. Thereâ€™s only 4 psychiatrist that accept my insurance and theyâ€™re all booked till March. Iâ€™ve lost 20 pounds, my grades are suffering, and I have no one to talk to aside from my therapist. I have no friends, my half siblings are teenagers, and I just feel really alone. Iâ€™m at the point where I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever get better. Dying feels scarier but easier than all of this. When I drive I often thinking of just swerving my car off a bridge or somewhere high up so I know the impact will kill me.
