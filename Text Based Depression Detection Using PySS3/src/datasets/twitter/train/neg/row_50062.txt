Suicide may not be your solution, you may not agree with it as a solution, but it is MY solution.All people can give me are their reasons to continue living. All they can give me are their reasons for why they disagree with suicide. 

"Suicide is a permanent blah blah blah." Okay, you feel that way, and that's nice. But I find it a valid solution and your bare-minimum effort and platitudes mean nothing to what feels like EONS of suffering. It is MY solution, and after years of thinking on it, it's a sound one indeed. 

A perfectly reasonable reaction to the intolerance of life and the human race.
