Why do people always say they care when they really donâ€™t?Humans are selfish as a species, no one truly cares about anyone but themselves. It frustrates me when people tell you they care then proceed to not care. Telling me you care doesnâ€™t mean anything if your actions show otherwise. Itâ€™s like regret is stronger than gratitude so people only care out of regret when youâ€™re not there. Iâ€™ve always been there for people, even in the most inconvenient of times because thatâ€™s what caringâ€™s about. But no one is ever there for me. Iâ€™m both alone and lonely. All I want is one friend, one person who genuinely cares about me.
