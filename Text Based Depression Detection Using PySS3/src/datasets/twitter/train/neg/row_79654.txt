Dear broken strangers, your voices are heard and your existence matters. They say the beauty of life is in its simplicity, so what are the simple things in life that make you smile/look forward to another tomorrow?Dear broken strangers,  I just want to say that your voices are heard and your existence matters. Please do not give up on life... Like you, Iâ€™ve had my fair share of despair and days where I truly wanted to give up. I am learning to find hope in the simple things in life and I would like to invite you to do the same... a favorite song being played on the radio, a rerun of your favorite show, the taste of your favorite meal, the smell of coffee first thing in the morning, the smell of earth after rain, an early morning stride in nature, past midnight sky-gazing, a warm cup of hot chocolate next to a fire in winter, a clean bed sheet, an evening walk by the sea, the sparkle in a puppyâ€™s eyes, the pure laughter of children, the smile of a loved one, the kindness of a stranger, an unexpected message/text from a long-time friend, late night conversations, an unexpected love....possibilities...yes the possibility of a better tomorrow.

For those who have forgotten (including myself): You are worthy of love and life...Just stay for you.
