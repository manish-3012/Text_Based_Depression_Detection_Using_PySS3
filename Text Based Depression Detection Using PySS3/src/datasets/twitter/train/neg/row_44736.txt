Every year gets better, but every year gets worseItâ€™s torture. I can see the light, the promise of something new, independence. But my heart knows that itâ€™ll be more of the same for me afterwards: Iâ€™ll work hard for little pay, fail to interact with others, never get my dream job, and forever be stomped all over by my superiors, for no other reason than the stain on existence that is the human race.

And I DONT KNOW WHY I FEEL THIS WAY. I have plenty to be objectively happy about but I canâ€™t stop concentrating on the hole inside me, getting bigger and bigger as I realize Iâ€™m destined to never graduate, Iâ€™m destined to stay in my garbage blue-collar hometown building trains or some bullshit unless I kill myself.
