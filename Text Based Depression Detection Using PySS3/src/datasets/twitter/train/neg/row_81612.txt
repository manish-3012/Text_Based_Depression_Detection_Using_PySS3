I can't see a future for myselfI don't know where to start.

I just can't picture any good future for myself. It all seems to be going downhill. My mental state is declining and I can't stop it. Whenever I try to picture myself being as successful as those around me, my thoughts get dark and I can't picture anything good. I despise my existence.

I have no motivation to do anything, hell, I can't even get out of bed. I sleep either 4-5 hours or 12 hours every day, and then it takes me anywhere from 1 to 4 hours to even leave my bed. Some days I forget to eat as a whole. Whereas some, I eat until I feel sick. Some days I can spend 12 hours playing games to distract myself, and the next day I hate myself even more. And the cycle repeats quite often. I haven't opened my blinds for nearly a year. It's extremely dark in here. I don't leave my house almost at all. Other than for school once a week, I have not went outside for a walk or anything of the sort for nearly 5 months.

No matter how hard I try, my marks plummet. So I've started to give up on them as a whole.

All the stress makes me nauseous. I'm in an almost constant state of nausea. I hate it.

I don't want to worry my family, they have enough problems already. Whereas the few friends I have view me as a joke. Not that they're wrong at this point.

I don't know what to do anymore.
