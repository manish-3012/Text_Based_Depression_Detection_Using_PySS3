2 years ago, I started struggling with suicidal thoughts. Now, I'm close to giving up.On the surface, I'm a happy, dorky dude who always jokes around and has a smile on his face. But on the inside and when I'm alone, I struggle with severe depression and anxiety. Around 2 years ago, it began progressing into suicidal thoughts. Ever since then, it's gradually gotten worse. I thought I finally got rid of it this year, but within the last month, it's crept up on me and it's gone from a passing thought to something I've actively considered and planned out. I don't know why I'm suicidal. I have lovely friends who mean the world to me, and there are times where I genuinely feel happy and have fun. But then the darkness creeps back up on me when I least expect it, and despite my attempts to ward it off for all these years, I can feel it starting to consume me. I'm slowly reaching the point where I don't even want help, J just want to be released from this pain. But I'm also scared, scared of the thought of actually dying. I don't know what the fuck I should tell my friends and family if I decide to do it and how I should go about it. I've got a couple months left at least; I have responsibilities I need to take care of before I can go through with it. After that? I don't know yet
