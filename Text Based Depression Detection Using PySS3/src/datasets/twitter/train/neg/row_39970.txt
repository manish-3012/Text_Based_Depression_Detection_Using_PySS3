My thoughts that I can't seem to escape.Hello Reddit.  I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts a lot lately.  Recently I actually tried to end it all but couldn't go through with it.  Ever since that day I keep thinking about killing myself but I know that I will never be able to push myself to actually do it.  I really don't know what the point of this post is.  Whether it be just to let my thoughts out and to be heard to ask for help to stop thinking about killing myself.  My mind can't stop thinking about death and everything along with it.  I don't feel as depressed as I have been.  I'm just at this weird state where I am sad but also completely okay.  Its hard to explain.  With monday being my birthday I am glad I was able to stick around.  For the first time in along time I feel truly excited about something.  I feel though as if I am on the brink of finally breaking this cycle of bad thoughts and low points in my life and I just need that extra push to get me there.  I really want to know any tips that you know to help yourself to stop thinking about the bitterness of ending your own life.
