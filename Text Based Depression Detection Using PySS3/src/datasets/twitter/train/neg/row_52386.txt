I just want to dieI've took so many sleeping pills. 15. 20. But nothing works. I've tried other ways to no avail. It's almost like I can't die. It's like God has a purpose for me. What that is, I have no idea. People say if you kill yourself, you go to hell. Maybe it's because you beat God at his own game. God determines when you die. If you kill yourself though, you beat him. At least, that's my interpretation of it. I want to die, but also want to live. I wish I could erase myself, with no trace of my existence. People think I'm crazy. Do you think I am? Tell me, what is worse: living and wanting to die. Or making someone live when they want to die. Suicide isn't selfish. It's a sign a help. No one helped them when they wanted it. So their last resort is ending it all. I know that feeling.
