Suicidal thoughts have decreased in prevelcey for a dayMy suicidal thoughts seem to have decreased yesterday for various different reasons, but my hallucinations have gotten significantly worse, I saw an entity approximetly 27 hours ago and It looked like something out of a horror movie but was wearing my motherâ€™s clothes, it was composed solely Out of Ashy black clouds/mist, giving me a Death Stare. Probably one of the scariest things Iâ€™ve ever seen as it seemed entirely real in the moment and my psyche seemed to manifest the desire to cause unimaginable pain within everything I see, hear, touch, feel, and that it had supernatural powers in which it had power over my mind and the physical world. Hopefully this kind of stuff stops happening to me because it is significantly harming my mental health, and if the prevelencey of such a thing increase I will Most likely end my suffering, hopefully medication is able to stop my development of what seems to be schizophrenia.
