I know I'll die by suicide.it's not today, let me assure you of that. it's not in the near future; I have goals I'm trying to reach. it's after that, when my goals aren't realized. I've determined that once I've lived a full life, I don't want to keep going. I know this isn't healthy, I just don't see why not. there is a proper time to die &amp; it's when you have nothing left to live for.

I've become self-destructive, engaging in risky &amp; dangerous activities in the hope that I might die spectacularly or in a way that isn't entirely my fault. I fear old age. I quit smoking &amp; vaping last november, but I picked it back up again once I realized I won't live long enough for cancer to kill me. I have tons of fun &amp; I'm living my life to the fullest until that day comes.

I smoke, I drink, I do drugs. I play sports. I see all there is to be seen &amp; I do everything there is to do so one day I can say I've lived a full life. I'm afraid of boredom &amp; monotony. I have no family. I've moved far away from all my best friends who would miss me. suicide is a viable option until I form new bonds with people who would give me a reason to go on, not for myself, but to keep them from experiencing the trauma associated with seeing a loved one kill themselves.

I don't see why I have a problem, though logic &amp; instinct tell me I do. I have the full ability to quit all drugs &amp; realize my future ahead, so someone please help me understand what's wrong with this train of thought. I figured this would be the place to ask, although maybe I'm wrong. any thoughts? I'm very interested in having my mind changed.
thanks,
