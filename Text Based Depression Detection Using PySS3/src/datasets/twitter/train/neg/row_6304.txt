Does it count as a suicide attempt if I backed out?So I've tried partial suspension about 7 times. Every time I get about 1 second away from passing out and I just back out. I was really trying but at the last second something in my head just told me to stop.

I don't know if this would simply be a suicide gesture or a suicide attempt.
