ThoughtsWhat happens when your dead? Is there a god? Are your reincarnated? something else? Or is it just a void, emptiness, black. Not knowing an answer to these questions is why I haven't killed myself. Growing up I've always been told that suicide is the easy way out or for the weak. That couldn't be more wrong. I feel some of the bravest people are the ones with the resolve to actually end it all. What mind set do you need to have to do it? What are your thoughts when you are face to face with death? Once you've jumped/cut yourself/hung just before you die do you regret it? All questions with no answers. The only people who would really know are the ones who can't speak anymore. Are they happy? Sad? Who knows. These are thoughts that have been stuck in my head every time I think about suicide. Once when I was younger I was forgotten by my family and was left waiting outside my school till 10pm. While waiting a guy asked if I needed a ride I refuse of course but thinking back I wonder what if I had gone. Would I be dead by now if I had left with him? If I had just said yes I wouldn't be in this predicament. I had a friend the killed himself by hanging. Every time I think about him I think about these questions. And come to a realization that I'm not strong enough to go through with suicide. I'm the weak one who will live a lonely life and when my time comes I'll die alone. Once I'm dead or if I get the courage to actually off myself which I doubt will happen I want to be forgotten. People don't remember be while alive and I don't want that to change just because I'm dead.
