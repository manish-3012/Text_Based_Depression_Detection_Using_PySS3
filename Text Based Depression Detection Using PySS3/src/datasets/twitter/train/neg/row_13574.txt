I can't ignore this want to die.sorry if bad spelling, i'm writing this in tears.

So i just had my parents shout at me and basicly tell me im not allowed to be happy, this happens all the time, i get shit at school as well. i never really have time to be happy anymore. only one thing is making me want to fight through all this but even that is fading.

I'm in my room in tears, i have a plastic bag and some cords/ rope, i think i'm going to end it tonight. 

i'm scared please help me.
