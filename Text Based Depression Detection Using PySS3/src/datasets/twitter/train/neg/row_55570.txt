I Have DecidedI have thought about ending my life for awhile. I have tried multiple ways but none were successful. Euthanasia is a promising option. I'm glad there are people out there who understand the severity of mental suffering. I have had my fair share. Wish I was able to speak openly and honestly with someone. Who won't go and lock me up or call me crazy for wanting to end my life. So many people all want more life. But I'm okay. Life has been a challenge and I have tried so many options out there. Its sort of ridiculous a bit that those who haven't walked a day in my shoes can then decide due to their inability to accept I am ready to die. 

My desire to die isnt because life wont get better or someone broke up with me. I'm ready to die because I am tired. I have fought long and hard. And its time to let my body, mind, and heart to rest. Finding a safe and humane way to do it I think is a good option at this point. If it doesn't work then there are less humane ways. All I really wish is I could live well open and honest about my decision until I am able to  financially pursue it more effectively.
