I don't even feel like a personThe older I get the more I realize I'm just not meant to be alive. I can't do anything normal and there's no excuse for it. I  can't talk to people like a normal person does. I can't even work dumb jobs without fucking up every aspect of it. I just belong less and less every year. I can't believe I used to be a good, smart kid because now I'm not even worth anything.

If there was a way to die without my mom feeling sad, I'd be gone. Im just so freaking sad.
