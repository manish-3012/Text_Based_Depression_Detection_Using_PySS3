I have been feeling suicidal for the past few years and Iâ€™m stuckHonestly Iâ€™m not sure if this is a good idea but Iâ€™m giving this a shot I made this throwaway for the soul purpose of expressing my thoughts on this whole thing but letâ€™s get to the point 

For the past few years there hasnâ€™t been a day where I havenâ€™t thought of killing myself even when Iâ€™ve had a good day I come home lay down and think â€œwhy am I even hereâ€ and that only gets worse on the bad days recently Iâ€™ve had a bad string of relationships that really have been eating away at me especially with the last one I went through Iâ€™ve tried to get professional help in the past but always the same end result being I still feel extremely suicidal often coupled with total loss of motivation 

As each day goes on I feel more and more helpless about this situation Iâ€™ve gotten extremely close to suicide in the past and I feel if I donâ€™t figure this out soon Iâ€™ll finally go through with it
