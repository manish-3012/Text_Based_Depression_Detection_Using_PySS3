I'm such a colossal failure and a terrible person, most people would be happy if I died and the world would be better off if I did.I'm 20 years old and in so much debt (in the tens of thousands) that I have no intention of ever paying back, I'm a terrible person who uses others to make myself feel better and I lie and manipulate constantly. Ive got no remorse or empathy for people I deem lesser than me and yet I just want to die so God damn bad.

I am so sick of this meaningless life and I'm so far gone that even when I think of that bright and happy future I dream of it's just not me, I'll end up in jail one day, living off government benefits and just get fatter and fatter until my heart gives in.

I'll probably ruin countless lives in my lifetime due to my selfishness and disregard for others. But despite all of this deep down I'm afraid, something inside me is screaming out for help, I don't want this life but I see no other options ahead so what point is there in living.

If guns were legal in my country I would have blown my own fucking brains out by now.
