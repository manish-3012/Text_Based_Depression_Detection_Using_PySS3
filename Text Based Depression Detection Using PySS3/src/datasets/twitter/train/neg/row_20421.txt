I feel like my sister hates meShe's either really nice upbeat and friendly or she's extremely impatient and bitter with me. I was watching a train derailment on the news and she tried telling me something she saw on instagram or something and I (somewhat impolitely) shushed her because I was trying to listen to the tv, then I said sorry and asked her to tell me what it was and she gave me the silent treatment. Tried asking again and she snapped and said "I don't care." I hate it when she does this. I try my best to be a nice big brother but she just doesn't give a shit and that frustrates me
