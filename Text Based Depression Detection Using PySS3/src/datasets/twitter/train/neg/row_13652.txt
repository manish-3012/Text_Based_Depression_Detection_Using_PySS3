fucking kill meplease. 

I'm tired. I'm tired of waking up, i'm tired of going to sleep, i'm tired of going to a dead end job, i'm tired of facing all my built up failures.

I don't enjoy life. I don't want to be in my head anymore. I don't want to write here anymore. I don't want to be me. I don't want anything except to stop existing.

I'm going to get some bullshit lie from someone here about how they really, truly care, and somehow that vague platitude is different from anyone else in the 30+ years of my miserably useless faggot life. Every person that has ever offered a ear has abandoned me once they know how worthless I am, or they had some bullshit ulterior motive. Like proselytizing to score brownie points with their bronze age god, or something.

I just need something to push me. Finally. I need to be pushed over the edge. I can't kill myself on my own. I'm that worthless. I don't have the balls to live or die. I just keep waking up in the real world over and over again.

I wish I could just have normal problems. A drug addict can go to rehab. A normal, attractive person has to deiced who to love from a sea of choices. A smart person chooses their career path. A creative person choose their art. All I have is the fucking pounding in my own god damn head.

Talking doesn't solve shit.

I don't want to talk.

I don't want to go through the mutual masturbation that conversation always fucking is.

I just want this to be over. I'm too old and tired for this bullshit.
