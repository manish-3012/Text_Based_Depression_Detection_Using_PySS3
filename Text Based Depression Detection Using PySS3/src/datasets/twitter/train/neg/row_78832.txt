A lost GeminiFunny how one can be the most inspirational, happy person to others, and then one day feel like thereâ€™s nothing left to offer. 
Im always told how wonderful and beautiful I am and itâ€™s makes me angry now. I find joy in the thought of giving up and starting over. Iâ€™m not sure what happens when one decides to die but it would feel better than having to feel so trapped in skin I canâ€™t escape from. 
Iâ€™ve lost everything..most of all myself. Anger and sadness have taken over every inch of my nerves and I want those feelings gone. Itâ€™s been a year feeling like this life is a huge mistake. Like every moment has been wasted and thereâ€™s no time I can get back or fix. 
Today..endless sleep is all that I can think about and I find so much peace knowing I can follow through with SOMETHING now. So this is no longer a cry for help, itâ€™s a request for understanding and a wishful goodnight.
