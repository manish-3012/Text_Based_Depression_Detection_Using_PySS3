HelpSo lately I've been questioning everything. Everything I do, I analyze, and I can no longer enjoy anything. The only thing that keeps me sane, is the thought of my girlfriend, spending every moment with me. I can't sleep anymore, and keep my mind off of this. I contemplate suicide every single day. I no longer no what to do...
