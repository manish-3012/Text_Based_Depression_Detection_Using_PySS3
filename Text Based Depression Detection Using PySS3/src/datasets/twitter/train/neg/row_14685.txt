I've lost my will to liveI'm 17 years old and don't really got a lot of problems.
But I completely lost my will to life.
Nothing seems to make me happy. I am failing school real hard. I can't get myself to do the things I need to do. 
And I think I will be better of dead. 

Can you guys help me? I'm kind of having a hard time expressing my feelings. That's why a shrink didn't work out for me.
But I really hope you guys can. 

EDIT: 

I think it's just that life doesn't please me. There are so many things in life that are so fucked up.
I think it would be wonderful, to have eternal rest. Nothing to care about anymore.
Nobody to care for anymore.
