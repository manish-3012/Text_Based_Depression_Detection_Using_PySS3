I guess Iâ€™m confusedI havenâ€™t gone a day without considering suicide. Iâ€™ve wanted to kill my self on my best days almost as much as my worst and I donâ€™t want to feel this way the rest of my life. I have every reason to not feel suicidal and I yet I do. Regardless of my friends, job, or any positive aspect of my life it all just feels the same now.
