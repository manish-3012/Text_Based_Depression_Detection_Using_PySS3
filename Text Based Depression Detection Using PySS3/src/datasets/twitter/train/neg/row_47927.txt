I am so bored so depressed I am so lonely I am an alcoholic constantly contemplating suicide (27m) please help me find the point in all this what's the end goal? I don't enjoy anything, video games bore, exercise bores me, my job bores me, all my old hobbies bore me to death, as I am typing this I am feeling so depressed I don't want to go lay in bed because it is so cold so empty there is no women that will sleep beside me, no one to cuddle with... I am on every dating website I never get a reply I always get ghosted, every women I have asked out has rejected me I have never known what a first kiss is like I have never walked holding hands with anyone, I lost my virginity to a prostitute.... I will probably wake up 3 or so times from the same nightmares I have every night, then I will wake up at 5am to get ready to go to work to my boring repetitive job, I will come home feeling tired as fuck.. all my hard earned money will go to taxes, bills, food, gas and other miscellaneous shit...every week I get blacked out drunk the whole weekend because drinking is the only thing I enjoy doing but it is becoming to take a tole at my body I feel week all time.... please help me understand the point of life I just want to die everyday.
