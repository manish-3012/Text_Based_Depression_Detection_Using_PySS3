I almost killed myself same way as Avicii did.So, first of all, I want to say that it all happened one day before Avicii was found dead.      
I just wanted to share this with you.

And as the title says, I one day just came home and thought, "how likely am I to get alcohol poisoning when I drink a bottle of 52% alcohol?" I thought it's probably high. So I filled a small glass and started drinking.        Apparently it's too hard for me to drink one small glass, let alone a whole bottle, and all that under an hour if possible.         
And then the next day Avicii was found dead because of (at least in my opinion) alcohol poisoning since he already had problems with alcohol before.

So yeah, that was quite strange experience. I felt rather guilty and stupid afterwards.
