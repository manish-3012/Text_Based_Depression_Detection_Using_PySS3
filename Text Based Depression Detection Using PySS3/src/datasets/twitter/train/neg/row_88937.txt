No one has ever cared
No one has ever cared about me. All that there is from everyone is hate. I have been bullied, made fun of, ignored, not listened to, and lied to by everyone. I have never had any irl friends or a girlfriend because of the hate and pain everyone has put on me. Not even my parents care. All theyâ€™ve done is yell and me, they never helped me when I was bullied, and they never got me diagnosed for Aspergers when they saw the signs. Iâ€™ve been suicidal since my senior year of high school because of all of this. Iâ€™ve tried therapy, medications, and even going to a mental hospital and none of those have helped me at all. The thoughts get worse everyday because my problems and the pain continue to exist.
