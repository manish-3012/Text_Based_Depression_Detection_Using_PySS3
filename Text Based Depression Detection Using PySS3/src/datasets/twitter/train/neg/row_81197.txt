Itâ€™s funny how no once cares about you until your goneIâ€™m so alone, I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™m a dude so I cant even really talk to anyone about this because Iâ€™ll just get teased. People talk mad shit behind my back but the moment I come out about wanting to put a bullet in my brain, Iâ€™m everyoneâ€™s favorite. Well I donâ€™t care anymore, they can grieve me then. Shouldâ€™ve cared before.
