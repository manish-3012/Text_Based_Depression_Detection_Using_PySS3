do i go through with itthis is my first post on here ever and it's because i'm having trouble with my thoughts, much like everybody else haha, but.. i'm 19 now and i've been depressed since i was 14 and a while ago i decided to kill myself on my 20th birthday, which is about 7 months from now. i do experience days where i feel fine, perhaps even happy. like there's hope for me to live on, but the sad days far outweigh anything i feel when i'm happy and i feel like i owe it to myself to end it. i'm giving myself one last chance to see if i can change anything, but i'm failing university and i've completely isolated myself from any social life. i'm in the closet, and internalize so much homophobia. i know it's wrong and i should accept myself but i can't. honestly i feel like when the date comes i'll be too much of a coward to actually do it but.. i got to right, guys? i don't have money for therapy, i can't even talk to anybody about it.. or again, i'm too much of a coward to talk about it. i feel like i'm faking my depression, like i'm not really depressed, like i don't even deserve to call this depression. it's more like laziness. i'm so damn lazy i'm failing myself, lol. so anyway, my life sucks and honestly some days i really feel the urge to just kill myself so, should i wait, or just do it next time i feel super suicidal?
