Ah yesI wonder if its normal for a Person to want to stab themselves in The thigh and The neck every Time they get a bit stressed or uncomfortable?

It's just that strange numbing pressure feeling you get in your neck, arms and shoulders that makes you want to get into a fetal position, scream and scratch your whole fucking face off.
