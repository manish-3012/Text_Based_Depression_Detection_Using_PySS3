Fuck you.For eight years I lived reluctantly. The rape and unfair termination was too much for me to bear. I never knew the depths of misery that I experienced were possible until then. I told you how harrowing it was for me. That I could never live that way again. You were a dream, the answer to all my problems. You replaced my deep despair, with love and contentment. Now because of one mistake, you've thrown it all away. It's not fair. How could you leave me with no money, all our bills, and your dog that we were about to put down that week??? I had to put him down yesterday. What kind of man abandons their dog???.You know after all the abuse and neglect I have suffered, that this is the worst thing you could do to me. Well, at least I appreciated everyday I got. I never forgot how horrific being suicidal and lonely was. I never did. But now those days are here again. I swore I would never come back to this place again. But now I find myself here again. I can't do this again. I don't have the strength. Those eight long years of pure, unadulterated hell were so damaging and still haunt my soul to this day. I can't do this again. I won't do this again.
