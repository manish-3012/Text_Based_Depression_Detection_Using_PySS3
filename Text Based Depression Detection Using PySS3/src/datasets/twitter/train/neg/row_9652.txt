If i were to seek help, would i lose what freedom i have left?I have considered seeking help, but my mind tells me that admitting to any sort of suicidal thoughts will cause me to be cuffed to a bed in a hospital; drugged, and having no more opportunities for freedom or control over my own life. Is this the case, or an unjustified fear?
