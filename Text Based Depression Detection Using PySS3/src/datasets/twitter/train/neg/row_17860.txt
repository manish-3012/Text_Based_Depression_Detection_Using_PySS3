I hate being so worthless and stupid and incompetent lolthis will probably be a mess. sorry. all i've wanted is to escape. not be trapped in a house where i'm emotionally and sexually abused on a regular basis. but it's my own fault because i fucked up my life and i'm trying to fix it and get myself out but it's hopeless. i finally got a job, it was delayed for weeks because of the virus, then when i started i was fired because i can't do anything right and trying my absolute hardest wasn't good enough. why wouldn't the same thing happen at any other job? and now someone else is living in this house with me who'll rob me blind if i leave the house for work anyway, and i can't do anything about it because i'm not even allowed to have the key to my own room lol. i'm an adult i'm just a complete failure of a human being. nobody can ever love me for long. i'm annoying and just too much for anyone to handle especially when i'm feeling like this. all the most important people throughout my life have left. i don't even want to post here and be a burden on even more people if anyone sees my post. i don't know what i'm hoping to get out of it anyway. there's no helping me.
