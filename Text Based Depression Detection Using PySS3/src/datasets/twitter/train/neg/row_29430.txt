When can I be finished?I have been battling depression for as long as I can remember. I have tried therapy, living healthily, and medication. I have grown so weary of this cycle of constant failure. I am educated, I have been in love, and I have done everything people tell me I am supposed to do to be happy. I am miserable, lonely, and finally ready to find peace in that womb beneath the dirt. When can I be finished?
