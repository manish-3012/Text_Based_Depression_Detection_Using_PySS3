I donâ€™t knowIâ€™ve had thoughts about if I did it how I would do it, but i donâ€™t think Iâ€™d actually do it. My life is decent enough, i just feel disconnected. I have plenty of friends, but not a single one thatâ€™s close enough to talk to about all this. I just feel down all the time and stressed. I think I might have depression, but I donâ€™t want to find out, because medication always sacred me (I know itâ€™s unreasonable). I just donâ€™t know what to do. I can be happy for a minute just joking around, but the second thatâ€™s over I just suddenly go back to being... well, me.
