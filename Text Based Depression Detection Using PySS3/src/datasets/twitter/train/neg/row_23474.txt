My financial situation amongst other things have made me consider the easy way out.Things have gone very downhill for me on the past two years. I once was at a point where i was able to help family and friends when they were in a rut. I had a job that had me touring the country for most of the yesr every year. I never struggled financially in that time period. Nothing i needed to do was so out of reach that it was almost impossible... lately its been the exact opposite. I cant accomplish anything and no matter what i try to do something i cant accomplish it without getting shit on one way or another. I feel cursed in a way and these suicide hotline folks don't take me seriously. My friends plan trips to the beach and make it a point to not let me find out about it. My family is ashamed of me. I dont thinkci have the balls to kill myseld but maybe theyre better off.
