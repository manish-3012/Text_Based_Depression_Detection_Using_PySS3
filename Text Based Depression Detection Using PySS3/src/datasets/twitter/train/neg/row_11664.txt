I have no life skillsI literally have no life. Iâ€™m too old. I donâ€™t go out. I guess I do have privilege, since my mum pays for everything sheâ€™s sick of me and avoids me. Iâ€™ve never had a job, never droven, never went to uni. Iâ€™m a one in a million fuck up. I have social anxiety and likely to be autistic. I canâ€™t be bothered getting diagnosed, itâ€™ll change nothing
