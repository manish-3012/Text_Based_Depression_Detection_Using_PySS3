Constant bad decisionsWell, I have a history of making bad decisions like taking out massive student loan debt which is what lead me to my current state. I decided to join the Army and was actually happy once I got through the enlistment process and starting BCT my suicidal thoughts were practically eliminated. I had shit tons of fun there there were some bad experiences like witnessing a trainee drink bleach and people just having mental breakdowns. I know it sounds horrible but it was honestly a great experience. Unfortunately, I was injured during training one was a hand injury (nerve damage) which ultimately lead to my discharge (5-11). I was able to continue some training but held from completing graduation requirements, and was pretty much just there until they felt like my injuries were healed enough to ship me home. I've only been home for a few days, but I feel the same suicidal feelings again, and I'm super lost without the structure BCT had. I'm practically back in the same situation I was before joining but now I have injuries preventing me from finding work. I am kind of excited that my injuries COULD possibly heal within a year and I would be able to try enlisting again, but what the hell am I supposed to do till then, and what if my injuries don't heal? I don't know what to do and honestly I feel lost as fuck being back in the "civilian world", like I don't know if this shit is normal or not but the only thing I can compare it to is the same feelings ex-cons say they have being released from years in prison. I don't really know who to talk to and this is the only place I could think of. I would really like some input from someone.
