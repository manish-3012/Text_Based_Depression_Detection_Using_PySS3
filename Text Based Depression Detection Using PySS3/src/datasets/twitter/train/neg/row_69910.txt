heading to the tracksjust finished my last exam. feels like i was wasting my time doing it but i didnâ€™t want to leave anything unfinished, ya know? ig really i was just trying to put this off. maybe i was looking for a sign , just something to make me feel a little less...idk. it wouldnâ€™t have made a difference anyway. iâ€™m not sure why iâ€™m writing this. i spose itâ€™s just one more goodbye. iâ€™m sorry to all my friends and family for hurting them in the past and for the pain iâ€™m about to cause
