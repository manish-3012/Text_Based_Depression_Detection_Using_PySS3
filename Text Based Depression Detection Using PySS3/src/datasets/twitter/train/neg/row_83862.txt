I think today I will actually kill myself after workI can't stand the pain anymore. Nothing makes me happy. I sit at this boring job all fucking day in misery. All these people pile their work on me and I just dont care anymore. I dont care about anything besides getting off this goddamn ride. Fuck everything and fuck my mental illness for making me the fucked up person I am.
