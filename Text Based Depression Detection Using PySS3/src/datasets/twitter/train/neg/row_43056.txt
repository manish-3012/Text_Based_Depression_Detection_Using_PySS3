Slowly losing all of my friends, and my will to live.Two months ago my ex broke up with me. She threatened to kill me if I turned my back on her. She blocked me a day later. I went to some friends, my mom, and the police. Nothing was done except brew stress all across the board.

Now recovering from who I'd now consider my "worst ex" I'm starting to get left behind because the mental instability I'm left with is stressing out all of my closest friends to the point where if they're not gone, they distance themselves in fear. I don't know who to trust. I don't expect this to get any attention. I don't expect this to speed up time.

I've never posted here before because frankly the amount of people who are suicidal scares me. But I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel the same. I just want my friends to be okay, and for my life to go back to normal.
I don't want to live like this.
