I'm so tiredMy life has literally been a series of bad of luck and sadness. I made the "positive" change of moving across the state to get away from my abusive family a couple months ago. I am still under their insurance till next year but because it's a different coast I have to pay out of pocket here which I can't afford. My hands have been fucked up for weeks due to lupus. Now the painful swollen blotches look sunken in some areas and I'm so over it. I emailed my old doctor to see if I they could help long distance but I doubt it. I'm going to end up killing myself because my body doesn't work anymore. Both mentally and physically. I've never had a happy life. As much as I am sad, I should be happy that this shit fucked excused for a life is over
