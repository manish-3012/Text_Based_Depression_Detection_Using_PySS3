A GoodbyeThis is a goodbye. Iâ€™m not leaving yet but when I do, youâ€™ll be able to find this. I feel numb, Iâ€™ve self harmed for the past 4 years, contemplating suicide for the past 5 years. Iâ€™m still very young and I feel terrible for having these feelings. I shouldnâ€™t think this way but I do and thatâ€™s the worst feeling. My mom has tried to help me but it never works and my friends donâ€™t worry when I leave school for weeks at a time. They donâ€™t text me unless they need help and ignore me when I reach out to them. Iâ€™ve thought of homeschool but Iâ€™m nothing without school. Iâ€™m nothing. I donâ€™t even go to school anymore and Iâ€™m a whole month behind on my work. My brother and cousins all say I have no reason to stay home but honestly Iâ€™ve had such a shitty week and have even tried to drown myself in the bathtub just yesterday. But my cousin knocked and said â€œYouâ€™ve been in there for a while did you pull a hannah Baker?â€ and walked off laughing. My family doesnâ€™t get it except for my mom. They all donâ€™t care and try to pray that Iâ€™ll get better but never talk to me. Iâ€™m kind of over it. Iâ€™ll find a way out.
