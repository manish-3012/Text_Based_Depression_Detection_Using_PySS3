Is it all worth it?my life is going absolutely nowhere i am failing school all my siblings hate me i dont know what to do with life. I have no freinds at school. Whenever i try to get better or get help everything just gets worse. Life seems like a dead end and i want to end it all. If I stay is it all worth it?
