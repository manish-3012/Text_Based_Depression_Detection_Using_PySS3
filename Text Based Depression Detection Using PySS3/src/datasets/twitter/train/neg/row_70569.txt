Anniversary of best friends suicide coming upItâ€™s almost been a year and Iâ€™m not doing the best. I miss him more and more and more every single month week and day. I want him to come back and I know thatâ€™s unrealistic considering the circumstances. I donâ€™t know what to do. I have no friends or support system and I canâ€™t help but to think Iâ€™m to blame. We promised each other if we felt like that weâ€™d call each other and he didnâ€™t call. 

We were like soulmates. No one has every and will ever understand me as well as he did. The amount of holidays I spent with him, birthdays, last day of school, so many special moments. He was my brother. All I can think is that for him to be as smart as he was and that far ahead in life yet still reach the conclusion that was the answer to the questions heâ€™d been seeking who am I to deny or not follow that same path.

Life has been so lonely since. I have no idea how to make friends or reach out for help.
