I'm on the verge of suicide right nowI've had terrible anxiety the past few months. It was gone for a long time and then it came back. I don't know why, but I've had a few panic attacks that were so bad I almost put a gun to my head to end it all. On top of all this, my workload at my current job has just increased at least threefold, if not more, which sucks because this anxiety has drained all my energy. I can't take this much longer. I don't even know when my next day off will be. Ugh.
