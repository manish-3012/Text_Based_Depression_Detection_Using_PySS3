What are your reasons for wanting to die?Writing a suicide note is too hard. So Iâ€™m writing a poem with my reasons of wanting to die instead. Failure, no love, sadness. I will contrast their counterparts for what I sought (success, love, happiness) and why I couldnâ€™t attain those things.

This makes me wonder what are *your* reasons for wanting to end it all?
