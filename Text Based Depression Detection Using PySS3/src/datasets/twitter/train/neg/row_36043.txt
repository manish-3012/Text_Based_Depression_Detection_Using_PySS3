Iâ€™m (23M) going to kill myself before new yearâ€™sI really hate myself. I keep on pushing people away because of my BPD. I keep on having short but intense romantic relationships that end in heartbreak. My last relationship ended with my ex ghosting me. The last thing she told me was â€œitâ€™s not my responsibility for your mental well beingâ€ in regards to her ignoring me. I wanted to talk to her about how I noticed how distant she was behaving but she instead ghosted me. What sucks is that I still love her. Itâ€™s a slap to the face that she still looks at my IG stories. 

I failed all of my classes for my first semester of grad school. 

I canâ€™t get a fucking job with a political science degree. 

I still live at home. 

Iâ€™m thousands of dollars in debt. 

My family doesnâ€™t care. 

My sister hates me. 

Iâ€™m gaining weight. 

I have no friends. 

My ex told me to go find some guy friends because I guess she didnâ€™t like me talking to her? Idk. She probably thinks our relationship ended because of me. 

I want to die. I have no hope for the future if my life is meant to be what it is now. A sad, lonely, pathetic, loser who sucks at everything that he does. Iâ€™m planning to kill myself before new yearâ€™s. 

I tried to swallow pills yesterday but my parents came in to me having a mental breakdown and telling me to think about how much in debt they would be to pay for my funeral. Nobody cares
