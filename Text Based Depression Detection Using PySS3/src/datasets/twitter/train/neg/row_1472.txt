how did i become so bleak?man, im such a pessimist. my daydreams are all about drugs and death and the end of the world. i donâ€™t know what happened, either. when i was younger i was the happiest, most optimistic person on the damn planet. now im just a cynical teenager who thinks about suicide all the time. i even annoy myself.
