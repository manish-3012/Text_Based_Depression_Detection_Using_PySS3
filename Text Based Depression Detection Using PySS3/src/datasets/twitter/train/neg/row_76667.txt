I just want to end it all.I'm in so much pain. I am so depressed and I feel so much every day. Every day I wake up ready to cry. I'm currently failing two classes (Math and Chemistry) and I don't want to fail this year. I am so worried about it. 
On Thursday, I'm going to New York, and I'm honestly just considering jumping off of the Brooklyn Bridge. I don't know what to do anymore.
