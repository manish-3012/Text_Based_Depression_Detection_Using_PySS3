I just want this pain to go awayI donâ€™t want to die. But only because I saw the pain it caused my family when I survived a purposeful overdose 15+ years ago. Two days ago I found out my wife was cheating on me with a coworker. People tell me Iâ€™m lucky the woman is really, sincerely ugly. But all I can think is am I so disgusting that my wife wants that? I have Multiple Sclerosis and stress exasperates the symptoms. So I am afraid of a flare up. I also regressed to cutting again after over 11 years of not cutting. I wish I could have an accidental death. I wish a semi would smash my car or anything that wouldnâ€™t be my doing to end this pain. My wife ended it with the other woman, but now the woman AND her husband keep finding ways to contact me. I had to go to the police because she keeps threatening me. I hate my life. I have a shit immune system cuz of my MS meds and Iâ€™m also anxious cuz of this sickness going around but deep in me I wish it, or anything, would take me out. I hate this feeling. I have an emergency video appointment with my therapist in 3 hours, so thereâ€™s that.
