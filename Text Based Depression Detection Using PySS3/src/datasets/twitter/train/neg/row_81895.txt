isolation is killing mei've been working from home for almost the past 6 months. in this time everyone i lived with has moved out - i went from 4 roommates/frequent houseguests to none, just my landlord who i sublet from and who is never here. i'm all alone now and i'm going to be alone for god knows how long. and i can't do this one more day.

i feel like i'm living in a dungeon. my mental health has been deteriorating ever since lockdowns started and now i am at total rock bottom. i can't take care of myself anymore. i've been eating \~600 calories/day for the past several days and barely keeping it down. i think i'm going to waste away.

i always wanted to live alone. just not like this. i don't see an end to this and i don't know how i can go on. i miss spending the day outside, going to the movies and going out to eat, having real live interactions with people so much. all i wish for is a normal day where i go to my physical workplace, spend way too much money on a not very good burrito for lunch, walk a few miles, and come home only to shower and sleep. i don't know if i'll ever see that kind of day again.
