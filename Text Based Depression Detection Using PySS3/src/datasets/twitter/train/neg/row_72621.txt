Should I be concerned?The parents of someone I know recently got divorced.  This person I know and his sibling are in their early thirties.  His sibling recently posted something online that has be a little concerned.

A quote was posted and it states:

"The happiness of the drop is to die in the river."

Should a quote like this be considered a suicidal thought?
