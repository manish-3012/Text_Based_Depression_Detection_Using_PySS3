Feeling scared I might actually go through with it this timeI posted last night but I have no idea how to link to the original post.
I have been dwelling on a stupid mistake I made for 3 days now and through all the contemplation my mind is so cloudy I can only see one way out.
I think I just need people to talk to that are removed from the situation and can give me some perspective, I'm just frightened I'm too weak to deal with this.

Edit: I think I figured out how to link to the original post
