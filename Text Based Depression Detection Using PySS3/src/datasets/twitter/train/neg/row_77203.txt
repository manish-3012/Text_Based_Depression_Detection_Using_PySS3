I desperately want to end my life, but I'm absolutely terrified to do it.I'm ready to finally die. I'm tired to not knowing what I want to do with life. I'm tired of mooching off my parents because I can't hold a job. I'm tired of hospitalizations and psych holds. But mostly I'm tired of always being manic or always being depressed. 

Having said that, I'm terrified to die. What method should I use? What if I fail? What if I change my mind after its too late?
