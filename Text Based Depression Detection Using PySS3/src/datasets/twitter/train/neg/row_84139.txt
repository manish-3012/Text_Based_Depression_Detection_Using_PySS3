Self HarmSo iâ€™ve realised that iâ€™m not ready for suicide yet as I have a bucket list to do before I die and by the time iâ€™ve finished that I will probably appreciate life more and not be suicidal. So, Iâ€™ve been self harming at an age under 18 but realised that I need to stop! It is the feel of blood and pain I like so is there anyway to experience bleeding without any damage to the body? Or anyway I could lose this strange quirk???
