How did I get here?I used to have everything. It's gone and I'll never be able to get it back. I have lost everything that matters, every source of happiness or hope. Every opportunity for a good life. This wasn't supposed to happen to me. I went from top to bottom and I haven't been able to crawl out for 3 years. I don't feel like there's anything I can do.

Anyone feel the same? Confused as to how you ended up like this. How can life be so cruel and take everything away. Life defeated me. It's won. I can't fight anymore. I lost the game.
