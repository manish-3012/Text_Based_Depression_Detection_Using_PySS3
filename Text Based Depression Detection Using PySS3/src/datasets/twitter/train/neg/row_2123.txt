I can't live without himIt ended a week ago because he cheated :( How could he have? I trusted him and loved him so much, I've never felt this way before :( I'm depressed and I don't know what to do anymore
He was the only one I had in my miserable life
I don't have anyone I have no friends, nothing :( I just want to die, there's nothing left for me
