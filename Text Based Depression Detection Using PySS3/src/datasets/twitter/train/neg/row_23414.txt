Why are people so dead set against someone killing themselves?Is it the religious thing where it's verboden or they can't fathom someone doing it or think that the person doesn't have the right to end their own life?  Some people even label killing oneself as selfish which is a crock of --- since that person is in so much pain.  So why do people make such a big deal of someone wanting to end it?
