I want to fucking kill myselfThose 6 words repeat in my head over and over and over and over. I don't want to be suicidal, I don't want to need to die, but I do. I don't know why, I wasn't raped or anything, I lost someone a few months ago but I hardy think about it. I just want to fucking die. I don't know why, I don't know how to fix myself. I just want to fucking die. In fact I need to die. I'm not afraid of dying, I'm just afraid of living. I. Want. To. Fucking. Die. I want it to be over, I just want to FUCKING DIE ALREADY
