My mom keeps telling me that i should kill myselfFirst of all, sorry if the text is a little confusing. English is not my first language. I tried to talk with my country suicide line, but i gave up after two hours of waiting...

Since my dad passed away my mom became violent towards me. Since three years ago, almost every fucking day when she gets home from work she feel this urge need to punch, kick me and tell me how better things would be if i killed myself... That i'm just a burden. I donâ€™t use drugs, drink alcohol or smoke, i donâ€™t know what i am doing wrong or why she see me that way...


I'm sure my teachers know that something is wrongâ€¦ I said in class more than once that â€œhome is hellâ€, â€œi wish i didnâ€™t need to go homeâ€, and i often have to go to school even with some bruises on my body. But they never even asked if i was okay. So, i finally accepted that my mom is telling the truth... If even other adults are ignoring me, it's because there's nothing wrong with what she's doing.

If i just disappeared, things would be easier to her and to my sister... I can't take this anymore, i'm tired of getting beaten up, i'm tired of being a burden to my familyâ€¦ Iâ€™m so fucking tired, but i'm too scared to die.

I know that i could call the police, but how can i do this with the person who gave me food and a roof for 16 years?
I just don't know what to do. If i killed myself, everything would become better to my family... And i would stop suffering too. But i'm too scared to do this.
