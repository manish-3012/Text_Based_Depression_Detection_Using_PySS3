Will never be good enough-Stupid reason to kill myself but that's the way it isMy brother just got into a top 5 engineering PhD program without any research experience, he has a 4.0. I have only a 3.6 (have been trying to get it to a 3.7 but I know it won't happen because I'm a piece of shit) and I have a good amount of research experience but I know I will not get even close to the quality program he got into. I keep getting Bs and I honestly think it is ruining my life but I don't know how to fix myself. I bought a shotgun a couple months ago and have hidden it under my bed, I hope I will brave enough to use it when the time is right.
