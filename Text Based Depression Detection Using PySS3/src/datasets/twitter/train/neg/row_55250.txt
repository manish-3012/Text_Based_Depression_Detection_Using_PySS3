I need adviceI know there are people here that know better than me. I need immediate help.  

My best friend told me he is going to suicide. He has been in a major depression for a year now. I did everything i could to help him but i couldn't manage to snap him out of it. He told me that he is letting me know it  because he didn't want me to "be in a shock and get too upset" when i find out. I am afraid to say things  that may make the situation worse. Please do not say this is a call for help because of being a teenager. He is way over 18 and he is an independent adult that has a decent life and a good reputation. 

If i lose him, i will never be a complete, functioning human again. He means the world to me and i would never forgive myself for nor being able to save him. He is a precious, kind hearted person that helps and cares for every living being around him. He radiates positivity to say the least. I am panicked. I don't know what to do. Please someone help me get my shit together and give me advice, i need to be a good friend once in my ifetime.
