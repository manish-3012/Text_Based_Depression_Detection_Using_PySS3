Stable for the momentI canâ€™t stop drinking. I canâ€™t stop inappropriate thoughts. Iâ€™m at a low point. I just looked frantically for something sharp enough to do the trick in my kitchen, but I didnâ€™t find anything.

I thought about borrowing my Husbands belt to hang myself in the closet but I donâ€™t want to leave him and my daughter with that last image.

So thereâ€™s where Iâ€™m at. Like an animal stuck in a trap wanting to chew itâ€™s own leg off but not wanting to traumatize anyone. 

Iâ€™ve been bawling my eyes out. Why am I so scared of death but actively seek it? Life is weird.
