Fucking uselessI hate how this keeps creeping back up on me. For the past month or so I've been making progress at therapy and my meds have been doing well for me.

Then a few days ago I can't intervene in a panic attack so I just ride it out and feel like shit. Then come today I'm attempting again.

I've hit a point where I wonder what even is the point of trying. Like really, what is the point of me moving forward and actually trying to do anything? The unhappiness and the self-hatred is always there. The anxiety comes back even if it dips out for a bit. I can barely even talk to people anymore.

I'm a fucking mess. Look through my post history if you want proof of this. I've been coming back here for months and months.  It's not gotten any better even with all of the support wasted on me. What's the point of me continuing? This is more me asking myself than anyone reading this. It feels so unnecessary at this point.
