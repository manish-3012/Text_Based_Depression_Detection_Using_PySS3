Not sure who to talk toHey. So, I'm kind of circling the drain. I have failed at everything. No job, my girlfriend left me, family disappointed. She told my family she wanted to marry me but she leaves me again and again. I don't blame her.

I don't know what I'm trying to say here. It's late. I guess I just wanted to tell somebody who wouldn't turn me in. Please don't turn me in. I just wanted to tell somebody.

Goodnight.
