I'm ready to die.I'm 16. My position right now gives me three choices: kill myself, kill my dad, or run away. I hate him so fucking much and this isn't stupid teenage rebellion hate or whatever, I actually want the fucker dead. I've talked to a hitman and don't have the $10000 to have him killed, don't want to do it myself, and can't support myself if I run away. I just snorted a pill of tylenol and codeine. I fucking hate him enough that I'm ready to die just to avoid another year and a half with him. It's that or rot in jail forever. I can't escape this, it isn't fair. This seems so real to me finally. Normally I try to kill myself while really angry or sad, and know deep down I'm not going to fully commit, but right now I feel I could do it, calmly, just to get away from him.
