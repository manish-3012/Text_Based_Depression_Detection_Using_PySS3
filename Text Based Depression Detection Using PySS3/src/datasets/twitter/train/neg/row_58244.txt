I can't resolve my[m26] insecurities with my bodyI'm getting really scared. 

For the past 10 years now I'll get terrible depression and unimaginable sadness because of my body for weeks at a time until I just get numb to that feeling and move on with my life for 3-4 months, just to have those feelings come back EVEN WORSE each time. 

I'm going through it right now and I just don't know how to cope anymore. 

I really need someone to talk to.
