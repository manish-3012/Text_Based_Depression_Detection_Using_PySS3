Not sure what Iâ€™m still doing..So for around a year now I have been thinking about ending it all on a daily basis. There are 2 things stopping me currently. 

1. The method, Iâ€™m not sure how Iâ€™d do it, pills seems like the easiest route, however I feel like there is a relatively high chance of survival, and i know that the degeneration of organs and such after a failure by pills can be agonising. Iâ€™m in the Uk, so no guns, therefore jumping (possible same end result as pills) or hanging potentially... also considered using my car exhaust. 

2. The prospect that nobody would actually care. This is the thing that scares me the most. Iâ€™m not necessarily thinking that nobody would care, just that I feel like Iâ€™d be forgotten easily. And that is way worse than death in my mind. 

I tend to be somewhat reckless with my life, praying that something will happen to me without me having to do the physical deed myself. Such as driving too fast, crossing the road without looking etc.. 

Iâ€™m not sure how to get out of this situation I find myself in.
