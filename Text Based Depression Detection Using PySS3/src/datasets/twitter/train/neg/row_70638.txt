Im trying to fight the urge. But I am still finding myself here again.Clawing my throat out. Punching myself in the face. Screaming and crying. I hate this. I hate that I can't trust that my friends want me around, I hate that I feel their hands still touching me in ways I never wanted anyone to touch me. I hate that my mother thinks I hate her and won't get out of her own damn head to see I'm in pain. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to hurt anymore. How much do I have to hurt for other people? How much longer do I need to hold out for someone else? I know you can't get help unless you want help but what am I getting help for? For a man I love to never love me back? For friends I care for leaving me? For family I hold dear to continue hating each other? I want to go peacefully. In a bath tube. Filling the water with liquid rose pedals dancing gracefully watching them as I finally find a moment with out pain. I have no hobbies. I have no interest. But I have a goal. This goal. This is all I want anymore. The only thing I look forward too. This is the only thought that brings me peace of mind.
