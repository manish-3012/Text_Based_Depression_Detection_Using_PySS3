I wish my family didn't have to deal with someone like me, they don't deserve itI'm a nobody. A loser, useless and I'll never amount to anything. I'm 28 years old and I've never held a real job. How can I expect to ac tlike a functional adult if it takes all my energy just to leave the house

I have no talents, skills, anything

I am one of those people whos brain is literally wired that I can never experience any form of happiness due to having Schizoid PD. What is the point if I can never be happy? The best I can ever feel is neutral. Laughing can happen but is rare and is a fleeting moment of dopamine.

I want to use drugs and alcohol so I know what it's like to feel good but I don't know how I can access the former. I have no intention of living to 40 anyway so why should I care about my health

My family is good people. They work hard and do well. They don't deserve to deal with someone like me. My sister is 15 and she has already accomplished more than I ever will

I know they secretly resent me for being a leech that sleeps until 6 pm every day and can't do anything on my own

I wish they would tell me how much they hate me so it would be that much easier to kill myself. I hate feeling like people want me around. Then I have to play along and act like everything is ok when its not

Failing that I'd jut rather be put into a mental institution so I can be forgotten. I can't function in society, it would be for the best to lock me up and forget me
