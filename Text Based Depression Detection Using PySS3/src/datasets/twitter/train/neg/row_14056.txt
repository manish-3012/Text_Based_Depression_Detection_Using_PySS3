somebody?its not that i am killing myself right now .. but the direction i am heading is not good. it will be a matter of time . so any suggestion would be appreciated !

tldr

These are my weird and bizarre thoughts and stories so far . I know these are very poor mentality thoughts but it is true what i feel.

1. Now i realised that back when i was in school , i have somewhat OCD . I used to align carpets symmetrically and books in order . idk why . but i used to do it . 
2. Grade 9 , diagnosed with sinusitis and eye problem and later migraine . went to several hospitals everything became okay within â…” months
3. From childhood , I was a lonely type . small family and less talkative . introvert . but I used to play and itâ€™s very good .
4. Grade 10 / 11 okay 
5. I used to align the bedsheet properly and wash leg frequently sometimes . but it went in 1/2 week .
6. In Grade 12 . I chose mathematics instead of biology idk why seeing others . and thinking I cannot do . and takes a huge amount of time and money . idk if i had interest in anything at all . had slight interest in becoming a doctor . slight . cause i have seen them working closely and it seems so reputed profession and all .
7. Sometimes I have irritability problems , can't resist loud voices and sometimes even bad weather can affect my mood . my mood depends on external factors .My performance depends on external factors .
8. Now grade 12 : a deep voice constantly argues that u should have gone there . that is your goal . u came here seeing others and all . and somewhere i feel i cheated myself.
9. Grades are good . Everything is good . Now I have started making few friends . Cannot even connect to people . Hoping Nobody likes me and all . Some days I felt so alone too .
10. I did the entrance examination and I did well .
11. But now in college i feel more alone . more lost . that i don't even know where I am . i am not feeling good . Before even starting my career I am feeling I cannot . I cheated myself . I am not good . I know nothing . then idk why i became anxious . I feel people are judging me .i feel people dont like me . i am not smart . and this is a complete new field . ( which might be to some extent true ) . And i am running from myself . Can't make genuine friends . Confidence ? - none . self-respect ? shattered. Idk i feel i dont have good friends . And i am becoming toxic . Grade is not bad so far . but i am not even 10% close to what i could have done . I am totally not happy . i feel so lost . so alone . there are people around me , but I feel lost . And No everything is not okay . I never sent a resume .Because i don't think I am even worthy . Even when some people ask me with care I feel i dont deserve anything good . I should not be happy . people don't like me . My close friends dont like me . This is a different field and i know nothing .
12. Day by day my self hatred grows . I feel i am cheating on myself and i am fake . 
13. I hardly go to relatives . Because I feel i am not good enough . smart enough . I am not worthy . I have let down . its like i am hiding something and i don't want to go there . its like i am not good and they wont like me .
14. And I feel so alone . so lost . let down . and everything . the more i try the more i go down . i feel i dont have friends . I cannot do anything . &amp; i am done .
15. The college experience is so bad that i dont even want to appear . i want an escape . 

Now i dont want to code .read write and all . i just want to sleep all day . and sometimes i wish i werenot even born .

1. I never applied to companies . cause i dont even know what i am doing . I cannot imagine my future . it feels like i am just moving or doing this in just the shake of doing . there is no extra hours and deep interest .
2. And at times i feel so irritated . so angry . that i don't like the place . i don't like to code now . feels like i am totally done . then sometimes I think about fate , palmistry , existential crisis and all. I feel so lost and isolated and sometimes i don't even know who i am . i feel judged and people would find out .
3. No everything is not okay . I am not feeling good . not even a day . i don't have proper skill . i cannot connect with friends . and i am done with fake smile . i am done with faking . i am not having good experience at all . and when i see my parents and other ppl thinking he is smart and all . Sometimes i burst into tears. Not a thing is okay . its not okay . i have told for quite a few years that it will be okay . but it is still the same . i feel unconfident about me . I am constantly let down . I cannot do things . I want to isolate myself. 
4. Now sometimes I think I cannot learn anything. I wont get a job. I don't think how long i can bear like this , sometimes I feel I am in huge trouble . sometimes everything seems fine. But I constantly swing back and forth between these emotions these days .
5. Now when I see myself i feel so sorry for myself .Sorry for my parents . If only I had no parents I would have quitted already.
6. It is okay from outside but it is not okay at all . I feel so fucked up . trapped and i don't think i can change anything . how can I ? i don't have proper motivation. I don't even know what i am doing . who i am going to be . where I am . I hate myself . and i don't think i can change anything . constant thoughts that u are not good . u cannot do anything . The thing you are doing is quite not meaningful . You dont like it . You are so boring .You just dont know it and all . And the biggest problem is now i dont want to do it . i have no motivation . i dont want to do anything .
7. That feeling when you feel so lost. Your charm is already lost . Deep down you know you have been a failure . and at this point sometimes it feels like it is easy to quit . cause how could you even fight ? u are so fragile . u cannot even tell anyone . How could I tell that i am not feeling good about myself ? 
8. If only I had some interest / motivation to do work . less anxious . and less edgy thoughts . and a little bit of luck .A hopeful and non disturbing thoughts , things would change slowly . 
9. Nothing is going good . No nothing is good . i don't have friends . I am isolated . I am at my worst . i feel so negative about myself that i feel i have no one that understands me .

Idk why  my mind constantly tell i would have become great in another field .

1. I am not satisfied with myself . I am not happy . i don't think i am complete within myself .there are people around me but i feel so lost alone . And i think its because of my lack of motivation towards career .its not that i don't like this career . but i idk why i feel so anxious . and idk if because of my thoughts i am feeling low or because of my career i am feeling low . i just don't know.
2. Last 9/10 months have been the worst . I felt so anxious . restless . Sometimes I could even imagine myself dead . constant headaches . vomiting . living recklessly . not caring about anything . i just don't see any hope . at times i thought death would be kindness . somedays i dont think i can even make it . somedays i feel so excited . Restless . So Hopeful . i have even slept all day . cried Â¾ times a day . stared at fan for Â½ hours . everything seems so lost and mostly i just don't know what i am talking about . Sometimes it feels it is there . Sometimes it feels it is not there . I get upset and excited very easily too. Even slight things can upset me emotionally . I hate myself so much and idk how i can change at all. I feel so angry . frustrated . I cannot get angry at others . i have zero interest to fight back too .
3. I have nothing in my checklist . i am truly dead already that is true . i just dont want to read , code and learn anything . zero motivation to do anything . i feel i am not ready . not enough and it is true i am not enough . not ready . i just think i cannot be good . i cannot support my family . make money and all . i am just done .
4. How can I change ? What steps should I take ? I have -ve motivations to read . to earn money . to go abroad . to even exist . but i want to be better and i just cannot change things ! i want things to change but i am done with even trying . focusing for even a minute drains my all energy !
5. Tbh yes things might get better or not .leave that ! but sometimes i just can sense my death . i am feeling already my death .
6. I dont even know what is good or bad for my carrer . i just dont know me now. I dont want to be negative but i cannot . at times i dont think i can even learn something .i just made a disaster of myself.
