I think I'm finally ready to do it..I've been here before. I've been here for help with depression, and been here actually threatening suicide. I've tried everything. I tried drugs. I tried cutting. I tried meds. Nothing made it better. In fact, the medication was the worst. I never wanted to die more than I did on the medication. Oh god, it was so bad. I'm out of options. I've written and rewritten my note... I think I'm ready. Don't give me the cliche bullshit of "It will all get better". No. It won't. Don't tell me I'm too young. I just want to die. This isn't angst. This is hell.
