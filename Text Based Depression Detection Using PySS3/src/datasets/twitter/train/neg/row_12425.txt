You don't realize how far you've gone, until you look back.Watching myself build up the courage is a sobering process. Reaching out, and then pulling back just before I can touch help, or the person I reach out to walks away just at the right time. The ups and downs are getting less extreme as I draw closer to my decision.

I've realized the pushing away of people was to protect them from a choice I had subconsciously always knew was going to happen. It's really peaceful to see clearly after everything being so hazy.

The real terrible part is that now that I've found a way to escape my torment... I've realized all of that all of the people I thought abandoned and hurt me this year, I really hurt and abandoned all of them. The way I treated my spouse, the way I treated my family. All too late. Everything has decayed away and now I'm left with nothing to save when I finally figured out how.
