I don't know who else to talk to.. So reddit, mind listening for a little while?I have no one to talk to and I am running out of reasons to get up in the morning.. I have severe depression.. I dropped out of high-school.. and uni 3 times.. I can't get a job.. I've been on so many different meds that I have lost count.. I am so incredibly lonely..

Is there anyone out there that can cheer me up..? I just.. need a friend..
