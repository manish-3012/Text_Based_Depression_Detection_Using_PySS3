Homeless peopleI live in a good safe neighborhood and have a decent job. I really don't have any needs that go unmet. However I am depressed and often think about killing myself.

I work in a pretty bad area of the city and I see a lot of homeless people who have it far worse than I. I see them sleeping in bushes, nodding off to drugs, pushing around carts, begging for money, visibly in poor health, digging around in dumpsters, and offering their bodies. These are things I see with my own eyes almost daily.

Where do these downtrodden people find the will to live where I cannot? I feel like if my life gets even partially worse than it is now (and it's not even that bad), I'm checking out. Where can I find the stregth to continue on like these folks?
