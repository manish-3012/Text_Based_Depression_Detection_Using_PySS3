I don't feel like I deserve to post here with thisâ€š but...I don't want to get older. I've seen people in my family get old. I've watched them as they become so reliant on other people and they can't even speakâ€š they can't shower themselvesâ€š they can't eatâ€š or they get cancer.

I'm only 18, but the thought of being any older than 30 absolutely terrifies me to the point where I start cryingâ€š and honestly I'd rather just stay 18 for ever. I foresee me killing myself in the next few years. The thought of my life becoming a boring routine with a wife and children and no time for friendsâ€š or my friends having no time for me. I don't want it to be that way.

I'm not an immediate suicide risk. I just need people to talk to. My problem sounds so pathetic compared to the others on here, sorry.
