It's lonelyI'm so tired. I want to hug somebody so badly, and for them to tell me that it'll be okay, and that it really will be okay. I regret not being more social, or thinking through my life choices before i made them. I went with what I thought was right, but i fucked it. I hid from people for years, didnt want to be hurt.
It hurts so much more not knowing anyone though. They say no man is an island, but i've become a peninsula if anything. You can't stop what's coming, so why wait? Meet death on your own terms. Why try to suckle the marrow of life out of others? I am a parasite on others happiness. The world is so much better off not having a fat idiot taking up and wasting space.
I wish someone could come down from the clouds and just take me away to a new place, with new people, with a different mind. I don't want to die, i just want to be someone that I can never be.
