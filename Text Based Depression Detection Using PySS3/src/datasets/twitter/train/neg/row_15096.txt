Why the fuck am I still up?Basically itâ€™s 2:30 am and I have to be at work at 8am. Iâ€™ve been trying since 1:00 am to fall asleep but my shitty thoughts are keeping me up. I live with a narcissistic asshole, who is my brother, and he just made yesterday an awful day for me. Like I know I shouldnâ€™t let him bother me, but he does.  He makes me want to jump off a bridge sometimes and I feel bad for my parents who have to deal with him. Idk my thoughts are just racing and iâ€™m always suicidal so situations like this just amplify my thoughts. Iâ€™m going to try to go to sleep for the 10th time but it probably wonâ€™t happen because my mind is to jumbled.
