I have no reason to kill myself, but I still want to.My life is fine. Good, even. Even though I took a couple years off, I'm back in school double-majoring in Physics and Math, doing well in all of my courses, and enjoying the coursework and the research that I assist with on campus. I've even found people that I can relate to in my department, which has been difficult for me in the past.

I've got parents that love me, and even though I don't see them very often because they're divorced and live in different parts of the country, I know that they love me and I love them.

I've got a retail job that I've had for several years, co-workers that I genuinely care about, and customers that know me by name and ask me how school is going, if I'm seeing anyone, etc.

I've got two roommates that I treasure. They're having a commitment ceremony in just about a month that I'm going to be officiating, and I couldn't be happier for the two of them.

And still, I want to kill myself. Not all the time, it comes and goes. Right now, for clarification, is one of those times. I'm not depressed, I don't feel any need to escape from anything, I'm not scared of what tomorrow or the next day or the next week, month, or year will bring. I just want to kill myself because I want to kill myself. I'm aware this tautology is probably not useful, but it's the only way I can express it.

Now, I'm fairly certain this is the result of some psychological issue that I should probably seek treatment for, but (1) I don't have any expertise in this field, and (2) I'm aware that self-diagnosis is not a viable tool in any case. So I suppose what this comes down to is that I'm hoping someone will recognize what it is that's going on with me and be able to point me in the right direction.

tl;dr - My life is fine, but I still want to kill myself. Help?
