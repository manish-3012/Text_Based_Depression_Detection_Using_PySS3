I'd rather give up than try and failI'm 16 and I graduate in June. Knowing suicide is an option is so comforting.I am a perfectionist, and I know I am way too hard on myself but I can't help it. I'm top of my class and everyone expects so much out of me and I really wish the bar was lower. It is all too much, I'm going to end my life before semester finals.
