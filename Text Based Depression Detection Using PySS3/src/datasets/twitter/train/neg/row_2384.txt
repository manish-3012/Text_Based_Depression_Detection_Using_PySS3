Itâ€™s hard to imagineHow will people react? I knew someone who killed themselves I wasnâ€™t super close but we had chatted here and there throughout school. It did shock me and it was sad to hear, everyone came together and honored his name. Itâ€™s hard to imagine what would my own death be like, I really donâ€™t want to be talked about too much or have my pictures going around. I really just donâ€™t want to see how it ends up, Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll have to watch it. I know your brain is no longer alive but Iâ€™m really scared Iâ€™ll have to see the pain I caused. I didnâ€™t want to hurt anyone god damn it! Every person dies on this earth why canâ€™t people deal with it better. I wish we talked about death more so that way itâ€™s not shocking and sad and instead celebrate their life. Itâ€™s always the sad â€œthey killed themselvesâ€ itâ€™s never like focusing on the person completely not the very end of their life. Iâ€™m not suicide I am a person stop fucking talking about people killing themselves, a person with cancer is NOT FUCKING CANCER. I want to be remembered for who I was not how I died you fucking pricks.
