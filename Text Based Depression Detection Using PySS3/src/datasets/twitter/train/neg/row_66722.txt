It just doesn't seem to get betterI attempted two and a half months ago. I got scared and reached out to my GP. I crawled myself out of the hole, with the help of some amazing coworkers and an optimistic AF GP, but it's just not enough. These past months have been hell, and this week was the icing on the shit cake. Part of me believes things can get better, but then I remember the other times I've been optimistic and what a punch to the gut it's been when everything inevitably goes to shit again. I haven't self harmed in almost a year. I don't even want to at this point. It doesn't help anymore, so all I'm left with is death. I just don't want to feel anymore. I really fucking don't want to feel, because it's never good when it's good, but holy shit it feels awful when it's bad. I fucked up a lot of things this week, and it makes me feel awful. I lost someone important to me. I am genuinely not a good person, and I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. I need to drink.
