All the hard work I've put in to bettering myself means absolutely nothingIt's been 6 months now that I've been out of the suicide watch program. I'm back on my meds, I've attended group and one on one counselling. Been sober for 3 months as well. Since my diagnosis 2 years ago I've been fighting to keep myself alive. 

But what's the point of all these things I've done when these thoughts of suicide always come back? I still get panic attacks. My friends have moved on with their lives, my parents think I'm a lost cause, I have no idea what I want to do in school, I'm severely in debt, and the guy I developed feelings for left me. I try so hard to be positive but I know I can't continue with that delusion that everything is sunshine an rainbows. 
How am I supposed to continue on with my self care when in reality everything is crashing down?
