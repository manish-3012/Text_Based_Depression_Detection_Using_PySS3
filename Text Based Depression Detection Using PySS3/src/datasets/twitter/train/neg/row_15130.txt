Reaching out for help? Doesn't workI've tried to reach out to 5 people, I really have, but people don't care. My results are: "aw, sorry" (1), "same" (2), "lol ok" (1), and "that's a little dark" (1). I'm clearly communicating this so it's not like they could say there were no signs. So if I wanted someone to care/take a genuine interest then I guess I have to pay for it and that's expensive.

Damn.
