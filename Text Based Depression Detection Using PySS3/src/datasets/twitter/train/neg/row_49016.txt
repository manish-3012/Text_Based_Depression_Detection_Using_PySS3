I want to give up.I feel so worthless. Iâ€™m not gonna finish school on time, Iâ€™m supposed to take the SAT tomorrow and I havenâ€™t studied once. Iâ€™m obsessed with sabotaging myself and then pitying myself for feeling shitty all the time. I used to be a star student and had so many friends and enjoyed my life. Then I became such a shitty person who only cares about getting high and not doing anything to make my life better. I feel so stuck and the only thing thatâ€™s keeping me from ending it all is the fact that my friend took her own life this past November. I absolutely cannot fathom the idea of leaving my other friend (who was even closer to my friend who passed away) behind. I think about ending it everyday and I want to get help but Iâ€™m just too scared. I feel like Iâ€™ve already fucked my life over beyond repair. Iâ€™m only 17 and I feel like Iâ€™m a waste or a person. Iâ€™ve fucked myself over by smoking pot everyday to numb the pain of existence. I have no hobbies, nothing that I enjoy besides being in my bed sleeping. My self confidence is in the gutter and I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m so tired.
