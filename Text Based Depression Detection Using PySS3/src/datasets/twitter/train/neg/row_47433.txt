I'm losing one of my dogs and I want to die with her.In the past year, I've lost two of my family's dogs to cancer. Now, I might lose a third. But this time, it's my own dog. And I'm fucking devastated. I can't live without her or my two cats. I can't live without any of them. My dog, her name is Daisy.. A chihuahua-Rat Terrier mix (with the personality of a golden retriever), has a lump on her chest, right under her frontal right leg. I've known about it for months, but haven't had the money to afford a visit to the vet. I finally can this week and I feel it's too late. In the past month alone, her tumor has nearly doubled in size and she's been throwing up quite often and I'm just so scared. It's caused me to relapse back into alcohol and even my suicidal thoughts and the possibility of losing her or any of my pets is just tearing me apart. I know they're going to go eventually but they're all so young. Daisy is only five. It's too soon. I can't live without them. I just fucking can't. They're the only reason I'm still here. I got them to keep me from killing myself. To keep me from being alone. To finally have someone to love who loves me back. The second my dog goes, I'm gone. I want to die. I won't live without her or my cats. I'm terrified. I can't lose her or any of my pets. I can't. I can't. Please, I don't know what to do. I don't know if this is the right place to post this, so I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
