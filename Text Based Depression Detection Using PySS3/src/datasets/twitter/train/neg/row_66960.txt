I am somehow even more aloneFound out that my best friend is moving to the other side of the country in 2 weeks...she was the only person I had and now she is gone too. I'm miserable every day and I am running out of steam. I can't bear the weight of everything now, and it is doing nothing but going downhill. I can't keep going especially on my own. I don't think I can do this and nothing seems sweeter than just running away from it all.
