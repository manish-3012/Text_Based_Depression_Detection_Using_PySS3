Just sick of being a loserI'm not good at anything no matter how hard I train and practice, women, at least the ones I show interest in, want nothing to do with me, and I can't even get a fucking part time job. I'm sick of being a loser in everything. People keep saying that I have to just "work harder" but I don't think that's possible anymore. They don't understand, they all have at least some success in their life, and I know for a fact that none of them have tried and worked nearly as hard as I have, but it doesn't matter, because everybody is more attractive and talented and smarter than me. I don't want to live out the rest of my life if it means I'll be stuck being such a fucking failure the entire time.
