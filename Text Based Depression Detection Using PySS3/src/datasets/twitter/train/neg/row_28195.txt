I want to buy a gun. But then i get suicidal thoughts. :/ please read.My first post. I recently got into guns. I've been wanting to buy one for a while now (legally of course) im still living with my mom. But i was planning to buy one after i move out. I have always wondered how hard you would have to squeeze the trigger and make the gun go off. That being said. I imagine myself buying a pistol after i move out from my moms place and just sitting in my apartment, just sitting there with the pistol in my hand, loaded, and just raising the pistol up to my temple and squeezing the trigger a little, and then squeezing a little harder. Trying to find out how much more i have to squeeze for it go off. I would originally buy it for my protection. And for the protection of my future family. But how would i be able to protect them, if i can't even protect myself from my own imagination. Sometimes, i even get thoughts of shooting my girlfriend (who i want to marry and have a family with) *i just teared up* and even possibly our baby. I live a problem free life, i have no anger, no anxiety, no stress, nothing that can make a person go suicidal. But then i get these thoughts all of a sudden after imagining myself of buying a pistol. What's wrong with me?
