what's the point if you can't enjoy itI got brain damage in an accident, and everything feels wrong. I can't do anything anymore. It feels terrible. Music hurts to listen to. Games hurt my eyes. Reading's getting kinda hard. I can't do anything but go on walks. I can't even notice half the shit I pass by. I used to like to talk to people. Used to want to be somebody. Used to want things. Now I can't. It's like I can't want anymore. I can't long for anything anymore. I hate it. I hate being so cut off from the person I was. It's all I feel anymore. I just hate it. I hate it. I hate all of it; I hate everything. I just want out. I want my old life back, and it's never coming back, and I can't stand it anymore.
