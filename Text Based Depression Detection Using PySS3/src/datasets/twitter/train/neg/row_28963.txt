Not long nowThrow away account - Only 5 months until I've had life insurance for a year and I can finally kill myself. 

The only reason I'm waiting is so no one has to pay funeral costs and it'll leave money behind for my family and friends, my passing won't really bother anyone for too long so at least I can be happy about that. 

I'm honestly fed up and can't wait, their really is no point to anything as I've tried for 30 years and can longer fight my anxiety and depression, I just want it to be over now but if I wait at least no one can say I was completely selfish.

Had to write this all down just so I could get my thoughts out, sorry if I upset anyone with this.
