Just lost a friend todayMe and her weren't that close but it pains me that someone that wanted to live life to the fullest died. And the worthless nobody just sits begging for death. It sucks why couldn't have been me. Why did have to be the person that wants to live why couldn't it be me I want it to be me so badly.
