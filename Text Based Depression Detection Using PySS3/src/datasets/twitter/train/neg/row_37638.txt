Tired of Living for Someone ElseLong story short: had an unsuccessful suicide attempt, was hospitalized for two weeks, and now I can't finish the job because I thought with my heart strings and promised someone I wouldn't when they asked me to promise them I wouldn't. Anyone else get a feeling like that?
