What are some actual good reasons not to kill yourself?I'm at the point where I feel that I can't find anything worth living for - and I'm a fairly positive person as well, always trying to help others out, believing in the whole 'push through the hard times and things will get better', etc. - but now I'm just tired, and it's been this way for a while now. Number of calls to the suicide hotline is at a total of 5 just this year alone. 

Hmm, I'm not exactly a fan of the "your family and friends will be devastated" reason, or the whole "someone loves you" thing - I used to agree with it, but honestly, life goes on, no matter who lives and who dies. I can think of a few reasons why it'd be worth holding on, but they're all so... mundane. 

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has any reasons that may seem a bit better than the usual 'every day is a new day' type of stuff...
