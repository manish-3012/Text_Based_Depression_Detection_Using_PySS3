I honestly thought I was okay until recently..I was depressed when I was a sophomore in highschool. Family problems and what not, you know the usual. But now it's been like 4 years, and I'm depressed again. I worked out most of the family issues. Now it's love. Like the godsmack song love hate sex and pain. It's screwing with me for some reason. Every time I open up to a girl it ends the same way, getting pushed to the side. It's demoralizing when I try my hardest to be the best I can for someone and I still am not good enough. Today it happened, and its happens about 10 times in the past. I don't know what to do, Im at the end of my patience and these heart aches are rendering me dark, empty, and dead on the inside. Please, help me, i don't know what to do anymore. I just want someone to show that they want me as much as i want them, to be happy with someone.
