My uncle told me he should shoot himself. He was drunk. What should I do?His wife died recently, and we are both depressed about it. He drinks himself to sleep every night, but he has been hitting the sauce extra hard since my aunt died. He lives by himself now, so I only see how much he drinks when I visit. He owns a handgun for self defense. 
To quote him:

"I should burn the house down and shoot myself, just like my dad."

This scares the shit out of me. I'm also depressed, but not to the point of suicide. I don't know if I should tell a family member because what if he doesn't remember saying it? He was really drunk. Or what if he wasn't serious? He says all sorts of shit when he drinks. I just don't know if I should take this seriously or not. If I don't tell anyone and he does it, I won't be able to live with the guilt.
 Please help!
