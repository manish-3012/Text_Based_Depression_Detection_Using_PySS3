Apparently I have no family.I've been gone for some time from Reddit, geez. 
I've been having a rough time. Latley I've went back into school and I'm getting bullied again. I tell the staff and my parents, however it doesn't fix the problem. I just keep getting physically and mentally and verbally and cyber bullied. I found my parents don't really want me anymore and that my boyfriend to them is just another guy I'll run away with... they threatened me into going into the hospital and then I hated it up there. And they've almost put me into foster care... I have no goals and I'm doing horrible in school. I've gained 25 pounds so all my cloths on me are tight so I'm always uncomfortable and they won't buy me new ones.... I have a buckle collar that I wear all the time. Im considering on choking myself to death tonight on my door knob, after I take a bunch of pills. Last words... well I have a loving boyfriend who is ready to stay his life with me and as I am with him but I don't have enough patience with my parents that I fight with everyday... I can provide more info but for now this should sum stuff up.
