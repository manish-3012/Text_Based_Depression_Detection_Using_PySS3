I disappoint everyone.I hate myself. I'm young and I have everything ahead of me but nothing to live for. I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror without seeing a failure. I failed out of college wasted thousands of dollars that my parents gave to me for school so I can flunk out and be in debt. I've attempted suicide in the past and I failed. Now I'm just overwhelmed with sadness and I don't want to go into that dark state again. I really just want a hug and help right now. I'm an idiot for even complaining.
