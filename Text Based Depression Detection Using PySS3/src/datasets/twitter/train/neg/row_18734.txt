I can feel everything slipping.Ive been in high school for three and a half years now and I graduate in May. Im tired of living my life for other people, and being forced to do things in order to remain out of trouble with my parents. Ive started cutting only to realize I still donâ€™t feel anything. I even bring my girlfriend down and she is never happy with me anymore, everything seems like its going to be over soon, but I feel like I am slipping faster than the light at the end of the tunnel is coming. Im being dragged into the void of darkness; coming closer and closer to succumbing to the fate of others before me.
