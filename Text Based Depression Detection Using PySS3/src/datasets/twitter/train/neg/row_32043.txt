My visas keep getting refused and my future is fucked.I want to study abroad but I've overstayed in the US before and no country wants to grant me a visa. I have an 8.5 IELTS and 1570 SAT score and 4 A*s in my A Levels but it's all useless. The good universities in my country only allow me to sit for the exam once, but I failed them as I focused for my SAT and IELTS. Now I have to study in a shitty university that I'm overqualified for, plus I've got a gap year for no reason. My life is fucked. I've given up on life. There's no hope.
