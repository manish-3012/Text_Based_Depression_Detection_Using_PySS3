I quitTired of useless treatments that made and keep ruining my life.

The girl I like hates me and won't ever get a chance to show I changed

I don't know what to do, I went to 2 doctors, each one wants to destroy what the other one does.

Had Abilify injection, endured 3 weeks of horrible akathisia.

All for nothing. I don't want to be sad anymore
Last doc said I have BPD. 

It's not my fault. I just wanted to be happy
