Depression is always present and all-consumingOne thing I didnâ€™t realize before I started feeling depressed is how all-consuming and intrusive it is. I donâ€™t feel â€œdepressedâ€ sometimes and â€œokayâ€ sometimes.

Every moment, every relationship, every thing that brought me joy is intruded upon my my overwhelming feelings of despair and despondency. 

Itâ€™s honestly exhausting, not getting a break from the constant feeling. :(
