Putting on a fake smileIs what Iâ€™m doing all the time lately. 

I have a diagnosed serious mental illness. Iâ€™ve posted in our sub too but I guess Iâ€™m feeling desperate. Also Iâ€™ve been obsessed with reading about suicide lately and I ended up here. 

Iâ€™ve made 2 attempts of sorts. My plan involves driving to a specific location, so Iâ€™ve been stopped at the location. 

Iâ€™ve been hospitalized I believe 6 times now because I admitted my plans plus the two times I got caught. I also self harm and it used to be severe. But I have stopped that for the most part

Anyway, way too much backstory. Currently Iâ€™m a newlywed, with a really supportive and understanding husband. However, he hates when I go in the hospital. He misses me. He cries and says how hard it is for him and that he feels awful that he canâ€™t help me on his own. I tried to tell him not to take it personally, but I know it has to be hard to love someone so broken. So I stay out of the hospital. But Iâ€™m so suicidal right now. I got an IUD and the hormones I think are affecting my meds. I had the keys in hand and note written to go to my spot yesterday but I couldnâ€™t do it. I just picture Matt crying. My mom. Iâ€™m already such a burden. I canâ€™t work. I hardly drive. Iâ€™m unbearably useless. 

My illness is defining me right now. And I hate it. Iâ€™m trapped. All I can think about is ending the suffering. Stopping all the pain and turmoil. The feelings that are swallowing me. I can hardly breathe from it, but here I am with my fake smile. Some think Terminal cancer patients should be able to kill themselves. Well Iâ€™m never getting better. This illness wonâ€™t kill me, but I wish I was dead half the time. Please help me.
