I'm pretty sure I'm at the end.It began yesterday, feeling completely hopeless again. This is the last thing I have control over. I am disgusted by myself. I hate what I am, I can't live with it. I've thoroughly listed the pro's and con's and everything suggests doing what I thought I should. I've begun listing people to contact and writing my farewells. I don't know when exactly I'll do it, but probably within the week. I'm sorry.
