I honestly think it would just be better if I wasn't alive.I've gotten really fat.  Even if I lose all this weight I'll have a bunch of disgusting loose skin to greet me in the mirror when I take a shower.

I have a pathological inability to succeed at anything.  I don't even know what the point of life is.

Both of my divorced parents uninvited me from their respective "family vacations" this year.

I'm a piece of shit and I contribute nothing to the world.
