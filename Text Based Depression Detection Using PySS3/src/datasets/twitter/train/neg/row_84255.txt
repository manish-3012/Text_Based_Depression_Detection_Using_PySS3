Today turned to shit and I'm here again wondering why I don't just finish this.I was up late last night crying and wondering why I can't just grow the balls to end it and thanks to a few of you was feeling a little better by mid day but then my wife got involved and here I am once more. 
Why can't I just do it? I have plenty of means. Guns and what not but I just can't. My wife would only care because she'd have to do something. It would be so inconvenient to have to deal with my body. You'd think that would actually make it easier for me. My daughter doesn't give a damn. I'm just an asshole to her. I don't really have any friends and the one's out there wouldn't probably notice me going missing. I guess Mum and Dad might miss me but I doubt it. When I tried to talk to the wife I was told that my pity party wasn't cute anymore. She has no idea how bad this hurt and probably wouldn't care if she did. 

Why can't there be one person who loves me? I had that once and it hurts so bad to know it's gone. It's like it's there but I'm not allowed to have it. Life is so fucking cruel and I don't want to play anymore. I want to end it but I'm a giant wimp and can't do it. Funny that I can't even get that right. Well pathetic really.
