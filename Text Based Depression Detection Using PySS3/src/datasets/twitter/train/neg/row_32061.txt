I just don't knowIm sitting in my old highschool bedroom thinking about how I hung myself in this exact room last April and failed. I am 473 days sober from drugs I finished my first semester of college on the deans list. I have a very good source of income. I should be living the time of my life but instead im sitting in this room thinking about ending it. What is the point of living if i'll never feel as good as I did during my using years. I used drugs from a very young age and got clean at 17. Once I got clean everyone quickly realized I was always using to not have to think. I hate fucking thinking I am always depressed, anxious, or just losing my mind. I have been taking my meds and haven't had a hallucination in a long time. But I still don't see any sort of point in living. There is nothing for me here. Money doesn't bring happiness too me, doing drugs does. Tonight im either going to kill myself or relapse I can't fucking think anymore i've had enough.
