I've lost too much in 2020to attempt to even think about restarting my life, it's all gone, they took it off me, and oh they made sure i wasn't getting it back, i just want to single handedly destroy that juxtaposition of RSJ's they replaced my local trad clothing store with and dropped them all on the heads of these people who conspired against me, but no i can't do that.

&amp;#x200B;

This year will be like no other and there is no gurantee i will come out of it
