I'm losing my mind.my mom has breast cancer treatments happening all the time so there's no money for me to see a psychiatrist, see if there's a problem with my brain (i seriously believe there is) or anything. there's no more time for me to wait. i almost killed myself tonight and somehow managed to get to the computer before I stabbed myself in the heart. you're my last hope, reddit. please help.
