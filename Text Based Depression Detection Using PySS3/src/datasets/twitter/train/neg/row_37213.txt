I lost my job yesterday because I sounded "too depressed" on the phone. Feeling really hopeless right now.I've been suffering from depression for the past 2 years.  Considering suicide for almost that long, and it's been really bad lately.  And now I don't have a job. 

I don't feel ready to work again.  I can't stop thinking about killing myself.  Right now I'm thinking about self-harming (I've never self-harmed before) so I am staying in bed and not moving.

I want to tell my best friend because I need help but I always burden him with these things and I don't want to put this guilt on him.  It feels inevitable that I'm not going to last this year, and--I don't know.

I don't know what to fucking do help me please.
