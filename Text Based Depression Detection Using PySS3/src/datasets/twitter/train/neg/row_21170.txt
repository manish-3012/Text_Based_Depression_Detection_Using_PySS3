I feel like running away is the only cure to my suicidal thoughts*The title says the main point. But some backstory first.*

*Also i apologise for bad grammar, and if you find the post a bit confusing, and genereal lack of structure to this post. I dont quite know the best order to write my thoughts as they have been inside for a long time and are all intertwined.* *It is all written in one short go late at night*

*I am making this post because ive held my feelings in for far too long, and i need somewhere to output them. But i cannot even cry them away as i have spent years building myself up to not cry, so now i find it hard. Even if nobody comments on or reads this, it feels good to put it out there on paper and to show the world.*

**It started at home/ it may also be in my dna?**

I am seventeen years old and have wanted to die since i was eleven. When i first tried, I was not able to go through with it, and when I felt strong enough*(at thirteen)* I decided i couldn't kill myself as I knew how much pain it would bring my mother; which is perhaps the only reason I have been alive the past few years.

It started out from the feeling of neglect. My mum and dad arent bad people, but they dont have parenting skills. The way they and my two year older brother treat/treated gave me depression. I wouldnt say my brother bullied me, and i would usually win our fights until i was about thirteen, but he has been a vile and bitter person since he was nine, and it always came out on me. My parents wouldnt care to solve the core issues, they would only get involved when we were fighting, and i would ussualy end up with more of the blame. This isnt me being a self centred, close minded child, I am aware enough to know it is the truth, especially after years of pondering. My parents never truly listen to what i have to say, which always made me feel unloved and unworthy. This made it hard for me to want to express myself, and for many years now i have kept all my thoughts and emotions to myself, which only adds to the depression.

**My friendships were problematic/ I have no life**

My parents were always over concerned and would rarely leave the house.*(i got a lecture/shouting when i walked the dog to the park down the same road where i lived instead of the park only two houses down, i was twelve or thirteen)* I had a bit of a rebellious spirit to not do as im told and leave anyway, but the mood was usually killed by the depression and I would give up and stay home.

My social life is nothing to be proud of. My friends and I were always a bit socially awkward*(i noticed they were the ones with parents like mine)*, we never hung out much, or even message each other(most the time we saw each other was school) and we didnt get invited to many parties. It meant i felt as though i just couldnt talk to them about my bad feels. Most of the other kids i met were fond of me, nobody hated me but i just didnt hang out with them. It doesnt help how i moved cites a few times and had to find new friends*(i dont like having to get new friends, and that makes it hard)* This bad social life mad my depression worse as it made me feel as though nobody would even care, or perhaps not even notice, if i died. The lack of a social life also meant that i had a lot of time alone to delve into my negative thoughts, which made me feel worse.

I also didnt want to spend any time with my family, partly as being a kid always made me feel it was a lame thing for losers, and partly because of how i felt i was only not with my friends and having fun because of them. I spent a lot of time in my bed. My parents and brother would always say this was why i was always sad, but i was only in bed because i was sad.

**Girls and my love life/ my quest for meaning and fulfilment**

I was always good looking. Girls i knew were interested and coming up to me since i was twelve, although i was always too nervous to talk to them.*(even as one girl i had a crush on at twelve hugged me and told me she loved me, i was scared  so i just said 'ok'. I blame most of this nervous behaviour on my parents, always embarrassing me in front of girls, just one of the ways they failed with me; i dont hate my parents and this remark isnt born of anger)* But as i grew*(when i was fourteen/fifteen)* i was more confident and very charming as well as more attractive, i began to fool around with some of the girls from school, but didnt go for more.

To the end of being fifteen up until now i had a few girlfriends who i loved. When i got a new girlfriend, i felt as though i now had somebody to open up my heart to. All my feelings would emerge, but that would usually scare her off until she broke my heart, which only makes me more depressed*(all my relationships ended this way)* Within a lovers embrace I felt I could share my sorrow, but most of my pain was from the breakup that followed*(yes i am writing this shortly after a heart break, it is why the bad thought has come back to me, and now i have no girl to share with)* And some people would say its just silly young love, but I dont believe it to be so. I wouldnt tell a girl i loved her unless i could very much see myself marrying her. I gave my life to my girlfriends*(while i had them)* and i am prepared to end it all and kill myself on her command. This is an offer I make when they break up with me, i know it can be a lot to put on them, but I hate my own life and only want to live to have a family, but if no girl can love me enough to do so, i see no further purpose to myself and may as well die *(I suppose that I want a girl to tell me to kill myself, so i feel as though suicide is not wrong since it is sanctioned by my reason of existence)*

**A lack of purpose/ no future**

*(this ones short as im getting tired now)*

I feel as though my life is stagnating. I see myself at thirty with a dead-end job or unemployed, a family*(the one i was born with)* that I have many issues with, not studying for my desired education, and rarely seeing my friends who i cant even trust. All because i feel ill never find the motivation to do anything with my life. I also see all my relationships ending the same way, with me never being able to find a girl that truly loves me.*(ive almost accepted that that is my destiny)* Although i really need to find love while im young, because soon i will lose my mojo and my looks, and girls my age will be married, making it hard for me to find one. I will get old and that is the only difference i see to my life compared to how it is now. My hairline has already begun to recede. The only positives i see to growing up are that ill have no non-monetary issues to obtaining alcohol anymore*(which i see myself becoming an alcoholic)*

**Running away/ a new life**

*(too sleepy to write or think of what to write)*

I feel as though if my life continues the way i dread, I will not flourish or be happy in the modern global society. I feel as though the only path to happiness is to run away to somewhere simpler*(i was thinking rural mongolia/tibet)* But i dont know if i can make it; i feel as though i am permanently broken and will never be able to make myself do it*(to broken i dont look forward to suicide as a pain reliever anymore, just as a convenience)*
