I don't know anymoreI'm a depressed wreck laying in bed, just writing, idk if I'll post this or not, so if I do, hi, I don't care that I'm not using a throwaway, it's not like anyone knows who I am, so I'm just going to start typing and see what happens, so here goes it. Being in r/suicidewatch you can probably tell I've had suicidal thoughts, but why? Because I'm a failure, I failed school twice, I've been avoiding setting up an appointment with a specialist with my family doctor to see what's up with my head, constant intrusive thoughts, I don't know what it's like to have a clear head or whatever, I just spend my days getting high(which is going to stop soon due to me not having the money for it) and playing video games too depressed to fix my life, I have no motivation to do anything, except play games and smoke weed, I'm an awful brother and son, my single mom who raised me and my sister alone with her mom doesn't need the stress from the constant arguing when she has to care for my autistic 16yo sister, I just fuck everything up, I won't amount to anything, I'm a waste of space, I might just start spending my days laying on the train tracks
