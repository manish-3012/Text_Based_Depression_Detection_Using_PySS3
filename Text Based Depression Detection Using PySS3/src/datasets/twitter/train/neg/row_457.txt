October 2021Everything I do seems to push me away or someone away from me. Friends stay until there life gets better then Iâ€™m left behind. Iâ€™ve changed jobs to experience new people and new environment but still feel this emptiness. How much can one person take till itâ€™s just enough. I love to big but get no love back. I turn 30 in October. If I canâ€™t fill this hole or find someway to maybe be happy for a chance in my life, Iâ€™m gonna just call it quits. Is it suicide tho?
