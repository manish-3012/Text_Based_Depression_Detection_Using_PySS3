UniversityHey there reddit. For the past two years I had a reason to live. And everything was great. Whenever my depression got too bad i was able to control it because i was hoping that things would get better if i got into university for illustration. Its the only thing i care about. Today my first rejection letter came in and im still waiting for the other two responses. I will probably get rejected from both of them since i was rejected by my 3d choice which is an easier school to get into than the other 2. Im not sure if i cant handle being rejected by all the universities i applied to. Im not sure if I'll be able to find the motivation and reapply next year. I know its a very mundane problem to have. But i dont have anything else in my life that gives me a reason to continue living and art is the only thing i thought i was good at.
