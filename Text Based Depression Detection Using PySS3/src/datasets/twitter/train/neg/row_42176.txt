I've given up recentlyI've given up recently because im trying so hard to be happy trying everything possible while trying to keep friends happy and stable on school, relationships, and just being friends with them but also on how i cant keep being myself anymore and that hurricane Irma is coming for me im thinking of just going outside during it and hoping i die quick, i dont own a gun, forgot to buy rope and dont really wanna go through a slow death in which i could get saved. Idk what to do anymore.
