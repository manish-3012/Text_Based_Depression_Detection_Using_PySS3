Losing the battleEverything has turned to shit.  I got pretty sick last year and was out of work.  Losing the house, declaring bankruptcy, marriage is on the rocks...I'm constantly thinking of suicide.  Pawned off all of my guns to help with bills but there are other ways.  The only thing stopping me is the fear that I'll fuck it up and end up on a vent as a quasi-vegetable.
I don't care how it will affect anybody left behind. I'll be gone and it won't matter.
Slowly, day by day, I'm losing the will to continue. I'm just tired of the day to day shit.  Tired of failing. Tired of being pissed off and pissed on.  If I could take a single pill right now and be 100 percent sure that it would end my life, I would do it.
