Breakdown incomingI fully tidied my room and changed my bedding. Know it donâ€™t sound like Iâ€™m gonna have a breakdown to a lot of people but Iâ€™m about to go down a manic road. Cut up my knuckle when tidying and Iâ€™m that numb it donâ€™t even hurt me. Ughfhdjdj why canâ€™t I just die already? Iâ€™m too numb and depressed to even kms which is ironic as itâ€™s the reason why I want to kms rn.
