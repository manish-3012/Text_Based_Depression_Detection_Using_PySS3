I'm so confused....I don't know if this is even the place for this to be honest.... but I'm terrified of losing my friends and family.

I have fucked up so many times, ruining my amazing friendships time and time again... sometimes i thought to highly of people who turned out to be a complete lier, just using me.

I try to fix my issues so i stop ruining my friendships, yet i keep doing it again and again and again and again and a fucking again.... i don't know why i can't fix myself, now im terrified il lose my amazing best friend Haru/Riaru (not real name of course) because of my stupid fucking issues..

Also i feel like lie to myself all the time, i used to be suicidal (not anymore) but i keep thinking "did i REALLY feel like ending it?" Or was i just faking it... lying to myself, same with feeling depressed "was i REALLY?" Or was it all just in my head and im actually completely fine

Im sorry if this wasn't the place for this... just didn't know where else to write this, im scared i might really become suicidal over my own uncertainty.
