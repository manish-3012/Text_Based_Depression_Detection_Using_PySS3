27 years old. my psychologist says rid his hands of meI am 27 years old. Still in college. No degree I've been attending for 11 years. I've just given up. I don't have any actual friends. I have a lying problem. And can't get focused. I have ADHD and take meds. They don't help anymore. I am going to shoot myself. Deer slug. My job won't let me get help. Industry I am attempting to get into will auotmatically blacklist me.

I am a failure and have hurt my parents emotionally and financially. I have done so much to betray them. My puppy doesn't even like me anymore. I literally have no one now. My doctor even said my parents should just kick me out. 

EDIT: things are going like expected. I know the place I am going to do it.  A spot I use to get taken to by my papou. Yiayia would cut slices of bread into squares and we would walk the two blocks to the inlet And feed the ducks.
