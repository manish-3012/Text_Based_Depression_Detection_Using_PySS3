At 2PM I'm going to take 65 LorazapamI'm sick of this shit it's never enough for anyone they always find some little detail to pick about. The only place I feel accepted is my damn bed with the lights off and it's the one place where no once want's me to be. I feel scared and helpless to do anything about it.
