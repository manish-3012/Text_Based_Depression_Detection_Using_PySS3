When discussing Suicide with a professional what should be avoided?I've recently begun reaching out for help as a result of my suicidal ideation. I've thought about killing myself multiple times a day for the past 8 months now, and I'm afraid that if I begin to talk to a mental health professional about my darkest thoughts that they're going to put me in the funny farm. Does anyone have any experience with involuntary commitment as a result of suicidal ideation? Or of any way I can talk about these dark thoughts I have without being locked up? Thanks.
