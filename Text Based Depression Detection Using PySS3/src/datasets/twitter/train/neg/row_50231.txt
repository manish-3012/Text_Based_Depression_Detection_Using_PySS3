Iâ€™m still loosing the desire to live here, everyday Iâ€™m sinking,I push people away

The way the world is, I canâ€™t see myself living in it..

Love is horrible, itâ€™s emotionally scarred me

Sex is horrifying to me

I donâ€™t feel like anyone would really care once Iâ€™m gone

Iâ€™m alone

I never left a legacy

I never made anyone happy 

Iâ€™m a burden

Iâ€™m complicating

Iâ€™m â€œcrazyâ€ ( I genuinely feel like I am )

These sequence of events are pointing directly at my death date, I donâ€™t find myself living much longer...I wonâ€™t even think Iâ€™ll survive this year. Iâ€™m honestly afraid, but hurt, fragile, depressed, angry, frustrated, though Iâ€™m more accepting of my feelings. I know I wonâ€™t survive very long, I just wanna leave at least something here, to at least help people and make others happy, then Iâ€™ll go...

However, I feel like Iâ€™d pull the trigger anyway, before I could even do that.
