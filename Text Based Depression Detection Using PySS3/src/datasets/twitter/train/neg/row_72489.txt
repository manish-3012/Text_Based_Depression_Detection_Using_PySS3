I just feel nothing let me rant a bitMy life has been crumbling around me since the beginning of the year. It pretty much started when I lost my religion, that was really horrible for me. Since then for some reason this triggered repressed memories in me about sexual assaults that happened when I was a child through to my teen years. Iâ€™ve had anxiety and depression ever since I can remember but recently things have changed I have become reckless, like before I lost my faith I didnâ€™t do certain things due to it but now I just feel like whatâ€™s the point. Iâ€™m 23 and a few months ago I got drunk for the first time and I did drugs for the first time. I cut ties with all my friends. Iâ€™m completely alone. I feel like my mother prefers my sister to me and I just canâ€™t relate with my family anymore. I just feel nothing. My family recently found out that my grandmother is dying and I feel nothing. I havenâ€™t cried at all and I know Iâ€™m a horrible person for that. Like I havenâ€™t felt anything in months Iâ€™m just numb. I am still a virgin and I planned to wait until I found the right one but what would be the point of that. Maybe sex will make me feel less numb? I joined dating apps and Iâ€™ve been talking to much older guys and sending nudes, which is something I absolutely would have never done before, and I know they donâ€™t like me or want to be around me they just want my body, they donâ€™t want me to be their girlfriend they just say that to get what they want, and once they get that theyâ€™ll leave too. I have a bottle of sleeping pills but I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m brave enough to actually do it.
