Fuck man my brother just hit homeIâ€™ve been trying to drink myself to death for the past (almost) 2 years now. I basically go through phases of blacking out and binging and other than that I just drink to pass out. My blood test shows Iâ€™m a smoker M/24 and my liver is fine unfortunately I guess for now. My brother has FINALS tomorrow/ this week (Iâ€™ve graduated) and he is basically saying fuck man I canâ€™t live without you when I was explaining alcohol withdrawals to him. God I wish I wasnâ€™t a pussy I wanted to end it months ago but I just canâ€™t do that to some people. Iâ€™ve been trying to push people away for a long time and it pisses me off when people â€œtry to understandâ€. R/suicidewatch donâ€™t keep me from doing it just talk to me. TY from TT
