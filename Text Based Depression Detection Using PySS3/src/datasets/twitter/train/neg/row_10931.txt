I hung myself and was unconscious for 22 seconds.22 seconds.

For 22 seconds, I was unaware of the pain. Ignorant of the inevitable loneliness. Twenty-two seconds of not pondering the nothingness of existence.
I tied a belt around my neck, and tied a knot in the other end so it wouldn't slip out of the doorjamb when I closed it. The blood in my neck could not reach my head. I don't remember passing out, but it didn't take more than five seconds. It didn't even hurt. I remember what part of the song I last heard. Then nothing; next the feeling of speeding toward something. I jerked awake because my body had started twitching, and I heard the song again. Later after looking at the timing, I discovered it was 22 seconds. 
And now I'm asking myself: should I try it again, or should I tell someone?

Twenty-two seconds.
