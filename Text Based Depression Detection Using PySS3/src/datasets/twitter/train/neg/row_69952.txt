Someone that could potentially be suicidal.So around 3am my wife calls me to tell me she's creeped out (I'm at work). She goes on and tells me a friend she knows texts her out of the blue. She knows this guy from high school back in 2010 and maybe 6 months ago from today reach out to him for fitness advice but he ended up being narcissistic ahole. Anyway he texted her out of the blue saying that he is going to off himself and it's all because of these random girls, (straight to the point) wife kind of ignores him because she was surprised and not really sure what to say. So he starts calling her non stop, she ignores him and then he starts texting, wife starts getting suspicious with his context because he begins to threathen people saying "if I off my self I'm taking you fake people with me". Wife tries to listen to him to show that someone's there, but after that comment she starts getting worried that he might actually hurt others. Should we report it? We tried to investigate further but he deleted all of his 2018 posts which my wife recalls being depressing lyrics and shit.
