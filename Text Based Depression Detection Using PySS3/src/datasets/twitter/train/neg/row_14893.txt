what's the point?I'm 17, this is my last week of senior year and I don't think that I can graduate with my poor grades. I went to the same school for most of my life and I had to transfer from a VERY (graduating senior class of about 25) small school to a large one (graduating class is about 300). It's been very hard and stressful and I've received no help at all, and I have no idea who to ask for help, and my anxiety prevents me from actually seeking it.

My mental state has been deteriorating since middle school-- I used to not feel depressed as often but at this point I'm depressed and cry everyday, I've tried to kill myself multiple times in 2017 and I've already attempted once this year. I have horrible paranoia to the point that I can't sleep at night most of the time and delusions that there's a demon inside of me and that everyone is attempting to kill me or is out to make me struggle. I struggle with bad intrusive thoughts of hurting people for no reason, with no trigger besides that I get angry sometimes, but usually it's unprompted. 

I'm really worried about my boyfriend, he struggles with a lot of issues that I have but I'm so worthless, I can't even help him. I feel like such a burden. He supports me and is basically my strength to get out of bed.

My mother finally put me with a therapist last year, and I even have an appointment for a medicine review coming. However it feels like at this point. I'm a total failure because I'm going to fail senior year and my family already hates me and berates me enough. My mom might be understanding but she's going to be disappointed and I feel like it's going to kill me.

It just feels so hopeless. It feels like the only way I can repent for everything that I am is to kill myself.
