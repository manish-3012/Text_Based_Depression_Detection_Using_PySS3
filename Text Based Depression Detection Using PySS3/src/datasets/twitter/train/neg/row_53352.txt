Do people react more to losing someone by suicide?People grieve those who die. I guess when people kill themselves, others react with anger and confusion along with sadness. And there isnâ€™t really a period of terminal illness, so people canâ€™t prepare. But death is death. Wouldnâ€™t a parent react in roughly the same way if their child died in a car accident? I think so, except for the whole â€œwe could have done something to stop itâ€ thing. Itâ€™s weird to me how people view death by suicide so differently.
