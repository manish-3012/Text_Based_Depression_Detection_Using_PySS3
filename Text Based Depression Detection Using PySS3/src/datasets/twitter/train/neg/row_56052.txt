I've never considered it seriously until today.I've had an amazing life, I'm so fortunate it is really incredible. I've also gone through more hardship than most, not even counting the time when I was fighting overseas. I grew up in a wealthy family, until they lost everything. I've been going to college on my own dime, I've spent 10 years in and out of school just trying to make money and take classes. I was going to give up on school until I met my now girlfriend a little over a year ago. I finished my last project today to get my architecture degree, I presented and it went really great.

Here is the thing, She doesn't know it, but every decision I make is to be better for her. Being completely honest, I'm a really great boyfriend. I also am pretty certain she is going to break up with me tomorrow. Don't know why, apparently it has nothing to do with me. I just never realized she was this important to me that I don't want to be alive without her. I'm not going to tell her I'm thinking of killing myself, I wouldn't put her in that position. I have nobody I can talk to, I've lost any friend I was that close to. I'm not even sure I want to talk.
