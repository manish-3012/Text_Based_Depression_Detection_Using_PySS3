Involuntary suicidal ideation.For a long time, in response to a thought that produces a negative reaction, my mind involuntarily blurts out "you need to kill yourself" or "commit suicide". I do this probably a hundred times per day. I don't plan on doing this, but it has caused me a lot of distress. Should I be worried? Is this depression, OCD, or something else?
