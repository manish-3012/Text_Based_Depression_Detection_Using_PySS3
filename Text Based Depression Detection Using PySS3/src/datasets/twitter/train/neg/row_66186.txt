Trying not to do something I will regret.Iâ€™ve been a bit spammy on reddit lately. Iâ€™ve already posted once tonight. Sorry. Mentally, Iâ€™ve been all over the place this past week or so.
I donâ€™t have anyone else I can speak to right now. It would hurt them all too much.
Decided to post here because I ended up going to my kitchen and holding a knife for a while. Iâ€™ve never cut, but I desperately wanted to. I want to hurt my body. I guess itâ€™s a â€œIf I canâ€™t have it nobody canâ€ 
I canâ€™t be hospitalized for the next two weeks, so Iâ€™m just trying to get through this. 
Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll end up with something through my throat soon enough.
