I quit my job. Live in my little brothers room. All my stuff is in storage. I have no income now to pay for it.See title. No job. No friends. No car. And now I have no way of paying for my storage bill, phone bill or credit cards that are racked up. I honestly feel like we are being brainwashed from a young age to serve the rich, like the new version of the slaves in the field. What backs this up is that a lot of the rich business owners are actually descended from slave owners. They have most of society convinced that "they can get rich just like them!" yet that never happens. Most people you hear about making a good living had rich parents.
