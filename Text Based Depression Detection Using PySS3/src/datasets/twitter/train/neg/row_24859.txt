My doctor has increased my sertraline dose but she doesn't realise I'm a lost cause and I still want to dieI went to see my doctor after a month from seeing her previously and since I self harmed a week ago, she has increased my dose to 100mg. She doesn't realise that increasing the dose of my pills won't help at all. Medication won't work and neither will talking about my problems. I don't see how either would help but it just seems absolutely pointless. She doesn't know I'm suicidal because there is no way that I would tell her that. I don't want to be sent to a hospital. I'm just trying to fake being okay so I can finally die when I have the chance. I'm literally constantly waiting for the chance I can get to end my life. The thought of death makes me so happy which others may find absurd. I want to fly as an angel away from all of this pain.
