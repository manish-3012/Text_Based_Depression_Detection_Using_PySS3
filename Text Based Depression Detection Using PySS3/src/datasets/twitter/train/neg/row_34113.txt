Is anyone here from Australia?Hi.

I'm just about to spend my first night alone for 3 and a half years after my girlfriend left me. I'm not sure how I am going to cope, my thoughts are terrible and I just want someone to call me and distract me with how I'm feeling.

I'm really not okay right now. I need help but I don't want to call the police.
