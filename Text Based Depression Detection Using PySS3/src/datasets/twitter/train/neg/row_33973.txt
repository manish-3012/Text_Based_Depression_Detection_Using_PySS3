The PainWhen I talk to my friends about the pain, they have no clue what iâ€™m on about. Like itâ€™s in my chest it feels like a weight is hanging from my chest and my heart is holding it up but sometimes it gives in, it follows me around every day, it has its triggers and it also happens at really random moments. Am I weird? I think itâ€™s grief, it also sometimes comes in the form of flusters and I get really hot around my head. Like none of my friends have ever had experienced pain that follows them everywhere like this... 
I just started a course of antidepressants to try to numb it, itâ€™s been going on for like 9-10 months now. Itâ€™s like my own personal hell, just hoping someoneâ€™s in here with me as much as I wouldnâ€™t wish this upon anyone.
