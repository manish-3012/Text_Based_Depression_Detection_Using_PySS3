HelpI donâ€™t know how long has it been since being surrounded by this negativity and darkness. Itâ€™s getting worse, Iâ€™m breaking down multiple times a day. My used-to-be-huge appetite is now gone. Iâ€™m starving. I have no appetite. I have NO interest to do anything. My school work is affected, Iâ€™m straying from my family. Suicide is on my mind all the time. I sleep most of the day away. I hate it. My emotions are taking over me. 

My logic which I heavily depended on previously is now fading, Iâ€™m reckless. Disgusted. Conflicted all the time. Sleep is my only escape but whenever my eyes open in the morning, I feel only dread and despair. Iâ€™m reaching my witâ€™s end. My rationale side tells me to not do anything stupid. My dad is gone already from an accident. Me leaving would devastate my family and my mum. I canâ€™t bear to hurt her. I love her. But at the same time Iâ€™m hurting so bad. I donâ€™t know how to deal with this. Iâ€™m hyperventilating as Iâ€™m typing this. 

I donâ€™t know who to turn to.
