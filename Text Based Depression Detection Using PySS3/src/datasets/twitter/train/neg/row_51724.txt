Iâ€™m 40 and dealing with an STDI waited until I was married to have sex. I was 29. Even though we were both virgins, I always used condoms because she didnâ€™t like the side effects of birth control.

After two years or so, she decided she was â€œboredâ€ and left me in a sexless marriage for years. Then I got divorced.

At age 36, I finally found someone willing to have sex with me again. She claimed she didnâ€™t have any STDs. For some reason, I believed her.

Six months later, I notice the tip of my penis looks blue. A mole Iâ€™ve had since birth turned into a wart. There are black dots near my urethra.

I get an STD test. Itâ€™s negative. A doctor examines my penis and doesnâ€™t identify any STD.

Still, Iâ€™m worried itâ€™s something. I do more research and realize itâ€™s probably HPV.

I get the mole-turned-wart surgically removed. However, the tip still looks bluish and those black dots are still there. I hear HPV can go away after two years.

I turn 39. If anything, it looks worse.

I went to a different clinic this time. They actually identified new almost undetectable warts and give me imiquimod cream for those.

Iâ€™ve been doing that for a month. No effectâ€”except for a red rash (a side effect) in the tip of the tip of my penis that doesnâ€™t seem to be going away. Now itâ€™s blue and gray and bumpy and itâ€™s just... a nightmare.

Iâ€™ve been involved romantically but not sexually with someone recently. Iâ€™ve been terrified about revealing this. Sometimes Iâ€™ll let slip things like â€œIâ€™m a freakâ€ and, subconsciously, I think I pushed her away.

Now I donâ€™t even have that. Crumbs. It was all I had.

I used to be proud of my member. Now itâ€™s just... a horror show. I donâ€™t want to live with that for the rest of my life. I canâ€™t.
