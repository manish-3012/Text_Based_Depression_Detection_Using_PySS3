I feel like such an attention seeking bitch for posting this on here but please I need helpI'm finally starting to realize my future, school more school, work all day etc. I'm currently in highschool and my teachers are constantly pushing on me about my grades and my attendance and I'm so damn tired of it, they keep calling my mom and emailing her about it and she understands that it's hard for me but I feel like such a burden since the calls and messages stress her out so much I'm genuinely considering suicide now so I can just stop this life and be done with all this I don't know what to do anymore.
