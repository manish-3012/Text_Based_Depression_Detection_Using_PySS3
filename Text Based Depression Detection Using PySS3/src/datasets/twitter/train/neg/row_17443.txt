I just want to be happyI feel like nothing good can come from my life. I just want to be happy. I just want to fall in love and have someone fall in love with me too. 

Today I put a rifle up to my head and clicked it off safety and placed my hand on the trigger. But I was too scared to actually go through with it but that was the closest I have ever come to taking my own life. I just had to get that off my chest.
