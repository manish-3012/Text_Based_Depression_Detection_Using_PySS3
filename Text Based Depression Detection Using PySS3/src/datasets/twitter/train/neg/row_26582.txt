feeling like im at the edge again lolso ig I haven't felt this depressed in about a year, but its only been 6 months since it started to get better. now ig due to everything going on personally im back at where i started. I finally lost my grandfather so all i have left is my other grandfather lost both my grandmas last summer. tried or well came out 2 my girlfriend about being a sort of closeted femboy and well she didn't take it as i expected were still together but now i feel like a let down. with school online now the little bit of social interaction i would get is even less now. I have only one other friend other than my gf thanks to reddit im happy about that at least but yeah. oh and with Americas current economy i don't even know if i'll be able to get a job next summer when i graduate with a degree in mechatronics and thats because i choose that degree for its job prospects. also applied for SSDI got denied trying to appeal since i haven't been able to get a job and the few i have fired me for poor performance. i cant help it i autistic i have adhd i try damit im trying i just do see myself going anywhere. everything's failin me and i keep trying to see the light and i cant i mean i thought coming out to my gf would help ease our relationship and like make it more open instead now im just afraid ill lose the only person who i feel happy with now. and i dont even care about therapy or treatment or whatever anymore pills make me numb and change nothing. therapists 4 me aren't consistent and i always get a new one cause they all quit from the clinic i go 2. been thinking that when my student refund comes around i could finally get around to buying away out finally i just im so tired of all this. 19 and life is still hell no matter how hard i try to make it better. i fuckin hate my life at this point im so close to giving up and now i can actually do something about it and that scares me yet empowers me lol
