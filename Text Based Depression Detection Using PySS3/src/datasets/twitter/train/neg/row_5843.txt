lots of support, no one to talk toi have thought of suicide for 6 years, and been hospitalized 5 times in the past 4 years for mental illness (primarily eating disorder). i have plenty of people who support me, primarily my dad and boyfriend. i have been feeling extremely suicidal, especially today, so i called my dad at work and he sounded disappointed. i ended up feeling worse after talking to him and more like a failure. especially since he said that he sees suicide as a cop out. and he would be a mess if i went through with it. so now here i am, crying hysterically alone at home, feeling stupid for dragging my dad into this, weak for feeling this, and scared for my life. i canâ€™t keep living like this. i dont know who to talk to. i donâ€™t want to talk to my therapist in case she sends me back to treatment, i tried the suicide hotline and it was useless, i donâ€™t want to burden my boyfriend who has already dealt with so much and has his own shit to deal with, idk what to do. iâ€™m sick of being the failure. i want to be a fully functioning human being. why is it so goddamn impossible and who can i talk to about it that will actually help and wonâ€™t make me feel like a burden???
