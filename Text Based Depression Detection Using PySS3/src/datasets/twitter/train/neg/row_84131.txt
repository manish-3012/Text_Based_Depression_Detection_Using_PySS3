What's the Point?Hey all~
  



       So, I feel a bit uneasy posting here because I'm so young to be feeling this way (16). I honestly don't see a purpose in life. I go though the same repetitive routine every day, and honestly can't see a light at the end of the tunnel. I've had thoughts of suicide before because of stress and frustration but at this point I don't even feel stressed; I just feel like I'm going through the motions of life with no end goal. I have been blessed with a great life; attending a great private school, playing the highest available level of hockey, and my family is financially stable. I have plenty of friends, good grades, and have been blessed with 5 siblings. I feel guilty for feeling this way because I know there are so many people out there that have it much worse off than I do. I'm not upset about anything, I just kinda feel *useless*. I have talents and things I excel in, but I still feel like I can't make a difference and life is just waiting to die. I want to die without going through the pain of killing myself, and I do not want to hurt my friends and family by killing myself. I just kinda wish I will go to sleep and not wake up. All of my friends and family think I have everything completely under control, but I'm actually just really good at hiding my lack of hope. My dad is a very strict man, which I understand. He sacrifices alot to give me and my siblings all the opportunities we have to succeed. I feel like my life is just one long repetitive cycle, eventually ending with me dying. If it's gonna happen anyway, why not now?
