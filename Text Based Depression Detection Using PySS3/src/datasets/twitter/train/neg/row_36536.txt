Nothing ever gets better you fucking hypocritesI will never get better. I will never be happy. I am unable to do anything correctly. I am a sickening disgusting piece of filth. I just want to hurt because it's what I deserve. I am not loved, I am not cared about, my death will change nothing, I will not be missed.

The pain never stops. All I want is for the pain to stop and there's no other way. It's decades of suffering or a moment that leads to everlasting bliss and peace. Death is the ultimate goal of life. Life is a prison, death is the ultimate escape.
