I wont ever be normalI've never been normal or able to control my emotions properly. My childhood was filled with rage and violence. I felt abandoned in middle school. And now as a senior in high school, I'm learning all about the sick twisted evils of the world. I'm lonely, depressive, lazy, and neurotic. I took crazy high amounts of mushrooms and acid and I saw evil jester faces and demons that laughed at me. I dont feel any ill will towards anyone. Actually, quite the opposite. I feel like something bad is going to happen to me on behalf of these fucking jokers in my head. Mental illness runs in my family. My cousin just had  psychosis and he said "I thought I was going to be killed."  I feel like soon im either going to off myself or completely lose touch with reality. I put on a mask everyday and act like a class clown to hide the fact that my own head is ripping me apart from the inside. I have no hope for myself or for the world. The only thing that can make me think I'm content is smoking weed and listening to reggae. I wish the world wasn't so chaotic and uncertain.
