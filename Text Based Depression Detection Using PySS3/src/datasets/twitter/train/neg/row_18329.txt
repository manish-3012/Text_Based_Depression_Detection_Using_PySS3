I hate medication but Iâ€™m forced to take it.Have been on various antidepressants and antipsychotics for 5 years. I stopped taking them about a month ago just because I was sick of them and scared about what they might be doing to
me....
and I felt so much better. Well, firstly I went into a hypomanic episode making me feel really confident and excited and hyper so it would make sense I felt better.
But that passed and I still felt the mental clarity, better focus, more energy and greater motivation/control over actions.
The thing is, because of the hypomania and the fact I am now quite sensitive/crashing into depression my parents are forcing me to take the antipsychotics to stabilise my mood. 
Itâ€™s so frustrating because I feel as if medication is a mask to numb the feelings and keep me controlled.
Iâ€™m terrified I am going to fail school because my work quality went through the roof when I wasnâ€™t taking them and now Iâ€™m back on them :(
