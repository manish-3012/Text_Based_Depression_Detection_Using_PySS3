Narcissist LosingI havent been diagnosed officially as a Narcissist, but a psychologist friend of mine pointed out that I exhibit traits of vulnerable narcissist of cluster B personality. I have done few research and I believe she was right. 

I have been lying about my success to everyone around me. But truth is I was terrible, I was unemployed for 2 years, I used to lie to people that I am at work. I got back to school to finish my undergrad. My course is getting over soon, I am going fail real hard. People are going to know I am a failure and shit person. Its killing me every day, I have anxiety attacks thinking about it.  I stopped using any social media, stop meeting people. But I know I cant run for long. Only way I can end this is by ending my life.
