I can't do this anymore.I don't know what else I can do. I'm at the point of no return. My depression only gets worse everyday. I don't even have a real reason for it. It just hit me one day and everything fell apart. I thought once, I could rebuild. I don't think that anymore. I think I've made my peace with it. This is how it has to end. This or just more pointless suffering. I don't know why I'm even bothering to write this. Maybe some kind of survival instinct. Maybe I just want to leave a note of some kind. Either way, I'm gone.
