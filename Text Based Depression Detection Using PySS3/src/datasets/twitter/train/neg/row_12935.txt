Things seem so bad and weird right nowI always struggled with trying to be happy for some time and trying to be satisfied with life but lately things just seem so bad. Things just don't seem fun anymore and it's terrifying to me because i used to enjoy going out and being with people and now i just feel like i want to go home and i feel out of place. Iv'e also had some nightmares since September but it was about once a week then and now it's almost every single day and it's always about something i hate about myself and i just wake up so scared and alone. I haven't been able to sleep for more than 3 hours in the last couple of weeks out of fear and it's starting to really affect me. I have an appointment with a therapist on the 26th of February but i'm scared i might cancel it or do something stupid before that and i want to go but it looks so far away from now and i'm just scared. I want to tell my family and my friends but my mom already told me i shouldn't be having these bad feelings since im only 18 and now im scared to tell the rest of my family and my friends always see me as the helping guy and i don't know how they'll react to what i'm feeling. I don't really know what my point is I just feel so lost and i don't know what to do.
