Dark daysI tried to kill myself today. I didn't have the plan together....I just kept taking meds until i had over 5000 mg of Effexor and a ton of other meds. I four queasy and threw up a little later.  Im shaky, twitchy, and my heart is pounding. Trying to calm down but I'm on edge.  As an aside, I'm a veteran and i did 4 tours in Iraq an 2 in other places. Everyday I'm haunted by the memories of my Iraq time.

Today, my wife and i fought. She says I'm pushing her away and disrespecting her. I started off with doubling up my Effexor this morning and kept taking more. She doesn't know i tried to od and is still ignoring me. I don't know what tomorrow brings but I'm determined to see thing through tomorrow...

... for now.
