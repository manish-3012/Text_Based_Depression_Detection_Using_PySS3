Home is where the heart isHey all. I'm 19, male, single; typical throwaway child. I'm working in the summer to pay for college, every day I come home to my parents shouting at me for the smallest of things and in particular my father making me feel like shit then when I try to make things better getting physically aggressive and telling me how he never did X,Y or Z (whatever the insult of the day is) if his father asked him too. Worst part is that even if I do the things they ask for they make up that I was disrespectful and Mum lies about what I say to dad to make him even angrier. 
I have to hold myself back every day from hitting my dad; because I know if I hit him once I'll start a fight which ends in one of us seriously hurting the other. My mother is a manipulating and cruel person who uses me to get her way with dad and my sister; turning them against me so she can use me as a straw man. To add insult to injury whenever anybody from outside the family comes round she acts like it's just perfect between us. Recently she has started saying unless I do everything she says she won't help me get by (i.e why I started working over the summer) seeing as the government loans don't even cover the cheapest accommodation where I study term time, it's quite hard to fathom that somebody would do that out of "Love". 

I feel like the world is falling from beneath me, I don't have any respite and there is constant abuse from work then home. Each night I want to go down to the train station or the highway and throw myself in front of something to end it, I'm sorry to clutter the board to be honest; I feel that everyone else is in such a worse position and I'm just a whining teenager.
First reddit post too so forgive me for my ignorance if I get anything wrong.
