I thought things were supposed to get easierI figured I should post here, I don't want to talk to someone over the phone, too much anxiety. I don't know if I would have the courage to actually follow through with it anyways. I just feel really really fucking lonely. things have been slow at my job, I haven't had work all week, so naturally I haven't eaten a full meal or left the house in 3 days. I've lost 35 pounds in the last 2 months, I'm falling apart. I don't even know where to begin to find people to be friends with. I have friends, don't get me wrong, but I don't want to put this shit on them. I moved back in with my family because I was too lonely working so far away, but I feel worse than I ever have before. I've always just fantasized about finally doing it, but when I caught myself researching exactly how messy it would be if I ate bucksot I thought I would try here. I don't feel very good anymore and I can't remember the last time I have.
