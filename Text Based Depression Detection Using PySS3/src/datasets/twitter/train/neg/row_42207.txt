WHY CANT I BE NORMALI cant do this anymore my life is miserable. I have anxiety and depression and I cant handle it anymore seeing all of my peers having time of their lives while I am sitting at home all the time. Even tho if I go out I have panic attacks and feel uncomfortable and I hate it. Every single year it feels worse and worse.. I tried to talk to other people but I cant. Only people I dont feel anxiety talking to are my parents. I have couple of friends but we are not very close we play games together sometimes and we go out  but I feel like Im gonna lose them cause I dont want to go out cause of my anxiety. My professors are making my life even harder cause they keep humiliating me. Ive been bullied and I cant keep on going anymore Im tired of this plus im living in small town in a poor country, I dont know what am I going to do in the future. I feel like its over for me
