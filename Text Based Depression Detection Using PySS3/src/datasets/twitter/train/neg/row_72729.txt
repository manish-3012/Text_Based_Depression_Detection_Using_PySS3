I don't want to die aloneThe only person I trust doesn't believe me and has cut me off, which I understand. I asked for help and he wouldn't. So I'm ready to leave- I have everything I need taken care of, I've let go of life, I know this is what's best for me and more importantly everyone around me. But still I feel so afraid of spending my last moments alone. I so badly want someone to hold my hand and tell me they understand.
