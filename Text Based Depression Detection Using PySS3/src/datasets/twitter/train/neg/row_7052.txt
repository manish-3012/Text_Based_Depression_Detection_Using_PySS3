Im tired.I dont honestly think Im going to kill myself. Im too weak. Too much of a coward. I know I don't have it in me.

However. I know that should a chain of events occur that would lead to my death. I would never actively stop it.

I dont feel sad, or angry or even hurt. Just resigned and bitter at my upbringing.
I dont know what to do anymore.
I really dont.
