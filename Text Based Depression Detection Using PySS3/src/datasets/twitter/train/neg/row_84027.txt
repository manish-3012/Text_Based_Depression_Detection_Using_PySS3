Spiralling. How long can you Do it per day?I've been spiralling for the past 3 years almost every day for several hours. Don't ask me how I can bare it. I can't. The past days have been the worst.


 I spiralled for at least 10 hours. I was sitting on the Bus and did not do anything Else. 
I am contemplating my life over and over and I realised that I thought I am not loveable and not good enough for All my life. I Turned down every relationship I could have had.. 
I had opportunities and I realised now I would have deserved it everytime and nothing was wrong with me. I denied myself over and over and missed beautiful days because I did not See myself the way I really was.
Is it my fault I made myself feel this way and missed every opportunity because I thought I was being fooled by the Person or why did I behave like this?

I am 21 and I've never been in a relationship. Altough I probably had the right and the chances for it but I did not know back then. I've been spending the past 6 months on the couch and working from home, crying, spiralling, sleeping. I really fell in love and did not know if the Person liked me. Now I think the Person did but by now I am getting ignored and I can't stand it.

Can someone tell me how I can change this behaviour? Everytime I deny myself my mental state is deteorating and I keep falling and falling...
