Everything hurtsI've fought depression for the last half a decade, and I've gotten better the past 2 years. But here I am, back to the trench, and I feel like I'm drowning. Everyday feels so heavy, sometimes just empty.

I dedicated myself to my work, and I've done great so far. I help out my family financially. I am very well loved by my family, friends, and girlfriend, but I don't like sharing my problems with them. I don't want to burden them. The same with my friends.

This is my 2nd life. I've done something stupid in the past. Back then, I used to cut. I also had an anorexia. I acknowledged it as wrong. But now that I'm back in this trench, why do I feel like it wasn't as stupid as I thought it to be?

I have no idea what my problem is. I just want to die. I want to end it all. I tell my friends (very close best friends) that I'm going to get a therapist, but that's not what I really want. It hurts so much.

For the past months, I have *moments* of sadness, sometimes disinterest in everything. But this week, it just hurts so much. Everything just aches. It just hurts. It's been like this for the past week.

I cry when I'm alone, but all I can do is smile around people close to me.

I want to be saved, but at the same time, I don't. Please help me. I've gone through this, but I don't understand what I'm feeling.
