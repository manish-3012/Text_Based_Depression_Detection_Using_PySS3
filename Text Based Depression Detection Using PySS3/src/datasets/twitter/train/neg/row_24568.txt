I think about suicide every dayI reflect on every choice I've made in past years, how I will never connect with anyone.

I'm a loser, I'll never live up to what I hoped I would be, &amp; I will never have my dreams come true.

What does one person in this world matter, really though?

One life means literally nothing, sure if you convince someone to not take their own life it would give you a relatively good but worried feeling in your gut, but the person would be left in misery knowing they will never be happy.

I feel i'm getting closer and closer to my expiration date.

Drawing ever near to my fate that is inevitable, I've even planned it, nearly done it a few days ago, easiest yet hardest thing to do, because I will be free from all my pain and suffering, but that is when it will begin for my family, one quick bath and its over my life ends after 2-4 minutes of running water.

Life means nothing.

I feel this loneliness, despair, this black hole in my stomach that I try to fill with video games, they shield my thoughts for moments, as soon as I am unoccupied, the feeling begins again, the torment, gnawing at me, convincing me this is what I will be, this is how I will live until I die of some disease or violent happening. 

I feel as though some people aren't meant to be happy as others are, it comes so naturally to so many, but some people are just broken fragments of humans that will suffer until they end themselves or time takes its toll.

Some people aren't meant to live.
