On the floor freaking out36F with 5 kids from 5 different men, each one a long term relationship I thought would last forever.  Got married, and he told me today he wants a divorce.  He listened to me break down and cry so hard I almost passed out, and he didn't react.  He didn't care.  My whole life has been a sad story.  From my dad abusing me and my mom then abandoning us, to every man I've been with hurting me bad.  Everyone who l ows me says I've had a shit life filled with enough bad luck for 10 people.  Everytime a door opens, 3 slam in my face.  I'm losing my job and can't find a new one.  I'm going to lose everything that matters to me.  I can't handle it all anymore.  I've always tried to be the positive one, the one who listened to everyone's problems and gave advice and saw the bright side of it all.  But inside I was always screaming and lonely.  Now I can't pretend to be that positive person anymore. 

I have had 3 severe mental breakdowns in my life , and I can't handle anything anymore.  I have chronic double vision migraines for 2 years now.  I'm always sick.  I find no joy on anything and I've tried a Gambit of meds etc.  

I can't do this anymore. I hate me.  I hate me so much.  I hate my mind.  I hate my mind so much.  It never ever stops putting me down, even when I do everything to stop it.
