I meant to leave this world several times already.I've posted twice in the past and if you go check those out this will make more sense. Anyways, summary is my grandmother who I was very close to passed away last summer (2018) and it completely flipped my life. I was just sad at first but it turned into depression and keeps getting worse. I see my friends a lot less because our schedules didn't line up this year and it affects me as well. I kept going for my friends but took a step back and realized I wasn't that close to most of them. I have planned many times to leave this cruel place later that day or the next day but never go through with it. I don't know if I'll make it to tomorrow or much longer at all. I don't know why the world had to be like this to me.
