I'm alone again and I'm not ready for that.I've had one friend for the past year and she has been making me feel like I want to keep living. Because of this, I got addicted to talking to her, and feeling alright. I made her feel like she could never leave me, and now she hates me for that. I can't comprehend being able to hurt her, but I did. I have told myself that I should live for one reason, since all the others are exhausted, and now even that reason is gone. I guess I've got no reason to live now.
