BipolarI am severely bipolar and i am extremely unstable. I can go from being on top of the world to in the depths of hell. after the episodes subside, they just get noticeably worse every time. I have been in a depressive state for the past week and a half and i cant take it. I'm alone in college right now and i'm too far to visit any of the 4 people i still care about. Its getting hard to manage and i just want to slam my head against a wall. I cant take it. I have a physcologist appointment next thursday and i doubt theyre goona prescribe me anything because its school ran. The last medication i took made it worse because it was only for depression, not bipolar and i tried to overdose on it. now i have hand tremors that havent gone away, its been a year since the overdose so i doubt its gonna go away.
