all i needis to be alone. to gather my thoughts. to put the plan in motion without panic. to have the time needed for it to be my last time. i just need them to leave home for an hour or more. that's it. no more interruption, no more uncertainty. then i'll just go to sleep. then, worry no more. the forever slumber. the peace.
