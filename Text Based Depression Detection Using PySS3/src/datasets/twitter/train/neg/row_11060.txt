A month since I don't speak to anybody.(sorry for my english, im from Argentina and my english it's not perfect) 

A month since I broke up with my girlfriend. She was everything to me. What remains. I don't think I can get over it. 

I decided to commit suicide. I spent almost 18 years in solitude until she appeared and literally take me and show me the light, It showed me what it feels like to be loved and to dream of a future.
It's not all about that. It's also for my self-esteem. It's also for my fucking stressful school and homework in the quarentine, It's also because I repeated class, family problems etc.
I hurt myself when i have panic attacks or when i just wanna stop the pain. Maybe i need psychological help, but I've tried like 3 times and didn't work.

I just... It's so fucking painful think that im a failure, needing another person to feel better it's like pathetic, i just... Don't have nobody to trust, it's just loneliness, pain and me. 
I'm not doing any homework, i just accumulated lots and lots because I'm not going to live for another year.

Thanks if you read all my problems, i just always wrote this kind of thing in the cell phone notes and with this post I just want to feel how it would feel to have a person read your problems for a last time.
