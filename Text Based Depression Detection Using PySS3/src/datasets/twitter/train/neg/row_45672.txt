I can't handle middle school much longer.Context: I'm in 8th grade and I have depression and anxiety. This is my journal entry for today. I decided to share it. 

Thursday October 1 : I have so much homework and I'm doing terrible in math. Average of 68. I think I might get kicked down to on level. I'm usually better than this at school. I'm super stressed. I also have tennis to do later. Like 10 extra math problems, and social studies homework later, too. School sucks and I'm not even in highschool yet. I just need encouragement from people here. Thanks
