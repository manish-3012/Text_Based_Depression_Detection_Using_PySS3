I'm at my last resortMy brain hasn't worked for a long time. I dont feel happy, all I feel is anger, sadness, and lust. My brain is defective and I feel as though the only solution is termination. Antidepressants don't seem to work, and I don't think I have the mental fortitude to do trial and error with anymore antidepressants. So I feel like this is it. Some of us weren't meant to live this long I guess. I definitely wasn't cut out for it. Can someone please tell me why they live. I want hope, I want to live. But, my only choices seem to be suicide. I need someone to talk me out of this please. I feel so alone.
