Chronically SuicidalIâ€™m nearly 24 years old and Iâ€™ve been struggling with major depression for 15 years and suicidal thoughts for 11 years. I have attempted to kill myself numerous times, mainly when I was a teenager but twice as an adult. My last suicide attempt I nearly died and was in the ICU for multiple days. I struggle with severe suicidal thoughts on a daily basis and struggle every day to keep myself safe and not act on the urges that are so loud inside my head. I feel hopeless, like this will never get better. Iâ€™ve tried dozens of medications, residentials, PHPs and IOPs, inpatient units, Spravato (ketamine), ECT, TMS, therapy, and neuro feedback. But nothing has made any lasting difference for me. The only thing that reduces the volume of the thoughts in my head is lithium, but I frequently have side effects on this medication that force me to stop taking it for weeks at a time until my body can handle it again. I canâ€™t work or go to school because of my illness and I only have one friend who stuck with me through all of this. Although I only live with one of my parents, they were both abusive in the past and still are to this day. I donâ€™t have a college degree and I have been unemployed for years. To get out of my abusive household I would need money, which I have none of because of not being able to work. Even if I got a job today, it would take years to be able to afford to live alone with the additional cost of all of my mental health treatment. I canâ€™t handle this anymore. I feel like the only solution is to die. At least it would all be over then. The only things keeping me here are my dogs, but itâ€™s easy to rationalize that eventually theyâ€™ll be okay without me. I donâ€™t know what else to do. Does anyone else feel this way?
