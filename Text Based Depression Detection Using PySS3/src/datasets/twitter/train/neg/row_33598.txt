My FWB is talking about suicide, I don't know what to doI met this girl, and we kinda hooked up, and not a while ago I discovered that she has a history of depression and that she attempted suicide twice.

She is prone to low self-esteem, and with her parent's splitting up and extra stress, she's talking about suicide. I'm chatting with her, and she said a few hours ago that she's planning it for tonight and asked me not to interfere.

I'm suffering from crippling anxiety, and I'm freaking out. I'm trying to talk her out of it, and for most part I think that the worst has passed. But still, I don't know what to do.

Maybe she's thinking out loud, at least I'm hoping so, we had a same talk a few months ago and me managed to overcome it. I just don't know what to do, should I tell my parents, call the authorities, call her family (don't have their number, just social network profiles, don't even know them)?

I just don't know what to do in case she decides to harm herself, I'm just hoping that she's thinking out loud.
