HelpI feel the need to kill myself over very small things. Tonight I accidentally spilt a milkshake on the carpet, and my father got really upset with me. Iâ€™ve been up for hours thinking about this situation alone and sobbing because I feel worthless and just want to end things.
I know it sounds irrational, but this is how I really feel. I get so upset about the small things, I just donâ€™t know how to stop.
