Somebody help meI am depressed.
Last year I was already unhappy. In January I was already feeling despair. Last week I was having suicidal thoughts and this week I am physically Ill. I can feel pain and heaviness in my chest.
Im a khv NEET, I should be in college but Im wasting my life going to sleep at 6am and waking up at 3pm. The time Im awake is just mindless browsing and consuming just to feel something other than the pain. 
I feel no motivation to work since Im ugly and short so even if I work my entire life Ill never be happy. I cant kill myself because Im worried about my mom otherwise I would have already done it.
