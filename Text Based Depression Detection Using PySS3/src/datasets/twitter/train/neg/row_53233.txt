Everyone dies alone?It's a long story.

In short, I'm in a really bad state health wise, and I've been abandoned by everyone that I know (which was not very many people to begin with).

If everyone abandoned me and I had my health, I guess I'd be okay. With enough effort I could pull myself out, cut contact with the people who turned out to actually be horrible or self centered or un-caring, and move on.

But I struggle to wake up every morning. I feel like I'm literally dying and I just don't have the money to pay for my health or therapy for my mental anguish. Living in America is seriously expensive especially when something bad happens it can ruin someone forever.

I have no one. Even if I pull myself out of this, I'm not sure if I could ever form a relationship with anyone again. One thing I've learned is that nobody really gives a fuck about anyone but themselves.

I met one person who seemed to care about me, but it turns out they had other motives. They abandoned me when I got sick and then recently they have actively been encouraging me to kill myself.

I see no future for myself or anyone in the West. The American dream is dead.
