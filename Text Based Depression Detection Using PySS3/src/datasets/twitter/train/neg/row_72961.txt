what do i do?i dont know whats left. Iâ€™m drunk, i have my bottle of pills in front of me. Ive already taken some. Am i going to die?
My dogs are all I have. I love them dearly but they cause me so much stress. My parents divorced and left me in the house with the dogs and I am so in debt because of them. I love them with all of my heart, however theyre going to die soon so why shouldnt I? Its hard for me - it is so hard. I dont want to go through losing the only things that have been keeping me alive.  

Iâ€™m so sorry.
