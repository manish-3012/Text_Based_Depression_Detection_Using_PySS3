I have no reason to live

I am 30 years old and my life has never improved, so I am already without expectation, I would not like to live another 10 years like this

every day i live is a suffering, adding my loneliness  
I will never have a girlfriend, my friends will always treat me in the background, I broke my teeth when I was 20 and was skateboarding  
Maybe the only thing I can serve is to die, maybe if I die my friends who neglected me will care about other people who are also suffering like me and will not treat them with indifference when someone asks for help
