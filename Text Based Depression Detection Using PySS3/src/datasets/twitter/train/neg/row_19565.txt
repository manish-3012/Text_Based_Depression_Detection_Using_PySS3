Feeling Suicidal after failing my degreeToday, i found out i failed one of my many exams (had an average of 63% and failed 1 exam by 1 mark), and that i will not be able to continue my degree. I feel like all my dreams and goals have just gone, and that i have let everyone down. Now i will be in crippling debt for the rest of my life and will always be that person who failed uni. I literally feel like a burden on my parents at this stage, my older sister is some kind of genius who flew through her degree and is currently working as a lecturer in one of the top unis in the country. Now im going to be stuck at home, with all my friends going back to uni. I work in a supermarket during the downtime from uni, i could not imagine doing that for my entire life, and the thought of that depresses me more.
