Only here to give my friends a couple good memories before next weekI'm omw to a club with my friend for her bday. I just wish I could go to sleep. I hate crowds, loud music, and being in new places. I hate that I came here, I'm only here because my friends bday is today and I am pretending like I'm having fun. I want them to have some good memories before I catch the bus next week.
