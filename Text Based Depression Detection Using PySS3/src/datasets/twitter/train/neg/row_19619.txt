Done with lifeNothing has ever gone well in my life, ever. For the 16 years I have been on this earth nothing has ever worked and never have I been truly happy. From girls who don't even want to be my friend, to finding out that I'm only going to be 5'3 (I'm a guy) for the rest of my life, and people constantly harassing me online for no reason. I don't know what to do, nothing seems to improve my situation. I have tried remaining positive but its difficult to when everything you hope would turn out good doesn't. I've had suicidal thoughts in the past but this time I actually feel I might go through with it. I honestly don't know what to do, I feel the only way for me to end this suffering is to commit suicide but I don't have it in me to do that to my parents. I see my 16 years here on this planet as a small preview to how life is going to be for me and so far it doesn't look good and I don't want to live like that. I don't feel I have anything to live for; I only have a couple friends, no girlfriend, I am not athletic or academically gifted, there is no thing I am singularly good at, I'm unattractive and lonely. I don't feel that me living anymore would matter, as I am sure I will not be successful or contribute anything to society If I am older. Its difficult for me to contemplate but I feel suicide is a necessarily thing for me to do.  

**Edit: I have thought it over and I have decided to not commit suicide. I have contemplated that things might in fact get better and I also thought about how upset my parents would be if their only son killed himself. I owe you guys a great debt of gratitude, thank you!**
