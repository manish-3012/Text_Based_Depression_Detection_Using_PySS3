i don't want to continueso many people posting here or at least online. whether you're reading or writing, you're probably all feeling depressed. and honestly i don't see a problem with it. i don't know how anyone can enjoy their mediocre lives. everything is meaningless. everything is centered around money in this society. the whole point of education is to get a good job to make money. i just don't see the point to live a life like that. i want freedom to do what i want. because of course if i did i would be poor. so it only leaves you with the option to do what society wants you to do. but i don't want to live the rest of my life depressed. not enjoying anything. not being able to connect with others. feeling alone all the time, even around others. i don't want to live anymore. everything has become nothing to me. no more sadness. no more emotions. most of the time they're fake.
i want to be free. free from this life.
