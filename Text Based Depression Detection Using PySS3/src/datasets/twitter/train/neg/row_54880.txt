I can finally restNow I can finally rest after my life of unhappiness and despair.  I have come to a point that I can no longer function in this world.  My thoughts are never going to get better.  I have no motivation to â€œget betterâ€ anymore.  I can finally rest now and it is such a relief.   I have lived 41 years and that is enough for me.  I have had enough of this world that I never asked to be born into.   My rest will bring me peace and will bring others some sorrow.  But this world will go on without me and the people who have been in my life will live without me.
