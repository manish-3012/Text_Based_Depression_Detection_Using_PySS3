Boyfriend has joined my bullies.I don't know if I can cope much longer. 

I don't even know where to begin so maybe I'll bullet point everything.

* My ex best friend has bullied me relentlessly for the past year simply because I ran against her in a club election (yes it's that petty)
* Multiple times throughout this bullying I have been close to suicide. 
* Throughout this bullying I have been going through constant hospital and doctors appointments to diagnose a chronic pain and fatigue condition. 
* My boyfriend was there with me throughout this entire process and saw me suffering at the hands of my bully, struggling to cope with my declining health, and generally suffering. 
* I unfortunately currently live with my bully, my boyfriend and a mutual friend. I cannot escape the contract that sadly ties me to this house.

I cannot do this anymore. I just want to be hanging from the rafters. 

A few times now I have heard my boyfriend (we've been together for approximately a year and a half now) bitching about me to my bully. Full on berating me to her. 

He's seen what she's done to me and how she has made me feel and yet for some reason chooses to give her more ammo against me? Bear in mind that the bitching is about pathetic couples arguments that are literally meaningless. The last bit of bitching he partook in with my bully was about how I didn't want to go and see the Superbowl with him because my health was bad after being at university all day so I just wanted to sleep. 

I can't even put into words how isolated I am feeling. He spends more time with this bully than with me and I've mentioned this to him - oh believe me. But for some reason he just gets annoyed with me that I even point it out. Why am I in the wrong for believing that you should probably support your girlfriend before the person that LITERALLY BULLIES HER TO THE POINT OF SUICIDE. 


And yes I know that everyone is always like "leave him" - I agree, he's not worth a minute of my time anymore. However I literally have NO ONE ELSE. Her bullying isolated me from every one I ever called a friend. I am alone here at university away from my family and he is all I have. 


I honestly just think it is best if I were no longer here. I don't know how to cope anymore. Perhaps I should just get some emergency housing to be away from them all - but then what? It's just me, alone again.
