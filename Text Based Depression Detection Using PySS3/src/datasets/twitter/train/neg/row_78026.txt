My AnxietyIdk if itâ€™s my anxiety or not but I feel like crap like itâ€™s hard to breathe. I feel like Iâ€™m not breathing fully. People say Iâ€™m alright but am I really alright. It also feels like something is blocking my airway idk if itâ€™s asthma or itâ€™s just me. people say Iâ€™m alright and I donâ€™t know if I should believe them or not. I can still breathe but I canâ€™t breathe fully to my chest something feels like itâ€™s blocking the way.
