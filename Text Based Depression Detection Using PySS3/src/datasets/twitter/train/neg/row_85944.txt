Not sure why I havenâ€™t at the pointAlways felt like Iâ€™ve had no future past a certain point, now Iâ€™ve reached that point (end of education). Everyday feels like weeks worth of emotions packed in. Iâ€™m struggling to remember why I did things only a few days ago because I canâ€™t keep track of anything I feel anymore. Iâ€™m not living for any reason it seems. This feels like the end.


Got diagnosed with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder in November and thatâ€™s basically destroyed me now.
