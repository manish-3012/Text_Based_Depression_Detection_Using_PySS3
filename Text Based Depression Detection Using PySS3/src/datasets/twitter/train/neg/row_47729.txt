i just saw that video of the guy killing him self on fb livethis was unwillingly. it came up on my fyp on tiktok and i watched it without knowing. i have been shaking for at least 20 minutes and crying. this was extremely triggering for me and traumatizing as i am a survivor of an attempted suicide involving a gun. i have to get this out before i go in panic. iâ€™m sorry to this man, who i later found out was ronnie mcnutt. but this is NOT funny reposting someoneâ€™s death, mostly bc of the disrespect, but also bc of how insensitive to the family and those whoâ€™ve watched it unknowingly.
