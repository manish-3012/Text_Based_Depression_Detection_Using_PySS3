Bit by bit Iâ€™m subconsciously distancing myself from the only people who care about meI have 2 brothers, a step dad and a dad, my mom and my sister and then my 81 year old grandma. So like 7 people in the world care about my existence. 

Iâ€™ve been getting heated with my parents. A month ago I stopped talking to my mom for a month after a fight and today I had an argument with my dad. Itâ€™s a manifestation of what I donâ€™t want to happen, to be abandoned by everyone and now itâ€™s becoming a reality.

Since Iâ€™ve been talking about suicide for a while and Iâ€™m more open about it to my family they have either stopped caring or donâ€™t entertain it anymore. What they probably donâ€™t know is I have tried and failed just like the rest of the shit I do in my life. 

Iâ€™m thinking the part of me that wants to die is responsible for the conspiracy theories about my family hating me which then leads me into deep thoughts of how Iâ€™ll end it. Iâ€™ve thought hard and I like cutting myself so thatâ€™s how Iâ€™ll end it.

I have no friends and my family knows Iâ€™m a piece of shit. I donâ€™t know how to do anything normal because everything feels controlled like Iâ€™m a robot being given commands.

Donâ€™t end up like me. If you really care about the only people who give a shit youâ€™re alive then donâ€™t take them for granted. Learn how to not say whatâ€™s on your mind because it can hurt others. Control your anger. Seek professional help instead of getting it from strangers on the internet who say they care but donâ€™t.

Iâ€™m 21 on June 24th, sometime around my 21 years in my life I will die from my own suicide. Some part of me eagerly awaits whatâ€™s beyond this life but another part is scared. Iâ€™m done though really
