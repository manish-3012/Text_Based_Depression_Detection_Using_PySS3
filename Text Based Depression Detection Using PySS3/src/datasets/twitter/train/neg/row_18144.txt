Iâ€™m so tiredI donâ€™t know how much more I can take. Ive been to so many therapists tried so many medications just given it so much time and effort and nothing. Ever. Helps. I feel so hopeless. The thought of continuing for another 60-80 years is utterly terrifying. Iâ€™m so so so so tired. I donâ€™t want anything from life anymore. I truly give up. The world is a bad place. Humans are bad. Iâ€™ve seen enough. I just want to rest In peace.
