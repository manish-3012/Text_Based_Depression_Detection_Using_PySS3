I wish I can just get Corona and die.Yea it will be very painful, but at least I will be dead.

I'm just tired, depressed and alone for the last 15 year. On good weeks I have one suicide idealising, on bad weeks every night till I fall asleep. Can't even read or play games anymore. Done absolutely nothing productive the last 6 months.

Whose nose can I come and lick?
