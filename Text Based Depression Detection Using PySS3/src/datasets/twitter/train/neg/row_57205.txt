Work all day. Return to a place you don't want, or a woman you don't want. Work the next day. 30 years later diseased, then dead.Completely over the cycle.

The even more sad part is, the title is describing my entire fate. And that's what I have to look foward to. Actually, that would probably be the best outcome. Unfathomable betrayal for all efforts, sacrifices, savings, and faith is the outcome. Fuckin done with this shiiit...
