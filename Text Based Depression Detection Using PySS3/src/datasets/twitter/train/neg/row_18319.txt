Hey, braincels user here, I really don't think I can keep copingEvery day I continue to live I try my hardest to stay positive, then I remember how miserable and fucking lonely I am, and think about how amazing chads life must be and I wanna blow my brains out. I just think of all the endless love and gratification and affection those guys get showered in, me, I'd be lucky to experience even a fraction of what their day to day life is like, I keep thinking about how much women despise me and how pointless and empty it is to try, and I ask myself why I'm too pussy to end things.
