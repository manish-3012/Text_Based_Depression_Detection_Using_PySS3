Feelings ExplainedThis world is broken and honestly Iâ€™m pretty tired of it I just rather not be involved taking a dip and not coming back up for air seems the appropriate response. I am being pulled into the earth by the demons that live beneath gosh and what I mean by that is I have always cared for others always was passionate about everything throughout my entire life even though this world would constantly have people in place to drag me down words you know nothing big would be said just that I am worthless that I would never amount to anything that I was stupid and weird now honestly all those things that were said broke a Levy in my head a while ago and I have never been the same. Itâ€™s weird I feel like a wounded animal on top of being corned I donâ€™t hate my self but I hate this world I donâ€™t hate other people even though I feel like I have the right to but I hate my life how everything has went and how I was treated the entire way and now I just want to be the wounded animal that becomes dinner because Iâ€™m so tired haha Iâ€™m done. This was just a cluster of somethings grammar is probably terrible but I donâ€™t feel the need to fix anything, I felt like maybe someone could resonate even though depression and more depression I donâ€™t think makes happiness aaahhh Iâ€™m done. This place is terrible have a nice night.
