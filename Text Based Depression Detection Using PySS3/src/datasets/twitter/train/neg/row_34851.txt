No one will miss meI'm in a really bad relationship, where my bf is controlling, and lies to me and I can't leave for fear of getting hurt. My parents only talk about the money I owe them. My favorite cousin has been hanging out with a different cousin of ours that doesn't like me very much. I just wanna fade away, because I know no one will miss me
