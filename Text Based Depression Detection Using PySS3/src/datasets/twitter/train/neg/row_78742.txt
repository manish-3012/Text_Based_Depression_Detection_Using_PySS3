I am thinking of killing myself tonight.I lost hope.
I want to die so hard. 
If I can give away every thing I have to die peacefully I will defiantly do it.
I am dying from inside, my heart is boiling and I can't take it anymore.
This is not something new, I was like this for so long.
It is hard to explain the horrible feeling that I have, I really want to escape this torture. I can't stand it at all.
I fuking want to die. I don't want to live any more.
I was like this for years and years nothing will change.
