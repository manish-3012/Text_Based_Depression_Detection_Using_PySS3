Can suicide ever be ok?I am so insecure. I have terrible depression and anxiety. I don't think i can function like a normal person. I feel like a burden and dissapointment to myself and the people that love me. i think about killing myself everyday for the last couple years. I don't want hurt like this. I want someone to tell me this is ok, that it's ok to let go of everything, that it's ok to just die.
