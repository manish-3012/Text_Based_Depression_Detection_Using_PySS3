Which suicide hotlines won't call the police?  I've thought about calling a suicide hotline.  But, I don't want to take the risk of them calling the police.  That would make everything worse.  So, are there any hotlines that I can be guaranteed won't call the police?  Or, would I be taking a risk no matter who I called?
