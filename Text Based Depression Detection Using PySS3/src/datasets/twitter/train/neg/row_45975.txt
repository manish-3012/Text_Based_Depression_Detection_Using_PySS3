I canâ€™t do this anymoreSince June of 2019 I been feeling awful but everything just explote in November when My relationship just end. I really love her and I tried to fight for us but she just treated me like shit and the last week she came back just because she was really lonely but I just couldnâ€™t because when we break up I literally die, I tried to kill my self and started to go to a psychiatrist and a psychologist, Iâ€™m taking antidepressants and sleeping pills just to make it through the day...
Last week was nice, I felt a little bit better but this week itâ€™s been awful, I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening, I just canâ€™t do this anymore.

Last night I spend like 3 hours thinking about how Iâ€™m going to do this, I donâ€™t want my mother to find my body and I donâ€™t want to destroy her life but right now I canâ€™t think, I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. 

When my ex gf told me that she wanted to be with me again and I told her that I needed some time to be alright, she told me that she wouldnâ€™t be there when i feel better even when I waited for her to feel better... that destroyed me.

This is not only for a broken heart even if I really loved her and I still do. This is because I feel like garbage, like I canâ€™t do anything right, Iâ€™m just a deadlift for my family, I canâ€™t get out of bed, I canâ€™t stop crying and everyday when I wake up I just have an anxiety attack because I canâ€™t keep confronting being here.

I just needed  to told this to somebody... sorry for my really bad spelling, in my country we speak Spanish.
