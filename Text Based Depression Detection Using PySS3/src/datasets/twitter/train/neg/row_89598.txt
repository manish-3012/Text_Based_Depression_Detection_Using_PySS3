Suicide seems...I find myself thinking of suicide. Tonight while driving home i thought about driving off the road. But itâ€™s not like Iâ€™d do it. Just seemed appealing. An end to the emptiness and dull aching depression. It comes and goes. Do I really not know why or does it just feel like it? Is there a reason and I just didnâ€™t notice or did it truly just come out of nowhere. If im completely honest when I picture how much pain the people who love me would be in, it makes me feel loved and I like it just a little. â€˜Theyâ€™ll be sorry they didnâ€™t..â€™ What? Pay more attention to me? Listen? Talk? Hug me more? Ugh. It happened slowly; depression. I think the thing that makes it different from just feeling sad is the hopelessness. And the muffled inward anger. Self brutality. I feel dull and hollow. And blindsided. Unnerved. Like this feeling could take over at any time without warning. But suicide. It feels like a real option now.
