I have no future.In early 2013 I was convicted of domestic battery, which is a misdemeanor in my state. In August 2014 I quit my job and relocated for a girl, which promptly didn't work out. I moved back home, and have been unable to find any work since. Every single job posting in my area requires full time hours, passing a background check, 2+ years of experience, and a degree. I have absolutely none of that, and I can't pass a background check. I am in my mid twenties and am stuck in a rut, living with my parents. Any job I apply for denies me once I fail the background check. Some jobs, I don't even get that far. I just get the "thanks but go fuck yopurself" email a week later.

I am fucking desperate for a job, a chance to do ANYTHING. But I have no opportunities. I am broke, I have no license or car, I have no savings, I have no education beyond a GED. I am currently enrolled in college for an Associate's Degree but it will take years to complete, because I need to take Calculus for my degree and I can't even get past Pre-Algebra.

What is my purpose for a continued existence if I can't even fucking get past this hurdle? There are 16 year olds with their lives more together than mine. None of mny friends bother with me anymore, because they all have their lives together. They've all moved out, some are even married and have kids. 

But I am still in the exact same life situation I was in 8 years ago.
