Just hit rockbottom from nowhere.Today my girlfriend (of only a little past two months) broke up with me. It was hard but you'd think something as short as that would be easy to deal with; however, it was the longest relationship I had managed to keep(pathetic I know). What's worse is I made the mistake of becoming a member of her friend group and now I can't even talk to them without feeling like I'm choking. I have almost no one to talk to since they were my only close friends and I've never felt so close to killing myself as I am now. I almost broke down today in the library when I thought I heard her voice... When I'm alone, I feel like there's a hole in my stomach, and the physical tension is almost unbearable at some times. I know others out there have it worse than I do, but I've never been in a darker place. I was once put into a psych ward for an attempt that I would've followed through with had my dad not been home. I'm currently a first year in college and have no one else. I can't even study for my coming midterm without breaking into tears and thinking about killing myself.
sorry for the rant.
