Thank you all for being wonderful people, i was wondering what i am doing with my life yesterday, i got drunk and then cried, today in 5 hours im going to kill myself, thank you all for the awesome memories, i hope you all live a wonderful successful life, its too late for me. I have talked and had some great memories with you all. I fucked up my life. I wish you all the best in life, ðŸ˜” im sorry.
