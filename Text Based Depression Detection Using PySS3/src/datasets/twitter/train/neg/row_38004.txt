Feeling depressed even when i am happy, suicide never leaves meI'm 23 years old, finishing uni in one month, my mental health is at its worst and its not because of uni, most of my depression comes from the fact that i suck at everything in life. I have friends but i'm incredibly lonelly, i never had girlfriend and started to believe that i will never have one, i have no real skills that could help me make money and i'am big big loser in all other aspects of life. I dont like being alive, i see it as useless existence that leads to nothing.
