pointless ventingI'm 21 years old still living with my mom bc of UH college. I feel so stagnate to the point that those feelings build up as anger and restlessness. I WANT OUT. I WANT TO EXPLORE THE WORLD. I WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT, FUCK. college is boring as shit. 

Life to me feels fucking meaningless and dull if I don't help others. College is a fucking drag. Working is a fucking drag. Everything is a drag except helping others. I think being of service to others is what is keeping me going. But a lot of this other dumb meaningless shit that people chase after is so utterly pointless to me. 

Also I've noticed how we always ask, "hey how are you?" but if you think about it that is such a personal question. Of course majority of us lie and say, "oh fine, im good wbu?". Idk why i thought about that but I did.

I always carry this emptiness in me. Everyday is the same shit.  EVERYDAY. 

Anyways I don't need advice just wanted to vent
