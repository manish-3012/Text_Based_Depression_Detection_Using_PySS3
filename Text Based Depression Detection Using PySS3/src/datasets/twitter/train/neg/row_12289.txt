Transgender in the closet and in high schoolHey Iâ€™m an ftm transgender I donâ€™t know what to do. Junior year has really been a bitch with the most difficult classes Iâ€™ve ever taken n having my transness causing even more stress. If itâ€™s not school itâ€™s my being trans or both. I always have that voice in my head telling me to just kill myself but thereâ€™s always that day every once in a while where things are okay. 

I have a good group of friends who would accept me but the only thing holding me back from coming out is my family. My father is an asshole towards everyone he encounters so I sort of bounce around to my friends houses to get away or stay after school nearly every day. 

I just donâ€™t really see an end to all of this since college is a thing n I wanna get in but I havenâ€™t thought much about it since I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d make it this far. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself 3 times. Once freshman year and twice this year.

I cry myself to sleep almost every night instead of doing my work so my grades have been slipping to a point but I just donâ€™t know what to do or how to fix this.
