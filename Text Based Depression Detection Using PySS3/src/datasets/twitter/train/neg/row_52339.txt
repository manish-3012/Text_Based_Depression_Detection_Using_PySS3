I'm not sure what to doI was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder (unsure which type). I know I've had it for a while, but I've been bounced around at least 40 different medications and tons of diagnoses before stopping here.

And actually, the meds work. They work until they don't. They work until it's nighttime or I wake up. I broke up with probably the sweetest woman in the world because I was having an episode, and now it's too late. I hurt her too much for her to want to get back with me. 

I've gotten angry. I've said horrible things to my mother. My mother, who worked on her fucking own to raise me. I owe her my life. I owe her everything. How the fuck am I supposed to pay her back for that?

I wish I could lobotomize myself. Cut out the sickness. Cut out the pain. I've been researching the parts of the brain that contribute to emotion. Apparently the brain feels no pain, so I could probably cut them out myself.

I wish I could sleep and just not wake up. 

But then I realize what that could do to the people I love, and I hate myself. It would destroy my mother, and probably destroy the love of my life as well. How could I have such horrible thoughts and not be a terrible person.

Sometimes I wish the world could end, so I could sleep without hurting anyone else. 

I wish I could give my life to my family, and to those I love.

But maybe this is my punishment. I'm already going to hell, why not get there sooner
