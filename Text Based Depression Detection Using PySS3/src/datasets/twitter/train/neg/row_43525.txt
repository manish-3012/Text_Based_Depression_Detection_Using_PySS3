Suicidal But Can't End ItIt's taken me quite a lot of strength to come tell someone online about this, but I feel my back is against the wall. 

First I'll just give an overview of my medical history:

-

* Anxiety at 15

* LSD-induced psychosis and PTSD at 18

* Cannabis induced HPPD, panic disorder at 19


-


Current circumstances:

* No job; supported by social welfare job seeker allowance
 
* No supportive family; living with single parent household

* No education; completed final grade of highschool at 18

* No girlfriend; every former girlfriend has lost interest

* No friends; they all fell out after highschool

* On bail awaiting criminal trial for something I did not commit

Qualitative report: I am 21 now and my life has amounted to nothing. The medical system has failed to resolve my mental health issues, I lay in bed most of the day, have no communication with anybody aside from my father (who is physically disabled and cannot provide emotional support; mother died when I was 17), no interest or positive emotion toward anything, unprovoked rage fueled fits, hallucinating visually 24/7, and am constantly contemplating the purpose of my life. I have lost hope in humanity, as everyone wants me to be a slave to jobs I don't want to do. For this reason I know that I am useless and should die, but here's the real kicker: my anxiety doesn't allow me to kill myself. I do not know if I am suffering from chronic loneliness or depression. I don't cut, cry or smile like other depressed people. It seems like psychologically and spiritually, I am nothing. Though, I do currently retain some qualities, which I'll list here:


-


* Physical fitness is optimal with weight lifting and anaerobic exercise

* Intelligence aptitude is optimal, with a verified IQ of over 153 (I don't give a fuck if you think that's pretentious)

* Nutrition is optimal; I don't consume ANY drugs, not even processed sugar.

* Hygiene is sound: I clothe, groom and clean appropriately.

On the surface it looks like I have everything I need. But on the inside I am void. If anyone has any suggestions, please respond.
