I'll be leaving within the next six monthsOriginally was going to be next year (as in 2017), but since I'm graduating far earlier than expecting with a more pathetic degree, no point staying around that long. 

I already have a method, just not a location. I don't own said method but I know how to get it. I'm considering June or July of 2016, or at least a time when I can get far enough away from people that I can be missing for a few days. 

I'm tempted to simulate a murder so people think it was someone else (not anyone in particular, I don't want anyone to get hurt on my behalf). I think it would be cool to be an unsolved murder, especially a bullshit one.

Other optimal way to go is by saving someone else. Taking a bullet, getting run over by a car, something heroic. Think it would be cool.

I'm just writing this here just to write it, since I can't tell anyone IRL without getting put away. I don't want responses, really. I have no positive qualities whatsoever and I have no future. I will never be loved or desired by any human being. That's more than a good enough reason to go. None of you know pain the way I know pain.
