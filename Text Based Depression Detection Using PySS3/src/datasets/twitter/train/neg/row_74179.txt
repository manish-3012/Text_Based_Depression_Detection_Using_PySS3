I've accepted the truth nowI've been depressed for a while and fighting suicidal thoughts. I now know that it's inevitable. I don't know when or how yet, but I will kill myself. I know I can't avoid it much longer. I don't want to, but I can't keep on living. I'm making plans for the future only out of habit and obligation now, but I don't see the point because I don't know when I'm going to die. Soon I hope. Then I won't feel like this anymore. I won't feel anything. 

Therapy isn't helping. Antidepressants aren't helping. I just can't fight fate much longer.
