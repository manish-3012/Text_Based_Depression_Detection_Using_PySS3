What is controlI donâ€™t want to lose, but afraid I will. 

Its all hitting me this month. Tried to make the big change this year, move across country. leave the toxic environment, go to school, become me but better. 

I didnâ€™t fail but I didnâ€™t succeed either. 4 months jobless in a new city isnâ€™t helping either, apparently I lost my license yesterday too. 

Money is the thing that makes me want to die. The emotional turmoil didnâ€™t have any valid solution before but now... when I took out a loan for upgrading they forced me to get life insurance. 

Iâ€™ve been avidly networking for the last 3 months with no job prospects. I just have nothing to stand out as am I. Iâ€™m a friendly face nothing more.. I canâ€™t afford anymore events, or coffees or rent or debts or anything. 

Today I ate a piece of bread with mayonnaise on it.

If I plan it right, my significant other will be set. If I continue like this Iâ€™ll lead them to debt and poverty.

When I was in high school a girl committed suicide. Her mom read a excerpt from her diary, she had wrote â€œI want to graduate high school and not kill myselfâ€. Canâ€™t stop thinking about it, I want to get married and experience life. This debt though, I donâ€™t know if I can win this mental battle. 

Iâ€™d rather die then keep making everyone around me suffer.
