why am i so disposablepeople throw me away so easily, i become an afterthought. the minute i think i have something good and become comfortable, it becomes uncertain. i'm so tired of being tossed away and im so tired of being sad all the time. it breaks you down so much. i feel like im not enough in so many regards and not worth other people's time. what's the point in even being here any longer?  i wrote the note a long time ago, but i can't muster up the courage to do it.
