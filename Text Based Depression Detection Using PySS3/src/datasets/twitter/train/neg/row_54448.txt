I failed....(pt3)I'm sorry I didn't update when I said I was going to, but better late then never.

I got to my parents house and they took my car keys...my phone was locked in the car.... They live in the middle of nowhere so I've been board out of my mind, even though I'm being watched I'm still trapped with only my thoughts and memories. It still hurts like hell fire when I try to speak, eating solid food is out of the question and the bruise is still quite visible. Maggie found out what I did and brought Amy to see me and that made me just that much worse. I miss my family so much. When my little girl touched my throat with tears in her eyes it was more then I could take and I haven't stopped crying since. Oh and it's Valentine's day and the woman I love it's going on a date.....

Does this pain ever face?  How do I trust again? How do I move on?
