I want to talk everyoneI just want it out in the open. I want a death date that I can share with people. It feels horrible keeping this to myself. 

I want to talk people that I have decided to die. On my own terms. When I choose to. I want support from people. I want to go knowing there will be no horrible surprises for anyone. I want to make it easy on people.

Iâ€™m writing out birthday cards in advance and notes for special occasions like weddings etc. the will go to my brother to mail out over the years after I am gone.

I guess I really want people to understand that I have nothing left to live for. Iâ€™ll never have family, never come home to a wife and children. No family vacations, no Christmas dinners, no one to look after or to look after me. All I have left now is to get up and go to bed. Itâ€™s the life of a 90 year old man but I just got there a lot sooner. Iâ€™ve just missed my window and now have nothing left to do or work towards. Itâ€™s going to be 40 years of solitary surviving, not living. 

I also donâ€™t want to be labelled mentally ill. I want people to accept this as a rational decision. I just want to speak freely about it.
