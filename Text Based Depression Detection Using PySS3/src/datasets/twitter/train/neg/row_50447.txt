I'm failing school, I have no friends and my alcoholism just keeps getting worse.I don't see what life has to offer anymore. My life's a wreck, parents think and have told me I'm a disappointment, I spend all my money on alcohol just to drown it away and I don't want this anymore. I want out. I'm a useless loser and I see things better off without me at this point.
