I hate everything about myselfHey, 22yo male here.

Well, I hate my body with all my heart. I donâ€™t know what did I do to deserve this. Like its okay for people to have a few imperfections, but I literally consist out of them. 
As I said, I am 22 and I still struggle with acne. For some reason my fat is stored in my ass and thighs, even though my hormones are fine. So I look like a disproportionate piece of shit having skinny upper body and fatty lower body. On top of that, I cannot even balance it out properly as I hardly get any muscle from working out. The worst part is that my penis is barely 6 inches long (yea yea average my ass, my whole life I have never seen anyone having a dick smaller than mine). I have tiny wrists and hands just like female, though I am relatively tall (6â€™1â€œ) which makes it look even more ridiculous. My voice is ugly, like I am a 14 yo who smokes a pack a day. I almost donâ€™t have any facial hair. 
For the past few years I watched my friends grow up into decent looking men, meanwhile I stayed seriously behind. I am seeing therapist, but it honestly does not help at all, like how can I accept and love myself when I am such failure. 
I have not left home for the past 2 months. All I do is thinking all day how I have no future and how much I hate myself. I also think about suicide all the time, but lets be real I am a pussy and probably will never find courage to end it all. 

Anyways, how are you guys doing?
