25, suicidal. Not sure where to turn, or where I cannot turn back fromI first experienced suicidal thoughts at about 14 or 15. I've mostly lived with them ever since. At best, they become an escape route I can take in case my happiness fails. At worst they are ever constant and nothing matters because I am so ready to commit. I have quit jobs on the spot because I was sure I wasn't going to live the night.

I always figured that sometime I'd stop having these thoughts or feelings, and I'd start to be a "REAL" adult. My first, and only, time calling the suicide hotline they hung up on me. I had threatened to throw myself into traffic and they thought they heard laughter in the background and accused me of using them as a party gimmick or something.

Now I live with my girlfriend almost 1000 miles away from my family, my dog and everything I knew growing up and I feel lonely. Since I moved, all my friends have removed me or removed themselves from group chats that I'm in. I have no new connections where I live now, and my girlfriend is always gone for either work or school.

When does it get good? Or at least OK? I'm tired of trying to run away from my pain. I'm tired.
