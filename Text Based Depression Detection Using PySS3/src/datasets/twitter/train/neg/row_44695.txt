Can't seem to find my happiness anywhereIm 25 years old, I have been depressed for the past 7 years and its getting harder and harder everyday,
The past couple of months has been the best of my life, I was able to see my loved ones on regular basis and enjoy my time without being alone with my thoughts but this time it got me harder than ever, 
My heart is racing over the idea of committing suicide
My mind is foggy, my soul is drained, 
I can't see the light, I feel overwhelmed and insecure, my loneliness is killing me everyday, I am an emotional mess, I cry for no reason, can't feel comfortable in my own skin,  this is my last hope, im trying to find a reason to be alive for, something to look forward to, the only thing that kept me till this day is the thought of hurting my parents and my best friend whom is basically like a family to me, am I being selfish?  I feel like that they will understand, I have been completely honest with them about this and told them that I don't think I can keep going on, the thought of seeing another day gets me worked up, and everytime I tell this to my best friend she starts crying, my parents take it as a joke even when I told them its not, so basically this is a cry for help, I just need a little hope, if It doesn't work , by this time tomorrow I will say goodbye to this dark cruel world, already wrote my note and got everything set.
