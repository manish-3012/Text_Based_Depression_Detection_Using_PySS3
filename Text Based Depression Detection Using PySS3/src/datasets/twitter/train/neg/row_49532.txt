From suicidal to... less suicidalToday was a pretty nerve-wracking day. Iâ€™d be seeing a psychologist for the first time. 

Iâ€™ve been battling severe depression and anxiety for a few years now, and itâ€™s been on and off. Just in the past few months itâ€™s gotten to the point where I have taken to self harm by scratching my arms and fantasizing about suicide everyday (which I had already made notes and plans for).

At first, I had a weight in my stomach. I was an anxious, sweaty, nauseous mess. My mind was filled with bad thoughts and â€œwhat ifâ€™sâ€ including the stress from today. The psychologist had greeted me with a warm smile and took me back to the room.

When I had finished with my appointment, I felt this weight in my stomach disappear and be lifted off me. Itâ€™s been the best Iâ€™ve felt in months, all because I just told this complete stranger about my struggles. And in a way, I felt so much better talking about my depression to a stranger than my own family and friends. 

Itâ€™s truly a step in the right direction, and if you are completely lost, feel like nobody understands what you are going through, or have no one to talk to, I suggest trying out a therapist or psychologist. They might be able to do you good, and help you relieve the weight in your stomach too. 

Thank you for reading~!
