Waiting for my family to dieMy whole life Iâ€™ve never been close to anyone, never had any real friends or a girlfriend I actually liked. Iâ€™m nearing the end of my 1st year of college and Iâ€™ve hated pretty much all of it so far. Iâ€™m lazy and I donâ€™t really care about doing well anymore because I figure Iâ€™ll just kill myself soon anyway so what does it matter. I donâ€™t have any friends and I hate talking to people so I always just listen to music every time I have to be out in public. My GPA is going to shit and all I really do anymore is sit around in my room and look at youtube or reddit all day. Iâ€™ve gone out to this bridge in the city I live in just to do some planning and theyâ€™ve got a suicide fence or whatever up on the sides and the bridge might not be tall enough anyway. So Iâ€™ve been thinking about just overdosing on something or buying a gun. The only reason I havenâ€™t done it yet is because I canâ€™t hurt my mom and Dad like that. Theyâ€™ve worked so hard to try and raise me correctly and theyâ€™re practically paying for most of my college but Iâ€™m just such a lazy piece of shit. Iâ€™m probably just gonna end up getting a minimum wage job and living in a shitty apartment until they die and trying to get high on the weekends or something so I can have a few moments of happiness by myself. Then when they die I can finally be free of this shit.
