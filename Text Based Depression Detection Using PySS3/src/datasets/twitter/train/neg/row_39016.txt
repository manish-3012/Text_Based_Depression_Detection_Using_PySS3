Been thinking on/off latelyI just can't find the means to do it. Every method i've looked up either seems too painful( hypocritical I know) or I'm ultimately afraid when I do it there actually MIGHT be a hell and I'll wind up there (i'm a devout atheist) My family and I aren't that close and everythings seem to go to shit lately. My mom's too busy worrying about her third divorce than taking care of one of my semi autistic brothers. My dad is too busy spending money getting drunk and on strippers/ prostitutes and doesn't really provide me with any type of support. My family will miss me, but they'll be fine without me, same with my friends. I'm just really scared about what will come  after I do it . I'm not even sure if i'll get along in doing this- I just need to vent to random strangers on the internet

Thanks guys
