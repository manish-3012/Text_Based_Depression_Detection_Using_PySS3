I'm sorry if this isn't taken seriously...I am 16 year-old guy, and if you knew me as a friend, you'd think I have the above-average American life of a teenager.  Video games on occasion, pretty good grades, and a decent family.  

To be straight up, I'm stuck from thinking this way because lately I've wanted to have something I apparently cannot get:  someone by my side.  I am so fucking lonely and it's pained me enough to the point where I contemplated self-infliction and I hate that I almost resorted to that.  I've met at least 5 or 6 girls I've been interested over the past few months, and none of them found interest in me.  I'm not here to complain about the friendzone or blame them, though.

I know there are much more serious problems on /r/SW, and I'm sorry if this can't be taken seriously..but I'm just looking for some positive outlook.  I feel so horrible.
