Iâ€™m a fucking failureI havenâ€™t done a single thing right in my life. Literally 15 minutes ago I had the one decision I thought I would never regret thrown down the drain. Iâ€™m a christian trans girl and basically just got harassed by another trans woman for no apparent reason. I didnâ€™t provoke anything, I literally just mentioned offhand that I was christian and suddenly I have 4 angry comments and a message from someone telling me that my faith is fake and that Iâ€™m a horrible person for believing in god. I donâ€™t even feel welcome in the one community that was nice to me anymore. Fuck everything, Iâ€™m so fucking done with this planet.
