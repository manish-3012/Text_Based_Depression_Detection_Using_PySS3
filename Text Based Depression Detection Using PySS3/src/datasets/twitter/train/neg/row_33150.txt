Nostalgia.Nostalgia is an interesting thing. Before, when I was just a little younger, I could look back on things with great fondness regardless of the traumas and horrors I lived through. I was happy, and I knew it. Even if things weren't perfect, they were *good.*

Now, I'm just a little bit older, and just a little bit wiser. Or, stupider... It depends on your point of view, really. I'm not happy. I haven't had a genuine laugh in years. I'm only 18; I shouldn't be feeling this way.

I don't believe life is worth continuing anymore. I've become even more delusional to the point where I now strongly believe that if I successfully commit suicide, I'll get a chance to restart. The only thing that I'm living for at the moment is my cat, but we're so deeply connected, that I think she would forgive me for leaving.
