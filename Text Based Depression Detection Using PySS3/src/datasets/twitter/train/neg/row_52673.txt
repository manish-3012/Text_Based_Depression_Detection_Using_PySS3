Im on the Edge againI dont have many friends, i dont have a family(well i do, but no emotioonal support at all from them), i enclosured myself and ALL the emotional support i have are from these friends, Last month my depression starts kicking off again, and blinded by it i kinda went to talk with one of these friends, he was going through a lot, and i was so blinded by my feelings that i pushed all my emotions into him, when he last needed/deserved, i was selfish, after a while and some fights he asked me for a time and Said, "we still friends tho", but this time he asked for literally means me being left aside by the entire group, i always felt like only two of them rly liked me, but now, i feel completely lonely, i know and i see them having Fun while im here, crying and fighting my Head that keeps telling me to kms, i dont know what to do, i cant Just sit and wait, i dont want to be alone, tbh this time my head might be winning...im having anxiety and panic attacks for three days straight. I've been taking clonazepam like mm's i prefer to be completely sedated than having to listen my mind telling me i aint worth a damm.

I've always been the one in the group that tried to keep everyone happy and together even If It means making Fun of myself, and know im here completely alone, they dont seen Sad, mad, they Just seen like they dont want me close...

I was a selfish piece of shit putting my feelings First, and i know that, still why does It seens like nobody cares about what im going through now
