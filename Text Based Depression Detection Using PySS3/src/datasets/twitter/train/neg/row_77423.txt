No more excuses.I've been making excuses my whole life and I'm tired of doing it.

So, I'm not going to accept excuses anymore and have finally decided to end my life this week. I have put off my suicide due to the fear of what consequences it would bring to others around me.

Just an excuse. 

I sincerely hope that anyone who reads this is able to find an alternate solution to the problem(s) that brought you here. Suicide is my alternate solution.

Take care.
