doing it slowlyA year ago I was assaulted by someone I loved and everyone abandoned me over it. I've been trying to drink myself to death ever since. I pray to myself every night that I won't wake up but sure enough I do. I've also been completely detached from others. The only time I engage people in conversation is to satisfy my internal desire to mock them and also reassure myself that the humans are beyond redemption. They never disappoint. 

I'll be buying a gun soon so hopefully I'll nut up and do it already. Or maybe not because there's a part of me that enjoys the pain. 

Does anyone else live this way?
