Not feeling suicidal, just severely depressed.I really need someone to talk to.. depression had just started consuming me over the past couple days. I've lost interest in everything, I'm extremely irritable when it comes to loved ones trying to be supportive, I've been craving to self harm.. I just need someone right now.
