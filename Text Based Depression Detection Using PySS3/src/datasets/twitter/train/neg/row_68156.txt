Would my boyfriend finally care if I killed myself?My bf is suffering with his own depression and has been pushing me away bc of it. I've been trying my best to understand and empathize what he's been going through but I feel like I keep saying the wrong things. I feel horrible about making him feel worse/guilty. The love is slowly disappearing. I've never been diagnosed with depression but lately I feel like killing myself. I just want him to care or feel something. ANYTHING.
