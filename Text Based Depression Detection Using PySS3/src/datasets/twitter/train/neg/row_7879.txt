I'm not hardwired for this of life.I started thinking about what was the point of life in middle school (around 13 or 14 years old). I didn't understand why we had to stay stuck in school for so long, then jump right into work for many many years, until retirement when you're too old to do anything really. 

I've kind of did small jobs here and there before, but always kind of been avoiding it despite my need of money. Now I'm 24 and I found a possibly long lasting job and I hate it. I just dread going to it. I'm sure I could stand it better if I worked part time, but who can afford to live alone and work part time? I don't know but it's definitely not the case in my country ! So now I'm left being tired, dreading the next day where I'll work all day long just for a few bucks... I always thought (well since middle school) that I'd kill myself if I knew of a painless but effective way. But that until then, I would never be able to do it because I'm way to scared of pain and uncertainty for this! But these days, feeling so depressed and stuck and unhappy, it got me searching, digging and I eventually found one, one that isn't even that hard to pull off. And I've been obsessed with it... 

I hate so much that it's all written from the moment you're born... They say "you have choices in life" but that's not true, ultimately it all goes back to following the script or ending in the streets or dying. I really wish I was normal, I wish I was like everyone else ! Why can everyone do it or cope with it? And why can't I? I don't know but I hate it..
