Absolute failureI flunked out of college 3 years ago but have a steady job with benefits. My parents and brother won't stop shaming me about it and questioning any interests I have. They say I'm only fit to be drudge and I shouldn't have fucked up. I spent 10 years on a degree I can't use and am so ashamed I can't even enjoy the subject anymore in casual conversation. 

When my brother talks about his college experience he makes a point to humiliate me for being an idiot. My mother keeps telling to shut up and not to have an opinion on anything because I'm not qualified to speak about anything but menial labor. 

So sick of this shit I want to go jump in the lake and drown. I wont be able to hear them anymore and I'll be at peace for once. I didn't want to be a failure but I can never forget and I can never go forward.
