What really is the point of being here when you have no reason to stay and life just hurts you over and overWhy keep giving life the chance to abuse you more? Nothing is ever going to get better. I spend thousands of dollars going to therapy and the psychiatrist, which I love both of them, and on meds and "self care" shit any I still just want to die. I'm nothing but a waste of space and a burden to people and even though I'm already down on my ass, life keeps kicking me.
So what's even the point? I took one of everything I have been prescribed over the past year. Shouldn't be enough to kill me but I'm giving life the option to take advantage of the chemicals in my body. Maybe it'll finally decide to put me out of my misery.
