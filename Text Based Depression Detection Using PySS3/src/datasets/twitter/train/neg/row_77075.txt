Here we are againI'm trying very hard, but to what point? I have struggled with this for such a long time and I'm just tired. Tired of seeing the same things play out over and over again. The same conflicts and the same resolutions. There is no real evolution for me now, no next step. I keep postponing my exit to try "the next thing/adventure" but ultimately just get let down. Why do I keep doing this to myself. There really is no respite, no downtime that has much meaning for me anymore. I find little fulfillment in things or activities.

Sorry, just venting, postponing again, trying to find a reason to stay today.
