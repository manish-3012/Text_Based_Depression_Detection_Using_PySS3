I am ending it all in 1 year.Throwaway account obviously.

I am ending it all in one year.  I am giving my family and friends one more year with me.  Suicide isn't selfish, it isn't about the people you leave behind.  It's about someone feeling so helpless and done.  I live with several mental health issues, physical health issues and family issues.  I am so done being in constant pain.  I am so done with being judged because my mental health diagnosis was made public in a small town so there isn't much to hide.  So, one more year.  I am actually excited.....
