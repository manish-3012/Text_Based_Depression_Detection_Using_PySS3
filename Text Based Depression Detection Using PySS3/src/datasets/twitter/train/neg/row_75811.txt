I'm too tiredIt sounds so simple. "You're tired, go to bed early." I did. "Get more exercise so you have a fitful sleep!" I do 5K training almost every morning. "Eat healthy!" I do. 

I'm tired. I'm too tired. I wake up tired. I spend all day being tired. I look forward to being at home, only home, so I can do nothing, so I can sleep. But then half the time I can't sleep. I'm mentally, emotionally and physically tired. I'm sure my fiance, best friend and parents are sick of hearing it. Anything sets me off into a spiral anymore. I'm depressed and anxious constantly and on the verge of depressive fits and anxiety attacks every day now, where as I use to only get them once a month. I need to be left alone. But I also need constant validation. I need to be touched. But I'm constantly overstimulated. I've had a migraine for three days now. My eyes and head hurt constantly. I want to see my fiance, but he has work in ten minutes. I miss him, but know he's also dealing with his own anxiety and depression right now. 

I'm tired. I'm at work and i'm trying not to just leave. I feel like sobbing. I cry a lot now. I hate it. I just want to sleep and not wake up.
