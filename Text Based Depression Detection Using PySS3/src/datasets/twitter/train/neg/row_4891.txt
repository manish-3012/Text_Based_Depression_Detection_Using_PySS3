Wondering If I Am OkayI worry sometimes I might kill myself. Idk why but I struggle with this notion a lot. I am 24. I am smart, I have a university and post grad degree. 

I quit almost every job I get because of this. I feel anxious very often, makes it difficult to sleep/ work sometimes. I find maintaining relationships very difficult because of my mood swings. 

Every day I wake up feeling different so I can't make a decision on anything. I don't know if I will feel the same tomorrow...

Weed used to help, use to love lsd and mushrooms. Real good vibes hippy type, still felt depressed/ anxious often. After my girlfriend had an abortion/ left me for some bumble match things got worse. I started using benzo's to help with anxiety. 

I overdosed on xanax and cocaine before. I haven't even touched a substance in a year and still think about death a handful of times a day. I've tried anti-depressants they don't work for me. Haven't touched those in a year either.

I thought when I got sober maybe I would feel better but I feel even worse without at least having an escape. I feel better when I think about suicide. 

Are some people just meant to kill themselves? I feel like I am just waiting because of what it would do to my parents. But if it weren't for them, I would probably try and overdose again. 

Life just seems meaningless. There are 10 billion people. I am insignificant. I would rather die then work a 9-5 till I'm 60-70 and try to find a girl to "make it all worth it." I even tried making music and art. I really have done my due dilligence here. 

It doesn't go away. It doesn't stop. Idk what to do anymore. Am I destined for failure/ lack of success? Does success even matter? What does matter? Why am I this way?
