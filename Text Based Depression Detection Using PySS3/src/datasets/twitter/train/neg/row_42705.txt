Today was terriblestarted at the DMV and apparently my birth certificate wasnt good enough for a real id. then the woman who i was sent to by someone else REFUSED to help me and someone else asked me what window she was - i think she got in trouble :(

then my parents kept arguing all day and yelling about whatever. they yell a lot but they havent yelled this much in a while :(

then to top it off my stupid video game capture device broke. thats like the one thing thta keeps me sane is making video game clips and stuff. and now thats gone :(

i hate today and i wanna die. im 22 and male but autistic and disabled. i know this doesnt sound that bad but i really hate everything right now
