GoodbyeThought I should atleast have the decency to say goodbye, so no one wonders whether I'm still around or not. When this post is read I'll already be out the door and on my way to my tree with a rope in my bag. All my belongings are given away, money donated away. Only thing left is for me to go away.

Sorry for those who spent time trying to change my mind, for what its worth, you made me stick around a few more days. But I'm still me and still set on doing this.

Bye.
