today is my 23rd birthday. my birthday wish is to have cancerso i dont have to try anymore... so i could be finally relieved, knowing that i dont have to suffer for so many years ahead of me... im alone and lonely on my bday. worrying about work, my future etc

been working at this new job for 2 weeks, absolutely mind numbing an soul sucking... it could be a way of committing philosophical suicide but still its a pain in the ass and i can feel the chronic, slow pain....

i have zero friends irl.. havent been talking to anyone besides my superior for this entire week lmao... maddening... about to go to some hobby group tomorrow but i think i got flu or something. hopefully its not covid, dont think it'll kill me, it will only bring more troubles to me and my family.... lonely AF! my world has been filled with excel spreadsheets, webpages, numbers, product photos, foreign language that i cant read.... lol.. im already brain dead
