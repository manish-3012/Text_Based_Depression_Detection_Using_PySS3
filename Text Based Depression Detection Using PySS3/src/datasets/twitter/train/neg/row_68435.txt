Hopeless.I don't want to live, and I don't want to die. I don't know what to do anymore. To lose the person closest to you is the worst feeling in the world. No matter what you do you can't get them back. Without this person you're nothing. You have spent all your days with them and then they're gone in an instant. You try to get help, but nothing works. You have no where else to go but to turn to complete strangers who don't even know anything about you. You turn to those strangers seeking help, encouragement to keep going and to stay strong. This is the last place for me, and probably the last place where people will see my words. 
With a life of growing up in pain, with no one else except this one person I've been talking about above, I'll probably just go unnoticed. No family, no other friends. Nothing but myself. I fear death, but yet I hate living without her.
