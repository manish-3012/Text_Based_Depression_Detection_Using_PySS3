i feel like there is nothing left for mei feel like all my life people have just been hurting me purposely and none of my friends care about me.. i have one friend who i hang out with in real life and when i hang out with them i just feel worse.  i have no one to talk about my self harm because everyone gets scared when i talk about it or ignore me  i dont see the point in being alive anymore.
