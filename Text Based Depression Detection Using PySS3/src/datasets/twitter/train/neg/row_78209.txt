Anyone who says â€œpeople care about youâ€ are liarsI hate that phrase so much. No one has ever cared in my life. All it is is hate. If I was cared for, I would not be having these problems in the first place. I would have irl friends and a girlfriend but no, Iâ€™ve never had either and Iâ€™m freaking 21. Meanwhile so many other people my age or younger already have their life set for them. Already have dates and are having the time of their lives. Meanwhile, everyone else in this world is preventing me from having these things. Not even my parents have cared. And it pusses me off more when I say I want to kill myself and people go â€œ donâ€™t do it, it will cause more pain on othersâ€. No it wonâ€™t. No one even fucking cares about me in the first place. Never.
