Today is the Date of my Cousins SuicideAlt account, and I hope that this post is allowed here?

I just really needed to say something

On his motherâ€™s birthday, which was coincidently the early hours of New Yearâ€™s Day, 2 years ago, my cousin committed suicide. As an only child, my close cousins from my moms side were the closest things I had to siblings and some of my first friends due to shyness. Being the middle, age wise of all of these cousins, I always looked up to my cousin, â€œNâ€, because he was the outgoing and popular boy that was the exact opposite of childhood me. Feeling forgettable compared to everything he seemed to do, I longed to be more like him as I got older. He became a high school psych and soc. teacher eventually, and actually â€œinspiredâ€ me to initially study elementary education, even while I contradicted myself while full well knowing that I didnâ€™t like young kids. Towards the last few years before his death, I learned of and witnessed his alcoholism, to the extreme sometimes. I even managed to admire it somehow, in an immature, very early high school kind of way. The path he was going down really only led one way, his parents and sister had sat him down and talked to him, and he wouldnâ€™t take their offers or advice. Our grandparents did the same i learned. Only after his death did I find out some of the objectively terrible things that he had done as someone truly suffering. As a early 20 year old, and someone who had suffered severe depression and suicidal thoughts for several years in late high-school, I definitely struggle with the emotional baggage and memories that this time of year brings. I am not a risk of suicide myself, after going through a lot of therapy and seeing what a suicide does to people. But I just wanted to share my story and get some invisible thing off my chest. 

I just hope everyone stays safe this season.
