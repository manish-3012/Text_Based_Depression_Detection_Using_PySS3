I wish I never existed.My parents were on protection when I came. And although theyâ€™d been through abortion twice before they decided to keep me. Every now and then I find myself wishing they didnâ€™t.
Iâ€™m no oneâ€™s favorite person. Iâ€™m always the third wheel, whether itâ€™s my two sisters being each otherâ€™s best friends or even in my group of friends. I feel like I have no right to feel this way because my parents loved me, but now theyâ€™re gone..and now Iâ€™m too old to get pampered. Iâ€™m too old to be still looking for my parents in others. But I still need to feel like I belong all the same. Iâ€™m too scared of death to end my own life, and that makes me feel trapped in that meaningless life even more. I have nothing to go on. In everything I do, at my very best Iâ€™m the second best. I failed at sports, I failed in academics and I even failed at games. I blame no one for this, I just wish I could simply disappear. I wish I could just turn to ash and no one would even remember I was there. I really wished I was more loved, but I can never ask anyone for this because feelings donâ€™t work this way. I just wish I never existed.
