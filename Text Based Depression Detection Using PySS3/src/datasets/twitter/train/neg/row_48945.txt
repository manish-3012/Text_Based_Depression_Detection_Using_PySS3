Just called the suicide prevention hotline and hung up after one wordI donâ€™t know if this makes me a pussy but here..
So Iâ€™ve been on Lexapro for over a year now and Iâ€™ve seen improvement, but tonight has been a really new low.
I called the hotline and after the automated message, a lady greeted me with â€œThis is Sandra how may I help you?â€ in a monotonous and rushed tone...  donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m not expecting a whole theatrical performance from these people but itâ€™s just so awkward and hard to open up to a stranger, and itâ€™s worse when I feel like Iâ€™m wasting their time.
I didnâ€™t really know how to respond so I just said â€œhello...â€ like a dumbass, and she repeats â€œThis is Sandra how can I help you?â€
I have no balls so I hung up.. I know itâ€™s poor etiquette to hang up on them and all but I just felt so weird....
I donâ€™t know man I just feel so like thereâ€™s no one to go to and Iâ€™m even fudging the suicide hotlines ...
