I want to help a friend.Theres someone who I'm friends with at school. She always makes the jokes about being depressed (in the way that you use jokes to deal with it) and she just kinda flashed off some cuts on her arm to me when people werent looking today. Not gouging hunks of flesh, just a little row of slits. I don't believe she's planning anything, but is there anyway I can help? I know she's going through alot and I don't want to report her, my school will only make it worse. Is there anything I should say? Please let me know.
