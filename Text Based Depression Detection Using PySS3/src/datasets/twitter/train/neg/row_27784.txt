Is today the day?Iâ€™m debating on ending it.  I donâ€™t fit in to this world.  I look around and Iâ€™m not a carefree partier like all the other college age kids.  I suck at being my age.  Iâ€™ll never have anyone special.  I look at all these spoiled housewives whoâ€™s husbands do any and everything for them (work, pay for them to be pampered and go on exotic vacations, cook for them, clean, etc) and I know Iâ€™ll never be valuable enough for someone to wrap the world up in a pretty package, set it at my feet, and cater to my every whim.  
I have a hard time relating to kids my age and that puts a serious damper on the whole â€œmake friendsâ€ and â€œdateâ€ thing.  The friends I DO have treat me badly and only talk to me or respond to me when itâ€™s convenient or when they need something.  I have no reason to believe a spouse wouldnâ€™t treat me that same way since it seems obvious that Iâ€™m not worth being good to even though I have ALWAYS tried to be a good friend to others.  Meanwhile I watch people who were mean to me when I was a child and they are doing so well in life.  I just feel like I am abnormal, thereâ€™s things wrong with me, I donâ€™t matter, I donâ€™t belong, I will never be happy, and the ONLY thing I want anymore is to leave this world and let everyone else go on partying.
I hate my job.  My family isnâ€™t there for me.  When I try to tell my mom I just get all this rot about how I can choose to be happy and if Iâ€™ve made a dumb decision (seems like every decision I make is bad) it just goes back to an â€œI told you so!  You didnâ€™t listen!â€ 
I want to die.  Thereâ€™s no room for me in this world.  I pray that God will just spare me the trouble and end me.  But he hasnâ€™t.  Maybe I should just go do it myself?
