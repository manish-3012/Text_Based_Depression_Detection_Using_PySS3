I want to just die.My life is hell. I get up. Go to class only to be shunned and made fun of. Iâ€™m the laughing stock of my university. Itâ€™s my fault, I know. But why canâ€™t people forgive and forget? I donâ€™t have any friends who give a shit about me or would help me through this. And I know it for a fact. Iâ€™ve had depression since I was 8; it might win the battle soon. Iâ€™m stuck in a rut. My parents wonâ€™t care the slightest anyways. Iâ€™m already a failure in their eyes. Iâ€™m stuck in the same rut Iâ€™ve been in my entire life. Iâ€™m alone in this world. I have no social skills. No people who truly care. And I want to just die tonight. Iâ€™m too weak; I donâ€™t want to fight it anymore.
