Another story about my father and why I still hate him.So, here is the story. One day after he got home after work, he was pretty drunk and had a relatively long fight with, he even almost hit her a few times. After that fight in the mist of rage he broke a glass pane with his arm (that was installed in our kitchen's old door which is currently removed mostly because of that incideny) and he got a big scar on his elbow and some small glass shards stuck in it. There was a lot of blood dripping from his elbow and Hand in general. Luckily my mother managed to help him with his arm and applied bandages on his elbow and his arm too (my dad was still drunk at that time). After some time he got to sleep. On the next day he didn't even want to go the hospital and saw what he did and was sorry. But I didn't accept his aplogy and would rather just say "fuck you" straight to his face instead if I could. He also couldn't go to work because of his arm for like 3 or 4 days. 

This is just another episode of my shitty life.
