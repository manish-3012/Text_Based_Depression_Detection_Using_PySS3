At my limitWith the holidays fast approaching I'm once again reminded of what a failure I am, and of all the people that have failed me. I went through a heart breaking divorce this past February. My ex wife left me due to my mental illness - OCD. She is remarried already within one year of divorce. 

The emotional fallout from that feels like it is going to destroy me. I've been behaving recklessly- missing lots of time at work due to depression (most likely going to be fired), having random hookups,  acting out with road rage, and most of the time just stuck in a hell that I feel I can't escape. I live completely alone 1200kms from any family or friends. I went through 2 years of separation and now one year of being divorced, completely alone. No friends, no one here that cares. I'm stuck here because if I were to sell my house I would go under financially (shitty housing market here). 

I really don't see the purpose of my life. No one reaches out to me or even calls me. I have to make all the effort. Divorce has put a black mark of shame on me. Most of my family are fundamentalist Christians that equate divorce with murder. They are hypocrites to the highest degree. They beat me as a child and should be in jail for child abuse. They think they've got a ticket to heaven which I think is so fucked up. Religion destroyed me early on as a child and now I'm essentially without a family because I don't / can't believe in that bullshit anymore. 

Suicidal thoughts float through my mind on a daily basis. I don't think I have the energy to kill myself but I do wish for nuclear war, or really anything that wipes out humanity. My life experience has proven that humans are scum.
