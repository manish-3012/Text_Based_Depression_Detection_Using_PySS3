Feeling at my lowestI have been depressed and down before but lately my mind has been turning to suicide more and more. 

I get these thoughts when I am doing something like I wonder what it would be like to die like that.  Like I was swimming and I wondered how it would be to drown. 

I don't want to die but I feel like suicide is inevitable.
