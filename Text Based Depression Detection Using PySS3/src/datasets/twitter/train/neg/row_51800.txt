Why can't I die?I keep having anxiety attacks. 

I just wish I would die already. 

That one of these anxiety attacks would trigger something inside of me and just kill me already. 

I'm beyond sad. I'm beyond alone. I'm beyond depressed. 

I can't even wake up without crying. Every morning. My phone rings and I burst into tears. 

I'm so nervous when I talk to people. I can't socialize well. 

I'm a failure. I'm a worthless person. 

Every day, the crying and the frustration and the anger and the loneliness. 

Why can't I die?
