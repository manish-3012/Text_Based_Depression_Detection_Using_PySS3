I want to die. Looking perfectly okay but feeling like your insides are on fire and twisting every which way is the fucking worst.I pretty much obsess over suicide. It's been a theme this year since my boyfriend has had two of his relatives (cousin and his own mother) commit suicide. His mom jumped off a building to her death, and his cousin hanged herself. Neither of them ever mentioned wanting to kill themselves, but I mention it to my boyfriend all the fucking time. He's very supportive, but he's currently playing video games in the other room and I don't want to bother him. 

I don't really know what keeps me going, besides his love and one other thing. I love being around animals. I don't make enough money to fully support myself, but I do make a decent amount doing dog walking. I love making a difference in their lives. I'm thinking about volunteering at a shelter, as well, so I'm not so isolated. I've just realized that no one in my family seems to reach out to me or want to include me in anything, except for maybe my mom. Today was mediocre since I don't have the best relationship with my dad.

I don't have friends. All I have is my significant other, and all he has is me. 

I just feel like I've failed. Everyone else my age has graduated and moved on, but I have not. I still have one more class to take before I graduate, and I'm so close, but I don't even know what I want to do. I have no real work experience and I have my mental health to thank for that.

I take medication but it doesn't seem to help all that much anymore. My boyfriend keeps urging me to see a therapist. I just don't feel like going through the motions, not this time. I just want to accept that I don't want to live anymore and be done with it. I wish I had the courage.
