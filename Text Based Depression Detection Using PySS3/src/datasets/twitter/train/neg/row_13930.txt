I have chosen a date, and it feels, weirdly peaceful nowDon't have an exact date, but in a few months  I know I will be alone for about a week or so, Im gonna buy a shotgun and shoot myself in the head, feels weirdly peaceful now that I decided to do that....

Who knows, maybe I'll end up in heaven or maybe there's nothing after death, either way, win win.
