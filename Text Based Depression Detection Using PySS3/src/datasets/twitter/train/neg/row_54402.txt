My therapist wanted a friendI used to go to therapy for my anxiety and depression.

I spent 10 weeks, my parents spent Â£1500, for her to get to know me.

I made it clear to my therapist that I wanted help, coping mechanisms that donâ€™t harm me or others.

10 weeks in? She was still â€œgetting to know me.â€

Therapists donâ€™t want to help you, they want your money and you to be hopeless enough to not call them out.
