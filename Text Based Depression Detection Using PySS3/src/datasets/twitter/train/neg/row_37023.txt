Is there anyone who would be up for a chat?Iâ€™m feeling really suicidal again. Called my GP the other day to say that my suicidal feelings have returned and theyâ€™ve suggested another type of anti-depressant, but Iâ€™m too depressed to even go and collect it from the pharmacy. Is there anyone whoâ€™s free for a chat?
