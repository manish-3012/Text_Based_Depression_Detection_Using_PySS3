Not trying to kill myself but can someone PLEASE talk to me? I'd like to feel human just once in my life at the very least.Guys, please. My chest is closing up and alcohol doesn't help, neither does logic. I've done it again. I have gotten fooled by another man who pretended to love me then proceeded to use me and put me to the side. 
Why do I do this? Why me? Its like I can never ever catch a break and I feel lonely and hurt and anxious and dumb and I just don't want to feel anymore. But then i have a kid and parents who would hate me if I did that to them and I have a sister whose mind is in pieces and how can I just leave her here. Its so cruel and dark and awful here. Just please tell me why I keep repeating my mistakes? Because this time I found someone who seems to be punishing me for all of them. 
I feel like my heart is about to stop. I can't breathe in just out and I can't stop crying or shaking or hurting. Just please make it stop.
