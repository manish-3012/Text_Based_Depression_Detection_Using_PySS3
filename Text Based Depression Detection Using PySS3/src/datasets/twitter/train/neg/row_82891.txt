I cant stop thinking about itEverything hurts, my family hates me. I have no friends. All I have is a boyfriend who is 600 miles away and my sweet kitty. The only thing stopping me. I dont know anyone who would take care of him if I died and he would go to the shelter. It breaks my heart to think about. But I've been kind of mean, yelling at him. I have been giving him extra treats and love and playtime but I still feel like a fucking monster and it's only solidifying my desire to off myself.
