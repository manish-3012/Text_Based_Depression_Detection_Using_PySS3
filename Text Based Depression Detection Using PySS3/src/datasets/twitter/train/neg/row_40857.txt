My thoughts sometimes I wonder how it feels to be dead and escape my depression. to see how it feels to put a gun to my head and blow my brains out thoughts that came to me ... I suffer from depression from a broken heart and not able to be my firstborn child and it hurts me so as the time thick the end will get near yours truly K's ..........7th/6/20
