I guess it's pointlessTried to get help on here and responses all disappeared. Tried to ask a friend for help but she couldn't offer more than 'see your doctor'. I'm spiralling and i don't know where i'm going to end up. I'm ready to accept the world wouldn't change without me in it. I'm fucking fed up with all this pain.
