Really need some help and a friend right nowI have been depressed before, but now I am depressed once more, only much worse, I am stuck in a job I don't want, and am not good at, I am 100 miles away from anyone who cares and those who I thought cared it seems do not, in the last week I have thought of killing myself twice once on the verge of doing so stopped only by the doorbell. I need someone, something to give me a reason to live because right now I can find none.
