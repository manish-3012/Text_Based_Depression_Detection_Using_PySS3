In a shitty situation...I'm in a shitty situation and I really don't feel like being alive anymore.

A little about us: 

- Married for 8 years.
- We have 3 kids and own a home.
- My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer at 25. (She had a double mastectomy)

It started a week after my 8 year anniversary. My wife told me she "Loved me but wasn't in love with me." We'd gone through a rough patch about a year or two ago. She had lost her sex drive almost entirely and it caused some friction and arguments. We both had a high drive while dating and early on into marriage. Hers completely died off after having her ovaries removed after having our third child 2 years ago. She told me she just didn't care for sex anymore. After counseling and talking things out with a professional and we were in a better place. I'd learned to just deal with it on my own and not let it hurt our relationship. The counselor had advised her to put effort into our date night and try to get into the mood, that we should explore our bodies together and she should try solo as well. She refused to try. I tried to just put it on the back burner and focus on our emotional relationship. She decided to bury her face in her phone even more than normal. I found out she was playing Game of War nearly constantly, ignoring our kids. I brought it up in counseling and she "cut back" to 3-4 hours a day. 3 weeks of her being distant and saying almost nothing she tells me to come home and blow off work the following day. Naturally I was confused and came home to her sitting on the couch and saying she does love me, she misses me, she wants to run away with me for the weekend. I tell her I can't miss any more work. We need to pay the mortgage and her back credit card bills, Thanks Game of War and irresponsible spending, we had a great night anyway. Kissing and loving each other. I was so fucking happy. We talk and I tell her I want intimacy and she wants stability. I agree to stability and whatever she wants. She says she doesn't care about intimacy and can't do it. We were at odds, again. The following Saturday she says she's going to go to a restaurant and museum with friends in Harrisburg at 5. It was our sons 6th birthday and we spent the afternoon together in Hershey to celebrate. I bring my oldest  home that night and get him to bed at 9pm. She's still out. I was looking over bills online and notice that there is ZERO money taken from our joint account. She finally comes home at 11pm. I was blunt and asked who she was out with. She lied. I asked again and she pauses and says Aaron, a "friend" from Game of War. I lose my shit. She's out on a date with a guy for 5 hours on our SON'S BIRTHDAY. She says nothing happened. They hugged and that was it. Well, I find out after counseling that week that she hugged him with her vagina. I'm crushed. A week earlier she "loved me again" but she out fucking another guy, even though she doesn't like sex anymore. 

We are filing for divorce. She's a thieving piece of shit ($15,000 on Game of War in 8 months) and a whore to boot. Here's the shitty part... I still love her. I still want her. I nursed this woman for months after ever surgery. Packing her wounds, measuring drainage bulb outputs, bathing her, feeding her. I put her through school 2 times. I work a job I HATE so that she can keep it to part time hours to spend the time with our kids while they're still young (her request). Now she wants to leave me. She wants to be away from me and she's all I can think about. 

I gave myself a week to see how things turn out. It's day 2 and the outlook is grim. I've never been this heartbroken and betrayed in my entire god damn life. I'm deeply rooted in depression and think about killing myself multiple times a day. 

Thanks for reading this. Getting it out is helping a little bit.
