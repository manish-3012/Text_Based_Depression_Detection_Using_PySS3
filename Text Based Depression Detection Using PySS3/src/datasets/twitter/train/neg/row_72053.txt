I've been staring at my father's rifle.Recently I've been thinking about killing myself, everyone I know abandons me and I'm too demotivated to actually do my school work, so I end up cheating and it feels shitty. But I moved so many times and got so behind I didn't know what to do, I don't want to get a bad future. I don't, but I know cheating is bad and I know that as soon as I get caught I'm fucked. I'm too demotivated to even cheat at this point I have all F's on my Junior year of high school, and I've been given the opportunity to improve it but it's so hard for me to just stop being lazy and do something for once. I feel so pathetic, so hopeless. I don't see anything ahead. All I see is society screwing itself over and me living some crappy life. Is it really that bad to say that suicide is a better option? I keep looking back at the rifle and seeing it as a way out, it's fast, I won't feel much pain and I finally found where my Dad hid the shells. The option is there, and I can't decide what I want. A possible future or a possible crappy future. Im scared that if I don't do it soon and people find out my plan I will get locked up.
