i plan on ending it tonight. F15.This is it for me. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m in a world of hurt, mentally and physically. Iâ€™m going to go ahead and feel sorry for myself because what better time for self pity than your last day alive? My family and friends will do fine without me, actually theyâ€™ll do better without me to deal with. Everyone who hates my guts or barely knew me are soon gonna act like they loved me for the attention. I donâ€™t want to be hurt, nor do I want to keep hurting others by existing. I canâ€™t live a happy life with my insides conspiring to make me so insane. The only way to rid myself of my bipolar disorder, anxiety, and asd is death. Iâ€™m really gonna do it this time because I canâ€™t take being locked up in the hospital like Iâ€™m a criminal and being pumped full of medicine again. I love sleep so much. Iâ€™m not hurting when Iâ€™m asleep. And Iâ€™m ready for an eternity of numbness. In less than 20 hours Iâ€™m going to walk into the woods by my house and off myself by climbing in a tree with a nice, tight noose. Itâ€™s weird how I remember being little and being so happy whenever Iâ€™d climb trees. Now I wouldnâ€™t describe myself as happy to climb this last tree, but relieved. My last day is going to be spent in bed, eating sweets and whatever i enjoy. Iâ€™m going to look back through memories of when i still had hope and people loving me. Comfort care.
