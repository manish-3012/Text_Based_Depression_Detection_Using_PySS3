I want to write me a poemdo you ever think that maybe it'd be better if maybe for some reason the things that we thought rhymed? I think if my suicidal thoughts were like poems people would like them instead of saying that they were bad and medicated away, they'd be art with iambic pentameter instead of insane ramblings of a sick sad person, don't you think&gt; I've had a lot to drink sw, I'll be honest, a lot of gin maybe too much, 

I want to take someones cancer from them to stop them hurting, I'll give them my organs, I'm not using them. someone good and kind who people need, I want their cancer, I think someone got it wrong and was meant to give it to me instead, that would be more fair and i wouldnt mind really, itd be so easy to sort out the worlds problems. I watched this documentary on Zizeck and he was at that staircase and said, wouldn't it be nice if we could have it nice and organised like this, have people fill out the paperwork and jump and there would be a services to take the bodies away, he said it like he was joking but I wish it was a reality we could have. 

I'm so terrified it's not gonna get better
