I just have no motivationI don't know if this is the best place to put this but I have no will to live anymore. I have a plan and everything. I don't really have anything to live for anymore. Before corona I had quite a few friends but now I have no one to talk to. I've lost all my friends and I just don't know how to deal with it. I used to never think I would have to post something like this cause I've never felt this bad. I'm not really looking for advice I just wanted to rant I guess..
