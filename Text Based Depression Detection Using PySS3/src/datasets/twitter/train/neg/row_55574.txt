I think i'm gonna try writing a book based off of my shitty life. I'm 15 and my whole life is pretty much shit. No one really understands me or why I am the way I am and i can't type it on here cause it would well literally be the size of a book. So I figured I would try over the course of a few months probably to write a book about aforementioned shitty life. I'm a good writer but never really been good at writing books or anything but i might as well try so my shithole of an existence can at least mean a little something useful.
