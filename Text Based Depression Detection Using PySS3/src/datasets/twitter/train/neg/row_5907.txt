Today is my last dayIâ€™m 16 years old, go to a private high school, and by all means should be happy. The only thing wrong in my life is my emotionally and verbally abusive father. However I cannot feel anything. Only sadness and pain. Iâ€™m a medically diagnosed psychopath. I have severe depression and nothing to live for in my eyes. I have no self esteem, no redeeming qualities, nothing about me is good. I cannot feel happy unless Iâ€™m cutting or abusing drugs. Iâ€™ve never been loved and never been able to love anyone. Iâ€™m not worthy of love, and Iâ€™ll never be loved. This isnâ€™t a cry for help or for comfort. I donâ€™t know by Iâ€™m posting this to be honest. I just wanted some like minded people to know and sympathize with me while I live my final day on Earth.
