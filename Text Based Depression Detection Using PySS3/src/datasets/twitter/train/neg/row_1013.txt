Sunday is My last day on earthHello My name is Barry im 21 im tired i have my note ready to end my life. I do think i put alot of effort into being nice to people i put a mark on this world I just cant go on I have a big heart but dont let it fool you my mind is sick and will never be fixed i have been depressed for years I have fallen apart something that cant be repaired. Im sorry to my friend bri ,we just hung out recently  im sorry for not being able to stay strong not for only you but for me i told you I would try to be strong but I cant I have been Isolated for so long I have dealt with rejection more than others I think but i thank my one friend for making me feel worthy for at least a day that means alot to me. I will be posting my suicide note here on sunday evening. Zi do have some things to take care of before I go . I will be ending my life in the woods that way it is harder to find me. I am open to talk to anyone on my full last day in this terrible world.
