TRIGGER WARNING: I'm done... Is there anyone doing the thing I am addicted to?I have no idea how to explain it without naming it... So, pls, be careful...!
I found a way to self-harm no one can see... and I am not able to stop anymore.
I try pressing my ribcage until my heart flutters or skips beats and reaches over 200 bpm... I can't help but love that sensation in my chest.
I guess it caused severely damage and I developed heart palpitations.
And yet I'm waiting for it to kill me...
