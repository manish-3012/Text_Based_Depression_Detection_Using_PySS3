Always lonely. Nothing will ever change. Is there any concrete, non-platitude reason not to end it?The most friends Iâ€™ve ever had was 4. That lasted less than a year. Other than that the most I had was 1, but most of my life I have had none. Never had any romantic or sexual interaction of any kind. Experimented with going out socially since Iâ€™m in college now and it seemed like an opportunity but it doesnâ€™t work. No one wants to interact with me in any meaningful capacity no matter where I go or what I try. I have no meaningful relationships within my family besides my father.

I feel lonely every moment of my life and I just want to end my existence. Itâ€™s too painful, there is no God or afterlife to worry about, my family can move on and have no right to make this decision for me anyway. I have been trying for years and Iâ€™m 21 as of today (woo!) and I am just done trying anymore. I canâ€™t think of any good reasons and no one on this sub will have an answer. I just want to confirm that. I guess itâ€™ll be my last laugh at this pathetic life of mine. I already have my method planned out and money ready.
