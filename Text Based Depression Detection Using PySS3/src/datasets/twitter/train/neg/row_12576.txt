How can you win in a society when there are no winners? Just people who suffer with varying amounts of moneyIt's like I can't escape the loneliness that is my mind. I grew up in a home full of fighting and narcissism. I have fairly "high-functioning" depression but what's the point when the entire world is going to shit. Billionaires are going to rid the earth of anything worth living for. I'm going to go to work for years just to enjoy the last couple of years if I'm lucky. I want to know what the point is. I feel like it's been nothing but suffering for what little "joy" I have. It's not worth fighting for. The pandemic really highlights how much fragility and ego-centric the world is. My head hurts and my heart hurts and I need something to hold on to.
