need helpI would give so much for my parents to love me
I really need love and can't find it anywhere
I'm still a kid &amp; i've been hooking up with older men because I need somebody to love me
I just want to be held when I cry, not yelled at, belittled, and attacked
I just want to give and receive love, share the things that bring me joy
I just want somebody to come home to
I just want a man to love me and to love
I just want love i just want love I just want love
Am i incapable? Why do I seem so repellent of good people who wont take advantage of me?
Why did my parents have me if they don't love me?
Why am I here?
I have a gun somebody please talk to me
