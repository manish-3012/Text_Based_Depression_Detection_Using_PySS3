Suicidal thoughts are overwhelming me and I'm accepting themI feel myself getting closer and closer to the point where I'll try to kill myself again and I'm happy about that because that's my only goal in life now after I've failed to achieve my goals. Now killing myself is my only goal I might not do it today or tomorrow or even this week but I'll do it eventually I hate being alive I fucking hate it and I don't want to be alive anymore

What's the point of being alive if you'll never be the person you want?
Whats the point of being alive if you're stuck in a body that you hate and there is no way you can change?
What's the point of being alive if you can't do anything that you love? You are forced to do things that you hate every single day and there is no escape from this hell
What's the point of living if you're all alone and you feel like an outcast in your society?
I've lived all my life with this motto "only the best is good enough" and I'm not the best, I'm not even average, I'm below average and I can't live like this anymore

I already got the plan and I'll do it when I feel like this is the last straw
