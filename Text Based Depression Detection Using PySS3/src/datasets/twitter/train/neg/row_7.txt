Can you imagine getting old? Me neither.Wrinkles, weight gain, hair loss, messed up teeth and bones, health issues, menopause, hormones, hating new generations &amp; the way world progress.

Being a useless angry piece of shit who can't take care of itself. Being totally depended on people who secretly wants you to die already.

Can you even imagine yourself there? Absolutely not. Even if I was happy, I'd take my life just to avoid this.
