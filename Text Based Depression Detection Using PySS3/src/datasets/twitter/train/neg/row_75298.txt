At this point Iâ€™m just so doneIâ€™m constantly depressed, faking every happy interaction with people, and I just want it to be over. Iâ€™m tired of feeling so down, and I want everything Iâ€™m feeling to just stop. Iâ€™m terrified of killing myself because I have a son, and I donâ€™t want to hurt my mom, but as time goes on, Iâ€™m hurting more and more and just canâ€™t handle the pain anymore. I really canâ€™t take it anymore. I donâ€™t know how to do it, because Iâ€™m terrible with pain, and donâ€™t have access to pills to do it that way. But i do plan on going through with it because I feel terrible, now and about my future. Iâ€™m going nowhere in life, have no drive or motivation in life, have no talents, and am just a waste of space, and Iâ€™m always going to feel like I do, and I canâ€™t live like this any longer. Iâ€™m just so done.
