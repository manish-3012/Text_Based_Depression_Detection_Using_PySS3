I can't go back to schoolAlmost everyday when I'm in school I think about killing myself and how much I hate myself. I don't wanna go back but my dad won't listen to me and he's gonna make me go back. I know if I go back I'm gonna die, but at the moment the only other option I have instead of going back is killing myself. I just don't know what to do anymore.
