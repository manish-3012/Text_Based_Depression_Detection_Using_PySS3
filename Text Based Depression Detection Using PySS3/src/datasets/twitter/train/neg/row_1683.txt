Iâ€™m just so doneI donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I always end up here, no matter what I do Iâ€™m always in my room thinking about killing myself. I often joke about killing myself hoping that someone notices but they never do and who would blame them? I donâ€™t know what to do. I need help. Someone please help.
