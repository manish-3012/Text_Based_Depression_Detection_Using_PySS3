My death.When I die I think I would like to be cremated. My grandmother was cremated when she passed and had her ashes spread in a river she loved. I want my ashes to be buried with a sapling so at least my death can help bring something positive into this world. 

Ive been starving myself for 5 days now, only drinking things like juice and energy drinks to keep my body going. I donâ€™t enjoy eating anymore like I used to. I donâ€™t want to eat. I donâ€™t want to waste food in these last two weeks that Iâ€™ll be alive. I canâ€™t wait for it to finally be over, it feels nice to actually be able to look forward to something.
