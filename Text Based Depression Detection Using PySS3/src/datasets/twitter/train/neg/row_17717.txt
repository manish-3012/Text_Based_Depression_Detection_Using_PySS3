Iâ€™m really not sureIâ€™m not even sure if I have a problem or not. But whatever. For almost all my life, Iâ€™ve gone through years of emotional and verbal abuse from everyone at school. Itâ€™s all because of who I am. My race, my personality. Everything.  Iâ€™m an Asian, 16 year old who canâ€™t do jack crap. Everyone I know says that I shouldnâ€™t be upset with myself. I get really good grades and have a decent life. But thatâ€™s not how I feel. I havenâ€™t had a more than ok day in a few months. I have friends but sometimes I feel as if Iâ€™m not really friends with them. I feel like theyâ€™re just lying about what they feel about me. I dont know.  My parents just yell at me for not doing anything but I donâ€™t have any motivation. At school I donâ€™t have confidence to even talk to people. I force myself to but I just feel so awkward when I do. I feel so lonely. All of my friends have moved on from the past but i have such a hard time doing so. Everyone has found someone they love, but Iâ€™m going to be alone forever. I have no chance with the girl I have a crush on. Life has just been shit. 
And well, I just attempted cutting my wrist and I only got as far as making a prick. My first time Iâ€™ve tried self harm and Iâ€™m scared and I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t have the balls to tell anyone or kill myself or full on self harm. I plan on telling my friends because weâ€™re all in a group chat but the chat has become so disconnected and I feel as if we arenâ€™t all friends anymore. I just feel they wonâ€™t believe me. Iâ€™m scared. I dont know what to feel. I know I need help but i donâ€™t want to let anyone down even if theyâ€™re not close to me. I donâ€™t wanna disappoint anyone. Iâ€™m sorry if you read through my whole rant. I need to go to bed but I canâ€™t stop thinking. Im only going to get 5 hours of sleep so I should sleep. At least Iâ€™m kind of watching my health. Hah. Yah right.
