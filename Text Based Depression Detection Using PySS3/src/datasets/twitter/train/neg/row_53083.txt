When does it get better?I've been suffering from depression for the past 11 years. My life is slowly just getting worse and worse, each year is harder to live through and with every passing day I have less and less hope that I will ever be satisfied with my life.

Now I'm only hoping to get to a state where I won't feel anything, I've given up on being happy with my life or anything like that, now I just strive for complete numbness. I finally broke a few days ago and emailed my doctor regarding my mental health, she says she can't help me right now because the medical system is overburdened due to covid. :D

I've hit rock bottom, I've never felt this bad before. I have no hope for the future and all I do every day is watch TV. If my parents weren't alive I would have been long gone by now. People always say about situations like this that it gets better, but after 11 years, I don't believe them anymore.
