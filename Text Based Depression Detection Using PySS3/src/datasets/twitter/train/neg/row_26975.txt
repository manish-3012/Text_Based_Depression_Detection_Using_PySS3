I'll probably be going to prison for 10 years or more.I'm not going to say anything specific about this but things are not looking very good.  Anyway my parents will be going on vacation in a few weeks so that should give me plenty of time alone to make peace with this and make sure I do it right.  My only regrets are not being able to finish some pretty good summer season anime I was looking forward to :(
