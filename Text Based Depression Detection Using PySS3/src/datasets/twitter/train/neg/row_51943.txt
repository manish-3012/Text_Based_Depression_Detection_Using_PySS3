Life is UnfairTimes like these when people are dropping like flies, I think of how much I wanna die.
For example, my uncle just died leaving 3 orphans behind. Why can't I give my life to them? I wish I could transfer my life. Because I'm worthless with no skill set while he's a doctor with kids, for example.
Anyone ever feel this way too?
