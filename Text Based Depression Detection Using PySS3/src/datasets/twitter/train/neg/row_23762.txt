feeling old and washed up at 19yesterday i posted on here with a different account mentioning that i wanted to kill myself on my 20th birthday. but i forgot to mention some important details from my past. 

i was molested by my math teacher when i was 13/14 and now every year i just feel like iâ€™m getting uglier and uglier. objectively i am more attractive than i was then but in my head i still feel like iâ€™m undesirable because iâ€™m not a little girl anymore. every birthday is miserable for me. turning 18 was particularly difficult. 

all those feelings came back last night when i stumbled across a subreddit which basically insinuates that women are worthless once they reach a certain age. they claim that women peak at 13-16 and everything is over after that.  seeing how ugly i feel now iâ€™m starting to think itâ€™s true. if i feel like a repulsive old hag at 20 then how will i feel when iâ€™m 25, 30, or 40?

i need help. somebody please help me.
