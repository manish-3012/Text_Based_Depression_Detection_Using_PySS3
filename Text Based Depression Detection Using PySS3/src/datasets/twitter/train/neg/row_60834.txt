Why should I live if I cannot earn any incomeWhy should I be expected of humanity to live if I cannot earn any income. It has been three months since my company shut down due to bankruptcy and still no job.

I have five years worth of data entry experience, two years worth of customer service, and three months worth of cybersecurity. I have a bachelor's in health science and a master's in cybersecurity.

Yet still nobody wants to hire me. Why should I be expected to be alive when I can't earn anything? Why shouldn't I take up the noose by December?
