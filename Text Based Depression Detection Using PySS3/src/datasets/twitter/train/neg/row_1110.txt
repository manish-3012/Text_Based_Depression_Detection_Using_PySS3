My "life" ended a long time agoI'm posting here because I'm for the most part done with living. Life has nothing to offer me. Never has. 

First, I'm going to describe myself so those who will be turned off by talking with someone like me will know up front.

I'm 5'3", about 150, 55 years old, medium-brown skinned female, short small nose, a jutted jaw with thin lips, sunken eyes, a metal hip and cataracts. Face looks flat from the side and people have called me "retard" or "Down syndrome" because of it. I might actually have something wrong with me genetically. I've always had poor muscle tone. So there, I'm ugly, and on top of that, I'm probably a narcissist with schizoid affective disorder, have been hospitalized in medical and mental institutions more than 15 times. I was assaulted in one of the mental institutions. 

I have never stopped thinking of committing suicide. I think about it every single day, have done so since my early teens. I was almost successful back in 2011. Worst day ever for the entire world. I should have died then, at least.

Not one person on this earth is compatible with me. Several people have said to me, "Don't nobody want you," and they have been right. Even the guy I was married to and divorced didn't like me for anything but as much money he could spend. I can't think of one family member with whom I've been close. I'm a burden to them all, and that number has always been around five or less.

So, for all of my life, I've been pushed off on people whose job it was to "provide services" to me. Now, even those people don't want the job.

So what's left?

The sooner I'm outta here, the less of a burden I will be, and the better off the world will be.
