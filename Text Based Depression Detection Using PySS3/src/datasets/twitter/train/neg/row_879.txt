I have so much to be thankful forDownvote please because Iâ€™m not actually suicidal. Not familiar with this subreddit but found it randomly and didnâ€™t wanna freak out others. 

I just donâ€™t know what I have to offer this world or vice versa. Emptiness. Iâ€™m nothing and stupid and alone. If America doesnâ€™t ease into facism, it will explode into a civil war. None of my people have guns. Re: Climate. I live in California and things will only get worse (as will it everywhere.) Luckily I have no children, nor a partnerâ€” I have no stake in this game. I donâ€™t want to live to see how awful it gets. 

But yeah, my life is great otherwise. All the other boxes are more than checked. Fuck.
