Been alone for nearly over 100 days, didnt do much besides go to work, go home, and go to sleep. Saved 4K, but im still aloneThe amount of loneliness ive been through during this time should be illegal. Our leaders should be in jail for the emotional torment they put us through. I havent made any serious social contact, and i was single even before covid. The isolation is starting to kill me, and ive begun cutting myself again just to escape the emotional detachment. Any advice would be nice.
