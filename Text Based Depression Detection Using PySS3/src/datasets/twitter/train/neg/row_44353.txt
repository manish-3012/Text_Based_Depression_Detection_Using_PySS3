anyone feel like youâ€™ve lived a previous life and youâ€™re just old and tiredokay let me explain, like iâ€™m young but i feel like iâ€™m too old for this shit. maybe in a previous life if thatâ€™s a thing like iâ€™m fucking 1000 years old. iâ€™m just ready to peacefully be a ghost or just have no thoughts/memories and have my existence be ridden completely.
