No judgementFirst time writter...

I'm just looking for a neutral opinion because im running out of options and i have no one to talk to because the people i talk to are all involved ....
 I dont know where to go for help, i don't know what to do... Im scared of judgement if i post my story... 


Alright well ill try to make this simple.
Ive been with the same person for 4 years. True real love after years of abusive ex boyfriends. Anything someone would dream for,  someone you would want to spend ur life with kinda thing. He teached me so much. I became a real adult.

Unfortunately the last year went downhill, no affection, no communication, no sex.
I started feeling even worst than i ever did. My self confidence took a huge hit even tho it was already inexistant.

Now i don't want to hear "if you really loved him you would not have done this!" People make mistakes. I did a mistake, i went elsewhere. 
He found out but he took me back. Now i am in extreme dillema because i can't stomach the fact of what i have done and look at him in the eyes. I'm so worthless.

Should i leave? Should i stay? Do i really deserve the true love im given?
 I don't know what to do. I just want to end my pain so badly. If i end myself then i wont have to deal with this no more. Theres more details of the story but i feel uncomfortable posting it.

Quick backstory on mental health: abused mentally and physically from 15 to 18 Now 22. Extremely depressive and anxious. Constant suicidal thoughts. No self worth.
