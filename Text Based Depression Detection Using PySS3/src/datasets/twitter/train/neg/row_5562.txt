I've seriously attempted Suicide 3 timesAll 3 times I failed. All 3 times I ended up in the hospital. Thankfully,
my life has improved a bit and I feel like I can move past some of those dark thoughts that brought me to that point. I wanted to share this free book, [Suicide, The forever decision](http://www.ryanpatrickhalligan.org/documents/Forever_Decision.pdf) because it helped me, and I just sincerely hope it can help 1 other person on this sub. Even if it's the last thing you ever read, it's worth a try. I can't know how you feel, but I know what the unrelenting desire to die feels like, and I'd just like to help anybody I can.
