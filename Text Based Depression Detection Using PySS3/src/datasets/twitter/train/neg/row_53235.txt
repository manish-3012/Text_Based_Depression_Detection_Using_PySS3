Urgent help, this is my first time and im losing all shit I haveIm mentally fucked up; my emotional strength is brittle it gets broken time to time because of my depression, my childhood is fucked up im not fcking gonna hide it anymore when I was a child I have this "practice time" with him and I was pretty mentally abused by my parents blaming their mistakes to me, my psychological health is fcking messed I have depression I dont even need a doctor to say so, my OCD doesn't really touch me as before.  

  Today, I just had it idk whether I should keep going, im trapped whether I should just close all the doors in my heart it feels so cold and lonely, it causes me stress and pain like it feels hurting my self. If I did open my heart all that happened from my past and time to time pain, happens again. I'll see my self lonely, no one will love me!! And I fcking hate it I just want to sleep. If I didnt make it till this friday. All I plan is to help my groupmates with our project which they partially rely on me. Fuck it, no one will love me anyways, im a fucking ugly retard anyways
