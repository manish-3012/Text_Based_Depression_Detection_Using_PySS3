I am uncomfortable with my existenceI'm so pessimistic nowadays and it feels like nothings gonna be alright ever. This  is my first year on college and I cant even focus my classes. I'm broke and in debt already and I cant find a part or full time job for getting paid. Everything is so expensive in my country and I can't afford anything I want even if I work and save some money. I live with my parents and so does my brother. And we cant get along with each other. My brother is a narcissist sociopath and always finds a reason to fight with me. He's always angry and threatening me to death. And I cant do anything. I cant find a solution to this life. I wonder if I end my life, will everything get better...
