I survived, only try again?A few years ago I had my first attempt at suicide. I was in the National Guard and had finally shipped off to basic training. It was the first day, and I hadn't slept in four days. I jumped off a 2nd story balcony that night from my bay. I first walked out and stood on the ledge, until another girl came out to make me come inside. My heart was pounding so much.. I couldn't turn back after I was there and had been seen. 

I asked the girl "If a fall this high would kill me". Deep down, I didn't want to die. But I made the choice when I fell forward. I fractured both my feet and hit my head on the concrete, scarring my forehead and ankles. The following three months were hell. They say in Fort Sill, there is still blood on the concrete because they couldn't wash it all off.

Now, I am coming to my second chance. It seems the only thing that has made me feel better is when I have a plan and I prepare myself to do it. 

I am a drop out, I have a minimum wage job, no house to call my own, and have no joy in anything. Everyone tells me "People have it worse than you, stop being depressed" and it only makes me feel guilty, so pathetic I should just vanish. I can honestly I am alone now. 

I had a love, the love of my life. I was already depressed.. and after nine years, I was cheated on and was treated as if I never existed. 

I just think, I am tired of feeling this way. I feel that this is life and I just want it to stop. I want to be happy again, but I don't even know if I can.

I want to just start walking and keep going, seeing where I go. I have under a hundred and I don't know my city or how to drive. I wouldn't know where to go, or what to do.. but I want to just keep on walking.
