How do you pick up your life when you've burned it to the ground?Don't know if this fits here, kinda don't care right now because it is literally the only place I can think of to turn to anymore.  

I have burned every acquaintance/friendship I've ever had, spiraling doesn't even describe my lifestyle over the past 26 years.  On February 20th I had the biggest wake-up call of my life when a friend, my only friend over the past 10 years blocked contact with me.  

Weird to say but it felt like my eyes were open for the very first time, seeing how abrasive, argumentative, cowardly, cynical, devious, erratic, ignorant, immature, insensitive, irresponsible, manipulative, superficial and toxic I was to everyone around me specifically them.  Like a bubble had burst around me.  I was attention seeking so hard trying to ignore how much I was projecting everything wrong with me onto everyone else, for Christ sake I faked suicide and even now I wouldn't be able to tell why.  It was so very stupid.

All I feel is anxiety, anger, numbness and sadness all the time crushing down on me as I realize just how much I've fucked up.  Now all alone, which I rightfully deserve and I don't know what to do.  My chest legitimately hurts.
