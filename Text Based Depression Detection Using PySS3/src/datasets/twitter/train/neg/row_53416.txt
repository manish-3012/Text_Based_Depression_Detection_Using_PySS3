Writing About The Past Is Too MuchI'm 35 years old. I've always had mild depression and the first time I contemplated suicide was when I was 19, when I had clinical depression (diagnosed).

Lately I've been trying to figure out if I should get rid of some things, like yearbooks. I sat down and remembered who I was then. My time in high school was a time of anxiety and fear for me because I played football and hated it. I only played it because I thought other people expected me to. Getting hit and yelled at for four years isn't easy. I still sometimes have nightmares that I'm playing football again, but I'm missing all my gear.

I decided to sit down and write honestly about myself and people and events that still bother me from that time. 

I've come to realize where I went wrong. Had I made 2 or 3 different decisions in the first two years of high school, I probably would have been very happy in high school and left high school a much better person. Significantly happier and better. But I wasn't strong or smart or principled enough to make those 2 or 3 better decisions. I believe I'd be in a much better place now had I been wiser, with better memories. 

In spite of my accomplishments since then, I believe I've wasted my life and feel I should kill myself. I don't think I will kill myself, but the feeling is so strong. It's not that I think I should kill myself, but that I *feel*, deep in my heart, that the pain is too much and I should just give up. That maybe everyone would forgive me if I just ended it myself, as an act of contrition.

I didn't really come here to get help. I can't imagine anything can help me at this point now that I'm 35. 

Feel free to comment, but I'm so depressed now, please don't expect a response.
