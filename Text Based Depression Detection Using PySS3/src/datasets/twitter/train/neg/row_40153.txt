i don't think i actually want to die but life is too scaryTW (besides suicide obviously, i mention self harm) 
here's the thing. I know that life can be very good, it just hasn't been for me and i wish it was. I've been depressed and severely anxious since I was around 4. I am now 18, wishing I would have the guts just to atleast attempt suicide just because of how desperate for help I am. I know it's fucked up, and I'm sorry, but I feel like it would be the only way for me to be taken serious. My mom does what she believes to be the best for me, but she kinda neglected my mental health, even if she didn't mean to. I asked for help way earlier, it wasn't supposed to be like this. I was supposed to get help and feel better. I've had serious suicidal problems in the past and they're coming back, but now im also scared of death. I just feel so miserable all the time and wish I could just click on a button that would make me get away from this planet and all the pain it's caused me. I'm way too young and way too scared. I absorb everyone else's problems, I have nightmares of my traumas, I can't function properly because of how sick I feel and because of how much I am scared of basic life tasks, my intrusive thoughts and how much I miss cutting myself. I don't think i actually want to be dead, but i just wish i had a reason not to want to die, because i know life could be good. at least it almost was once.
