Actually wanting to dieI read so many posts here of people that want to die because of a terrible situation they're in, which seems endless for them. I often hear people say ''You don't want to die, you just don't want to live the life you're living now!'' and thats probably true for most people, but how do you cope when you Ã¡ctually want to die? I don't want a life at all. I'm not in a bad situation, i'm not going through something tramatic, I just don't have a will to live, to do anything: no motivation. I don't think I ever had.
