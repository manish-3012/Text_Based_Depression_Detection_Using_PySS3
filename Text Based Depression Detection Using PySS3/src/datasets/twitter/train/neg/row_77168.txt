People are fucking jerks, but they're the reason I'm sorta sticking around for bit longer.I hate all of the people I know. Every place I go, everybody sucks. They all treat me like a second class person, a nobody, someone who doesn't deserve the second thought. 

But if I go down, they are all going to be like "He was such a kind person" like bitch shut the fuck up, you don't care about me you little shit. 

That's right, I'm not ending it all cuz I'm a petty little bitch who doesn't want to give the people their satisfaction.
