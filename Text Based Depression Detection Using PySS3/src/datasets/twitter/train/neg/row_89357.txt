I wish that my parents could hate me, so I could die in peaceI'm a 14M, I don't know if my age makes you surprised or not, but whatever. I never had many friends in my life, mainly irl friends, so I never dealt well with people. And this never bothered me until my 11 years.

I always knew how to take care of myself, and I saw things I didn't wanna since when I was younger, so I've been depressed since I know myself, but I never considered suicide, I always had a little hope with me, that I'd have a good future and blah blah blah.

But this year, I lost almost everyone I've ever trusted, and this broke me so hard, because there's months I'm holding almost everything I feel just for me, and I'm afraid of exploding at some point. There's just this girl, I met her last year and we got a genuine relationship after some things that happened for us, and she, and my parents, are the only reason I still alive, all I want now is that they could've hate me, so I can kill myself with no regrets. At least was what I thought until today... This girl is on a mental clinic now, and we barely are able to talk now, but I always tell every to her when I have the chance, and I told about my wish of she hating me... and I don't know, she said some things that changed my mind, even knowing that I won't have a good future, I still wanna be with her.
