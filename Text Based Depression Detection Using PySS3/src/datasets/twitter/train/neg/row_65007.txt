Some advice I was given by a friend

"Well, firstly, personally, I can't say I understand cutting- nor has it ever appealed to me as a thing I want to do. But I understand that people do it, and not because they're "freaks" or "insane."
In my own eyes there are better, safer, funner ways of getting through tough times and I'd love it if you didn't cut to be honest but, as I said- it's not something I'm going to look at you negatively for wanting to do. 

When I look at you now I see someone who's down really deep but I don't really think you have to be that person, even if you've convinced yourself that it's all you have. The side of you that's upbeat, entertaining and plainly just cool doesn't have to be a mask that you put on. 

I hope someday you find a place where you can be that person all the time, because its times like that where you shine the brightest. And sure, there will be low moments- but hopefully you'll always have someone like me, or eventually someone else who can help you through."

A message from a friend I wish I had treated better, "D", after I told him I cut.
