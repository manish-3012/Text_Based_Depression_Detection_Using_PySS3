What do you even DO with life if you have no friends, no people to share it with, no companionship of any sort?No one to talk about common interests and hobbies with (if you still have them and haven't felt it pointless to continue watching a movie/show, reading a book or playing a game, if you have no one to discuss the various mediums with) . Hell, no people that even speak the same language as you.

It's just such a lonely lonely existence. The kind that makes you tired of living it. So tired...

And once your youth and health leave you... what happens then? Truly I'll have nothing left, if I decide to live long enough to lose those last 2 things that I have through the ravages of time.
