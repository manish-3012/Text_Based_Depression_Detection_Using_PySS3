Success Stories?I'm not feeling too good today, these last few weeks haven't been the best and it's all starting to hit at once. I lost my grandma, an uncle, a few girlfriends, a really important scholarship, the emotional intimacy I used to have with my current girlfriend, and I might lose my best friend to surgery complications soon.

I think at this point the only thing keeping me from suicide is practicality. I don't want to shoot myself in the head because I don't want my mom to have to see that. I could shoot myself in the chest and hope that I hit my heart, but my shotgun is too long for me to be able to pull the trigger at that angle. 

But I'm digressing, do y'all have any success stories about what happened when you didn't pull the trigger? I don't know what I'm going to do with my life if I don't kill myself, and some inspiration about what to do would be really nice.
