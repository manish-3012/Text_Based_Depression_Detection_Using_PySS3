everything is bland and im just tired.i wish i could know for sure that it's just peaceful rest on the other side. i just haven't gotten better as much as i wanted to, ever since my teen years, its so hard to feel positive emotions, i have trouble keeping a job down, i constantly question if i should be in a relationship, i hate being alone but i when im with someone im not happy there either and feel trapped now that ive convinced someone to love and be with me. i try to work on becoming a psychologist to have the answers but i procrastinate my assignments, but my gf and i fight, and im just tired. im tired of trying to get it right all the time just to feel like ive made no progress. when i was younger i didn't even have to try life just came my way and i enjoyed it. if the rest of my life is this then hopefully i get cancer
