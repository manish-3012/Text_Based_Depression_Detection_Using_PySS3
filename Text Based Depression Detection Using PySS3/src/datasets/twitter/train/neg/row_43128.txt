its easier for me to deal with a difficult situation by committing suicide than face the painful emotions caused by a sad situation.I don't know what to do. my brain's going into emotional shut down . I'm terrified of being seen as weak for getting upset or showing emotion even if something terrible happens. I think even though i can talk quite openly about my mental health struggles i still feel that underneath that i have a huge fear of showing myself when i'm at my most vulnerable.
