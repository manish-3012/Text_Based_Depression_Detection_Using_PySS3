7 years of no genital sensation/PSSDWhen I was just 17 years old I went on the SSRI Zoloft for severe depression. After a single dose I noticed I had zero genital sensation, no libido and the complete inability to orgasm.Keep in mind I was hyper sexual prior to this and would masturbate an average of three times a day. I cold turkey quit after just four doses of 50mg and that was 7 years ago. My genital sensation never returned, nor did any other aspect of sexuality. I had a hormone panel done, various blood tests, an MRI, etc. you name it. I've been dismissed and invalidated by too many doctors to count at this point, leaving me to suffer in shame and isolation. Finally, I came across a condition called PSSD- or Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction- which has been reported by thousands of others like me. It's only just recently a medically recognized condition but still poorly understood and there is no effective treatment or cure for it.  There's one doctor in California who treats people with this condition but insurance doesn't cover it, it's extremely expensive and the medication has a low success rate (many even worsened from it). On top of being essentially chemically castrated, anhedonia is common in nearly everyone with this condition. It's not just the lack of pleasure from sex, it's the lack of pleasure from ANY activity. I have zero enjoyment from anything in life, and every minute of everyday is painful for me to live.
