I think my ex is stalking me I'm scared and it's making my suicidal ideation really badI'm at work right now it's about the only place I feel sorry of safe. I'm going to make this fast. My ex and I broke stuff off four months ago during the process of the break up he told me that the previous two years he stalked me because we had a falling out and I didn't want anything to do with him. He said he'd been watching my internet activity to see what I was up to. It confirmed my feelings of being watched during that time. I thought I saw him more than once but I shook it off. 

The other day I went out with my new boyfriend, my boyfriend googled the directions to the place we were going and my ex was there when we got there he looked like he rolled out of bed and went there. It could be totally coincidental but with him there really are no coincidences. 

He also kept telling me that if I left him he'd start killing people so I'm scared that he's going to hurt my boyfriend. I don't think he'd hurt me but with the way that things ended I wouldn't put it past him. 

The part of me that needs control is screaming at me to self destruct before he hurts anyone. I know that this is his fault not mine but if he hurt anyone close to me I wouldn't be able to keep living. That and he makes me feel trapped and I don't see another way out. He made it very clear to me that no matter where I go or what I do he'll find me. And I feel like the only way for me to truely be free is to die.
