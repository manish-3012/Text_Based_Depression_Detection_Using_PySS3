Nothing left to lose.I'm soon to be homeless, my entire family moved very far away and I have this theory that once I finally do it, my boyfriend and my only friend will be together and finally move forward in life. I'm the only thing holding them back. I am tired of the same old cycle everyday. I have plenty of plans, it's the timing that I'm not sure of. I just know it's time to say my goodbyes.
