Would you want to live?I was raped. Multiple times. By my own father.

And he wasn't the last.

I want to die. I keep having flashbacks and nightmares of it happening over and over again. Nothing has ever helped or gotten rid of them.

I feel like it just happened.

I'm afraid all the time. I never feel safe.

I want to die. I need this to be over. I'm worthless, and I'm just a burden on anyone who ever made the mistake of caring about me. I'm worthless, disgusting, horrible. I hate myself. It was all my fault.

And I can't live with this. I can't bear it for another moment. Would you want to live, if living meant you had to live through that? Over and over again... I just want it to stop.

Please. If there is any other way other than dying to make it stop, tell me. I'll listen. It isn't that I want to die. It's that I don't want to live with this anymore. I can't.
