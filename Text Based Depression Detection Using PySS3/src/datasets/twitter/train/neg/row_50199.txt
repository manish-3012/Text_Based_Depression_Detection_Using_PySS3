100% succes rate, easy and not painful.It's been already 2 years since my light started to vanish and I fell into an endless darkness, I still try to make plans and live this life, but every hope I have gets destroyed by reality.
I've been thinking on how to end this, cos I can't fight it anymore, I can't find those reasons to get out of the bed that helped me until now. 
I escluded hanging because I don't want to traumatize my family more then I will already do by ending this, and because I don't want to fail, I would loose the little sanity I still have. I can't find the courage to cut myself so deep either. 
That's why I would like to ask you a good way to end my miserable existance. 
My only idea as of now is sleeping pills, as I'm already 19 i think I could get a prescription, so yeah... 
Do you have any ideas?
