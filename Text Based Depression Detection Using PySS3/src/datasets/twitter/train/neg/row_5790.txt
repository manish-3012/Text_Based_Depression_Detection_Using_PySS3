I want to help people.So I want to kill myself and have my organs given to people who need them. Iâ€™m never amounting to anything, I hardly care about my own well being, and even though nothing matters and life is pointless, why not do one good thing. It will save the life of people who want to live. So why not? Why shouldnâ€™t I help them? Why should I stay alive?
