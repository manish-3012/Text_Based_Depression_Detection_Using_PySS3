Sick of it all.How long will it fucking take for me to just stop existing? Everything to do with life makes me feel so sick and so does everyone in it. I wish hoping was enough to take me out. Some people donâ€™t need help, they just need a quick way to die and Iâ€™m one of them, and I hate how people think they know better. They know nothing. Iâ€™m not about to die today, because I donâ€™t have a way, but I hope someday soon Iâ€™ll finally find a way to do what needs to be done. I hate to even post this Iâ€™m just so paranoid.
