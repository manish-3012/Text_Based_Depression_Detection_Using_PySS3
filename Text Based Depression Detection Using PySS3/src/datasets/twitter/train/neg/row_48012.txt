JoylessI think about suicide pretty much all the time. I am on a depression medication at max strength and yet I still feel no joy in most things. I feel like I am just wasting time between work and events. Anything I used to like pretty much doesn't make me feel any joy. I feel like ditto of a person - no personality, no likes, just a fake being trying to be happy when he is never happy. My thoughts have started getting worse - I caught myself rationalizing that I'd only stay alive for my cat. Or that I should not renew my lease with my roommates so I can move out and kill myself without effecting them.

I don't talk about my issues with many people. I've always even been shy online. But here is me putting myself out there to see if anyone else can make sense of me since I can't.

I'm gay and shy with a low sex drive. I always looked forward to being in a gay community and now that I have a few gay friends... I just feel like even more of an outcast than I did before. I have friends who have said they'd want to be there to listen. But the way they act says otherwise. They always make it out to be that I'm not trying hard enough. The gay community used to preach 'it gets better' but it never really has.

I have body issues. I used to be over 300lbs, got down to 170lbs. I decided to go into a health field to help others lose weight. But I always saw myself as being overweight still, even when fitting in 'small' clothing. 

A year ago I contracted mono (in my friggen 30s) and started taking an anxiety med that prevented me from exercising. I started to emotionally eat. Now I'm back at 220lbs and I cannot get myself back down. Its so depressing. I help others lose weight and get judged by them constantly for being bigger than I was. I feel like I am 100x bigger than any other gay friend I have. There is no hope to ever stop being lonely. Everywhere I turn I feel judged.

I don't know what I hope to get out of this. But I figured it's something I hadn't tried.
