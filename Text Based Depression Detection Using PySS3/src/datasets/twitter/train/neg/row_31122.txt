I've been trying and I can't find any reason to keep myself alive.Everyday is a chore. I have counselors and psychiatrists. I've tried multiple meds and currently take some. I've recently moved out on my own, away from my wife. I enjoy being alone, but it makes me realize nothing matters. I feel like the doctors don't listen as i discuss my thoughts on projection as they say things like oh that's very insightful. I realize that. I need direction and understanding, or else I give up, there is no point.
edit: I should I add I drink every night, 10-12 beers as i can't stand the swirling thoughts of my pointless existence as they keep me awake and crying.
