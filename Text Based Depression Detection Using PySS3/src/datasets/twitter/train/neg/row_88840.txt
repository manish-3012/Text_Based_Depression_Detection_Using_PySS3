i'm numbi'm so lost, nothing i do i can complete, and i'm so far behind in all my classes that nothing will ever get done and my teachers have quit trying to help me and all my relationships with friends have stopped and i am so hated by them and no one responds and i'm lonely even though i have siblings

i don't feel anything anymore.

i told my guidance counselor i'm depressed. she told me to watch some shitty calming meditation video instead of helping. then she didn't have any open appointment (online) spots open and any time i tried to email her she didn't answer back.

i'm too poor for a therapist.

i started cutting again last week

first time in six months
