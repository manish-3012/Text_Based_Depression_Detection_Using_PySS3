Life..Iâ€™ve been getting really suicidal lately Iâ€™m with this guy and Iâ€™ve tried to explaining to him but when I get really really bad thoughts I donâ€™t want to talk to anyone and so I started talking to him less and that hurt him witch ofc just made my thoughts worse but then he like...made me feel like a shitty girlfriend for needing time to myself and told me Iâ€™ve been making him depressed because I wonâ€™t talk to him and so I talk to him even when I need my space....Iâ€™m like fine rn but feel like it might happen again where I just donâ€™t feel like talking and heâ€™ll leave...
