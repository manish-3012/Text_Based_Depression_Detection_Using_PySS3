i wanna drink itthereâ€™s a bottle of gin downstairs that got banned because it contains lethal levels of methanol. itâ€™s unopened. if i drink the whole bottle i could die. i wanna drink it but iâ€™m a coward too. i hate myself. i hate everything. iâ€™ve been thinking about it so much. my fear is that i wonâ€™t be able to down it all in time. i donâ€™t know what to do. i donâ€™t know what to do with life. i donâ€™t know how to live like this. itâ€™s all awful and so hard. i feel awful all the time. canâ€™t i just die.
