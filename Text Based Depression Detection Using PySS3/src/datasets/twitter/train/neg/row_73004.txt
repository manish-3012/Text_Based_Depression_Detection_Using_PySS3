Everything is fake.My mother was right. I manipulate her, and everyone else. I exploit people as much as I can. I empathize to a precision to make them like me, and then I just use them. I was so caught up in it that I didn't even realize, until now, that's its all just fake. I never do anything that isn't for my own gain. I'm so selfish and I hate it. I don't want to live like this anymore.
