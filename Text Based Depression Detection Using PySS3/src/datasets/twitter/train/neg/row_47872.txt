I feel worthlessI feel like my anxiety and trust issues are destroying my life. I feel like Iâ€™m annoying and burdensome to all my friends and loved ones. I donâ€™t see that many (if any at all) positive qualities in myself and Iâ€™m constantly stressed. I just want it to be over. I donâ€™t think I matter or have any worth or have a positive impact in the world, so I donâ€™t see the point in staying around.
