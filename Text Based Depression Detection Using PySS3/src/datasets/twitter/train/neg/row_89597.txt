Pretty I will always be angry I wasnâ€™t born pretty. I wish I cudve experienced being beautiful, having confidence, not even knowing to care because I DONT care,,Iâ€™m asked â€œwell what are you gonna do after you get plastic surgery?â€ It doesnâ€™t matter, who cares what I do?! Iâ€™ll be pretty I wonâ€™t care!! I canâ€™t wait to know what itâ€™s like to be pretty to be happy
