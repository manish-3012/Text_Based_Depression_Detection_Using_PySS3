Furniture, clothes, appliances, etc.I am ready to end it, but I have a home full of stuff.

It would be even harder on my parents if they had to pack up all my stuff, and on top where would they put it?

If I donate everything, and chicken out, iâ€™ll be stuck with no furniture and no plates or clothes.
