I canâ€™t do anything because my brothers are depressedI moved across the country and I want to die. Iâ€™m so lonely. I ended a four year relationship and I donâ€™t have many friends here. Iâ€™ve started cutting myself even though I feel like Iâ€™m too old to do that. I think about jumping off the bridge or into traffic almost every day but then Iâ€™ll feel fine the next (bipolar 2) no one checks in on me. my family never asks how I am and friends donâ€™t either, most of my friends from my hometown havenâ€™t bothered even texting me since I moved. My brothers have both struggled with depression in the past, my little brother is having a lot of trouble right now many states away from me. I check in on him and call. I canâ€™t do anything while heâ€™s having so much trouble it would be a bad example to set.  But it hurts that no one checks in on me or takes me being suicidal seriously. Even therapists. I donâ€™t know what to do. I never pictured being this old. I was abused as a kid and feel like I just wasnâ€™t mentally snapped in and present until college and sometimes I snap out again
