I want to and need to do it so bad.Iâ€™m a failure who can get his own life together at 17. My family hates me and Iâ€™m a burden to everyone and hate myself even more than everyone else. I have no friends and no one that cares for me. Iâ€™ve been trying to get the courage to kill myself but I just canâ€™t get myself to do it. I think committing suicide would be the one thing that I could finally do good and succeed at. Why am I so useless that I canâ€™t even kill myself to at least benefit the rest of the people around me for once?
