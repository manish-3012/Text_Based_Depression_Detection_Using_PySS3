I need someone to talk toOver the past couple of months I've been feeling more and more hopeless. My life seems to be going in a downhill spiral. I'm constantly stressed and anxious. I feel so alone and just want someone who I can talk to. I feel like I just want my life to be over. Killing myself would be so much better than having to go on.
