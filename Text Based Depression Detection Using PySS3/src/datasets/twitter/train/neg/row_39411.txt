Is it worth going to the Hospital?Hey. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have posted here before a few weeks ago. I don t feel much better in my current situation. What i am askin here is advice or direct help if possible. Disclaimer: I live in Germany. Over a week ago, i had contact with a person who tested positive. To save others. i ever since then spent my time in my Flat, not going out. Now, since last thursday, i have not eaten and been trying to get myself either food delivers by non profit organisations or through other sources such as "Foodsharing" (food, some don t need and could still be "used" can be shared with others). All those methods did not help and i am struggeling. I do not want to call the emergency hotline because hospital staff are paid low enough already and overworked these days especially where i live.  **I have been asked this before and i wanna say it beforehand. I have no family or friends who i could ask for help.** The family i once had, i am over an done with. So my question, Could any of you help. With advice, or any sort of way. because at this point i am thinking, that in a dew hours or maybe days i will be over and done with.
