Human RightsMy human rights have been, throughout my life, and are, violated on a daily basis and there's nothing I can do about it. 

I'm in love with someone who is in love with me but I stopped connecting with the person months ago out of fear.

I've never been diagnosed with anything but I just know there's something wrong with me.

There's also something wrong with the world, like a cancer that has spread underneath the surface no-one can quite find the source of... or put a finger on. 

I can barely face the day, let alone the night... or help someone- I hear their inaudible cries constantly in my soul. 

Is it selfish? Or is it inevitable
