I wish I could end my life without hurting other peopleI'm in a lot of pain, I have a lot of grief. My life hasn't been easy, and everytime things look up for a while they come crashing down worse than ever before. Each time gets harder and harder to carry on from. The last time I felt like this I was 15,and it only ended because I met my ex. Throughout my entire life I've had down days, and times where I struggle. But I've fallen down a hole I can't get out of without help, I can't rely on my family because they would make me feel so much worse. I don't have any friends to talk to anymore either. I had one I began opening up to about it, but I can't anymore.
I don't want to die but I want to stop causing pain to people, I keep thinking maybe this one big pain of my death is better than causing multiple times of pain to people around me continuously if I carry on living. I don't want to die, I've just had enough. Of both causing and experiencing hurt.
