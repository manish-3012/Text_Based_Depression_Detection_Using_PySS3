Stuck in contemplationI want to die so badly right now. I know I'm going to kill myself sooner or later once things get worse. I have no real terrible reason to commit suicide at this second and that's why I can't do it. I'm tired of waiting for that one event to push me over the edge. Why waste my time waiting?? Hope maybe. I wish I didnt have that. The sliver if dignity I still have left.. I wish that was gone. Self prevention is my enemy.
