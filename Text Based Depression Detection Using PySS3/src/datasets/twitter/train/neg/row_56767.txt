people are constantly using stuff against me.there was this girl who I was best friends with, she and her friends, who I became friends with as well, but were closer to her, would use casual racist, and homophobia insults. for the longest time I brushed it off, when I did talk to her about it, she didn't respond it would act like everything is normal, and of course me not wanting any beef, I didn't say anything, but I told her how I felt, and from there she told me "this time go take enough pills" and also since then every few months, she has had her friends tell me to kill myself, and say racist things towards me. they have insulted me in ways I've never been insulted before. there is another girl who knew all about that who was also ex friends with her, may I add I was never friends with her because she fell out with the girl I did, but we both have that in common, got super close and she knew all about the situation. but we got into an argument today, over stupid shit, and she said "I see why *** did what she did". I feel like every time somebody uses that against me, I go back into a depressive suicide state, and of course she'll still keep her remaining friends that she has, and so will the other girl that told me to kill myself, and I just feel so alone. that whole situation affected me so bad, and for her to use it against me. that situation made me question myself, that situation made me hate my skin, that situation made me depressed, the situation made me suicidal, that situation made me feel disgusted, and i would NEVER wish this on my worst enemy. im totally lost on how she could even say that to me. i dont know what to do.
