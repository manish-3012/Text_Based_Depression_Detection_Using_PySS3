Iâ€™m so close and Iâ€™m scaredIâ€™ve been suffering from depression since my early teens. Itâ€™s spiraled into an unbearable mess. Now that Iâ€™m in university, I have made no friends or connections because of this mental illness. Most of the people I was friends with before have forgotten about me, and I live alone. No one has a clue about what Iâ€™m going through. I just want to be gone already. Iâ€™m so upset that I failed at this life so bad that this has to end up as the conclusion. This is my last cry for help, I guess. Iâ€™m sorry to everybody Iâ€™m gonna let down.
