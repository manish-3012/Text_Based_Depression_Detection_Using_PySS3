The most terrible time, of the year.Wife and I have been having a lot of trouble lately. Lots of fighting, arguing, screaming. Shes recently resorted to calling me names, belittling me, condescending attitudes more often than not, overall distant and detached. 

The basis? Shes claimed I haven't cared for her and appreciate everything shes done over the past 7 years of our marriage. We had a terrible time in our 2nd year of marriage. I was unfaithful. Admittingly. In retaliation after I smacked myself around a bit and cleaned up my act, she cheated on me too. That was 5 years ago. We've been to individual counseling but have both put off marriage counseling. Recently, I've swallowed my pride and suggested marriage counseling, that we definitely need it. Now she doesnt want to go, claims I'll "Play the victim, tell sob stories." I dont think she understands counseling would have to listen to both sides and be completely objective.

Fast forward to today. Mid fight, told her we needed a break from arguing, that I would leave, give her space and come back. She yells at me for wanting to leave. Later, she tells me to leave! Kicks me out the house! Tells me she wants a divorce! Locks herself in the bathroom, comes out, gets on her video game and goes straight to talking to the same guy shes been for weeks now. Sitting in the other room now contemplating ending it... I dont own a gun, hanging is not the way I'd like to be found, and pills well, I just want it to be painless and quick. 

I seriously am a jumbled mess, dont even think my post made much sense. I want to drive, far, fast, and see what happens. 

Idk. Help? Anyone?
