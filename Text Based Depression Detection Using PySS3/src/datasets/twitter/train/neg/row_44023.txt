Does alcohol help anyone else?I dont know why i feel like booze helps me but it I feel like it just amplified my desire to kill myself but Iâ€™m more at peace with the idea of dying once Iâ€™m drunk. I feel like Iâ€™m ready to go and the alcohol definitely helps with it. Does anyone else feel like this?
