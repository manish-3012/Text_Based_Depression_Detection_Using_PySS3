How do I write a good suicide note?Iâ€™m done with everything I made a fatal mistake and permanently vision impaired myself and ruined my life. I now feel awful like I never did before the accident. The only way I can think to describe it is I feel like Iâ€™m in a dark deep pit that keeps getting deeper That I canâ€™t leave no matter how hard I try. I donâ€™t wanna feel like this so Iâ€™m taking the only way I see out so Iâ€™ll no longer be a burde to my family for the rest of my days, so I can finally end what I feel and leave the pit. I love my parents so much though that Iâ€™m gonna endure the terrible things Iâ€™m feeling a little longer to at least leave a note before I do it. Iâ€™ve got no clue how to go about it though. What should I Putin a suicide note other than I love them? It has to be short I canâ€™t stand this long enough to write a long one plus my vision make it hardr. How can I make sure they see it? Or woud it be better just to not write one?
