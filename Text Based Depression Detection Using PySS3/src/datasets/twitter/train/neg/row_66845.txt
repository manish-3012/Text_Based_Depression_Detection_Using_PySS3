I tried, I really didI really did try my hardest. I tried to make friends, tried to form relationships, and tried to be more open. Iâ€™m a 19 year old in college but all I do is lay in my bed and cry whenever Iâ€™m not doing school work. My birthday is this December but I donâ€™t plan on being alive to see it.
