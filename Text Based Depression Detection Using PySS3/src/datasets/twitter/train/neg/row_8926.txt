WhyWhy do people keep going...it feels like when I am excited or powering through I am just lying to myself.  I dont want to kill myself always.  But the feeling has been getting stronger and stronger my whole life.  Suicide seemed kind of outrageous when I was younger and with each year, each month, it seems more and more like the way.  

I am very lonely.  I am disgusted by the people around me but I also have a lot of love for them.  I want to love myself and I have tried.   

To no success.   I feel ugly and desperate.  I burst into tears a lot and everything seems purposeless. My therapist is no help.  

Im so fucking alone.  And I could reach out to people if I want to. I know how to be charming.  I am good looking and go to a good school.  I have lots of good things and so on.  

But I fucking hate people.  And I fucking hate myself.  As much as I know this is a toxic and degenerative mindset, I cannot shed it. 

I don't want to be around people.  There is nothing I want to work for.  Everyone I am close to exasperates and exhausts me. 

I assume no one will read this.  Whatever.  I am inching closer to the edge.  I'm trying to move the opposite way, into life, but...

It isn't fucking working.
