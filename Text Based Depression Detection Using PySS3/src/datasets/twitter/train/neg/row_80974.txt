fucking worthlesshate myself so much. I just make life harder for the ones I love. can't stop crying and panicking and feeling like a total piece of shit. I just want to disappear and let everyone get on without me. fucking waste of space and time. can't stop having thoughts about hanging myself. my girlfriend is out tonight with her other boyfriend, which is normally fine, but she left the house accusing me of picking a fight, and I don't even know I'm doing this shit. feel so fucking stupid and hopeless and selfish and alone.
