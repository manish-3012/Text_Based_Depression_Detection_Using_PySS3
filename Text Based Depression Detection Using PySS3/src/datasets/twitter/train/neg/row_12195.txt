Iâ€™m tired of this shit.Iâ€™m only 15 and I donâ€™t care about my future anymore. Iâ€™m doing bad in school because Iâ€™ve been so slow lately. I just want to run away from home and die, I always expected Iâ€™d be dead by then so why not get it over with sooner. A few weeks ago a girl I liked moved away and just the thought of never seeing her again is too much for me. A few days ago another girl Iâ€™m friends with but I also liked broke up with her boyfriend, I wanted to do something but If I tried to get with her or at least wait till sheâ€™s interested in me I would have felt guilty for using someones sadness to get them to like me. Iâ€™m always gonna be the lonely quiet kid no one wants to talk to. Iâ€™m always helping my friends with relationship advice, yet I canâ€™t seem to be in one. A year ago I did something I feel very guilty for and I wish I could just go back in time to fix it. I started texting a girl I used to like, then I found out she liked me. I was hesitant, but I told her I felt the same way. She started talking about long distance relationships and I realized I shouldnâ€™t have told her how I felt... So, I erased her from my memory and forgot about her. Till this day I want to fix it, but there is no fixing the past, there is only living with it. There can be few less scumbags like me in the world. Iâ€™d be better off dead than ruin peoples lives.
