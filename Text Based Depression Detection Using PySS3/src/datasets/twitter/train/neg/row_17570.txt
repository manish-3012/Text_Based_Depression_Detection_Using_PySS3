Still want to be deadIâ€™ve really lost all my motivation these past two weeks. Iâ€™m having a hard time forgiving myself for something I did. I regret it every day and wonder what would happen if I hadnâ€™t done what I did. Now Iâ€™m all alone because of it. I ruined the one good thing in my life and Iâ€™m so fucking sad because of it. A month ago I had everything that I ever wanted and now itâ€™s all gone. I feel hopeless, ashamed, and embarrassed. I still just canâ€™t believe I ruined something so good. Iâ€™m blaming myself every day because it was all my fucking fault. People tell me I should be easier on myself and forgive myself, but itâ€™s just so hard. I donâ€™t want to kill myself because of my family, but I just donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. I donâ€™t have any friends and I donâ€™t want to do anything. I wake up not knowing what to do with my day and I just lay here. Iâ€™m tired of it.
