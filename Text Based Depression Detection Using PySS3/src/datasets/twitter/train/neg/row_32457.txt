I tell myself Iâ€™m fine, but I just wrote a suicide noteIâ€™ve gotten help in the past and I want to say I donâ€™t need it anymore, but the depression is back in full swing and I just donâ€™t know if I can take it anymore. I wrote the note as an attempt at catharsis, but I think it was more real than Iâ€™d like to admit.
