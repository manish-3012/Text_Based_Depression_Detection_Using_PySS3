My sister tried to hurt/kill herselfI picked up my sister to take her to work, half way there she shut down and said she didnâ€™t want to go to work she wanted me to take her to work. Since I work in the same city as her (1/2-45min away) I told her that I still need to work and she could stay at my office until I finished. For 1/2 she was ok then she texted me constantly to take her home. When I asked her to tell me whatâ€™s wrong, she wouldnâ€™t. 5min later she walked out of my office to the common area where the washrooms are. I followed her to see if she was ok. She kept yelling at me to leave her alone but to take her. An argument ensued about how I needed to work and i left back to the office. I called my dad to tell him to pick her up or to call her to calm her down. I went back to find her and when I walked into the washroom she had locked herself in a stall, and she had knotted her sweater to the top rail of the stall. I tried to open the door but she was crying and wouldnâ€™t. I looked over the door and she had a black plastic knife and the sweater around her neck. I tried to get the thing from her neck and I climbed over the stall her neck was red and her face was red she had marks on her arms and chest. She blames me that I didnâ€™t take her home. I took her to the hospital and they released her told her to take counciling ... I was so afraid I didnâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m so exhausted. I realize why they say suicide/ suicide attempts are selfish but I never thought Iâ€™d have to go through this. I canâ€™t have her in my life anymore. Iâ€™m so emotionally drained I canâ€™t deal with it
