Is happiness the true illusion?For a number of years now, I have been keeping myself alive because I do not want to cause any pain to those that I love if I did disappear.

I often feel no joy. No desire. I prefer to spend my time napping if I can get away with it. 

I was promised when I was a loser kid that when I grew up that all of the bullies' lives would turn upside down and I would be "successful".

Well, thanks to social media I can see those lives that were predicted to fall apart. obviously, they haven't. Actually, they have steady jobs and a steady social life. Although, this doesn't apply to absolutely everyone.

It was a generational issue---these elders at the time meant well----maybe it was the case for them. I don't know. 

but, those bullies and pretty people and social butterflies all succeeded. I'm shy, anxious, terrified of making mistakes in a work environment. I've lived under a few large rocks. I find most people boring and genetic.

I do have a few friends and a great relationship. But I'm just literally not enjoying it. What do people do with their time???

I may as well be a machine.
