I can't handle it anymoreI feel so empty and lonely. All my friends have either moved away or are too busy. I haven't really talked to anyone in months. I've tried to make new friends but my attempts never work or I end up getting hurt.

I always end up in this place. My life improves but then suddenly I have a major breakdown and have to start from the very begining. I always end up feeling alone and abandoned. I don't want to go through this anymore. Even after I started to reach out and get profesional help I'm back in this place.

I've recently taken to SH. I first started slamming my head against the wall whenever I felt overwhelmed a few months ago. Recently I started cutting and its the only thing I want to do and the only thing on my mind until I'm ready to take my life. It makes me feel so disgusted and ashamed with myself but I don't have the motivation for anything else anymore.

I know I deserve to feel the way I do. I have no reedeming qualities. I'm not even sure why I think I deserve to have any friends. I have no self-esteem. No one should ever want to talk to someone who has the ugly psychotic sobbing episodes like I do. I already said goodbye. I don't want to face the humiliation of not actually going through with it.

I don't think I want to talk. I might not even look at this account ever again since I'll just feel embarrased.
