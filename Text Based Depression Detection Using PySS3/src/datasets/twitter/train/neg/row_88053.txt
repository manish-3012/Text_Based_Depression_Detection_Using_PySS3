How honest are you with your therapist?Iâ€™ve been to therapy/counseling many times... but I have never been fully honest about my thoughts on suicide. I never tell them I think about dying every day multiple times a day. I never tell them I have a plan. I usually donâ€™t even admit to my past (and relapses) of self harm. 
I hate that I donâ€™t tell them the truth because I feel that prevents me from getting the best care...
But Iâ€™m too afraid to risk telling them the truth and losing my privacy... they always say they have to keep your medical information private unless there is risk you will harm yourselves and others. 
The thought of police showing up at my door... of being admitted and losing my career... of somehow my parents being notified (I havenâ€™t spoken to them in months)
Itâ€™s terrifying. Way scarier than the thought of dying. 

What do you guys tell your providers about your suicidal thoughts? And how have they handled that information when you do?
