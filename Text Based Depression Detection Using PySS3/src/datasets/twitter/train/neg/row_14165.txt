I Thought I DiedAll night Iâ€™ve been tossing and turning with a pounding heart from anxiety and alcohol. It went on the entire night. I woke up and my heart was completely silent and I heard the sound of a gong in the distance. I thought I had died and I was actually happy. Then I realized I was just be coming out of a dream and I am still very much alive. Damn.
