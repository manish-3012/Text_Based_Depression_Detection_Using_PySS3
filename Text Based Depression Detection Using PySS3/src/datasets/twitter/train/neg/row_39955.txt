2 months left, what should I do?
Im pretty confident with my plan, the only thing I need is to wait a bit longer.there is still snow outside and I can't get to the train tracks bc of that.

so, what should I do in the meantime? I thought about planting flowers and hanging out with friends. also will try to make a comics. 

btw don't suggest getting help, i already go to the therapist and take AD, I just can't handle my life anymore. school has been very hard for me, I constantly feel tired, my marks got worse, I lost all motivation to keep going. there are more reason but I don't feel like sharing.

who knows, maybe in a couple of months I will feel better?  thanks in advance!! ðŸ’–
