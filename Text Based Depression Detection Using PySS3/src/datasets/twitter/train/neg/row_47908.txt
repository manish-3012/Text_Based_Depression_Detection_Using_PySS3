I'm doing itThere's a building in my campus that's nine stories high. I read somewhere that if you jump from six stories you have a 90% probability of dying, and the number goes up with any extra stories. 

Anyway, I'm not looking to be convinced of not doing it or anything. I guess I just wanted someone to know. Thanks for listening, reddit.
