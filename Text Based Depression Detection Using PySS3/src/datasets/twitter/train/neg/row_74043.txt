I lost everyone in my lifeI lost all of my friends in a fight recently. They called me selfish and reckless and said that they were done with me. My mom is now depressed because of my struggles with anxiety, depression and bipolar. In turn my dad hates me for making my mom feel that way and so does my sister. I feel lost and alone and like no one understands me. I tried going to therapy but I couldnâ€™t bring myself to actually talk to him about how I feel because it hurts so much I canâ€™t even think about it anymore. I hate myself, I make mistakes and make it everyoneâ€™s life progressively worse. I canâ€™t anymore. Iâ€™m on the edge, I just canâ€™t do this. I would have done it already if I wasnâ€™t so afraid of botching it and ending up seriously hurt or in a mental hospital. Both would just make this living hell even more unbearable. Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but there lives would be better for it. They wouldnâ€™t have to try and care for me anymore. I donâ€™t belong here, I donâ€™t have anything and nothing is better than this. It has to be better. I donâ€™t have anything to look forward to other than more mistakes and ruin.
