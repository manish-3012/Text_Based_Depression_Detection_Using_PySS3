My best friend just committed suicideLong story short, at around 1am last night I got a phone call from one of my friends that another of our friends had just hung himself. We're all 18 years old and never thought he would do this.

Now, the evening after, I feel very strange. I didn't sleep at all last night and just was on the phone with friends until it was time to wake up. However, although quite tired, I feel quite calm. I assumed if something like this ever happened I'd be a complete mess but I feel quite relaxed. 

Can anyone explain this to me because it feels very ominous? 

Also, in the unfortunate chance that someone's experienced a similar thing, could you give any advice on how a close group of young lads could deal with it? 

Thanks everyone.
