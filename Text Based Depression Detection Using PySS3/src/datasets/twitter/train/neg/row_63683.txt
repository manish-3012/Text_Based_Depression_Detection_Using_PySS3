Do you really believe everyone is able to live happily?Hi guyz, I came really not for help, but to ask a simple question. I wonder how sincere you are when you try to prevent suicide? Do you really believe, sincerely, that the person you try to convince not to commit suicide will be happy? Do you seriosly think that every humanbeing in this world has chance to live a happy life? Look, I donâ€™t want to be sound cruel, sound provacative, so I will not the adress issues directly. Letâ€™s assume a person has a disorder that costs him many things, such as lack of social relations, physical capability etc. Câ€™mon guyz, what would you do if he/she were you? I believe that this world is unjust as fuck, and indeed it is a fact. How can you ignore this?  How can you constantly try to make people abandon suicidal thoughts, even though you donâ€™t know if his suffer is temporary, fixeable? 

Let me end my words with these: If I were god(if it exists), I would really make the whole people happy, I swear, I would not let any of them suffer. I wish I was the god :(
