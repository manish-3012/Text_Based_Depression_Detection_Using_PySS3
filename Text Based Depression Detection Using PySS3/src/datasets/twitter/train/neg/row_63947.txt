Iâ€™m tired..Everything has gone back to the way it was before. Iâ€™m so fucking exhausted from trying to be okay. Iâ€™ve tried so many times to kill myself I donâ€™t even remember the number. All I am is a burden to everyone; Iâ€™ve gotten help, been on medication and have even gone away to rehab but nothing works. And Iâ€™m trying so hard. I want to be better; I want to live a normal happy life with the people I care about but nothing is sticking. Now Iâ€™m all out of energy to keep trying and am making everyone around me miserable and scared. I donâ€™t want to burden anyone like this again. I saw what it did to my immediate family and it destroyed them. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m just trying to stay out of everyone elseâ€™s way and hopefully people will forget about me or stop caring. That way I wonâ€™t make the few people that care about me upset. Iâ€™m losing this battle and Iâ€™ve run out of weapons to defend myself. Iâ€™m giving up... Iâ€™m just so tired.
