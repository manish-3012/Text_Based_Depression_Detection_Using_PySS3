Suicide is the only optionIve been depressed for 7 years. Im 20 years old now. I also have severe anxiety. My health has gone to shit so quicly and I know nothing about myself. My parents never took me to a dentist or a doctor and just never did anything for me besides feed me unhealthy food day in and day out. Im in pain daily from my teeth, my gums, my untreated heartburn and random pains in my stomach. I have no job due to my depression and noone ever giving me a helping hand that I severely needed. I dropped out of school when I was a sophomore and hid in my room because of being neglected and just didnt give a shit about anything anymore. That was 4 years ago now. I tried to seek help a long time ago for my depression but no one in my family took me serious nor tried to talk me through it. I now think the end of my life is coming faster and faster because I cant bare the pain mentally and physically. I just want to be at peace for once. I dont know why im writing on here because I dont think words can help me at this point, but I just needed to get it all out one more time. Thanks for reading. Hopefully the otherside is as peaceful as everyone thinks.
