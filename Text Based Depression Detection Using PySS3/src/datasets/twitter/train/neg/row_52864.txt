I need friends...My boyfriend recently broke up with me, and he was my only friend.... and I can't stay/be friends with him... cuz it hurts.

so I'm looking for some friends... I'm 18 (just turned 18, November 25th) and everyone is welcome to be my friend! I would love to have friends! it's all about honesty and the memories we make/are gonna make. so yeah!
