My depressive moods are getting longer and longerI've never been actually diagnosed with a mental disorder, but I know im being plagued with horrible and agonizing thoughts. I want it to stop but I have no other options. My family will never allow me to seek help and I rely on them for everything. I feel like such a burden to them and I think it would be better if I was gone. I told my mom I was suicidal two years ago and she said that if I killed myself she would  as well and then torment me for all eternally. Im so scared and feel so trapped.
