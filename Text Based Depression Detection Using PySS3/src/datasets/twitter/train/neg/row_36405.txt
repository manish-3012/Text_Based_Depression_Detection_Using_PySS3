I am readyOver the past few months I had renewed my hope and even prayed for answers, but today I have found that those positive thoughts have disappeared. 

Since 2013 not much has gone my way and many told me to return to school and get a master's degree to forward my career, so I did. I finished in the top 2% of the class and it is the only time in the past five years when I felt like I was on the right track. However, a year after I walked off of that stage it is clear that all that lay ahead was failure. After applying for hundreds of jobs, interviewing for jobs, hiring recruiters, and career coaches I find myself broke and on the brink of homelessness. I have even tried to get work in places like the oil fields, overnight FedEx facilities and restaurants to no avail. I am broken and at a loss for plausible solutions. Perhaps life is just not for us all.

I am thinking of putting on my best suit and hopping on a plane to see my grandmother. She passed away years ago, but sitting next to her gravestone to remember the good times while I drink and add in some poisonous additives along with some sleeping pills so I can enter the long goodnight is what keeps entering my mind today.  I am ready for it. Those that say that people who kill themselves don't want to stop living, but rather, they want to stop the pain are absolutely correct. My life is the issue and if I had one wish I would walk into a Children's Hospital and give the life that I have left to someone who could make better use of it.

Thanks for reading. I just felt like I had to get that off of my chest.
