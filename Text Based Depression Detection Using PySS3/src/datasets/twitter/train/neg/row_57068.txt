Feeling offI have suicidal thoughts for a long time. I'm to scared to try anything really but i find relief thinking about being dead. It feels like life is a burden nothing actually fun its all just a job. Its like i cant take in life anymore. My boyfriend hugs me or says he loves me and it takes a moment to feel anything sometimes it doesn't happen. Its to the point where he thinks acting like this is normal he doesnt really help much 
either i dont think he knows how to. Im probably expecting him to treat me like id treat myself but i dunno. I try to tell him what to do but i still feel dead inside 
Any help?
