Iâ€™m gonna test somethingIâ€™ll keep doing non negative stuff through the day and Iâ€™ll see how I feel at the end of the day. Non negative stuff is everything that doesnâ€™t carry negative emotions (playing cute videogames like Animal Crossing, listening to happy songs, etc...). Iâ€™ve been having really bad days lately and I think if I do this at least one of my days will be better. If I feel better afterwards it probably means Iâ€™m faking all of this, but whatever.

Iâ€™m gonna log out of this throwaway and then at the end of the day (itâ€™s 10:26 where I live, Iâ€™ll be back in like 11-12 hours) Iâ€™ll tell yâ€™all how it went
