The only thing that stops meI can't believe I'm even writing this, but it's even harder for me to vocalize it. I've thought about suicide for years now. I'm almost 25 and I remember the first time thinking about suicide when I was 12. Back then the only thing that stopped me from even entertaining the thought was my belief in god at the time. I was raised to believe that people who commit suicide are selfish and will go straight to hell. Well, I quit believing in god when I was 19 but my thoughts on suicide were still the same. The only thing that stops me is the fact that once I die, my pain will just transfer to everybody around me. The pain never goes away. I won't feel it anymore, but everybody else will 10x as bad as me. It's not just the costs of a funeral; my life insurance wouldn't cover my funeral expenses if it's suicide, which is horrible for the families of the victim (I'd rather be cremated after my organs are harvested for donations and science.) But not only that, my brothers, my nieces and nephews, and the couple friends I have would be traumatized. I feel like nobody cares about me and I can't talk to any of them about it because either they'll push me away by thinking I'm crazy, that I need god, that I'm selfish, that I'm just seeking attention, etc. Honestly, I can't handle being around others who are depressed also, but I can't handle myself the worst. I thought about doing it on my 25th birthday, which is in about 3 weeks. I'm scared of pain. I can't afford to go to a psychologist. Antidepressants don't work; I've tried them. I'm only depressed about half the time. 

I really hate myself.
