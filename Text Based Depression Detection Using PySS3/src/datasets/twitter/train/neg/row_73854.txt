I attempted suicide last week and was in the hospital for a weekI'm fine , physically. But they're making me see a therapist and they assigned me a case worker.  If I refused what they offer, they're gonna take me away , against my will, for 6 months, and still will make me pay for it. I'm gonna take the meds and see a therapist. 

Who knows,  maybe it'll work out for me
