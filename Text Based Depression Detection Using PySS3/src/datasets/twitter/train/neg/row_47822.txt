My job makes me want to kill myself, is it justifiable to quit without notice?I donâ€™t really want to explain why cuz I just got done explaining it to my mom and Iâ€™m done b/c she just wants me to stick it out. But all you need to know is that I work as a CNA right now and have been since April. Itâ€™s also my first job. And the emotional aspect of the work is just overwhelming especially with other recent shit going on in my life. A few of my other coworkers want to quit too. 

This job just has me feeling drained at the end of the day, everyday lately. When I have days off all I feel is dread the next time I work, itâ€™s all I can think about. I drive home hoping some one will crash into me and my piece of shit car and take me out. I think about chugging my antidepressants every time I go to bed. I pray not to wake up, but I do. 

Ive been told Iâ€™m â€œone of the good onesâ€ by several rnâ€™s and a couple cnas, but Iâ€™m also tired of all the responsibility I just want to feel free again, ya know? 

So Iâ€™m going to quit without a 2week notice on Wednesday by a resignation email to the HR lady after I go pick up all the gift cards Iâ€™m owed for picking up extra shifts. 

Is this the right move? Or am I being selfish?
