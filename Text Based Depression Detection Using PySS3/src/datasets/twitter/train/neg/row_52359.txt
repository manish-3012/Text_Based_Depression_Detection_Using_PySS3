I'm doing okay right now but I can feel my dad's lecture from earlier bringing be back downI just started college, and I have no friends. All my roommates are either loud and annoying or gone 90% of the time. My boyfriend lives about an hour away from me and cant talk to me too much since he is best friends with his roommates and is usually hanging out with them. I'm failing two classes already. I get paid minimum wage with less than 20 hours each week. But I was happy anyways. I've been doing okay. But I visited my parents today and my dad guilted me for not going to church, for not being friends with my roommates, for not putting myself out there. And I feel the depression creeping back. I'm sitting in my room getting fat, with no one to talk to and no friends. I dont want to spiral again, but I dont know how to stop it.
