I feel like life just isnâ€™t for me.I used to have such hope inside me. That life will get better, or if I get this job Iâ€™ll feel better, or if I get a wife Iâ€™d be better. But it turns out, it never really does get better . Thereâ€™s just something inside me that doesnâ€™t enjoy living, but is also too much of a wuss to just pull the trigger. I had dreams, and I would work so hard for them and Have always come short. When Iâ€™ve had jobs,Iâ€™ve been such a loner I canâ€™t really communicate well with others at the job. Iâ€™ll do my job well, but for some reason I feel terrible because I canâ€™t joke and gossip like the rest.Even when I see my check I donâ€™t really feel that good(itâ€™s a 1000 a week). I buy people things, I still donâ€™t feel happy. I buy myself things, I still don't feel happy. I just donâ€™t get it, I just feel like Iâ€™m not meant for this world. And if I killed myself, hopefully Iâ€™d come back as someone who was better fit to live in this kind of society.
