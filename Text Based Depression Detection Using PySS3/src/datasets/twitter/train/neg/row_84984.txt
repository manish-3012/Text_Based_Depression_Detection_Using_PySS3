I hate myself for everythingA little intro about me. I am a 19 year old dude in a top 20 university. My grades are somewhat above average at the moment. I can play the guitar/sing and people tell me I'm good at it. I am physically fit and some people go as much as call me jacked. Some girls call me pretty good looking and even charming, and all of the guys in my dorm respect me.

But I wasn't always this way. I used to be fat, ugly, stupid and talentless. People didn't hesitate to call me out on being such a worthless person. Now, I still feel as if I am useless. And I hate myself for it.

I hate myself for not being perfect. I hate myself for being a worthless human being before. I hate myself for being a pretty good guy but never having a single girlfriend in my life. I hate myself for respecting girls too much to just sleep around. I hate myself for being unconfident and thus not having a chance to find someone to be with. I hate myself for being depressed and having bipolar II because that means I won't be able to love another person properly. I hate myself for hating myself enough that my productivity suffers.

I hate my past, present and future. I hate myself and I want to die now.
