Dont have uni for the next two days.I am in a safe place. But i dont feel safe. Im alone and i cant concentrate on studying. All i can think about is my ex, my attempt the other night and that i am a bad person. I want to hang myself. I hate being alone with my own thoughts. Trying to stay occupied is hard. I just keep thinking bad thoughts.
