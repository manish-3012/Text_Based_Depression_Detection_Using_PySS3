whyI don't know why I'm here. I have giant ass  nose and a receding giant ass forehead, pimples all over and no matter how much I work out I look the damn same. I was homeschooled so I was very sheltered until I was fucked with highschool all of a sudden. This one asshole always singled me out. I was called gay a lot because no one would fuck me cause u know, ugly and what not. Sophmore I actually make a good group of friends and get my first kiss, and then I have to fucking move out of state. None of them remember me. None of the ppl at my new school like me. They have their fucking friend groups and I get shut down when ask if I can sit somewhere. Finnally I met some new friends and guess what, they thought I was gay. One of the guy's asked me out, even though he knew I was straight. Part of me felt a little better thinking that at least he liked me but I cried that night knowing I lost my chance ever having a girlfriend when I moved from that fucking state. I feel souless. I lie a lot. emotions feel fake to me. whenever I laugh or act sad its out of peer pressure. Theres no end. Every time I find something nice, the universe is like "Sike! Those friends are homicdal maniacs, and that girl you had a crush on just lead you on for money until she found another douche.

I'm a senior in highschool now. And I thought I just grown past it. I almost killed myself a couple months ago. Unfortunately my mom stopped me. 

DO NOT tell me that naive bs about every life is worth something cuz I have absolutely no fucking dreams or goals.
