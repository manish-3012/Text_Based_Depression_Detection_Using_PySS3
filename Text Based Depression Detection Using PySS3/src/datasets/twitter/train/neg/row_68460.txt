well this is itim sorry. i cant keep going. everyone says to live for the future,  even ive said it. but the future isnt real. the past and the present are, and theyre fucking shit. i would have saved everyone so much trouble if i had done it right the first time. but im too much of a coward to kill myself right.  the love of my life, the only person i will ever, ever love left me more than a year ago. shes clearly moved on (not hard to date better people than me im shit) but i havent. and i never will, whether i live or die, i never will. she was it for me. i dont know how or when exactly, but im finally going to make the best decision of my life and kill myself. god just let it be fast, im too tired of the pain of living, so at least let death be quick and painless. because god, youve abandoned me even when i beg for mercy. so at the very least you owe me a quick death. im sorry, but i cant do it anymore.
