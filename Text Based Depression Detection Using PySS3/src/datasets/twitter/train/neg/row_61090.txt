I'm close to suicide.Hey.
Im young, in high school (UK) and Im just fed up, everyday is a drag and its making me miserable. I've been feeling like shit ever since my dad was killed in a car accident in 2013. Since then my granddad has died and my pet has died.
I sometimes look around and It's like I feel my brain as if it's a machine, a cog turning and I think "What's the point?". I despise school and I'm bullied everyday I go (My attendance is piss-poor at 74% too)
I used to be in all the top classes but since my dad died, its dropped from there, now I'm bottom set, and used to have aspirations, now I have none and I dont have any purpose to live.
What should I do? I want to just die and get it over with, but I dont want to miss the very, very few things I have left (Football, Video Games)
HOWEVER, My Mother has been supportive, up until September 2015, whenever I would not feel up to going to school, or just felt miserable, she'd take away my PC, and my video games, leaving me with nothing. Even more miserable and despising life, giving these suicidal thoughts another run through as there is nothing to occupy them instead (Games etc)
I just want to end it all, but I don't know how I'd do it, or when, or if I should try stick it out (The thought of it makes me depressed further)
Later this year I'm also due an autism spectrum test and I've been having councilling at school but it's useless since whenever I go to try speak to her, she's occupied with someone and 5 others are waiting, and School arent keen on helping us, they only seem to care about how many drones are getting A's and how to stress us out.
Thanks. If you need more info, please ask.
