Here to ventSo Iâ€™m 22 with Sickle Cell Disease, anxiety, and depression. Life was amazing until about 17. Now i havenâ€™t been happy ever since and nothing else will. Iâ€™m in pain everyday and have mental breakdowns everyday. I donâ€™t like to talk about my problems to anyone in person bcuz i feel like a burden. Always have been always will be a burden to everyone. Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts since 17 but this year itâ€™s been heavy. Idk what to do anymore. Yes Iâ€™ve taken meds and seen a therapist for it. Not my thing, i donâ€™t like it. Canâ€™t talk to my family bcuz they tell everyone else. Canâ€™t talk to my friends because they tell my family. Yes i know they tryna look out for me but it makes things worse. I only feel some relief when Iâ€™m with my friends but i canâ€™t do that every second of the day. Im giving up more and more each day. One of them will be my final. Feels okay to get this off my chest. I think the only reason i havenâ€™t done it yet is bcuz i donâ€™t want to fail
