Can't believe I'm here againI was well for a good while. A little over a year. Now, I'm back where I started, just wishing I were dead, having thoughts of slitting my throat or hanging myself but knowing I don't have the ability to do either properly. It is all the more painful having known what it felt like to be well. Trying to work has been like swimming through thick mud. I don't want to eat, and when I do, it makes me feel sick. Feeding and walking my dog feels like a monumental task. I don't want to shower. I don't want to get out of bed in the morning. I don't know for sure, but I suspect I have ADHD. I work in an office job, and it has been a mighty struggle, even in good times, to stay on task.  An actual 8-hour day of work generally takes me 11 hours to achieve. Obviously, I'm not supposed to work that way, but I can't help it. I feel chained to my desk. I feel overwhelmed. I know I am lucky to be employed, but it feels tenuous and like I'm fooling everyone. How much longer can I really expect to pull this off?
