i think iâ€™ve finally tied loose endsso, this sounds stupid, but i think i was waiting until iâ€™ve finally finished my novel. itâ€™s done. and as a person iâ€™m just so tired, so angry for no reason. it hurts me every day to keep going. 
i used to be unsure or stressed or whatever but now iâ€™m finally just relieved â€” i still feel crap but iâ€™m more confident, and i have half of a plan together
i honestly canâ€™t just see a future and i think this is best for everyone around me â€” i told my parents and they actually said it was selfish to tell them i was feeling like this and that i should just do it so they donâ€™t have to live with the uncertainty. that definitely helped.
