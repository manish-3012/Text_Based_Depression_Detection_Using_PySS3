WhyMy Life has Always been Hard ,and i;ve always been alone waling in the rain..trying to find my way but lately i can will the urge to end my life growing trying to convince my mind its the right choice feeling my head with questions like Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die.......i just i don't know why but it feels like I've jump off the moon in i'm slowly moving closer to burn up in the atmosphere....
