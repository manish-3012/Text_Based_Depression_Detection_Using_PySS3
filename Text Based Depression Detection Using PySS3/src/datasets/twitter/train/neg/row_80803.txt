Help me! My girlfriend will attempt (for the second time) to suicide in the next days.First of all, a bit of context. I started dating my girlfriend 7 months ago. I love her very much and she loves me, aswell. We both live in western Europe and we are both 22 year old, studying Psychology in the same university. We still live with both our mothers, but she has been home alone for almost 10 days now and she is staying home alone for about 4-6 more days, because her mother and her sister went on vacation to Scotland, while my girlfriend refused to go. Early in my relationship, I started finding out about my girlfriend's suicidal ideation, previous history of self-harming behavior and traumatic childhood (almost no memories before she was 6, physical abuse and possible sexual abuse as a trafficked child). As I found this out, I started lurking r/suicidewatch, to better understand how to intervene with a person who wants and has plans to suicide. My girlfriend is special in this regard - she centers her suicide ideation on rational and philosophical thoughts, creating an ideology, where death is the only solution to escape from a world that brings her suffering and sorrow; a world full of unintelligent people, who disappoint her constantly. 

I first started knowing about this, when she revealed to me that she wanted to partake in a suicide pact or murder-suicide (finding people through the deep web or pro-suicide chats/forums). The explanation for this is that she would share the experience with someone who shares her end goal and who truly understands her. I started learning a lot how to listen to her and how to be someone  who could support her, thanks to you guys. However, 4 months into the relationship, this wasn't enough. I stopped two possible attempts, by making her meet me in the morning (5-7 am), managing to keep it a secret from everyone. Then, the day I most dreaded came. I noticed she was less communicative. We were going to have an important exam the next day and I knew she had a ton of pressure on top of her. I started panicking on the inside because I knew something was up, but I stayed calm on the outside, trying to get as much information as possible. She finally told me she would place her favorite pink ball behind a tree near her place and asked me to get it as soon as possible. After my insistence, she finally admitted she was going to attempt suicide as she moved to the train line. I managed to prevent her from hanging up the phone like 20 times. I have no doubts that she really was going to kill herself. Every 12 minutes, I would stop listening to her because of the deafining sound of trains passing by. Everytime this happened, I thought "well, she's gone". Meanwhile, my mom arrived home and I used my "trump card". As soon, as I saw my mom, I grabbed a pen and a paper and wrote "my girlfriend is going to kill herself in the train station, please call the emergency services". After some minutes, the dumbasses interrupted my phone call with her (which was ongoing for more that 40 minutes), to ask her where she was, which prompted her to panic and hide. It took them another 30 minutes to actually get there and another 20 to find her. The only correct thing the emergency services did was to alert the train station, which made every single train in my city to stop while the situation was being handled. She went to the hospital and she actually went to the exam the next day and passed (whereas I skipped the exam, because of the whole situation). Since then, she has been going to the psychiatrist (only) once per month. I heavily suspect that she has Borderline Personality Disorder, along with some form of depression.

Almost 3 months have passed and she hasn't "forgiven me" yet for saving her life when she wanted to die. She tells me that she wants to die even more than before. Better than the "you ruined my life for real now" and the "we will never speak again after what happened" that I listened after this first incident. Everything stabilized a bit, since we are on summer holidays, but, during the start of this month, she again started exhibiting more concrete suicidal ideas. We were planning a trip together and when I suggested September, she told me she couldn't because she would be in Shangri-la by then and/or she was going to the moon. She then told me she wanted to do it in September/October. Some nights ago, we were looking at the stars and she told me she would be a star "soon". She also appears more fearless to try methods like hanging herself or jumping from a building.

Today the entire thing escalated, once again, to huge proportions, though. What first seemed like an argument about our relationship, actually turned out to be a conflict within herself, due to her suicidal thoughts. I wanted to meet up with her today, but she avoided it, saying she couldn't, because of important personal stuff (she's home alone and, realistically, she has nothing to take care off, except for herself and her cats). Then I asked her I when I could meet her and she told me she didn't know. I asked her if she would like to come to my place on Saturday, but, surprisingly I got a "no" as an answer, followed by "I've been meeting new people". You can imagine the conversation that followed. However, after being upset with her, I managed to make her spit out the truth again, after she told me "you must think I don't love you, but I really do". The truth is, that during this home alone time, she has been browsing these suicidal things on the internet more often and something must have triggered her to anticipate her suicide to the next few days. She wanted to stay away from me because "she isn't on good terms with herself" and consequently, she believes she cannot be on good terms with me. She must have realized that being home alone is good chance to do it aswell; she might have met someone who lives not far away and wants to do a suicide pact (what she meant by saying meeting new people, was that she was meeting suicidal people).

I am in a really rough situation right now. I've been through so many gamebreaking situations in this relationship and, somehow, we managed to get through all that awful stuff, strengthening our bond and love farther then I would have ever imagined at the start of the relationship (which is my first). I am the only "offline" person who she actually has a good conversation about her suicidal thoughts with. She is still extremely sheltered in this regard with me, but extremely is better than completely. I know that if, for some reason we break up, she will no longer have a person to save her life or a person who she can talk to about these things. I have already taken the first step to control the situation a bit, which was making her meet me tomorrow or Saturday. To save my girlfriend's life appropriately, I feel like I have to solve a metaphorical puzzle and I am giving you the pieces:

- Emergency Services: Not a good idea, at the moment, even if I call anonymously. They've proven to be incompetent before and she would know it was me who made the call, because I am the only person with her address that knows about this situation. This could also raise tensions between me and her mom.

- Her Mom: First idolized me after I saved her daughter, now secretely despises me, according to my girlfriend. She has said to my girlfriend that I don't love and that she feels much safer when my girlfriend is around her ex-boyfriend, who is still friends with her. I have my own logical reasons to believe my girlfriend is telling the truth. She doesn't (and never did) care that much about my girlfriend, as evidenced by the fact that she leaves her recovering suicidal child home alone for two weeks. I could try to phone or message her, but I don't know if it will work, since she is in Scotland right now. There's not much she could do until she arrives back home, except telling me how to proceed with her own daughter. My girlfriend is extremely controlling about these situations and she could find out that I had been talking to her mom to spoil her plans.

- My mom: Overheard the conversation today. Panics everytime she hears something related to suicide, cops or self-harm. Along with my girlfriend's mom, she has been very intrusive in our relationship, to the point where I found out she had been reading my conversations with my girlfriend 5 months ago. She likes my girlfriend, but, at the same time, she calls her "crazy", because she completely fails to understand depressive people. However, my mom has actually helped us aswell in some bad moments. She has offered to help my girlfriend while she is home alone, by inviting her to stay over at our place any day she wanted. She only slept over once, at the beginning of these two weeks. My mom keeps asking "when is she coming over?", but my girlfriend has been making excuses for me to go to her place instead of going to my place. Anyway, my mom heard something today and she went berserk at me, because she knows something is up. However, I managed to patch up the situation with my mom (making her less suspicious), so she doesn't ruin our meetup which is going to happen tomorrow or Saturday. I don't want my mom to intervene in such a way that it ruins my relationship with my girlfriend and consequently my family environment. I also don't want my mom to intervene in such a way that makes it obvious that I told something to my mom or that my mom has been listening to us (which has caused trouble in the past). My mom can be dangerous in the sense that if she knows or she tries to help me she make it worse. She can also be helpful, but I know that in the aftermath of the events I will have damaged my family environment because of this situation once again.

- Me: I've been trying hard to live the best moments possible with my girlfriend. Even though she shares things with me, she also accuses me of not understanding her because I am not suicidal. The idolization period is wearing off and there are days where she tends to point out my flaws and differences from her. I am not perfect and our relationship suffers, because I've only been able to have vaginal sex with her once, thus far. I please her a lot sexually using other methods, though, but sometimes it doesn't suffice I've been dealing with my own personal problems for the past 7-8 years, which are causing moderate psychosomatic effects on my everyday functioning. I love my girlfriend to death, despite all the negativity portrayed in this post. I am rational enough to see the pros and cons of this relationship and the pros still outweigh the cons. I love her too much and I don't plan on leaving her, even with the knowledge that she might break my soul forever - it wouldn't really matter if I left her and she suicided, because the effect would be similar. Trust me, when I am telling you that I have gone beyond my powers and obligations to make everything a bit better. To make her world a bit more positive and bearable. To show her that there are reasons to stay here and leave this reality when our time comes. 

I read this subreddit often, so I pretty much tried most things and methods to make it a bit better for her. Take that into consideration. She is also extremely intelligent, smart and stubborn and will almost never listen to emotional or irrational conversations or suggestions. Her "problem" is more ideological/existential than emotional. I've tried the philosophical and spiritual talk many times and, while I shared interesting thoughts, those aren't enough to override her own. The scariest thing is that I don't know what to do next. I don't want to save her and ruin our relationship after - this might have sounded egotistical, but I am certain that once she loses me, she has no one who will try to stop her. She has lost contact with all of her friends since we started university. She also shelters away from the social environment at university, having only a single friend who she treats more like an acquaintance. Bear all this in mind. I truly hope someone reading all of this can give me some insight on what to do next.

EDIT: It saddens me that I actually got a PM from a banned user who tried to comment here saying: "Good luck to your girlfriend! I hope she dies quickly!". I just want help, if you have your own problems you don't have to project your negativity to people who are calling for help.
