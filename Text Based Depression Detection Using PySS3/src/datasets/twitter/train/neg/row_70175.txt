Bipolar disorder hallucinations tell me to do it.I have lived with hallucinations telling me to kill myself daily for a year now. I'm tired so so tired of it. I go to high school and have embarrassing panic attacks that cause me to be unable to continue school to the full extent I should be able to. I have to be watched like a baby because I'm a danger to myself. My teachers watch me my family watches me my friends watch me. I stress out all the people who mean anything to me because of my hallucinations and anxiety. When I'm not having hallucinations I'm depressed when I'm not depressed I'm anxious I don't mean to sound like I just complain but it's killing me. It really is killing me.
