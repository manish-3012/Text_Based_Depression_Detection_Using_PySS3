I want to die.For a while now I've had my emotions and feelings bottled up and I hide everything behind a smile. My friends and co workers say if I ever need to talk, then they're there for me but when they say it, it doesn't feel genuine (for my co workers), and I would feel like a burden pushing my thoughts onto my friends. My fiancee is always there for me and she's helped me a lot with talking about how I feel, but I don't want to tell her how I feel. I feel like it would make her feel guilty and that she isn't doing enough, she does so much for me. You wouldn't be able to see how I feel from just looking at me, I got too good at hiding it, and i think that's what stops me from actively seeking out help. I don't want that image of me to degrade, I have too many people who look up to me and rely on me. I just can't go on like this anymore. I'll try to go on for a little while longer. I'm sorry
