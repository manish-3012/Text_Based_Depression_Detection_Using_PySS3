Resent my kids some daysI keep thinking about the robe belt I have, how efficient I assume it would be. And it keeps getting easier to imagine how and where I will finish this. The stars are all aligning to make this happen. To say goodbye. The only thing preventing me is my kids. I guess I am not there yet. I feel like they would be SO much better off without me. They will eventually forget me, right?? Fudge- probably not- I am their MOM- what would it do to them?! Some days I resent them- for keeping me alive.
