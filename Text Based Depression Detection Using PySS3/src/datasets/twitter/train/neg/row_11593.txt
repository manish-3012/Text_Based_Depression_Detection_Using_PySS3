May 1stFor a long time I've been thinking of this. Probably two or three years. Even though I'm young (I'm fifteen) I don't believe I will have any future that's good. There is no point. 

I don't know if I am going to do anything tomorrow. I've been planning this date all year now. This week I've been feeling happier, almost as if at the last moment my brain finally makes me feel happier and more confident. Though I have decided if I don't do anything tomorrow I will probably on May 8th. 

I've messed up so many things. I regret most things I do. Even if I feel happier right now I know in the future I am going to feel bad again.
