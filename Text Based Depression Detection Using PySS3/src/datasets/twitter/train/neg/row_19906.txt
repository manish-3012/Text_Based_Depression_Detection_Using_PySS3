Next Saturday Iâ€™ll hopefully be deadIâ€™m not sure what to say other than fuck everyone that I asked for help who did nothing when I physically couldnâ€™t. I begged for help because I couldnâ€™t get help myself. Fuck most of my fake family who likes to act like they are so high and mighty, who likes to ignore me until they need something. Thinking that Iâ€™m lazy and I donâ€™t give a shit about anything when itâ€™s actually the exact fucking opposite. Even with a doctor talking to you about mental health you guys didnâ€™t get it. You pretended to. Saying youâ€™re there for me but as soon as we were back home it was right back to being ignored. Being left out. I donâ€™t know what I did to be treated like this? What did I do that was so wrong? 

I want to thank my friends for being the only family I ever had. I love you. Iâ€™m sorry, I know Iâ€™ve treated you guys like shit these past couple months and acted like I didnâ€™t care. Iâ€™m sorry I let my pain take over. I just hope you donâ€™t hate me but itâ€™s honestly okay if you do. Nobody canâ€™t hate me more than I do myself. I love you guys so fucking much. Thank you for the past 3 years together. Through all our ups and downs. Thank you. I love you. 

Iâ€™m sorry Dad. You were the only one that really cared in this fucking family. the only one who actually did anything. Donâ€™t let any of my siblings make you feel like shit anymore. Donâ€™t let them talk bad about you anymore. I love you.

Iâ€™m sorry to my nephews. Iâ€™ve never liked children but you three were always the exception. I wish I couldâ€™ve been around more, but it wasnâ€™t up to me. Stay strong. I know you guys are going to grow up to become some really good men. I know it. Donâ€™t let your parents force you to do anything you donâ€™t want to. Donâ€™t let them try to mold you into something youâ€™re not. Stick up for yourselves and each other. Donâ€™t be afraid to be yourself ever. I love you. 

Lastly, Iâ€™m sorry to myself. Iâ€™m sorry I gave you false hope. Iâ€™m sorry you feel so much hurt and Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t love you as I should. But Iâ€™m also thankful for you being you through everything. For knowing what you want even if itâ€™ll hurt you later. You were always honest to yourself no matter how painful. Youâ€™ve been planning this for a month. And youâ€™ve never felt more at ease in your life. Youâ€™re supposed to turn 21 in September but youâ€™ve always known you wouldnâ€™t make it that far. In some weird way itâ€™s comforting. There so much I want to say but I donâ€™t even know how to say it. I just hope I find peace. 

If i donâ€™t give an update a 5 days after the 14th then I was finally successful.
