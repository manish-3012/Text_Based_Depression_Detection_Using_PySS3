I often wonder at what point itâ€™s appropriate to give up.Itâ€™s been the worst year of my life. I think about ending it often but have yet to solve the problem of how to do so without damaging the people I love. 

I donâ€™t talk about it with anyone and so Iâ€™m saying it here for the first time because it sucks to feel this way and it sucks even more to feel this way AND be alone. The happy mask goes on for the ones I care about and I trudge on feeling like thereâ€™s a bowling ball sized hole in my chest. 

Itâ€™s been a struggle for 16 years. Itâ€™s hard to imagine it will ever get better. I wish there was a clear point, a line in the sand, that everyone could see and say â€œyes, we understand and are ok with her being gone because she needed toâ€ but that point doesnâ€™t exist and Iâ€™ll never be able to make them understand.
