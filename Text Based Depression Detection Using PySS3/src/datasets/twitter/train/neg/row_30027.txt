I don't think I'm capable of being happy, and because of that I don't think its worth it to live anymore.I'll try to make this a short read.  Basically I'd describe myself as a Utilitarian.  I'm looking at how bad my life is now and how bad it is going to be for quite some time, and I'm adding up the "antihedons."  Then I'm looking at all the things people are telling me to look forward to.  What I'm realizing is that all the things that people say will be so good for me in the future, don't seem like things that are actually going to make me happy.  Needless to say this leaves me with a net negative "happiness."  I feel like if I were to kill myself it would at least make the balance neutral.  I think if I wasn't just writing something in a hurry that I could make my family understand.  The only thing that is stopping me is how hard it would be for my family to explain it to my nieces (8 and 4).  I always look around and it just baffles me how people are so happy and content with their lives while I can't derive any amount of joy from anything.  I don't know where I am supposed to find happiness, and if I can't I just feel it may be a better alternative to kill myself.
