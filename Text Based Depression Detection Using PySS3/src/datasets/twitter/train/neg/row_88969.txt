What helps me get through...Ok, so this may not be the most constructive of ways of getting though an issue, but does delay and keeps you focused.

So recently I have been suicidal. Been thinking about exits and how it's all pointless... etc.

I've decided to become less attached to people. It means that im less likely to be hurt, and will at least remain focused while I fulfill my main goal. 

My main goal is to climb everest by 2013. From what I figure, I can attempt to make some money to charity, and even if I die on the mountain, at least I have attempted some good, and would have made a better exit than just taking pills or cutting myself.

However if I succeed, I would have climbed everest, as well as being in peak physical condition. I just think people should realise the affect we could have on others.
