Some of us are not built to survive.That's lately what I've been thinking. 

My life is just an endless myriad of suffering. Consistently used and tossed away. I miss the pills. At least on the pills I didn't feel like throwing myself out of a moving car.

I fantasize about it almost every day. How I want to die somewhere beautiful and cold. Somewhere in the snow. 

I survived a cult. I endured a childhood full of rejection, rape, abuse, beatings and death - Only to have it continue into my teenage years. My own family disowned me because of their religion, I was denied education, medical treatment and a place to call home. I fell in love and thought I could be cured. She married me (foolishly) and I can't seem to overcome my disorders. I've been fully diagnosed with a plethora of them. I was too broken for most of our relationship to treat her as well as I should have.

I'm proficient with music, I hold a job, I'm good at most things I put my hand to but I can't be happy. The nightmares, the anxiety, the depression, the lack of friends, lack of family, lack of support... it eats away at me every day. Everything is overwhelming, it hurts and I'm afraid. I don't want to check into a hospital where they'll forcefeed me pills and I'll be away from my wife. She's the only thing that keeps me grounded. I tried to start a family with her and failed.

I want to stop being sick. I used to be afraid. But now I just feel apathetic. I feel resigned. I've been thinking about the gentlest and best way to end it but haven't come to a solid decision. I was thinking of something to just quietly put me to sleep. I'm tired of trying. I've tried for years to be better and not be my situation. I've been to therapists, doctors, been on pills, tried almost everything I can think of to improve but nothing is working. The darkness is winning.
