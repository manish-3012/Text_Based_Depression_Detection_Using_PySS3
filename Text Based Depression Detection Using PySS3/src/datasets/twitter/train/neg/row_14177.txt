I guess I just want to let the weight break me.There is no point. There is no true happiness anywhere. It's all only temporary, at least for me. Everyone is different I'm sure. I can be happy sometimes. But eventually even if it lasts for a while I break down until I see the sadness again. The sadness is always there waiting to show its head again. The sadness makes me just want to finally give up. Its like a weight on my shoulders and all I want to do is let the weight break me so I can relax. Sometimes I feel like the weight isn't so bad but eventually I realize what it really is. For a while I thought I had everything figured out. Now I know nothing about the world. How can anyone? What is the point of my life if all it is is me pretending to be happy for other people. In reality I'm sad and I want the sadness to take over, because it's so much easier than trying so hard to be happy. The happiness is only temporary anyway. Everyone is only here for their own good. It may not seem so but it's always true. Does anyone really truly care about me? Do I really truly care about anyone? Probably not. Unless I want or get something in return. It's fucked up. So no one cares about eachother yet for some reason I push through the weight on my shoulders. Why do I do that? Why can't I just let the weight break me so I can finally relax. I'm more curious to see what happens if I let it break me than I am about staying here sometimes. Sorry if anyone reads this. I'm spreading sadness. I need to know someone has read these feelings though. I can't tell anyone I know. I'd be labeled or looked at different. I'd get fake attention.. Maybe at least if anyone even cares about that. I can't say anything to anyone. I'm forced to push through it silently. Im not sure how much longer I can do that. I just want to let go of that weight and relax. And possibly finally have my true forever happiness.
