The ones weâ€™ve lostThis subreddit is like no other, in the way that you canâ€™t tell who has gone through with their plans. Itâ€™s such a sad concept. Letâ€™s all take a moment to pay respects to the people that weâ€™ve lost to the battle, and hope that theyâ€™re in a better place now. To everyone that is still fighting, know that you deserve so much better and that good things are ahead. I love you all so much, keep fighting. You guys are so brave. ðŸ’•
