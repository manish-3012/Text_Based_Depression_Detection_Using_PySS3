I'm completely aloneForced to be alive on this cruel world I wish i had someone to support me but everyone around me is only blaming me for their bullshit.

I have enough tried living normal for 2years and it only made me break mentally apart.

I cut my dreads to make sure Iâ€™ll kill myself this month 

I hope I can finally relax now canâ€™t take life anymore i hate society for forcing me to take a risky suicide method but idc anymore
