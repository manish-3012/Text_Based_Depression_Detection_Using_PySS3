I canâ€™t fucking win. No matter what I do, it will never be good enough. Why do I even fucking try?No matter what I do, itâ€™s never good enough. If I accomplish something, itâ€™s belittled. My mom is so controlling over my life too. After literally suffering a depressive episode two weeks ago, I finally got my shit together and got ahead in school again. Went to go tell her. I was also planning on going to my best friends for Halloween since I would be ahead. A fucking no because oh, I just caught up and that isnâ€™t â€œgood enoughâ€ for her. So why do I even try?? I feel like everything I do is just going to be never good enough. Iâ€™m not good enough. Iâ€™ve tried to see around it and look for the positive aspects but I am just so done. I am so lost at life and my depression is going to eventually drown me. Itâ€™s bound to happen. I see no future for myself and living through a single day feels like such a chore. I am so done with everything, honestly. I just want this all to end.
