How do I get through everything alone?I probably shouldn't post here because I want to live... I just don't know how. I don't know how to survive when I can't have a guy hold me at night or even just a friend to talk to, even about shallow shit. I tried making friends for three years at my college, and it resulted in a few acquaintances. But friends won't be there for you, *really*. They wont make time for you like an SO would. And I need someone who will make time for me. I met one guy a month and a half ago, and he's all I have. And he knows it. I don't know what I'll do if it doesn't work out with him. I don't know how to be alone. It's not like I can be with him all the time at this point, either, of course. I'm wasting my time sleeping and crying and distracting myself from how badly it hurts. I'm cutting more and more people out of my life because I keep feeling hurt. I'm not eating. I'm doing poorly in school. I'm self harming, hoping I'll go to the hospital so people will care. I just don't know what to do. I'm in so much pain all the time. I don't know how to live.
