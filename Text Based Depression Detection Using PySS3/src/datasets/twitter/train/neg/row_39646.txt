I don't even know if this is the right place to post this, but my best friend is suicidal right now for the 3rd time.Hey guys, I don't really know where else to put this, I'm just hoping for some advice. 

My wife and I have a best friend (We'll call her Kelly) who we've been very close with for years. She called us last night at 2am, her and her girlfriend broke up and her girlfriend left Kelly by herself and she was very upset, spoke of killing herself. I kept asking if we could come get her (She was at her girlfriend's house in the state directly below ours, about a two hour drive) but she said no. We stayed up until 4:30 on the phone with her until her girlfriend finally came back and let Kelly in so that she could get some sleep.

She's going to come stay with us for a while. We've got a gun in our home that we're going to give to a friend of ours for safe keeping while she's here. This is the 3rd time in 8 years that she's had an actual thought out plan to commit suicide. Once she actually went through with it and it thankfully didn't work. 

My wife and I both feel much better knowing that she's going to be here with us and not by herself, I'm just hoping to get some advice on what we can do to keep her safe and make her feel warm and loved and protected.

I'm sorry for rambling, I'm kind of a mess right now over this and I just want to make sure my wife and I are being the best we can possibly be for her right now.
