This is it guys.I'm not going to try and explain the whole story as that would take a long time. 

Essentially, I've struggled with depression since I was in grade school. I used to grab knives in the kitchen and contemplate ending my life when I was only SEVEN years old. I've pushed for a long time to fight it, I am too weary to hold it back any longer. 

No, nothing you say can change my mind, it will still happen. 

What I really want is someone to help me. Someone to make my final days easier than my life has been. All that's stopping me right now is not knowing which method will hurt the least. 

I'm sorry that this is probably the wrong sub for this, but I can't turn to anyone else. The few friends I have in life would not understand the pain I'm in and would try and stop me. I care about them and I'm sad that I'll be hurting them by going, but I can't push through any more. 

If anyone could help me in any way, I'd appreciate you. Just PLEASE don't tell me what I'm doing is wrong or selfish. There hasn't been a day I can remember where I haven't been fighting this and I have finally reached my limit.
