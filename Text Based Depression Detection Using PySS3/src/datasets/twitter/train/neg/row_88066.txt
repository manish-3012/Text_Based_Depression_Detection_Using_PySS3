To students committing suicide-iâ€™m a final year student and i have exams upcoming in a few days, and i plan to commit suicide after my supply comes in which is during exams

i donâ€™t know what to do about my exams, i havenâ€™t studied until now and yet i still have to take it so

any students here? what have you been doing w ur schoolwork? 

i feel like the intent to kill myself really makes me feel like thereâ€™s no point in bothering anymore so
