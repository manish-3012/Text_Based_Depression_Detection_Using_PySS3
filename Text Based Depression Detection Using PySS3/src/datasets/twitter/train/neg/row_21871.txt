Helpi'm getting released today (have mandatory therapy sessions but i'm not being kept in or anything which is good), and I just... the semester is almost over, i haven't submitted anything for a lot of courses and can't unenroll, is there any way to save my gpa, is there anyway that this is not already a lost cause and i should just try harder for winter. is there any way that my parents won't have to see this when they ask. They aren't abusive but sometimes they hit me, and withhold food for days if they think I deserve this. And with this gpa i definitely do.
Mental health is nrver a valid excuse to them, so please don't suggest that. They don't care this is my fifth suicide attempt(they do but more in the crying, why am i such a coward and let's make sure nobody else finds out just like the last 4 times way than anything else) but they do care that i'm failing college. So please help?

I don't know why i'm posting this on suicide watch, the last stint in the hospital felt horrible, and i'm probably not going to try again anytime soon unless i get a foolproof plan and i need to somehow deal with my life till then
