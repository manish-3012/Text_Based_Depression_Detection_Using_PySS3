JUST KILL ME ALREADY!We all die anyways what's the difference between me dying now and later? There isn't, fuck society and what it thinks about how we should live to 70-80-90 living this balance game, trying not to be miserable and depressed. Everybody just let me die already, stop trying to force me too live this messed up life just cause people can't handle death and everybody's selfish. 

(If I had the resources to kill myself, I totally would. Be the best day ever to be honest.)
