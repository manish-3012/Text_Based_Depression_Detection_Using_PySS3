I failed a suicide attempt two weeks ago because my family cared too much. Now I know they despise me and if they found me dying, they wouldnâ€™t do anything.So how can I ensure I die if I slit my wrists with a scalpel? Is there anything to avoid doing and is there anything that increases the likelihood of dying quickly? 
Iâ€™ve been considering this for years and Iâ€™d just like advice so that I can go through this properly
