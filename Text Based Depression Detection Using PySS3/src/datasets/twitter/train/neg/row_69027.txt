feeling hopelessly lostfirst off, im not going to kill myself but I have gotten to the point where Im obsessing over my death and dying.

I feel trapped in a miserable unhappy life and have no way out. if I died tommorow in a car accident I almost wouldnt care. i say almost because ive got kids which is the only reason i havent offed myself yet.

i dont know what to do. i sometimes feel like im gonna snap and off myself. just tell myself fuck it i cant take it any more.

i feel like everything is out of control.

im hoping that maybe someone else has been in a similar situation.

im in my 30s in a loveless marriage with a dead end job... i could really use some advice

i smoke pot which helps with the depression but it seems to be a lot less helpful lately
