I texted 5 different suicide text lines this morning (7 AM) and still no answer for a single one (10 AM)I was having really bad suicidal thoughts and had such bad anxiety I was crying and trembling uncontrollably and vomiting and going between hot and cold sweats and didn't want to be a burden to my boyfriend who was sleeping so I tried texting a hotline as when I get like this I cannot bring myself to speak words for some reason. just as the title says I've had no response whatsoever and it's making me feel hopeless as fuck. Like how does 5 DIFFERENT HOTLINES FOR SUICIDE NOT ANSWER? If I was adamant on killing myself I would have done so already with absolutely no help from them  the only thing that's keeping me from doing so is the fact that my boyfriend and my cat would be homeless if I wasn't alive to make money for our apartment. does anyone know how I can seek help in a better way than having to Google suicide hotlines bc I can't do anything more without risking losing my job, then apartment, then relationship.
