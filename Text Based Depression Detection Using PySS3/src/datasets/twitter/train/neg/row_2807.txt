I thought it would be betterI went to my first therapy session last tuesday. I was rescheduled to go the following tuesday. I felt better after the first sesh, despite it just being a test. Do you know what happened? My mom cancelled it. She pulled me out of it. Said that she didnt trust them, and i should go someplace better. And now, im going nowhere. Fuck. Why the fuck am i like this if im normal?
