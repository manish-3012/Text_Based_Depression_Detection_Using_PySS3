Feeling dizzyIâ€™m 32. I made it past my birthday. Not that I wanted to. I still feel 16 and lost and hopeless. Drawing on my walls and writing Linkin Park lyrics on all of my books. Playing sad songs on my guitar that I eventually had to sell to pay rent. Nothing got better, nothing helped. Iâ€™m still 16 and cutting my arms in neat little rows just to watch blood pooling on the floor. Iâ€™m sick and Iâ€™m done trying to heal. I need to get out of here. 

Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m quite emotional. Sort of hazy.
