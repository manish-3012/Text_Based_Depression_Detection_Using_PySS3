HelpMy parents are abusive assholes, and Iâ€™m stuck with them until quarantine ends. That in itself wouldnâ€™t be so bad, because Iâ€™d be back at uni in the fall and have a way out in a year once I graduate, but they infantilised me to hell as a kid and I literally donâ€™t know how to grocery shop, or book a ticket and get on a bus, or rent property myself, or drive. Iâ€˜m useless. I got through university this far just by fumbling around and winging everything because they forcibly paid for my accommodation etc. (couldnâ€™t go unless I went and stayed where they wanted) and taught me \*nothing\* about how to look after myself. I feel so useless and ashamed for barely knowing the basics of how to adult at fucking 25.

I also suck at making friends, and those I have seem to forget about me pretty quick when I donâ€™t message them. Iâ€™m lonely as hell, I always have been and feel like I always will be because I fit nowhere and no matter what I do, people just seem to drift away or arenâ€™t interested in knowing me. My parents and me are all stuck at home all the time due to covid, so they have nothing else to amuse them except to hassle me, and I canâ€˜t escape them. Rn Iâ€™m terrified my mum is gonna come in and start yelling at me again because she found out Iâ€™m gay and absolutely flipped her shit, and I just donâ€™t. Want. To be here anymore.

I donâ€™t want to die, but I donâ€™t know how I can stand this amount of pain. All I have any hope in anymore is my creative writing, but I canâ€™t even do that right now I feel so shit. I just want out. Dammit, I want to be free of them, and to punish them for fucking up my life before I was old enough to understand what they were doing. I just want out. Somebody help.
