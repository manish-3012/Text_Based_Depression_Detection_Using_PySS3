I've made a terrible choice.Suppose this isn't as deep as some stories on here, and I have no idea how well this will be taken. Let's get on with the story.

On November 13 I had left my loving, carping, and overall sweet boyfriend of a year and a half for someone i had not known nearly as long. Why I made this decision, I will never know. 

"But if the time comes that that guy leaves you, I sincerely hope you suffer as much as I have ten times over, because the pain i had, it almost killed me."

At the time my now ex-bf sent this to me, I hadn't given it much mind. My now current bf was there beside me to comfort me through this and the high of a new lover was still strong and numbed the pain of the breakup. 

A few days ago i had started to see what i had given up. And now, 2 weeks after breaking up, it is taking its toll on me emotionally. I had envisioned a family with my ex. We had a love i had imagined strong married couples had. The feeling that i gave that up, and that i had sent my ex away, utterly heartbroken, is breaking me.

The "new love high" has worn off quickly. I feel my current bf just isn't telling me about himself at all. There are no cute, funny, or sweet moments between us anymore. It all feels stale already, and its only been 2 weeks.

At the time of the breakup me and my bf were going through stressful times. With a few of my friends ignoring and leaving me behind, while he had been feeling lonely. I had initially thought he had lost our spark, but now i see that I had just been to distant.

Today, I am feeling extremely stressed somewhat neglected from my boyfriend. I am having trouble finding anyone reasonable that i can vent to, and with me being socially awkward as the story usually goes, i don't have a lot of choices. This has helped though, even if the only people to see this are a handful of anonymous users.

Thank you guys

Edit: yes, I know im a terrible person. I don't need you to pm me to make sure of it.
