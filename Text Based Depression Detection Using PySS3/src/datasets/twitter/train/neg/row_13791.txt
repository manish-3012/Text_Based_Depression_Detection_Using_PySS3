SLooking for a very compassionate female to talk too. I'm 28, female my self. But I need someone to talk to who isn't looking for someone to help. I used to have a mom to talk to when I was very down, she is gone now, not dead, just gone. I just need someone to care and act motherly I need to feel loved again
