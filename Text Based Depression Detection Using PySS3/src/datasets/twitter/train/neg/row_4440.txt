Not a cry for helpI'm just here to get my story out lol. If one person reads this I'm fine with that also.

I'm 16, I have high ADHD, I'm off and on with my medications, my grades are mediocre, and the most basic thing is that I dont feel happy or sad. Never both or one of the other.

I haven't felt sad, I haven't felt happy, something in my brain switched in 7th grade and I just never felt any thing worth awhile. I keep on saying that mental health will recover on it's own, that in just attention seeking, I'm over reacting and my emotions dont count as much as my peers or family.

It is hard for me to make eye contact with my closest friends, I'm losing friends, and it's never been harder to get them, I have no ambition, I do sports for my parents to make them happy. I never liked them.

I haven't done anything for myself and it's always been for my closest friends or parents. Sometimes I feel like when the text me it's just for me to give them something. Like I have no value other than car rides and food. I have no value to anyone.

Being this much of a husk of a person I just feel like it would be better to be gone without having to give anymore. I'm tired of not being able to meet eye contact with my friend Ethan from 4th grade. I'm tired of doing things for my parents. And I'm tired of not feeling sad about any of this, and I'm angry at myself for not being happy from the good. I'm selfish and I dont deserve any of what I have. 

I'm a husk that keeps on giving, it feels like I dont have. a presence. I dont know if I am going to kill myself. But everyday it seems like a better option.
