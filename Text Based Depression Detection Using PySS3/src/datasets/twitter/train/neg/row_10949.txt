no more drivefor the past 2/3 years i have had a drive to get threw life, from trying to kill my self, to my sexuality, having someone i loved and helped me find my self block me and never talk to me and be deceptive  about there feelings, iv gone threw braking up with my dad, falling in love and having my first real relationship end with him cheating on me, iv gotten into use done my 1st year thats was hell, i just can't keep going.

i hate uni even halls makes me want to hurt m self and i can't move out, i find it hard to get a job as it is and need to go looking for the summer and i can;t face it.

i don't want to keep going in life, get a job, work, die, that's it?, i have dreams but i know i can't do them, i feel trapped and that i can't escape, like all the issues are my fault, i have no home support really, i just don't want to keep dealing with life, i never planed to be this old, im 20, i get told i still have a life, i don't want it, i was hoping to die by age 16, my life is just be stumbling and falling with hardly any support, and the ones that do are far away.
