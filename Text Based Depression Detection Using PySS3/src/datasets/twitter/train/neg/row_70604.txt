Whats the PointIt has been one year since I graduated University in Civil Engineering and cannot find a job and my life is going nowhere. All the new graduates will now be prioritized in jobs which will only make the job search more impossible. I sit in my room applying for jobs 16 hours a day and cannot even get a job basic minimum wage job. I am willing to do almost anything for minimum wage and still cannot find a job. My parents look at me as a failure and I have no one in my life. I am currently 23 and have felt suicidal for three years and didnâ€™t kill myself since I hoped my life would get better after graduation, but instead it has only gotten worse. It feels pointless to continue to apply to jobs since everyone I graduated with found a job in less than 3 months, while I have spent 16 hours a day applying to jobs for a year and canâ€™t get anything.  I have no one in my life and my life is going nowhere, I donâ€™t see a point in continuing living.
