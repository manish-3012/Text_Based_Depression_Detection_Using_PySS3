I was under a general anaesthetic for an unrelated operation, and I'm now scared because I enjoyed the experienceI had a oral surgery earlier this week which was done in a day hospital as I needed to be put to sleep for the duration of procedure. This might sound strange, but I actually enjoyed the experience of being put to sleep; it was so calming and relaxing to have no sensation.

I'm certainly no doctor, but my understanding of going under a general anaesthetic more likened to a temporary coma than sleeping, or to put it more bluntly, a "temporary death". I already struggle with depression, and now that I realize how tranquil such a "death" is, I'm really concerned that this experience will make me more likely to attempt self-harm as I'm less afraid of death as a result.

I'm very sorry if these thoughts of my comes up at bizarre. Should I be raising what I've just described above with my psychologist/psychiatrist?

Thank you.

tl;dr: was put to sleep for an operation, enjoyed the experience and I'm now less afraid of harming myself
