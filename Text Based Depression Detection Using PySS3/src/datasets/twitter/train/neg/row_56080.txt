How do I stop crying?How do I stop thinking about the lost love, the lost opportunity, the waste of a life I'm living, the loneliness, how happy I could be at this moment if I had done only a few things differently in my life, chances I will never get back?

How do I stop waking up with the very first thought not being that I'm hungry or that I need to shower or whatever, but instead elaborate fantasies about walking into the woods and hanging myself? How do I stop playing with the rope once or twice every single morning, just tying and re-tying knots? 

I feel so desperate. I've talked to so many people, telling them "I'm having a rough time." I've talked to therapists. It feels good while I'm in their offices, but I still have to go home. I still have to be alone. Am I just waiting for numbness? Because once numbness comes I won't want to kill myself, but I also don't want to live a grey, bleak life. I can't stop crying. I've never felt so God damn alone. I don't want to die. But I just can't feel like my heart is bleeding every single morning and all day every day. I'm more scared than I've ever been.
