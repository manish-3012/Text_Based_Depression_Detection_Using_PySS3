Why are people so mean?Lemme start off by saying the people who will respond to this are most likely good people, but that is a small percent of humanity? What the fuck is the point of life if you're to be beaten down repeatedly. Mass shootings, abuse, all manner of atrocities are committed and it makes me think... are we really worth saving, is life TRULY worth living? Every day it seems that one more fucking tragedy after another plays out and the ones with the power to fix sit with fingers so far up their asses they spit out fingernails... What is the point? Sorry if this seems... needy or dramatic... I just don't see the point. Sorry again...
