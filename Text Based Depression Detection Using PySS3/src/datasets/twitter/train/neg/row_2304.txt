I've done this to myselfI keep avoiding my friends at university and eating alone. I've been meaning to make new friends. But Idk, I grew up without friends and now I just feel better alone. I know it's not good for my well being, but at this point I think I'm addicted to the pain of being alone. I want to call for help but I feel like a burden to everyone, my friends, my family,  myslef, I've only ever been a burden. A shit stain. Maybe it's my shame. I don't open up. I don't share my interest with anyone because I'm ashamed of it. The music I'll spend hours analysing is almost a burden of shame to me. I don't want to be sad anymore. But Idk what will take, I don't know if I'll ever be truly happy or that I'll ever find validation. I'll help others instead of myself. I can't even keep a coherent thought throughout this cry. Maybe I'm better off alone. After all I deserve me
