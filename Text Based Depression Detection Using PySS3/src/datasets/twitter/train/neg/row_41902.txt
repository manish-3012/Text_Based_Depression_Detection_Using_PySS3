I'm tiredEvery day I get up and I fix it. Whatever it is, I fix it. It's my job. I have kids, and their lives aren't supposed to be like mine, their childhood isn't supposed to be like mine. They are not supposed to suffer just because I am broken.
The guilt I feel for having brought them into the world, to have to have me for a mom, it is breaking my back. 

I should have died when I tried to kill myself when I was a teen, it feels like it was a mistake that I survived. I should have died before I got anyone else involved in my fucking mess. 
It was a mistake that I lived.
