Not really wanting to kill myself, but in a quite bad place.The main reason im in a quite bad place is because school is starting soon for me, and normally I would be fine about it, but this year i'm scared to death. It's because of one of my friends(?). Around the end of last school year, I started to obsess over him being a god and far superior to me. This was for many reasons. The main reason was because he got ALOT of attention from other kids, and 90% of the kids he got attention from were girls. He had a girlfriend, and a ton of other friends too. Those girls would often run up to him and hug him. On the 2nd of last day of school, I couldn't help but count the number of hugs he was getting. That number was 13! Thats alot! And all of them he never asked for, they just came running up and hugging him. I only got like 2 that day, all of which I had to ask for. Two people from his "fanbase" (A term for friends I use) are kids in THE GRADE ABOVE HIM! One of them even said in front of me and him that he was her favorite kid in my grade and I was one of her least favorites. She said it was because we don't know eachother really well but I've tried to get to know her, but she doesn't seem to care. I also started to go psycho over him being with his girlfriend. I would save seats for them to sit together, beg the teachers to have identical schedules next year, beg him to kiss his girlfriend sometime, and so much more. I'm pretty sure he got weirded out over all this stuff, and now he might think im weird. I as you can see, I am already obsessing about him too much in this post. My main problem is in 10 days, school starts. I am scared to death seeing him, and people from his fanbase running up to him and hugging him. Which I am 100% sure will happen. I know when I see it, I'm gonna start to cry (I cry very easily), and hide in the bathroom stall for a while. any ideas on what I can do?
