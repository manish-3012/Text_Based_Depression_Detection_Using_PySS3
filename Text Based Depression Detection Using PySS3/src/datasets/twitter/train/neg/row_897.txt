I'm not strong enough to carry on anymoreI've been here before. Being totally broken by a relationship, but this time it's different. It was my fault. I needed some time to think about if I was ready to just back in to a relationship and took 4 days to think. During that time the girl got into another relationship.

She was seeing somebody else but kissed me before I told her I needed some time. Then she never told me she was in a relationship and let me believe I was taking her out on a date over the weekend. It was only after I had kissed her that she told me she had a boyfriend. Despite that we went out for dinner and she held my hand and cuddled into my arm, crying a lot because she wants to be with me but she says 'she can't'. I took her home and she begged me to stay the night, to which I responded that it wouldn't be right. She told me 'we don't have to do anything, we can just cuddle', which to me implied she wanted more to happen. I wanted more to happen too but I left because I knew it would've hurt more if we slept together and she still couldn't be with me. 

I've waited 6 months through lockdown and covid restrictions for her. I went on one date with another girl but couldn't stop thinking about this first girl and so I told her my mistake. 

I'm honestly done at this point. This will be my third and final suicide attempt. I'm making sure I won't survive this time. 

I've given myself until Friday to get my stuff into order before I drift away into the long sleep.
