I'm about to go to a new school (high school) and I'm so scared I want to commit suicideSo I live in Poland and I have autism. I think I cannot go to school because of how freaked out I am. I think of committing suicide right now and the more close the moment of me going to school for the first time is the more scared I am. I feel numb in head. So scared I can't even think straight. The chances are I won't be here than going to school.
