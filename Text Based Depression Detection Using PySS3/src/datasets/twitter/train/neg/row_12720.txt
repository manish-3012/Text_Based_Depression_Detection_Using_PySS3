suicidaleven when i should be happy and i have people who care about me, i still want to die. thereâ€™s a really nice guy who iâ€™m seeing and he treats me well but i donâ€™t feel like i deserve it. my friends always check on me and i just tell them iâ€™m better. i start fights with everyone i love bc i just want them to leave me so i donâ€™t hurt them anymore. i cause everyone a lot of trouble. everyone worries that iâ€™m gonna kill myself. iâ€™ve become some sort of kid they gotta keep track of. i feel like a burden to everyone. i wish i could make them stop worrying about me, i just want to get better but iâ€™ve tried and nothing changes. i still feel the same sadness no matter how much help i get. i think my eating disorder is coming back, i keep starving myself until i feel like iâ€™m going to pass out from just standing. i feel like a waste of space, i feel like itâ€™s not even worth staying alive when i contribute nothing to anyoneâ€™s life. iâ€™ve tried therapy and iâ€™ve tried medication. it just never goes away. i should be happy right now but all i wanna do is kill myself. idk what else to do. im scared iâ€™m gonna actually do it
