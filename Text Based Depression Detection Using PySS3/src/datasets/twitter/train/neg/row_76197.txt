Help me help my friend.Please help.

I have a friend. Well he isn't really a friend. But I care enough about him. He is around 16 years old now. He used to go to my school but left because of reasons. He hasn't been in education for around a year (I think) and I always knew he wasn't mentally healthy. He was a bit of an outcast. Sorry if I'm typing this fast but I need to help him.

I hadn't spoken to him in years up until a few months ago as my other friend who contacted him occasionally said that he was really suicidal. I think I managed to talk him out of it via steam chat and then I added him on skype. I recently checked my skype and saw that he changed his status to "Done with myself."

Help me. wtf can I do.

I don't talk to him often, he has no friends either. He's depressed.

please help.
