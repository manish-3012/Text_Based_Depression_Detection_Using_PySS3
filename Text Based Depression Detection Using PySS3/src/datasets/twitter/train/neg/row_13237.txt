I'm just so fucking tired.I'm not depressed nor suicidal. In fact I feel pretty okay most of the time. I'm just so tired of life. Idk where else to post this. 

I'm tired of the repetitiveness.
I'm tired of doing the same shit every day.
I'm tired about the fact that I can't maintain something new that I try to start.
I'm tired of going to work and feeling like this when I come home.
I'm tired of waiting for Uni to start but still not knowing what course I want to do.
I'm tired of the family problems I have.
I'm tired of not knowing what to do with my life.
I'm tired of not having as good social skills as I want.
I'm tired of not being where I want to physically, and I'm tired of not being able to keep a workout routine.
I'm tired of myself, of the way I am.
AND I'M FUCKING TIRED THAT WHENEVER I TRY TO CHANGE ANY OF THIS I CAN'T, OR STOP, OR CSNT MAINTAIN IT.
I'm tired of how I feel sometimes. Just sometimes. Like I said most of the time I feel pretty okay. But I don't like right now.

Fuck. I have work tomorrow as well. I had such a bad day today. And yesterday, and the day before my Grandma died. 

Man I wish I could do something different. I know I'll be better by tomorrow but I'm just writing this here to vent or whatever. In fact I feel a bit better already.

I really, honestly, just feel so tired of everything.
