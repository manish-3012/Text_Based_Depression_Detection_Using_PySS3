I'm fucking doneThere's a lot of fucked up things in my life, but right now the thing that worries me most is going to jail. I've received two misdemeanor charges for possession of marijuana in less than a fucking month. I was arrested for one of them and spent 16 hours in jail. It was the worst time of my entire life. If I am going to jail, I'd rather just kill myself. I already want to die anyway, and the one thing that made things better actually made things a whole lot worse
