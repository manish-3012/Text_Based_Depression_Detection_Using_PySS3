Yo whatâ€™s up? Itâ€™s been awhile.Iâ€™ve always been an anxious guy, had my first breakup in February and I experienced first hand exactly what it feels likes to be in a dark place, the thing is, you donâ€™t feel anything. Iâ€™ve recovered, shit happens. But.. itâ€™s coming back, the numbing and the suppressed emotion and lack of expression, you almost forget itâ€™s been like this for weeks. 

Iâ€™ve decided to see a school councillor, not now, Iâ€™m in school break and about to move to a new school, if that doesnâ€™t work out, well I guess, I wonâ€™t have to worry about much. 

If anyone can PM me, that would be awesome thanks.
