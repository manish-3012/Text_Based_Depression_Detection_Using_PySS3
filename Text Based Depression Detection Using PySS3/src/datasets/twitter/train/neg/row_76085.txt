I donâ€™t want to kill myself, but I donâ€™t want to be here eitherSo for the past year or so, Iâ€™ve been on and off battling severe depression.  I started to feel better in around late May, early June, but recently itâ€™s sparked up really bad again.  It may stem from my fatherâ€™s recent passing, but I donâ€™t really know.  Recently Iâ€™ve just wanted to no longer exist (if you can understand), but I donâ€™t want to commit suicide.  I donâ€™t want to put my family through another death so close to a previous one.  The line for Bohemian Rhapsody phrases it pretty well: â€œI donâ€™t want to die, but sometimes I wish I never was born at allâ€ (or something along those lines).  I donâ€™t feel like I can covey this to someone because I donâ€™t want them to be hurt.  Has anyone else gone through this, and if so, how did you get through it?  Iâ€™d also appreciate advice from people who havenâ€™t been through this as well.
