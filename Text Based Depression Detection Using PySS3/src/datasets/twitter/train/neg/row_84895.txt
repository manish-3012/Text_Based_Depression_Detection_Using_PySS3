should i tell my parents about my suicide attempt?a little over a month ago, i tried to commit suicide and got very close, but i was shaking so much that i couldn't follow through with it and texted a friend out of sheer panic. he talked me out of it. it was extremely traumatizing but the next morning i went to school running on a very small amount of sleep and an extremely heavy weight on my shoulders. school was incredibly hard, but i somehow got through it.

i opened up to a few close friends over the course of the next few weeks, but i didn't tell my parents. 

i am wondering if i should tell them. i'm worried they might think i am lying or that i'm being dramatic, as that has been their reaction to this type of thing in the past. at the same time, i know that i really need help and i have to reach out to them to get it.

should i tell them?
