Just wish for peace.I'm slowly giving up again, it's at the low point of before. Realizing your peace is me gone. Feeling as though that my answer to getting peace. I'm just exhausted and tired of trying. Been alone all day ignoring my phone, thinking no one would even know. Not for days. No one would check up on me for a while. No one knows how badly I'm faking moving forward while on the inside screaming for help. I'll get up tomorrow and put on my best mask. Or maybe I'll let peace happen
