Running from the devilThe worse off I am mentally, the more I try to make progress in life. To take positive steps and try and fix myself. Major depression and constant ideation leading to therapists, hrt, coming out to friends &amp; family... an attempt leading to confiding in friends, psychs, antidepressants and more effort. More attempts, changing Drs, therapists, medications, coming out at work and presenting a more authentic me, scheduling surgeons...

All of this brings with it it's own additional types of stress and anxiety. I cried myself through April, feeling a step away from the edge. It feels like I've not stopped crying though, that I'm only running short of tears. Now I sit at work, listening to music to wrap myself in the comfort of my depression. Waiting to get home in the next few hours. To drink, curl up and just stop moving for the day.

A friend who dearly loves me wrote a poem about the day of my attempt. I so wish that I didn't make it, things would be so much better for everyone. I can't keep running at this pace.

&gt; ***Taste Like Christmas &amp; Death***  
Beautiful in Life  
Beautiful in Death  
Crumpled mess  
Attempt to escape  
A warm embrace  
A sudden shudder  
A painful tear  
Sorry, but not today my dear
