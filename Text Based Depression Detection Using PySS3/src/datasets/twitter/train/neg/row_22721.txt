I want to dieLife is exhausting, tedious, draining, unenjoyable, has no value or meaning, has no impact and is full of pain and discomfort. Why should I have to go on, why does no one help in a meaningful way? Is it because it's impossible to rectify these truths, I'd be better off if I didnt have to force myself to go throughte effort of living day to day and getting told to fuck off and do things when I clearly don't want to. Also Reddit is full of cunts.
