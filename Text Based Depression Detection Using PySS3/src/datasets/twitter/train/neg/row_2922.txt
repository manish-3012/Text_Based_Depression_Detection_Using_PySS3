So today when I posted this comment I relisead I'm in deep trouble.

A ton of bad decisions/procrastination and I see myself having to do the last year of highschool again while all my friends go to collegue (Everyone is some miles away).

The thoughts of loneliness are starting to gather and  my will to live is fadding faster than I though. Tomorrow is only the first day of school and I'm already deaftead knowing I will be completly alone.

I have been strugling with depression and anxiety for a long time due to some incidents on my childhood and my unability to talk to others.

I fear I won't be able to handle this whole year and I might end up choosing the easy way out.
