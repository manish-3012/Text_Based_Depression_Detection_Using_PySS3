DeathIâ€™ve just taken whatever medication Iâ€™ve got in the house, all of my epilepsy medication and my anti depressants and what ever paracetamol I have in the house.
Iâ€™ve had enough Iâ€™ve lost everything and feel like nothing helps
Iâ€™m going to try to sleep now hopefully everything works and I die sleeping, I feel weird and weightless, Iâ€™m going to sleep now
