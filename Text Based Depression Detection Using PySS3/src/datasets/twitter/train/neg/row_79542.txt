I'm sorryMy exe girlfriend tried to kill herself after I broke up with her. I wanted to end things because my mental state is really bad. I absolutely hate myself and believe she deserves so much better.   But it hurt her soo much. She tried to end her life and it was really bad. Her sister has let me know she's in the hospital now. 
I feel entirely awful. This is completely my fault.  In my efforts to avoid hurting her, I hurt her the most. I wish I wasn't alive. I wish I didn't exist. All I do is hurt people. I'm monster. 
I shouldn't have been with her. I wish I'd taken my life so long ago. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. 

Theres nothing I can say to her. Staying will only make things worse. She wouldn't be in this situation if she had never met me. 
I always ruin things. I've got a cuts on my arm and it's still not enough. Nothing will be enough for the things I've done. I shouldn't be here.
