my kid hates me, so why not suicide...i have a six year old that i love more than anything. today i realized that he doesnâ€™t love me, so iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s finally time to kill myself. 
his father &amp; i called it quits last year. we had been in an unhealthy relationship for many years &amp; i eventually cheated (or found someone i connected with online). causing the marriage to officially crumble.
we split, i moved &amp; things were ok for a while. now, thatâ€™s not the case. 
i lost the home i moved into in a natural disaster, lost my car, &amp; now feel like iâ€™ve lost my relationship with my child. i pick him up from school &amp; he is visibly upset. he wants his father. he tells me that he loves me but would rather be with his father. i try so hard to be a good parent, but i feel like there is no point. id probably be doing everyone a favor by just going away.
