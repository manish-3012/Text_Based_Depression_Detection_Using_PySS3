I used to be scared but now I'm too tired for fearI've always struggled with feelings of emptiness and lack of identity. I know I have a personality disorder that causes me to have incorrect emotions. I don't trust anyone, I hate everyone, and since I was small, even elementary school aged I've always wanted to die.

It's been passive for a long time, but these last few months have been the breaking point. I tried to die before, but I couldn't do it. I ended up getting help and pretending that it was just some mystery illness. But it's just too heavy now. 

I'm too scared to get a gun, I don't want to OD in case I survive and become addicted, so I'm doing the same thing I did last time. As long as I can be strong I can make it this time.  

I made sure that my cat will have somewhere to go if I can't take care of her anymore. She'll be with someone who I at least trust to take care of her.
