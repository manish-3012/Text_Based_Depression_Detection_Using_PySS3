im really scaredive posted a few times here already but im really at my wits end. i think i'll be going within a few days. but im just so scared of what will happen. i dont think i have a choice though, ive been waiting for years to feel better and it never happens. i just give up. im scared of what will happen to me but i know that it cant be worse than what ive been going through... right? i just really wish it never had to come to this. i wish i had something to hold on for... a big part of me hopes that there will be a next life or some sort of afterlife where i can exist without hurting. but this earth has no place for me. i c ant even articulate how much im hurting. im sorry
