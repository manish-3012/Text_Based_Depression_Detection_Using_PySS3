Woke up after passing out, I suck at even killing myselfSo about 30 minutes ago I tried to hang myself. I had done all of my research, thought I'd done everything right, but I still managed to fail at it like everything else in my life. After passing out I woke up in a panic not unlike that of waking up from a horrible nightmare, but far more intense. Im not sure for how long I was out, but it couldn't have been too too long. I felt panicky, shaky, and sick to my stomach and still feel that way. The inside of my lip is sore and swollen from I guess biting it really hard while unconscious. 

My long distance fiancÃ©e thinks I'm in finals right now, but the truth is that I haven't even gone to any of my finals this week and haven't studied for them at all. I can't stomach lying to her and know dying would break her heart more than anything else, but I'm just no good at being a functional mature member of society. 

I'm on academic probation at my school and will most certainly be kicked out of school for a year for failing to get my GPA up this semester. I was supposed to graduate this year, but I'll be lucky if that happens in 2018 at this rate. I'll be thrown off my parent's insurance in 2 years, and I just don't want to be alive anymore. I love my fiancÃ©e more than anything, but I've been a shitty partner to her for years and I just can't see myself ever being responsible enough and capable enough of taking care of both of us. I'm supposed to be flying to visit her in 3 days. She's been going through really hard times herself mental health wise and I want to help her, but how can I when I can't even take care of myself?

I don't know what the hell in trying to say, I just needed to get some shit off of my chest. :(
