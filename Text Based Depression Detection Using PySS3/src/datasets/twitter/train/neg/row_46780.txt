I just don't knowI don't know where to turn right now. I'm horribly depressed. Everything I do I stupid, wrong, or hurtful. I can usually see a light at the end of the tunnel, but all I see is blackness. It's beyond a cry for attention. I wish I could follow through but I'm too much of a puss and I'm afraid my family will find me. Fuck it. I don't see any other outcome. I don't see it getting all better this time
