I just feel so "done"I don't feel particularly emotional at the moment, I mostly just feel apathetic and worn out. 

I don't enjoy most things. I don't really like being around other people. I'm not really good at anything.

I can't afford therapy and medication or to travel or really do much of anything. 

Honestly, I think the only thing stopping me right now is my cats and my boyfriend has a really awesome trip planned that I don't want to ruin. I just don't know how long those motivations will keep me going if I keep feeling worse
