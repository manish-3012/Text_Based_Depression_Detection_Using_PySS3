Everything is going wrong. It just got even worse. I'm losing my FUCKING mind. I'm already going downhill and things just turned for the worst. My Internet went out and I have a paper to research for that I've been stressing out to do. I can't even thing of a topic for it. That is the least of problems actually. My friends that I did have broke it off with me today. I haven't slept in 2 days and to insure that I didn't fall asleep writing this paper that I can't do I drank a lot of coffee. This might sound stupid to you but I have all these crazy thoughts and I'm LOSING it. I don't know what to do. I can't fail this paper / have no friends / feel no happiness / not be loved / live anymore.
