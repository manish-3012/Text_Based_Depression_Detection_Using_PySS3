Tired of livingIt's as simple as it sounds. I am sick of life. My father fucking abandoned my mother and I. I don't have enough money to finish college. I can't get a job no matter how much I look for one. I can't get the girl I love to take me back. Wish I could just not fucking feel anything anymore. Could go into detail but I know people don't fucking care enough to read more than a couple lines of text. So yeah, I don't know how to feel better and I'm fucking tired of living.
