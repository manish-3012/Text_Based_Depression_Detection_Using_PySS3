Slowly pushing everyone away...I've always had good grades, talents, and friends, but recently i learned that i was born into a financial hole i wont be able to dig myself out of. In this depression I've pushed many friends and family away and my relationship with my parents is dwindling. Relationship wise i have and will always stay lonely. Everything feels cold, music, media, just living. My lack of motivation has made my summer complete garbage, and i keep thinking how easy it would be to slice an artery in my wrist with an xacto knife and just fade out. Now i feel dull and emotionless and I'm not sure how to pull myself out of this pit. Since all my friends have up and left my life i feel like i have Noone to ask about this.
