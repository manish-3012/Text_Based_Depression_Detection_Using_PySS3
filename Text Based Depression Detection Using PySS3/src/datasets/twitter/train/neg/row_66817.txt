Honestly, I tried.Well, time to come back here. I tried to survive, and I failed, I'm going to die very soon, barring any unwanted interruptions, everything should be done soon. I don't have anyone to really leave a message to, so I'll just leave it here. You guys that do stuff here, and help people, keep doing what you're doing. You're great people, and while I know you're not able to help everyone, any lives saved are worth it. I'll just count as one of the ones that slipped through the crack, although I wasn't exactly expecting any miracles anyway. I may be here for a tiny bit, before it's done, but not for long. Goodbye world, you've been a bitch to me, although some people are nice :)
