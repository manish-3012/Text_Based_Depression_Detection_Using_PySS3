I wish I could just throw myself in the trashI am dealing with a really bad bout of trauma reenactment from being abandonned by my father as a child. I don't know how to make it better, and what doesn't help is that my boyfriend is dealing with his own stress. His coping mechanism is hiding, and it triggers my rejection trauma. So then I lash out, it worsen his shame. So basically everyone has a bad time.

I just feel like my state gets worst and worst. The more I try to make myself available, the more exhausted and worthless I feel. I thought he could be great because he wanted to disclose our relationship. I was hesitant, but then I gave in to make him happy. Ever since then, I feel like he puts less and less effort in our relationship.

I feel terrible of saying that, but in a way I envy my two friends battling cancer right now. I wiah I had a way to escape my hurt and the one I cause others.
