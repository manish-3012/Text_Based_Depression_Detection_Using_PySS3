I wish I wasn't such a coward.Hey, so let's cut to the chase, I've attempted suicide multiple times and I was so fucking close to attempting it again right before my birthday.

I didn't want to have another one and there was something poetic on having your body found on your birthday, supposedly a happy occasion.


I wanted to so badly, but I didn't.



I so fucking wish I did.

I want to commit suicide so. fucking. much.

For so many reasons, but I'm tired.
