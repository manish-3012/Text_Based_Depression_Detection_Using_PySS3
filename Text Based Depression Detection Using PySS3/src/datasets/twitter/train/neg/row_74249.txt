I'm not a good person and I can't do anything good.I'm a stupid autistic fuck and the only good thing I've done is date a girl, and stop her from cutting herself. I don't want to live in this world anymore, because no one wants me except my parents. I'm also an alcholic, two D.U.I's at 19 and a attempted poss of meth. I won't be able to have a decent job until I'm 27, and I'm nobody. I don't work, my parents support me in everything but it's best I just drop dead, because I'm no one and I'm nothing. I know my girlfriend is just waiting for an excuse to dump me, and I just lost four friends yesterday. Best I fucking end this miserable excuse of a fucking life before I get anyone else hopes up I'm a pretty cool guy. I'm going to keep drinking and see where my thoughts go, but if she breaks up with me I'll probably fucking kill myself, because long distance is hell and I don't want to live anyway.
