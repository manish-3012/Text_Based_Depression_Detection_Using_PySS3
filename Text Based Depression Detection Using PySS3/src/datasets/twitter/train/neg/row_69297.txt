I requested time off tomorrowI donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do tomorrow. All I know is I shouldnâ€™t go esp when I feel suicidal. I work in a daycare so my attitude affects the atmosphere of the classroom. I have to be positive, patient, sweet and nurturing which I truly enjoy doing but how am I supposed to do those things when Iâ€™m feeling suicidal tonight. Itâ€™s at an all time high. I shouldnâ€™t be around kids tomorrow
