I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m feeling like this again.Long story short Iâ€™ve been put on antidepressants and i was feeling better. But tonight itâ€™s all gone to hell. I have Conversion disorder aka FND a neurological condition and thatâ€™s what I originally got the medication for but it helped me too. I wasnâ€™t awful but I wasnâ€™t right. Then I was and now Iâ€™m back to self harming and the impending need to kill myself. I just need it to be over. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ll get better, I just feel like the worlds ending and that Iâ€™m worthless again. Iâ€™m a piece of shit and idk what to do to get me through the night. I canâ€™t deal with this again. I canâ€™t go through it again and I donâ€™t know what to do.
