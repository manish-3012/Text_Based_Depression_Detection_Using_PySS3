Being so ruthlessly bullied has made me want to end it all. I'm an adult.I'm a transgender man and I'm in my 20's. Lately, I've had to deal with bullies in a group of people I know. I'm so tired of it, I just want to end my life and end the pain deep inside my heart and soul. It's hard enough not to deal with family that is unaccepting of my trans identity.

I also deal with verbal assault from family a lot. My mom, the only accepting person in my life, is also lgbt and dealt with the same treatment.

I've lost my haven, my safe space, and my only good friends left me because they decided to act like sheep following the ringleader.

I can't handle this anymore; I can't handle fear anymore or emotionally aching. I just want it all to end. Bullying in our own community is another pathetic reason why so many of us die.

Please be kind to each other. If I go, I hope my mom gets my heart, as she may need it soon.
