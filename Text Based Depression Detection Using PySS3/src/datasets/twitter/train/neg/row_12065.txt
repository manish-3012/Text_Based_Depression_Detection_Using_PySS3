How can I be hospitalized?I lost my job and I'm so fucking depressed. I can't even function. I can't do anything my husband asks, literally nothing. I can't even mail something, go grocery shopping, vacuum. All I want to do is sleep and just....fucking die. I haven't cleaned the catbox in a week because I just can't bring myself to get up and do it. 

I want to die, but I don't want to go through with it. I know my family would be devastated. My husband is so down and sad with how our relationship is right now and it kills me. He doesn't blame me, but just taking care of me is really bringing him down. I feel like a terrible wife. Fuck, I literally can't even make sure my husband is happy by going to the FUCKING GROCERY STORE TO GET FOOD. 

I just want to escape everything. Bills, responsibility, applying for jobs, thinking about letting my husband down....

I can't. I just can't.
