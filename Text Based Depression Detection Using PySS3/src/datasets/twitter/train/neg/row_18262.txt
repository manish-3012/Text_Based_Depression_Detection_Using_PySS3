Am I depressed or do I just want attentionHas anyone struggled with the fact of WHY they want to kill themselves or feel this pain? I currently wish Iâ€™d rather be dead. That way I didnâ€™t have to live the life I feel like is miserable. The reason I canâ€™t do it is because I feel like deep down I just want people to notice me by being dead and I feel like thatâ€™s just wanting attention. I donâ€™t know if that makes sense or anyone can relate. I am a very prideful person in nature. But I just wish for fucks sake I was dead because no one notices me. Even though Iâ€™m there when they need me or when they are down. No one is there deep down when I need them. I feel like if I was dead everyone would finally realize my pain was real.
