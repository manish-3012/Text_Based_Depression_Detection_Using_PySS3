Teenager going through a struggling timeIâ€™m so ashamed of posting here. Iâ€™m so upset but at the same time Iâ€™m forcing myself to because I know I need to talk and get further help. I know I need to be honest about this and how I feel to get better. People will look at this account and not only see a typical guy just enjoying life, they will see they also were dealing with serious issues and inching closer to a pathetic and cowardly choice. 

This was a last resort/place to talk in a comfortable and anonymous sort of way. 

I am a 17 year old male, dealing with depression since age 14 after my Uncle passed. I never been afraid to share that. I mentioned it in comments here on Reddit. But all the details are something I keep bottled up. It was a whole year until I got help and even though I am currently going through help processes right now, there have been phases of weeks where the depression comes back as bad or even worse as before. I think I might be gong through one of those phases. 

I slowly felt it coming and posted in the off my chests subreddit a few days ago. The only person who responded definitely gave me good advice and helped calm me down a little. Thank that person so much for taking.Their time out to help. 

But even still it just seems worse and worse and Iâ€™m becoming more scared of getting to a point of suicide. I canâ€™t ever stop thinking about how people would react or if they would care. I feel like a lot of people wouldnâ€™t. Plus Iâ€™m so young I hardly have had an impact on the world. So me leaving would matter much anyway. Would it?

Iâ€™m just  scared and wish this would end.
