Ending everyone's burdenSomehow...  

I've been a failure all my life, 22 and still in High School.  

Everything I do is wrong to my family, my boss, my teachers and friends, constantly used as a punching bag and a vent for their anger.  

I feel like ending it all because everyone would be so much better off without me.
