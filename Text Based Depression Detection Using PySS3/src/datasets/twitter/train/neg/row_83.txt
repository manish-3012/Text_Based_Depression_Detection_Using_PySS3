I just donâ€™t even know anymoreThis is the first time Ive felt this way since I started antidepressants but I think this is the last straw. Iâ€™ve been sitting here at rock bottom for a while now people tell me to keep going and Iâ€™ve tried but things just havenâ€™t really gotten better. I havenâ€™t even found something that I like doing and am good at and I put a lot of false hope into many things and am just disappointed in the end. I donâ€™t even think I know myself anymore and at this point Iâ€™m really considering suicide.
