I need advice on whether to share my attempts with my therapist and/or family
CW: slight tr//ma mention ( just the word ), s//cide attempts, disordered eating, mention of self harm.

To put it into context:
I'm part of a system, if this is confusing think of dissociative identity disorder ( DID ) or Otherwise specified dissociative disorder (OSDD) which are essentially disorders in which trauma causes the personality of a person to split into multiple people, each real and valid. (multiple personality disorder, although the term is outdated most people don't know the term dissociative identity disorder or otherwise specified dissociative disorder, one of which I have ).

I'm very mentally unstable I'd say, I try not to eat when I'm fronting ( on control of the body ) and exercise excessively lots, I also excercise lots or try and make myself sick because I'm terrified of getting more overweight. I also recently tried to kill myself multiple times the other day including having pills in my mouth but I physically couldn't swallow, I was trying to but nothing was going down so I had to spit then out.

Honestly I think I'd be safer in a psych ward but because I'm not the only person in my head it's really complex and I feel I'm not as important as singular people who have the same issues. It also feels unfair because I can't starve myself if someone else is in control and eats. 

Anyone know if I should tell people or keep it secret that I tried to kill myself? It's a really weird situation with the system n all. My parents would probably look at me much differently if I told them again
They know I self harm a lot but they don't know all this.
I genuinely think it would just be easier to kill myself instead of trying to fix this.
