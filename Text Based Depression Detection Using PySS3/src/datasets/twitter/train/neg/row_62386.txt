Thinking about it more and more lately.Iâ€™ve been trying to fight with myself. My life is a mess but I always tell myself it could be worse and my issues arenâ€™t the worst in the world. But what is worse than finding out that youâ€™re expecting a child when itâ€™s far too late? I have a lot to live for but I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m worthy to live for it. I would never wish bad upon people. But I need to read about others going through life issues too. Not to compare but just to know that Iâ€™m not alone. I know sh*t happens to everyone. I think I need therapy. Sorry Iâ€™m rambling. I just have been feeling like ending life would be easier for me.
