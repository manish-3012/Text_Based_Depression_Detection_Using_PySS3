i hate being borderlineI'm sick of this. I have been feeling really manic but then in depressed af. I cut myself two days ago and I haven't done that in like a year or so. alcohol is my main issue because it has made me do so much crazy shit. I dropped out of collage a few months ago, I haven't done anything since then, not working. I never want to work really. the idea of it makes me uncomfortable and scared. I hooked up with my ex on the weekend and she was seeing other girl and I felt like shit, wanted to leave, was too drunk to ride my bike and returned. we spent like the whole weekend together and now she's talking to me again. she makes me feel so sad really, she's 8 older and so happy. I think she likes me because she brings herself up with my horrid self. I really want to die, I want to try killing myself again but I wanna make sure I don't fail. I've tried therapy, exercise, getting closer to my friends but nah. I keep on thinking of all the bulls I've done and have been done to me. I have a few money saved and want to travel somewhere inside my country and commit suicide there. I don't want anyone to find me.
