Getting Closer All the TimeI may not be as depressed as I used to be, but I feel like that means I'm more able to go through with it. The exhaustion almost acts like a safety barrier. All of my thoughts get more vivid as time goes on. The coldness of the waves pulling me under, the sickly warmth of blood draining from my arteries. I can feel the visions get more real until they'll eventually blur into reality and consume my existence. It's only a matter of time. All it will take is patience.
