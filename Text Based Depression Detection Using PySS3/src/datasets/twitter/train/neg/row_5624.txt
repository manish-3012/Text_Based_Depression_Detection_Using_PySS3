I see no point in going onI don't know what I think sucks more. My dogshit life or actually going through with suicide. The only thing preventing me ending it right now is fear of the unknown. I'm scared of death but life hurts more. This is the first time I've ever REALLY considered suicide and I just don't even feel sad about the fact that I'm so deeply hurt.
