Give me a reason not to.I've subscribed to the nihilistic idea that my life is meaningless. I don't have the ability to give it meaning because I'm too depressed to care. I have no desire to rise to life's challenges anymore. It's all. Literally. Pointless. I accept that death happens. One minute you're here, and then you're not. Life is unnecessary, especially when you have to go through it with low self esteem and anxiety. There's nothing to be proud of in enduring it, because afterwards, you're just fucking dead. There is no reward. Ironically, I believe in God and heaven. I don't believe he would care if I took my life. He'd accept me. So every little damn reason anyone stays alive for is invalid to me. Can you offer me ONE good reason to keep going?
