I wish I could remove my emotionsI care so much about people that it's painful. I want to kill myself, but I also don't. I wish that some sort of incident would happen to me so that I would die. But I know it won't happen. My life is as bland as a bowl of corn flakes, and I live in a very protective environment. My parents want me to live, though, doesn't that seem greedy? I'm in pain, but they still want me to live. Why do humans try so hard to keep life going even though it is painful?
