Yup, life is a certified cuntsackImma make this short, I'm 13 and yeah puberty helps with the fact of depression, but listen to this, this may not be as bad as all of you other poor souls that I hope to console and show love, but I am currently in a group home and was in foster care for 2 years now, was homeless for another 2 and my parents need to get an rv before the 6th of august, or I'm pretty fucked and am splattering my brains, if anyone knows anything about an rv that sleeps 6 for 7k, hit me up
