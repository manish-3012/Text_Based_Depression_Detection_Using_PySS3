I'm not only becoming a danger to myself but to others.I have had depression for a year now and I refuse to see therapy anymore and now I just keep it to myself. I'm rather good at hiding it now. Only problem is I've gone from wanting self harm to harming other people or breaking things. The other day I completely trashed a public bathroom. I knocked the soap dispenser off the wall, broke the mirror and opened up the back of the toilet grabbed the porcelain lid and smashed it. I know what I did was wrong but do you think I have something other than depression? I didn't think it could lead to violence like this. I'm going to go back on my medication and talk to someone because as soon as I stopped this started :(
