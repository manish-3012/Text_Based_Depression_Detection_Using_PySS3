Venting mainly but stillSo thoguht life was maybe going better about to be done wtih school job prospects.. and nothing.. had an awesome interview 2 weeks ago. Was hoping to finally a dream job and it was just perfect.. close by home easy to do deal with kids wife and her job and school.. and havnent heard anything back. Granted its a company that works for the government so could be a bit but just bleh probably passed over yet again. I know people in the IT world who never went to college that can get jobs without an issue. I have 60+ hours of completed course work plus 20 years of experience and I cant get even get my foot beyond an interview? WTF is wrong with me ? This job would have changed so much for our family.. but of course because it would make me happy it probably wont be happening. Fuck me. Fuck me. Gettting depressed waiting to hear back. Was a long interview like 2 hours we got along talked alot figured it went well.. but probably found someone better as usual. My luck.
