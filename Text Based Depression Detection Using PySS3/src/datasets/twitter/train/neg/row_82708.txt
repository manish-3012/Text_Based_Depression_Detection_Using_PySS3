tiredi canâ€™t help but feel so low when i have never had a true friend, i have completely messed up my life by leaving traditional education behind. i feel like im alone and im so scared of the future. most days i feel that i can do it and i canâ€™t get through it and its been this way for almost 7 years. im so tired of feeling this way. feeling like people donâ€™t like me and that i will never belong. i always try to remind myself that killing myself wont help the situation and i could miss out on things but i have so much fear of the future that most of the time i donâ€™t want to live to see. i always try to remind myself that i will be okay and that i can get through this but somedays are more difficult than others
