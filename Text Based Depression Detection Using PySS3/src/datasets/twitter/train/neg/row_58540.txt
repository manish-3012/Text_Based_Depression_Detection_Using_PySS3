Why is a divine plan supoosed be comforting?Nothing guarantees that if there's a God with a divine plan that their plan will benefit us in any way. Hell, just look at everything everyone in this sub goes through, what omnibenevolent God would create a world where people likr us exist?

For all we know our existence could just be a byproduct of whatever God is actually working on and we're too far below their notice for them to do anything about us.
