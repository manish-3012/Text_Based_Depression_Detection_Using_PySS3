I feel like a big hypocrite, all the time.It's not that I don't mean what I preach about, I truly mean it. Suicide isn't the answer and we can all get better. We can all see beautiful things and have moments in our lives that whisper in the back of our heads over the screams of our pain "you can make it". It's a faint whisper, almost non-audible but it's always there. Even in the direst situation, it's always there to tell us that there will be something worth to live for someday.

I truly mean everything that I tell people. I just can't help but feel like I'm a "lie" because I don't think none of that applies to me. It just feels so lonely and painful. I wish I could use my own advice and apply to my life but I can't... I just wish I wouldn't have been born at all so all this pain would never even be real. You know, if I kill myself... when I kill myself, I will die along with the pain. It won't vanish, I will just disappear along with it. That's why I just wish I wouldn't have been born. I don't wanna give up but I have been fighting for too long for something that doesn't exist.
