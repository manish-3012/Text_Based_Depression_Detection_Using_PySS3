Help bad therapy recoveryI can't stop thinking about my previous therapist even though I'm seeing a new person now... The second to last session he asked me "do you expect me to fall on my knees for you?" Because I told him it seemed like he didn't care. I am so worried I expect way too much from people and it's part of the reason I don't want to live any more - like I will never get the type of support or empathy I really want and so willl always feel empty.
