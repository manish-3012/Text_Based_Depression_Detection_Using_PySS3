Fuck this.I'm so tired of living and existing.

I'm not depressed, and have never suffered from depression. I'm just fed up. I am fucking sick of being told to consider other people's bad situations to make myself "thankful" for the pointless, meaningless life I live. I never fucking asked to be born.

I am suffering *every fucking second* of knowing that I exist. It hurts to breathe and blink. I'm fucking tired of trying to play this stupid game of living up to society's expectations so that I wouldn't feel bad about myself. I don't want to go to college or get a career or make lots of money or even get married or have sex. All of this bullshit is just a man-made scheme to delude the primates of "humankind" into thinking their time on this shithole has meaning. What the fuck am I supposed to do after all that? Eat ice cream? Go to the movies? Read books? Find someone who will let me ejaculate on their breasts? Lease a luxury car? Invest in the stock Market? Again, all of this bullshit is just some more distraction that I no longer want to take part of. And none of it will matter if I suffer brain damage or die. I'm going to be forgotten in the next few decades anyway. I've stopped all contact with my family just because I'm tired of them not seeing my point.

I'm only 20 now and I'm just done. I'm not sad. I'm just tired. I'm fed up with life. I never asked to be a part of this pointless, meaningless game. Even if I "wait it out," I'm eventually going to slowly turn into a useless piece of shit when I age. Why should I have to go through that and be lied to about it being a sign of victory?
