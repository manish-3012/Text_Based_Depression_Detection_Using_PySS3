Happy Fword yearYesterday I got to know my wife has an affair. And now I'm reading a book about doors history on architecture while sipping whiskey cause I need something to distract me. And the book is actually boring. I can't even properly suicide. Why? Because I just send my 7y kid to bed and I don't know when my wife will return from party I was not even offered to participate. Meh just 1st world problems, will read till whiskey switch me off.
Anyway I have a plan and a place to make it happen, just need to wait till my mother dies, I don't really want her to suffer any pain. The kid is the other story, but I can make it hate me. But it's a long journey till that happens, more time for me to suffer. The good thing is that I see no one to be blamed than me. As you could notice my English is way to bad for conclusion I have in mind to share. But I really need this writing to post as I have no one to share my feelings, except a cat, but he is stupid anyway. So taping on phone screen is best way. I can't even cry loud till kid actually sleeps. If anyone would tell me that life would suck so much I wouldn't even start.
By the way, 8y ago I was living with another woman had an affair too. So it's either bad luck/carma or I'm doing something terribly wrong.
I really would like to end this game. Just can't. I noticed I started cross a street with less fear. I care not about my safety at all... I must end this writing... As barely can see through tears. Happy new year all.
