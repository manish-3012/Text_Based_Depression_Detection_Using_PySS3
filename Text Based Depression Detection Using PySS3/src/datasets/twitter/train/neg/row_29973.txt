Iâ€™m always aloneI have a lump in my throat and I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m ever going to escape these thoughts. I thought once I shared my struggles with family and friends people would be more understanding and sympathetic. Everyone has just distanced themselves and I no longer have friends or strong relationships with my family. Iâ€™m constantly filled with sorrow for the loss of who I used to be and I donâ€™t feel any hope or direction for who I can be. It feels like everything has been crumbling and fleeting from me for years. Even when I try to be hopeful and put in the work to better my mental health. I feel stuck and I feel empty no matter the therapy or medication. I just want to go to bed one night and never wake up. I cry and scream pleading to die because some days this pain is just too much. I donâ€™t know how to get better at this point. My life feels more meaningless since Iâ€™ve opened about these struggles. I donâ€™t understand how people can leave someone in such a vulnerable state. I feel worthless and I am starting to believe that I am. Itâ€™s been almost 5 years and I donâ€™t see an end to this pain. Itâ€™s so hard to stay optimistic.
