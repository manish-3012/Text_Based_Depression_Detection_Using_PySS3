maybe now is the time.Ive been dealing with depression for a long time now, since age 13.  I am 26 years old and have attempted suicide once as a teenager. I moved states away to try to start a new life and make myself happy, but that did not work.  I feel like it only made my depression worse.  Now I am living with my parents back home, I have told my parents about my suicidal thoughts.  The first time I brought it back up to them was a couple months ago my mother cried to me and told me she loved me no matter what, and she would be here for me always.  But today, I brought it up to her again and she didnt seem to care.  I called out of work because I just cant anymore.  I dont want to do anything. I dont want to work or pay bills or go to college again.  I dont want to live. I told her i called out of work because i cant do this anymore and she got mad because i called out of work not caring at all that im speaking out to her about attempting suicide again.  I am the only child and I used to think that my suicide would hurt my family but i honestly just feel like a fucking burden now.  I could easily do it my parents both owns guns and arent home a lot, so many opportunities. I dont even know why im wasting my time writing this on fucking reddit lol I guess i just wish my life could be different, that i could have been better and didnt have to have these feelings and could have been happy? thats what holds me back from actually continuing with my actions but i feel like my days of thinking there is a possibility of changing my life  is slimming down. and i  just know im going to attempt again soon.
