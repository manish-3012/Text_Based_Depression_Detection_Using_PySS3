Ready for the pain to stopAs I wake up to take on the day, I have already  cried in the shower, beat myself up, cursed God for my existence and contemplated suicide. 
The days are getting harder, I have given up on my religion but can't tell anyone that because my family is very religious. I have stared in the mirror this morning, I hate my body, my brain and my life.
That tool in my bedside drawer is looking ever so sweet today!
