I feel like if I killed myself, the only people whose lives would worsened would be my mom and grandma's. Not my friends, not my wife, no one else.I'm literally all my mom has so I feel like I could never do that to her, so honestly she's like 80% of the reason I haven't killed myself. She gave up her life so I could have a good life so I can't waste her sacrifice.

But aside from that, death just feels soâ€¦peaceful.

Sure my wife and friends would be sad, and every year they'd remember me. My wife and I are separated on what I thought were amicable terms but I've come to the realization that it's a lie I've been telling myself. I feel like such a fool.

I don't expect their lives to come to a faltering stop, and it wouldn't be my intention to make them feel guilty, but honestly I want to die.

I live a comfortable life. Just got a huge promotion at work. But it just all feels so meaningless.

I live next to the traintracks. All my friends are asleep; it wouldn't even disturb their sleep.

Maybe I'll go for a walk.
