Seeing family for the first time in years[first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7kh8cu/abused_boy_forgotten_son_30_years_old_and_almost/)

Iâ€™m home for the first time in years. Or at least my parents home. The house I grew up was sold many years ago.

As I sit here surrounded by my loving family I feel alone. 

Six nieces and nephews, two sisters and their husbands. 

They all say they love me. 

They do. 

I love them too. 

Intellectually at least. 

But I feel like a stranger. 

When they say I love you it just makes me feel more isolated. 

The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because of my dog. 

I used to think that if I killed myself it would crush my mother.

But my mind is fracturing still. 

I no longer feel like part of the family. 

I donâ€™t feel love or guilt. 

I miss my dog ( a friend is watching him while Iâ€™m away) 

Hopefully this darkness will pass. 

Because In this moment all I want to do is kill myself. 

All I want is the pain to end.
