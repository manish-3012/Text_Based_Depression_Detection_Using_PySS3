I cut my own face and now I will never ever be able to leave my house. I will never get past this shame written on my face. I have bought drugs to kill myself with because of this. Please help.I am male. I am so ashamed. I don't know what I was thinking. I cut my face because I hated it and now I hate it even more. 

I have only been in public two times in several months because of these scars, each time has been hell. They are visible and everyone knows I made them. I look ridiculous and pathetic. I can't look people in the eye.

I see absolutely no way out of this. I tried fractional laser on one of them but it didn't work. One cut is so deep I think I cut a nerve because my smile is more crooked now and I can't blink properly.

As I see it there's only two ways out for me. Either I get rid of the scars and damage, or I kill myself. But at the same time I don't want to die. help..
