I just want to die.I just had my 27th birthday and I have come to the realization that I am only getting older and nothing seems to be getting better. I have been struggling to get my life on track but no matter how hard I try, things continue to get worse. 

I woke up at 1AM and couldn't go back to sleep for over an hour thinking about how miserable I am. 1 being the worst and 10 being the best, I've said I am about at a 2 or 3. The only way it could get worse is my parents dying which I would easily take my life if that happened right now. I am struggling financially which has affected my depression because I would like to get help but you have to have money to get help. Self help books and these kinds of things are my only options which aren't face-to-face meetings with a certified individual who can listen to my issues and help me get past all of my issues. I have been trying for so long to find a new job but I haven't found anything. I went to college, got my bachelors, and have been busting my ass to find something decent.

Even the things I have in life that normally keep me happy have made me miserable (my hobbies, my fiance, my job). The stress and depression has taken a toll on my physical well-being. My body feels like a lump of flesh being held up by the little bit of will I have left to live. I just don't know how much more I can take. 

I genuinely want to die but I am too much of a coward to actually kill myself. If I got in a car accident and my car caught fire and I could easily escape, I would rather sit and burn alive in the car at this point.
