I'm so done with thisHow many times do I have to hit the bottom before I'm allowed to stop giving a shit about the feelings of the people I'd be leaving behind? Like, I'm 22 and I've felt this way since I was ten years old. Fucking 10. Every time I feel I have it managed it just comes back and hits me harder. I'm so exhausted. I just want to be done. I want out. If I had a gun I'd already be dead.
