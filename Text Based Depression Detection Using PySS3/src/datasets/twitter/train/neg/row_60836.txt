i almost called 911 on myselfi almost called 911 on myself because i was scared, i know i wonâ€™t do anything because i would never want to hurt my friends and family so much but i was so scared at how i was feeling. i hadnâ€™t felt that way since i was in middle school when i was literally on my way to the bathroom to scarf down all the pills i could find but realized while walking down the stairs that people actually cared about me. but i felt that exact same way and it was terrifying. i eventually calmed down after crying my eyes out and decided i would rather not waste resources that could be sued for someone else that was more likely do it. it just hurts, knowing that your family looks down on you and thinks you canâ€™t do anything right while also willing to do anything to just not feel the things youâ€™re feeling.
