I can't conceive that it will get betterLooking from the outside my life might seem pretty good but I am constantly worrying about the future. A couple of years ago I started a business with two friends and I have never been more anxious and worried that I made a huge mistake.

I risked everything my wife and I had worked for the last 15 years. I just don't think I can keep doing this. I feel like everybody would be better off if I was just gone. I feel like such a failure and I'm letting everybody down.

I just want this endless merry go round to end.
