my dayfirst i went to a bridge. tried to jump off of it. then got back it my car. then i cried for 30 minutes then i thought about how iâ€™m worthless and unworthy of love. then i thought about how within two weeks she went from calling me her future husband to saying that her new boyfriend â€œfinally made her truly happyâ€

then i went back up on the bridge and tried to jump off again. then someone honked at me so i ran away. then i drove home and tried to swerve into trees but got to scared and swerved out of the way at the last moment. i did this several times.

then i went inside and hung myself from my door. then i stopped. then i hung myself again. then i stopped.

then i wont downstairs and pretended like it was a completely normal day.
