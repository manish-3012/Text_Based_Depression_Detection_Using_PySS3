I have contemplated suicide the past monthThis past month was very hard for me. I found out that I had a rare condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia which has made my hormones go crazy. I have felt depressed and neglected at times. Done things I usually donâ€™t do and I lack so much motivation. I have been suffering with depression for two years but this year it has gotten really baD (hormonal) Recently I have been going through an identity crisis and I tried to make a few friends. Long story short It didnâ€™t work out and I felt very horrible. Tonight I had an episode where I cried for hours and even had suicidal thoughts about how fucked my life has been lately. Iâ€™m ok now and Iâ€™m with my grandparents who are up and sleeping in the guest room with me. Iâ€™m up now and I still feel the rush of anxiety that I felt a few hours ago but itâ€™s getting better. I just wanna let anyone who may be reading this know that you are so wanted and so loved. This is not a fun time for me and you are not alone. Anyone who needs a friend or someone to talk to, I am here for you and I would be so happy to talk, guide and even help the best I can.I hope we all take the chance to realize that suicide needs to be taken seriously.
