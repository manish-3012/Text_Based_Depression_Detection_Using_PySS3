I'm losing my job and feel suicidalI'm losing my job because my manager believes I have given poor performance. I want to end it all now with xanax and alcohol, or maybe tonight holding my wife. One thing that's hold me back is that my wife needs me (we need each other). I don't think I'll find another job that pays this much any time soon (about $65K with good benefits).

I can't even go to my job right now because the very thought of it makes me want to die. I can't stand it.
