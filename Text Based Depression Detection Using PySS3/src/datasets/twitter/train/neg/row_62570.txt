I'm just exhaustedI love my wife more than anything in the entire world.  But I'm just so tired.  Everything is a catastrophe to her.  And I get it.  The recent few months have been rough.  But it seems like no matter what I do I can't seem to make her feel better or even do anything right.  Every little mistake is somehow my fault or it gets taken out on me.  Some files we needed recently were lost because my computer crashed and she's screaming at me right now that I'm a let down.  I don't know how much longer I can do this.  I work 40+ hours a week, I go to school, I spend 10+ hours a week in the gym... all to provide for her, to get an education to get a better job to take better care of her, and to be more attractive for her... I follow her around everywhere while she's working so I can help her... I do most of the cleaning... Honestly... I feel like I'm doing everything and not only do I not get appreciation... I feel like I'm constantly defending myself from her criticism and being told how disappointing I am. 

EDIT:  Now she's screaming at me that she's upset and nothing I'm doing is helping.  I'm trying as hard as I can.  I've been stressed out of my mind nonstop for months.
