it's nearly time.Over a half-decade ago, at 12 years old, I made a promise to my future self to commit suicide if life had not improved by a certain point in time. Well, the premeditated date (my date of expiration, if you will) is now fast approaching, and with it comes a most peculiar sense of comfort.


My problems are not unlike those of other persons in this subreddit; broken family, childhood abuse, untreated mental illness, complete lack of friends, unattractiveness, drug abuse, expectations I failed to live up to, failed relationships, suffering academic performance, lack of direction in life, etc. 


But, these problems are not the focus of this thread, and as such they deserve no more than a passing mention. I disconnect from it all and instead look forward to my impending date of release.


I'm unsure where I am going with this thread, but I feel that my decision to wait years into the future to truly consider something as permanent as suicide was very, very reasonable. Now that the allotted time has nearly passed (so little of it remains that I would need a miracle to pick me up at this point) and I have drastically failed to better myself and my quality of life (believe me, I tried), I can see that suicide is quite likely the best option for me. 


I feel that I have made peace with it all, and I welcome the time when I can finally cease to exist. Please wish me luck.
