I don't want to do anything.I don't want to seize the day. I don't want to work a shitty job. I don't want to travel. I don't want to meet people. I don't want to get into a relationship. I don't want to have sex. I don't want to find a hobby. I don't want to take medication. I don't want to go to college. I don't want to take my own life. That shit hurts. 

So what do I do? Because at this rate I'm seriously reconsidering that last option. Least it'd take care of the rest.
