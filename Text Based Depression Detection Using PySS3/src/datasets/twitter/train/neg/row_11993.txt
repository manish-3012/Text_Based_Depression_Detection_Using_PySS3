My value in life... is zero.Zero.

I cannot handle small issues.

Right now, I am in a coffee shop. I am the only one who is single.

You know what. It is not getting better. I am writing here everyday.

I started to write everyday.

I cannot wake up for the work in time, because I am reading this subreddit until 4 am.

When I am fired, I am going to suicide.
