I am even worseI posted here last night: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/38he81/i_will_never_know_what_love_is_like/  and I have to thank some of you for trying to help but I feel as though I'm slipping further and further into the pit of despair I'm afraid of

I have a lot of sleeping pills on my dresser right now and the temptation is getting harder and harder to resist.

I don't know what I expect. I just need someone.
