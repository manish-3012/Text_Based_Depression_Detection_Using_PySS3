Lost a coworker this week, just want to chat. He was an amazing guy.We knew he had problems but there was only so much we could do, you can't chain him to a bed.  He was a really nice person, like give you food before he ate kind of guy. I was filling in for him for the last year and a half.  He was a really great person and I'm sure he was becoming a great father.  It's really an odd subject and I don't get to type it out publicly often (even talking about it publicly has caused problems, my one neighbour called him a coward and I was done, I broke down), I found this sub reddit. He was a person, he mattered.

If you have any issues search anywhere, everywhere, talk here if you have too, that's why I'm here now.
