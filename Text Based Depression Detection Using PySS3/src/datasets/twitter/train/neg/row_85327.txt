Question about lethal alcohol consumption. Today is the 5th anniversary of my aunt's suicide. Tomorrow is my birthday. Anyway, I got really depressed and chugged an entire bottle of pinot noir, and I'm afraid that once it kicks in , I may be subject to alcohol poisoning. Should I vomit, or will I be okay?
