I just.. existThat's it. I exist. I wake up, go to work, come home and go to bed. 

I've had severe anxiety/depression since school days, and very introverted/socially awkward as a result. I've only ever managed to make a couple of friends in my life-time and ended up annoying them to the point they basically told me to fuck off. 

This is hard to admit, but I think I'm actually afraid of people. I have an extremely hard time letting anyone close, and am constantly trying to hide any emotions in case it's the "wrong" way to react in a situation. 

Anyway, to the point.. lately I've been having thoughts of suicide on a daily basis. I've attempted (once) to call the hotline, but as I've mentioned in another topic, the operator just hung up on me.  I've made a couple of plans, but they're still just sort far-off things. 

I'm not entirely sure what I think will happen having put this out here, just wanted to vent a little I guess.
