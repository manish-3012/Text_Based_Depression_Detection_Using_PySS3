I feel unbearably lonelyHello, well I've been depressed since sophomore year (October of 2011), I've attempted suicide at least three times, and was admitted to a psych institute February of 2012.
 I started feeling better, but around the start of junior year I started to feel horrible again (also, my bf went back out with his ex girlfriend so that contributed to the depression). I was raped in October, and my parents found out, so I got even sadder. My boyfriend and I got back together, which made things better for a little while. But he never seems to care about whenever I'm feeling sad or suicidal. 
  Whenever he's sad I do whatever I can to help. But if I'm crying or feeling hopeless, he brushes it off. So most of the time I just keep my feelings to myself.
   Anyway, it's on a daily basis that I find myself on the ground, bawling, nearly hyperventilating from crying so much. I have literally no one to talk to about how I feel. I don't cut anymore, but I hit myself to feel some sort of relief. My parents won't put me on antidepressants, and my therapist doesn't help. I'm constantly fantasizing about my suicide. I find comfort in planning it out in my head, and I'm also comforted by the fact that I could kill myself whenever I feel the need to. 
   I know I'm young, I know I have life ahead of me, but I can't take daily breakdowns much longer. It's becoming unbearable, and I just feel physically exhausted from living. 
  I'm not even completely sure why I posted here. I guess because I used to find comfort in posting here (old account) and I even made a friend once. 
   I'm sorry for all of the text, I just needed a way to clear my head.
