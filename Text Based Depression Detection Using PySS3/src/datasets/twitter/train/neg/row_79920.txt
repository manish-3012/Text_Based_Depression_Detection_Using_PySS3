.I think my best coarse of action since I canâ€™t do it even when Iâ€™m drunk is just tripping and driving off a cliff. Idk why but every time the past few times Iâ€™ve tripped  Iâ€™ve thought very deeply about ending my life and I wasnâ€™t afraid of it either. So I think Iâ€™m just going to take two tabs and then drive off of a mountain. I just wish things got better :( my family will be sad. Iâ€™ve been watching videos of mothers who lost their sons to suicide. These videos really are a good tool if you want to prevent someone from doing it, but idk
