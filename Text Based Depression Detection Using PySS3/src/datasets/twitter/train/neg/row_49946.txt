Iâ€™m so sad, I just want somebody to hold me in a purely loving way...I feel so worn out and having self harm urges but I promised my therapist I wouldnâ€™t cut. Nothing is getting better, the loneliness is just getting worse and worse, I wish there was something to save me but there is nothing. I love my therapist but she canâ€™t take the pain away. The people who abused me, the scars they left behind, she canâ€™t fix those. She canâ€™t promise to me that no person would ever hurt me again, that I never have to feel unsafe or abandoned or in fear again. And that wouldnâ€™t be fair. Itâ€™s not fair for one person to be expected to fix everything. Itâ€™s not fair to expect meds to fix everything. Itâ€™s not even fair to expect people to fix it. Because nobody can fix it. The damage was done, the world gets darker everyday, and that shred of hope that little me hung on to that things would get better and all that pain and abuse was worth it is diminished to ashes. The truth is, if you donâ€™t care about yourself, youâ€™re out of luck. Because most people in the world do not. The world will gladly use you out but it wonâ€™t jump in to stitch you back to pieces. And you, who has been reminded just how little you are respected in the world, is expected to somehow make up the damage that lots of people inflicted on you. Youâ€™re expected to parent yourself, console yourself, nurture yourself, with energy you donâ€™t even have. Youâ€™re like a plant, who has been trampled over, left to rot and are somehow expected in your debilitated state to then water yourself and grow. Thatâ€™s what this â€œself loveâ€ really is, right? Itâ€™s not like we are social creatures, we can just fucking bring ourselves to life and survive without anyoneâ€™s help. Yep, someone who has been demolished is expected to just help themselves. God only helps those who help themselves.
