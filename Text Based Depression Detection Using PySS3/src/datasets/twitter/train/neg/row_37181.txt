Rant          Nothing like watching my favorite anime to remind me who I really am. Growing up I  wanted to be a shinobi from Naruto but i didny kniw the suffering my life would bring. I'm not sure how to cope with my deamons. I don't know what I'm doing in college. And I don't know if I deserve to be happy. From suffering blindly I know that if I don't accept myself and face my downfalls my life will be lost. 
          In the face of wanting my life to end and taunts of how I will never attain peace. In the face of my deamons I will never EVER give up. In the face of adversity I will stand for what I believe in. And that is the life that will not be taken without death. That is the hell I've chosen for myself
