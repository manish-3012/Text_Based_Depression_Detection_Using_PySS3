Maybe living isn't meant for everybody.I get killer anxiety from doing anything. I don't wanna work or get an education because it stresses me so bad and nothing interests me at all. I have looked for career paths for countless hours to no avail. I hate people who say money doesn't buy happiness cause if I had enough money to not work a day in my life I'd be one of the happiest people. Maybe people like me just aren't strong enough to get by in this world that we live in. If I can't get over the incredibly low bar of working at a job what the fuck am I supposed to do besides be homeless or die.
