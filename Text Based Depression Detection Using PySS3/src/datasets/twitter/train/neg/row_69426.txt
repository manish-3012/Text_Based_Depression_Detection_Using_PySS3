Everyday just gets worse.Everyone tells me youâ€™ll get over, it youâ€™ll be fine. Everyone says that it will get better with time but all time fucking seems to do is make it worse. Each day knowing she doesnâ€™t care about me anymore. Knowing she doesnâ€™t give a fuck what I have to say anymore. After everything. She wants to throw all that away? I just donâ€™t understand. She shows no signs of missing me or even thinking of me. This has happened before but never like this. I wake up everyday in a panic filled anxiety because Iâ€™m not next to her like I always am. Then I remember Iâ€™ll never be next to her again. How am I supposed to deal with these feelings. I have so much love for her but she doesnâ€™t care anymore. What is the point of going on when I know sheâ€™s gonna be the one I think about my whole life. I can feel myself drinking at bars in my 50s over her. So much love in my life is just gone
