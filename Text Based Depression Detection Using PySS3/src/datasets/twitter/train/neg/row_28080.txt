I want to kill myself because of my familyI fucking hate them. 

My mom- blames me for everything, assumes my emotions and makes me embarrassed, ruins my reputation, is a "nice bitch" (meaning she's bitchy in a non aggressive way), does not care about me emotionally or mentally, neglects me, does not love me as much as my brother, treats me like shit my whole life but not my brother. 

Dad- he's a fucking asshole, bad temper, I cant have a conversation with him because he's too aggressive and doesn't listen to anyone else, he blames me for everything wrong that happens in my life, indirectly tells me that there's something wrong with me and that I'm stupid. 

My brother- I love him but he never pays attention to what happens to me, he doesn't care and will take my parents' side over mine when I'm the one being treated like shit. 

They're narcissists. They will also fucking hate me if I come out of the closet. I fucking hate them so much. I want to fucking kill myself I'm never going to be free from them
