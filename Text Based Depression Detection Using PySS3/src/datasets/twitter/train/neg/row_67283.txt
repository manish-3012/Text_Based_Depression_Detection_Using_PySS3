I don't know what to do.I really dont know what to do right now. I'm failing a class again the same fucking class in fact. Im just ruining my gpa and fucking my tuition. I'm really planning to just kill myself after finals because I know I'm going to fail. And I've let everyone down. I'm so tired of being a fucking failure. And I want to cut right now, but I'm trying not to. I'm trying to stay strong but its hard I think by the end of the night at some point I'll just do it.
