But what do i kno?I just wanna touch on depression/suicide for one quick second. In fact I only have one thing to say about it. It doesn't matter if you have or do suffer from depression. It doesn't matter if you have attempted suicide once or a million times. It doesn't matter if you've studied mental illness on the most in depth levels possible. If you are not the person who just committed or attempted suicide, if you are not the person who is currently trying to find their way out of depressions dark deep void, if you are not the subject of the depression conversation, you DO NOT kno how they feel, you DO NOT understand, you DID NOT go through the same thing, you HAVE NOT fought the same battle. If you do not agree, that is literally pure ignorance. The only thing as complex as the human brain is the comprehension of our existence. We (our brain's included) are as different as every piece of sand on the beach, every snowflake that has ever fallen, every star that has ever been wished upon. We are not the same and our comprehension of our individual experiences are completely different from one to the next. I am so fucking tired of people trying to project their idea or understanding into every thing that happens to anyone in the world.  This is the era of  arrogance, I swear. I need you all to go into your bathroom, look in the mirror, take a real long look into your eyes, and tell yourself aloud, "I don't kno shit".
