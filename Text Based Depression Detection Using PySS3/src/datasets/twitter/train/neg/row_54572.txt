I don't want to live if I'll never be lovedI just turned 27 years old. I've always been socially awkward and inept. Obviously I've never had a girlfriend before. Not even a kiss. Now I'm stuck at home without a job and caring for my sick mother. I feel as if it's too late to ever have that kind of connection. I don't want to keep merely existing if there's no way I'll ever be loved. The pain of being alone is too great to go on.
