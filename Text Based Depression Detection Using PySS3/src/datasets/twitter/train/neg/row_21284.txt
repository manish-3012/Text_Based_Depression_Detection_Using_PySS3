Always good but never enoughHey there, I'm going to just park this post over here and see what happens.


I have had depression since late 2013 and it has kept fluctuating ever since. In the process, I was bullied for a while, both physically and mentally abused by my family, and sexually harrased. Besides those, I worked towards some achievements and accomplished them, but never a hundred per cent. Always good, but never enough.


Recently, I told my mother that I was sexually harrased. In response, she said something to me with an underlying message of: "You had it coming/deserved it." This may be it for me. I had done nothing to deserve that act, yet had to convince her to it. She has shown no sign of sympathy or help. This is my one and only mother. It is such a letdown.


I've always and always tried to act nice to people. I've always been kind, helping and when I could not help, listening. And the responses like these are what makes me question if I can endure what I am going through. I've always been an underachiever, have never done enough, and I cannot put real effort into anything since my depression successfuly convinces me that my efforts will prove worthless nonetheless.



I'm an eighteen year old, overweight and ugly male, if that helps.
