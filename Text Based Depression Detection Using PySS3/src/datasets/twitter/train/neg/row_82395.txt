These past few months have been the worst. Usually when something bad happens, I don't care. But these past few months have made it so every (trying not to swear here) night I just want to kill myself. And people can't seem to understand. 

My doctor- Upped my medication. That's it. 
Counselor- Told me to write a letter to my mother, explaining how I feel, and they would try to get my mother to 'open up'. (My mother acts like a hardass too. She has a ton going on her life, and me not telling her anything was so that I wouldn't be a bother.)
Mother- Flipped out on me when I told her. Said  that I'm using suicide as a crutch. (In the past she has said that if I am going to do it, at least do it right.)

I'm not sure what to do at the moment. 
I don't want to keep feeling like this night after night.
