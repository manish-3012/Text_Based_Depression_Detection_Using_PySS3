My parents are driving me crazy and I feel worthlessNow I am completely lost in my life.

I live under my parents roof just graduated from high school and past half year was very hard for me. I was visiting psychologist every single week and I got better and felt like world is great again.

But yesterday I cried again and now I feel like a piece of shit, worthless, failure and I feeling very bad. I don't understand my parents completely and i start to hate them. They started to live separate lives. My father helps his mother to build a house and spends a lot of time there but for a year he doesn't talk to me at all I can't remember when we had normal conversation. But the worst part that I realized was that my mother used me to talk how bad she feels how bad father is what an asshole he is. She told be every drama their had. She told me what my father thinks about me and actually one morning they had argument and I heard it myself. That i am nothing, that asshole that I am not helping him, he never asks for help. Lately she kicked him out of our apartment and cried to me, again was listening to her and she told that he left for all time that she hates him, and can't see him. But after a week he moved back and mother acts like nothing happened. I feel so hurt in side after what she said before and does now. And this drama happens very often several time a week. I stressed at home, I don't want to be around them.

By the way i am 19 but don't have a job, looking for one and i guess I will get one soon. I think about moving away. But when I told my mother that I was in a job interview she started to cry and said that she doesn't want me to leave her but I haven't told her my plans.
