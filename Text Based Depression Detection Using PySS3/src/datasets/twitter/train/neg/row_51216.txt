Thank you so much for trying, RedditYou've stopped me before, but now it's the time. You tried to make my miserable life longer, or worthwhile, but it isn't, and I'm tired of trying. Next month I would be seventeen. I'm never gonna get married, never gonna found my true love, never gonna have a kid or start working. But I'm not afraid, I'm calm, this is fine for me, even if I keep going, I'm not gonna be happy. Never. This never stops hurting, being in my own skin it's just suffocating now. I hate myself for being bisexual, for being genderfluid, for being an bad artist, for being me. 

Thank you for trying to make me keep going, but I won't do this anymore, I'm too pathetic to keep on living, and if I can't be happy as a kid, how can I be happy as adult? Today, it's gonna be over, finally, and I'm not scared anymore.
