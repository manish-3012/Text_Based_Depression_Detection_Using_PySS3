My light at the end of the tunnel is that I won't make it to 30.Depression and anxiety have controlled my life for the past decade. I barely do anything anymore because I don't have the energy or I know it'll take away the energy I do have.

I live in constant fear of pretty much nothing, I'm just a nervous wreck. When I'm not scared, I'm upset, angry or confused. 

I'm sick of living like this and I've tried speaking to professionals and doing other methods of coping/adapting/improving, but all I can see change is a steady decline.

I'm not afraid of dying anymore. I know my time will come soon and I almost welcome it at this point. I don't sweat any major situations or events because I know my time left is limited.
