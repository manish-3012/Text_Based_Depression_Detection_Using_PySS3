This is horrible.
I thought (or hopedâ€‹â€‹) that the cause of my anxiety was because I was ludicrously fat. It made sense to me that I was anxious of how people saw me and interacted with me because my size would disgust and intimidate them. So having lost the weight i can confirm that people are more ready to talk to me, to look at me and smile and to actually want to converse with me, yet that hasnâ€™t solved the problem. I am still cripplingly anxious. If a conversation doesnâ€™t end perfectly and cleanly i will torture myself with the details of it until i just want to jump out the window. If I have an unproductive day in work or I fail to do something I feel like everyone is bearing down on me to see how useless I really am. It wasnâ€™t because I was fat.

So I thought maybe i was stressed. Money was tight and i couldnâ€™t afford to do and have the things that made me feel better. I had situation after expensive situation that further depleted my funds, I was utterly trapped and kicking as hard as I could to keep my head above water. Well now I have a generous income, money to burn and the realisation that it wasnâ€™t the lack of money stopping me from doing those things, it was me. Buying games and gadgets, seeing movies, drinking and eating - all the stuff that would bring me joy before no longer does so why would I waste the money on them. It wasnâ€™t because I was poor.

The lack of the justification for how I feel has made it so, so much worse. When I had â€˜problemsâ€™ I could tell myself they could be fixed. I could say â€œwhen iâ€™m not x anymore, Iâ€™ll be so much happierâ€ and in a weird way itâ€™s the concrete obstacles that gave me a reason to keep trying. Theyâ€™re real, they can be solved and I can solve them. 

Well ... how do I solve this.

I am anxious, depressed and suicidal. The same as I was before but this time I canâ€™t fix it and without a reason for them I feel so fucking helpless.
