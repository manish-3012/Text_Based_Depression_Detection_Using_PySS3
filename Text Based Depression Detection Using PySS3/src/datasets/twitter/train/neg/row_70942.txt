BruhI don't know a better title. 

So here's how it goes:

I'm really considering suicide. My friend-crush is no longer showing interest in speaking to me, she has quite a lot of friends and obviously she doesn't have time for such a weakling like me. She also says I'm boring and serious, when I'm pretty much the smartest boy in my class. So yes, I believe my purpose in this world is over. I am now just a waste of space. I will need to terminate my life, so the strong and promising young people can rise after my death. I'm young myself, but I have realized that there's no use for me. Things that are no longer useful must be thrown away. Even me. 

There's something that you guys would like to call "Hope". I have a backup plan should my suicide attempt fail. It's excluding myself from all social interactions separate from my family, and attempt to find happiness alone. Because my "friends " just really want my intelligence. Once they got it, they leave. Now let's see what happens when I refuse to cooperate. This might ruin a reputation, but my mind is so corrupted already, I wouldn't care too much.

However, I suffer from a lot of mental disorders. Manic Depression, Major Depression, PTSD, OCD, probably BPD...

The suffering would probably not stop. So it's better for me, to end my suffering... permanently.
