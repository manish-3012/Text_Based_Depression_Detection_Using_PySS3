So I thought about hanging myself but then I remembered that my ceiling is 6 inches away from the top of my head.Fml Iâ€™m so poor I canâ€™t even commit suicide. I canâ€™t afford pills or apples and a blender. The only affordable way I can do it is walk to the nearest highway and jump. I want a quick and relatively painless death. Drowning and knifes sounds too painful. I canâ€™t afford a gun. Fml
