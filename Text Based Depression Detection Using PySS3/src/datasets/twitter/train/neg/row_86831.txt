Talk it out with meI am in the medical field right now. I understand the biology of death, I believe nothing happens after we die. I love science and I love the patients I see. It's an amazing life to anyone else who sees it, and many would sacrifice a lot to get it.

But I still have some issues. I have been feeling off for a while now. I have always thought about death, at first a fascination, but perhaps its more than that now.
