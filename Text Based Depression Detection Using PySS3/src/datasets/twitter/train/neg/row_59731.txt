Too many fuckupsI have fucked up too many times in my small city where many people know me. I have two options. Suicide or moving town. I am at university and can't really move for another two years. Two years in which I will be living in this town where so many people know me. They know all the times I fucked up socially or the times I did stupid things when depressed. No one knows I suffer from depression. I can't really tell anyone because I don't want to ruin the few friendships that I have. Actually I'm pretty manic depressive. I do and say the dumbest shit when I'm manic and when I'm depressed I really struggle trying to hide it and thus fuck up more. I want to kill myself. I'm afraid that if I move away then it will just repeat. I don't know what to do. Fuck. I wish I could tell people. Sometimes I think the best way to tell them is to commit suicide. Then they'll know why I was so fucked up. I can't face them. Please help. I need advice.

Edit: All of this makes me feel so lonely. I can't relate to anyone because they don't know what I'm going through. I don't want to tell people or they'll think it's one of those attention seeking things.
