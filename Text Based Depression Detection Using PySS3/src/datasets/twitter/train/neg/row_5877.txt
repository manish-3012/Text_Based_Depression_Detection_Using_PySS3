Girlfriend just quit on me after breaking down and telling me she loved me 3 days agoI donâ€™t really have anywhere to go with this so I just need somebody to know. My girlfriend just broke up with me a day ago after breaking down and telling me she loved me 3 days ago. We both came from similar backgrounds of being emotionally abused by our previous significant others, but we started to fall in love nevertheless over the past few months. She was engaged previously but definitely gave me every impression she was moved on and ready to be with me. I have extreme trust issues because my previous girlfriend of 5 years abandoned me about a year ago after treating me like I was worthless for over a year at the end of our relationship.

My newer now ex-girlfriend and I started to become super close over the past couple of months and we both confided in each other a lot of really deep personal things and I was actually able to trust her with that information. She broke up with me because things were moving too quickly even though she claimed she meant it that she loved me a couple of days ago. 

How can somebody be so cold out of nowhere after letting their defenses down and starting to love me and why does this keep happening to me? Please help
