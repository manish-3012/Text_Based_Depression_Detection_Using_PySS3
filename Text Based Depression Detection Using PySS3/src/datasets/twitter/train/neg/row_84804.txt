I want to die, but I feel guilty.I want to kill myself. Everything in my life has gone downhill and I don't think I can take it anymore. 

But I feel guilty. Because I have family and friends who wouldn't understand. They wouldn't understand it has nothing to do with them. They wouldn't understand that I just wasn't cut out for living. They wouldn't understand that this is something I needed to do for myself. 

So I debate. Over and over again. If I will kill myself or not. I know how. I know where. I have it all. Except I feel so guilty. It's the only thing keeping me here. But I can't keep living simply for guilt.
