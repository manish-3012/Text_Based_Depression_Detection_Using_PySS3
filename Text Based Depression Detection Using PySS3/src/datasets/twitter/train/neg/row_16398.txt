21 years oldHave felt empty for 5 horrible years now they say it gets better but fuck, it's been getting so much worse. Finally finding out I have too get my hip cut open and my feemer grinded into ontop of so many other problems I've been dealing with for years makes me feel like this mite be the one to break the camals back. All my friends seem too be numb too my pain but it's my fault for I've been miserable for years and how can you expect someone with there own problems too continue too care about yours. So here I am reddit alone in my room texting into my phone hoping for I dont even know. I want too blow head off so badly I used too love shooting trap but lately it's hard cause every time I look at my shotgun I just imagine taking my head off with it. Only thing that keeps me from going crazy and doing it is the hope that mabey some day I can feel the embrace of a loving female again but I'm losing hope.
