Reasons to to die.I've ranted a lot about my situation and my depression, sadness and inability to enjoy life.

I've read a lot about suicide, depression, meaning of life, reasons to stay alive and how it will eventually get better.

People seem to be quite fond of saying stuff like, "It'll get better, I was there too, believe me." or "Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem." and stuff like that.

The thing is, I know it won't get better. How do I know that? Simply because there is nothing in my life that indicates that it will get better. 

What little amount of friends I had, have stopped talking to me. I'm about to fail college. My prospects of trying to get out of my parents house are bleaker than ever before. I was somewhat acceptable as a socially inept child, teenager. I doubt more people will spend time with a socially inept 21+, ugly male. My parents funds are decreasing as they have to support two loser children and pay off loans.

My life is inconsequential and my death will be the same.
