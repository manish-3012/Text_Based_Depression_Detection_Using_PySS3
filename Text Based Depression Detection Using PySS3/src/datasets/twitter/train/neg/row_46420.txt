I hurting myself , need help ,afraid people will think I want attentionI hurting myself by slapping myself and a bit of cutting , I feel relieve when I did for split second , I did because I dont want to feel my own thoughts. I very stress out today because of study and I do stupid mistake(I decide to not eat any meat few days prior and today I just forget and eat chicken , realize hours later ,start freak out.)
I live with my boyfriend , I feel like i need help because I want to just die , I feel like piece of stupid shit. Now my bf is at work , I just want to bang my head to the wall , I still have to study and I just cant help with all of this , I feel like I need to calm down but I dont see any posible way to stop. I want to tell my boyfriend but I dont want him to think I did for attention. I just really want to stop thinking.
I have no one to talk to.
