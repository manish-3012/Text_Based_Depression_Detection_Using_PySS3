My last day on EarthI can't do this any longer. I have nothing left to live for.
After unexpectedly losing my best friend last year I thought I would never recover from the trauma. I see him in my dreams every night, his life draining out as I helplessly hold him in my arms. But the nightmares only start as soon as I wake up. The woman I dedicated my life to who betrayed me, who let a stranger into our home. The memories haunt me and torment me relentlessly. The pain is insurmountable and inescapable, my life has become a living Hell. They don't understand, they think I am selfish, they think I am weak and unwilling to recover. There is nothing to recover from. I have been reduced to nothingness. There is nothing left in me. I know they love me, but I am simply no longer living. I lost half my soul the day he died, and the other half the day she left. How can a person keep on existing without a soul?
I have no desires, no will, no wants or needs. I am simply no longer there, and tomorrow will be my last day on Earth. I only wish they can forgive me one day
