I'm done. I'm so fucking done.I've created this throwaway just for this sub. It's gonna be a long one, sorry.

So, as you can probably tell from my username, I'm depressed and want to die. My mother hates me but I can't move out as I'm unemployed and can't afford rent. She takes everything out on me and kicked me out of the house for a while earlier, threatening to call the police on me. I have one person in life who I can rely on and that's my boyfriend, he's the only reason I hadn't killed myself yet.

But tonight was the straw that broke the camel's back, I had a shit day, I went up to a bridge that's quite well known for suicides in my city (I'm in the UK) and there's a help point for the Samaritans charity, I pressed it and there was no answer (I think it was disconnected or broken).

I stood at the very top of this bridge and thought "what if", what if I actually phoned my boyfriend, said goodbye and did it, I overcame the urge and came home.

Then it all kicked off with my mum, I just want to end it but I don't want to hurt the guy I love with all my heart. I'm torn.

I have a huge knife, painkillers, alcohol and a belt. I have so many options.

I don't know if I'll be back, tonight might just be the night.
