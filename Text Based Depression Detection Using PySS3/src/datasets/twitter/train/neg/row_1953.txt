My Father-in-law committed suicide. What is the best way to help my wife?I don't know if this is best subreddit to ask, but I just found out that my Father-in-law just committed suicide. I am shocked/sad/angry, but mostly worried about my wife. What is the best way for me to support her? They weren't in the best of terms and I know she is feeling guilty. Any recommendations?
