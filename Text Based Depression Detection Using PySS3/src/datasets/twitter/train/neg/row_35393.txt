Its too muchSo im 18 years old and I dont know if I can keep going, I dont know who I am and it destroys me, Im not sure why I act the way I do, is it because thats just me? Or do I want to gain something through my actions? I dont feel a lot most of the time, my mood changes very regularly, every few hours, sometimes in the matter of minutes , sometimes it takes days. I cant concentrate on anything because of this, the emptiness makes me go crazy. I know that Im a broken person, and I probably know why, but that doesnt matter since its the way I am now, and there is no way to change it, I tried very hard. I do nothing most days, dont have the motivation to go out most of the time. Sometimes I get movtivation boosts that catapult me into this feeling of euphoria, where I just work on something thats stuck in my mind and it makes me really happy, but the aftermath (sometimes after a few hours) is just unbearable. I know I have my whole life ahead of me and anything can happen, its just so hard to keep going when it feels like everything is falling apart around you over and over and over again, like my body isnt allowing me to be normal, to be happy, to be content.
