I have a severe complex about my face thanks to school and online bulliessome of the worst ones that i can remember: 
a guy in high school pushed me to the ground telling me to exercise (iâ€™m 5â€™6â€ 130 pounds)

a girl in middle school said i had an ugly asian nose (iâ€™m asian so that was pretty racist)

a girl in elementary school told me i looked like this other asian girl but i was uglier

another girl in elementary school grabbed my arm fat and said why are you so fat 

this guy asked me why my skin was so bad 

another girl in middle school pointed out my asymmetrical eyes (which i have a severe complex about) 

i can list more but itâ€™ll probably be too much 

Iâ€™m thankful for corona in that I can wear a face mask everywhere and hide my hideous face. I wish I could wear a face mask forever. Thanks to these bullies, I developed PTSD as a result and suffer from panic attacks several times throughout the day. Bullies never remember the psychological damage they do, but the victims have to suffer for the rest of their lives. My therapist said kids will be kids, but honestly fuck that shit. She might as well tell me to kill myself instead because that makes more sense.
