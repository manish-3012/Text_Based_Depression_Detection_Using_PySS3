I hate myself so muchIm a 17 year old highschool drop out with no reason to live. I have no friends, no real interests or passions, and really no desire to live anymore. I live with 5 other people yet im so alone and no one speaks to me, my mother who i don't live with hasn't spoken to me in many months. I can't even remember the last time i left my house. I can't stand to look at myself or think about how much of a failure i am and a waste of space. Suicide doesnt sound too scary anymore.
