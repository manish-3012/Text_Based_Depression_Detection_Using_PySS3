Don't want to get a job and my parents are threatening to kick me outMy parents can easily afford me and their estate will support me after they're gone so that isn't an issue.  The issue is that I've always had "potential" and they are getting mad that I'm "wasting it".  I've always done good in school even though I hated it.  I'd just do things to get them done as fast as possible and I'd do things right because I thought they were so easy.  I was the guy who was always done first and got the best grades.  Whenever there was something like a project I would do terribly on it because I didn't give a fuck.  This would always piss teachers off and they'd tell be I'd never amount to anything doing this.  I never wanted to "amount to anything".  I never wanted a job.  Whenever we had to write something about "what do you want to be when you grow up?" I'd write something like "play videogames in my parents' basement".  I have no interest in having a family and the only reason I'd want a relationship is for regular sex.  I do masturbate about 5 times per day so I really doubt any girl would keep me satisfied anyway.

So because of this I keep the stuff to kill myself in my closet and a spare kit buried in the woods somewhere just in case.
