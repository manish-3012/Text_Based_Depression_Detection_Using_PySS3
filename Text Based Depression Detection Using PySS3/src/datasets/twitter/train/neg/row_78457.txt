I canâ€™t stop the thoughts.He found me. The man I loved so intensely 20 years ago. We had the most torrid affair. I was 19 and he 36. He was an artist and I was a lost girl in NYC. He made me part of his art. 20 years later I found my photo in his gallery. 

I still want to die. I still canâ€™t stop the thoughts. Even with him professing his love. I donâ€™t want to go on like this. Enough.
