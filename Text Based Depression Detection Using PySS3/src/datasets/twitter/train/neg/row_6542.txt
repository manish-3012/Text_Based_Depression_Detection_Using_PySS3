I'm not happy with myself. Ever.I've done a lot of reflecting lately, and I've realized something. I'm never truly happy with how I am as a person. I've been struggling with depression for a while, but I recently tried coming to terms with myself.

I always feel depressed every waking second I don't have some kind of chemicals in my system (weed, alcohol, tobacco, nicotine). I've lost the respect of my parents, and my one true friend I could turn to in times of need. I'm not happy with my body image, as in I just hate the way I look and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. I hardly cut it through high school, and decided I don't want to go to college; which by that decision, I have no personal ambition to do anything. All I do with my life is play video games, go to work, sometimes sleep, and drink &amp; smoke.

I just feel like there's no damn point at all to anything I do, and the harder I try to find a purpose for myself, the more I realize there is none.
