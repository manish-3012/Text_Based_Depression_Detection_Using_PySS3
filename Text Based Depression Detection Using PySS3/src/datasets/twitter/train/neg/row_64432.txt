I'm Scared of Being AloneMy entire life I can't remember being happy or having anyone there for me. I found someone special and he kept leaving me over and over again until I got this fear of somone leaving me. Randomly without warning and for long periods of time. It took me two years to leave him and I found someone who I thought would never leave. He didn't. I ended up being controlled and beaten and now I am friendless and alone. I have nothing I want to do or say to make me feel even a little better. Im lost. He's right there on my shoulder hurting me more and more and more and I'm so scared of being alone I can't get him away. I need someone to be there for me because the only thing I'm more scared of than being alone; is what I'll do to myself when I am.
