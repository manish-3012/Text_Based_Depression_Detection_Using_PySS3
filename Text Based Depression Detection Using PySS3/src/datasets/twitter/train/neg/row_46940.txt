My job search ends today.No, I didn't find a job. I'm just sick of the false hope and constant failure. I'm of no use to anyone on this planet, so today I turned my phone off and never plan on turning it back on. The only thing that ever came out of that phone is disappointment. I don't need any more disappointment in my life.

I live alone in this city and never leave my apartment, so turning off my phone is effectively the same as cutting contact with humanity. And with that, this begins my road to acceptance of death. In 4 months I will run out of money and die. I don't plan on fighting it anymore. I'm sick of fighting, nothing ever comes of it.

I fantasize about jumping every day. I can only hope that in 4 months I'll be ready.
