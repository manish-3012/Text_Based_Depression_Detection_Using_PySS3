Ready to die because of my flat chestI just hate myself. I've been battling this for years. I have the flattest chest of any woman i've ever met. I have a 28A measurement. Which is like a 32AA. I feel so ashamed and unattractive. I know my boyfriend doesn't like them. He ogles big breasts and I know he used to have a crush on this girl when we first started dating because of her giant boobs. He made a comment once about my small boobs when he was blackout drunk. 
I just can't stand it. It hurts to not feel like a woman when I feel so feminine inside. I am 21 but everyone thinks I am 14 because I look so young and underdeveloped. I have been hospitalized for a suicide attempt two years ago and I thought I was getting better. But every day I examine my body in the mirror and feel so ugly. I've been thinking about killing myself all week because I'm so fucking ugly
