I'm incredibly sad yet numb all the timeLife is insanely bleak to me, I fear that ill never feel the love i give, though i've never attempted suicide nor have a plan i do have a date planned to end it should life continue the way it is. I have nothing to look forward to, maybe i have a long life ahead of me but theres nothing to that life but the same cycle. i suck at everything i do, i have no motivation left, the world will always be the same weather i leave or not, only the pain stays around and its the only thing I'm afraid of, hurting my best friend thoughI've not talked to her in a while, the pain my mom and grandma will feel after not only losing my grandpa to cancer but me to depression and suicide, and though a part of me believes they wont be affected, the other knows i'll incredibly hurt the bros that always look over me, because although they may not show it i know they care. if not for all the people around me I would have ended my life plenty of months ago maybe even years. I don't know what to do, i feel like no matter what I do I'll never be fulfilled. I'll never find the pain worth enduring, ill never find the fight i used to have in my heart. the flames that kept me going. Death seems closer than ever and in a sense its on my tounge, yet i hate the taste
