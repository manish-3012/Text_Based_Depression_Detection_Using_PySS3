HopelessnessI'm hopelessly depressed all the time. I feel worthless and like nobody cares about me. I'm 21, can't get a job because I dropped out of high school. Im in my head all the time. It seems like all I think about is dying. I don't know what to do and I have no one to turn to as they don't understand what I'm going through. I sit at home all day and do nothing but cry and feel sorry for myself. Bipolar runs in the family but I've never been diagnosed. I know I need help but I won't go get it, because I'm too embarrassed and I don't wanna bother anyone. I feel like I'm not meant for this world. Ugggghhhhh
