A guy asked me out, I don't know how to handle it (gay)We are both 18. My mom is not accepting of homosexual relationship, and I have only "came out" two years ago. Just recently, a guy that I met at school striked up a conversation to me on Facebook, and I was rather surprised, because it was so out of the blue. I remember talking about him a few days ago, and that maybe we could try dating, and then, this happens. I was not prepared for this. I do like him, and he seems to like me a lot too, but I already feel like he's rushing it. He texted me all day, and I am believing that this behavior is rather clingy and unattractive, and frankly, quite creepy. We are going to have a date this Thursday, which is just a day after my therapist appointment. I am scared. If I don't want to be in a relationship with him, I am scared of hurting his feelings and feeling like a monster afterwards. But now I feel like I've been cornered. I'm clueless. No idea how to act. No idea what to do. No one to talk to. I've been having panic attacks and not been able to sleep. I have attempted suicide two times in my life (depression) and I have been thinking of doing it again. Please help me.
