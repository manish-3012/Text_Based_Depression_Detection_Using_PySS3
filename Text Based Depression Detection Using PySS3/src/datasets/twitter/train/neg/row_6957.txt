It feels like I'm suffocatingI posted this in /r/depression but decided to post it here as well. This might be the worst I've ever felt, and life is starting to look less and less worthwhile. So many times now I've been completely alienated by those around me, and now this is really pushing me over the edge.

I've posted about this a few times but my girlfriend, the only person I've talked to about my depression, broke up with me a couple days ago. Yesterday, to distract myself from my thoughts, I hung out with a buddy and told him about my breakup. We had some beers and got high at his placeâ€”which was calming while it lasted. But after falling asleep at his place at around 1:00 AM, I woke up 2 hours later and couldn't get back to sleep. I've always had trouble sleeping, and this recent event has aggravated it. So I left his place at around 6, three hours later, and bussed home. Then I climbed into my own bed, trying to get some more sleep. I fell asleep at 7:45, and had a dream that I was with my ex-girlfriend. We were kissing, even though I was aware of our breakup within the dream, and pretty much knew it was a dream anyway. Then, as I was putting my hands over her body, I woke up again. When I checked the time it was just past 8:00. I was still so tired. And then I started crying again.
