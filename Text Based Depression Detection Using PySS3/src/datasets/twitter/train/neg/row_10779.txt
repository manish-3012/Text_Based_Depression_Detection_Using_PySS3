I've been googling variations of 'how to kill yourself' for the past 15 minutes (take two, with bonus semi coherency) I've been depressed for seven years. I've cut, burned, drank, cried, acted promiscuously, and tried drugs because of my depression. I've wanted to kill myself, on and off, for most of the seven years but I've been too afraid to REALLY try. Sure, I've tried in a really pathetic way, but I've been told those don't count.

Lately I can't focus. I've been more depressed than usual. More suicidal than usual. I'm failing school because it's honestly all I can think about. Nothing feels good anymore, not even cutting or sex. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because my boyfriend asked me not to, but he's suicidal as well and I'm terrified of the day he leaves me. I know he will. I've been more and more frustrating lately, he can't even get me to go to sleep without me screaming and crying over it.

I'm honestly nothing but a burden. I don't do anything productive. I'm a waste of resources and I feel like it's just better off if I kill myself. The only reason I live is for my boyfriends sake, and lately that doesn't feel like enough. I have a million plans but I'm scared of failing, or scared of succeeding. I'm hopeless.

This will probably get lost but it's ok. I just needed to get this all out.
