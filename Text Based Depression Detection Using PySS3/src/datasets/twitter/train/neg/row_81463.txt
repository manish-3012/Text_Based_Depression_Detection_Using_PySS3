I need motivation but can't generate my own. I have no motivation to live or be productive or even self-sufficient.Maybe my problem is extreme laziness. I simply can't see any reason to continue living. I'm uninterested in family,  I don't care about changing the world or even the area around me, I'm not having any kind of fun and I don't enjoy any of it anymore. Honestly, I'm pretty bored and kinda sick of this life. I don't really have much to complain about and the praises about my talent or my future prospects have been repeated ad nauseum.   


I'm honestly  beginning to hate all this. I don't want to continue it and all I can see in the future is hassle after hassle, responsibility after responsibility. Life, to me, is just one long hassle, a chore that I am forced to slog through for sentimental reasons that have nothing to do with my own happiness. I hate this and wish to put an end to it.  


The problem with it is that I have too many sentimental reasons to stay, the usual arguments about how people will be hurt or things about solving short term problems with permanent solutions. Well, I can't see the long term. The short term is that life is one big hassle, and the long term I can only expect it to be more of the same. I've held on hoping things would get better or easier but they don't and likely never will. I don't expect to be convinced any which way concerning whether or not I should or should not simply die and let come what may. I just wish there was something that could once and for all convince me that life is worth living. That it isn't just one long hassle and list of chores.  


I hate this life and I hate how this world is turning out. I am seriously considering just trying my luck with whatever might be next. If it's endless torture, at least it'll be consistent and I won't have to do shit. Uncertainty and lack of motivation is a bitch.
