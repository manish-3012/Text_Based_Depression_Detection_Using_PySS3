If life only gets harder, then why continue?No one asks to be born. Youâ€™re born into this world without a choice of your name,location,financial class, parents, etc. My childhood feels nostalgic because I was naive to the negativity in the world and was actually happy. Iâ€™m almost in college now and since 8th grade Iâ€™ve felt depressed. High school sucked all of my energy out. Iâ€™m always told that I need to do my best because it only gets harder. Every. Single. Year. â€œThatâ€™s lifeâ€ â€œWelcome to the real worldâ€

Do you honestly expect me to just accept that as an answer? Why should I have to deal with so much stress and anxiety? Why do I have to be forced to deal with it? So many times Iâ€™ve been told â€œnoâ€ because of my lack of money. I donâ€™t mean asking for an ice cream cone or anything. When I turned 16, I was hit with all these bills. I have to pay for my car, gas, drivers ed, college, and then pay for a living space. Any enjoyment I had in life is gone. 

On the topic of being forced, why are we forced to go to public/private school for all our early life? Youâ€™re forced to wake up early, get ready, and go to a building for seven hours. Most information isnâ€™t retained. Especially homework, surely thereâ€™s other ways of measuring intelligence than piling us with essays and assignments with unreasonable due dates. Itâ€™s like some teachers donâ€™t understand itâ€™s not possible to complete multiple projects when you have multiple other classes. 

Itâ€™s 3 AM right now and Iâ€™m doing an assignment. But why? Because they told me to? Why am I forced to? Because it will affect my future? I donâ€™t want a future. Iâ€™m about ready to give up. If things donâ€™t get better, I donâ€™t want to live on. Thanks for anyone who actually read this.
