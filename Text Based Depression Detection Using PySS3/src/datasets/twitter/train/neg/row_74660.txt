Just bought a bottle of 50 acetaminophen 50mg pills and plan on washing them down with alcohol tonight.The pain of staying alive is greater than the unknown pain I might feel by doing this. I just can't go on anymore.

Edit: 500mg pills, not 50mg.

Edit 2: still here, decided before reading this to maybe wait until Saturday, but now I feel I need to change my approach entirely. I mostly thought the alcohol would help calm me and put me to sleep while the pills did their job but it seems I'm gravely mistaken. I've been battling depression for more than half my life, I just can't handle myself
