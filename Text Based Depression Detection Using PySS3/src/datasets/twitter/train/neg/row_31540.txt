Today I learned that my father has cancer.He's been trying to get together with me to tell me and I've been blowing him off. I've been avoiding my parents because of how far gone into my depression I am. I called him during my lunch break and I was angry and annoyed as I have been most of my life but especially the past couple of months. I pushed him to tell me what was really going on and I couldn't have been any less sympathetic. I have felt surrounded by death for so long that it feels normal. I didn't think my dad would have anything like this happen to him. If I could hate myself any more I definitely would from how selfish I am. I can't handle this. Why has my life been a struggle after another? I'm 24 and I feel like I've been through a life's time of pain. I can't keep myself together anymore. I've already been suicidal lately. Actually thought about buying a gun today. I would've run my car into a tree along ago if I was confident that it would actually kill me. I've been thinking a lot about how once my parents go I'll follow because I know my mom would try to kill herself again if I did that and I didn't want to do that to my father but I just don't have it in me anymore to keep doing this. Maybe this is all my fault for waiting for them to die so I could die?
