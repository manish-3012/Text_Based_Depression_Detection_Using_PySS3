please helpI feel trapped at the moment. I think this is the closest ive ever been to suicidal thoughts. suicide has always rather scared me. My girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me a week ago and is completely unaffected by it. like the 4 years of time, effort and love I put in just didn't matter to her anymore. I feel so betrayed and don't know what to do. I dont think ive ever felt this much agony over another person before. The past week ive felt as if im in a hole. see before this I flunked out of community college and didn't get accepted to the art colleges I applied for. since I failed community college I owe them a lot of money. ive been trying to promote myself online but haven't done a lot with it. my now ex girlfriend however DID get accepted and she just got her licence and is already seeing someone else. Im so jealous and angry at her. she was the only outlet i had to talk about things and she just up and left. i almost feel like I want to message her saying I want to talk and explain my issues but every time I think that my body spasms and I get so angry I want to scream and hurt something. she was the one I lost my virginity to and had my first kiss with, and she left me when I had no job, no money and no educational future. shes off meeting new people while Im sitting her feeling absolutely awful. I recently went into such an angry state that was screaming and breaking wood planks in the backyard with my bear hands. Ive never been angry like this before. ive always been a very docile person. Im scared. I don't know what to do. Please help
