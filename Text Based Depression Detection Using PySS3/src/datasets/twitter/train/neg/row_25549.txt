Is it unhelpful to tell someone suicidal Iâ€™m a bit sad? (not in a guilt-inducing kind of way, of course)I donâ€™t wanna go into details just yet. A friend of mine overdosed on some pills and is now doing better. They live very far away. I want to help them but I honestly donâ€™t know how. Iâ€™m doing my best, and just openly expressed my support. Iâ€™m really sad I love this friend of mine but Iâ€™m not sure telling them would do any help. 

I donâ€™t wanna make it sound like Iâ€™m guilt tripping them â€œoh but Iâ€™d be so sad how come you didnâ€™t think of how Iâ€™d feelâ€ is what Iâ€™m trying to avoid. (I hope that made sense to you, I donâ€™t wanna be an asshole, itâ€™s just that this situation came out of the blue and Iâ€™m trying to do my best processing it). 

Also, I donâ€™t wanna make it sound about myself. Like, they are opening up about this experience and I think talking about my feelings would be a little egocentric from my part. 

I want them to know I care. I told them how much they mean to me but I donâ€™t know if that helps at all or even if itâ€™s harmful. I know every personâ€™s different but maybe you have insight on this. 

Thanks in advance and I really really hope you all start feeling better. Iâ€™m sorry if this post was a nuisance.
