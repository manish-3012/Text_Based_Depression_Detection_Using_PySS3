I'm going to love them forever, or until I kill myself.If I have a sure way out, I would be out already. I don't have that. I don't have the means to kill myself for sure. 

I'm afraid to reveal too much information but here is what I can say. I am in absolute love (don't question this, please) with someone who loves someone else equally as much. I don't want to get over them. I'm happy if they're happy. I would love them unrequited forever if I could or I would off myself if I can't do that. But I do have desire sometimes for them to love me. There is always a bit of hope and I wish I could kill it. To stop hoping that one day they'll love me because they won't. They haven't. Even though they are well aware of my feelings. Even though we are sexual/hug/cuddle. Even though we are close friends. I will never achieve it and it conflicts me.

I just want them to be happy and I'll be happy. If they go I will go too. If I can't love them anymore I will kill myself.
