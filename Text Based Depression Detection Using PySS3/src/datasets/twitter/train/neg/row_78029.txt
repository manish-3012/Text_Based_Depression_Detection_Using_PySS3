i've honestly been thinking about killing myself for awhile now.And its not out of anger or being sad, i personally think i have thought about it quite rationally... I mean i have thought of so many outcomes to do with how life is going and where it could be and i cant actually see myself ever being where i want to be, That thought doesent make me sad or feel anything at all...its just sorta there.

I told someone about all this maybe 2 nights ago, went into almost  every detail about stuff that i feel like i should be sad or angry about...And i only did it because she asked and started bringing things up which was weird, Come to think of it that whole situation was a bit fucked up..thats beside the point, She said something that really confused me which was 'how can you possibly think that's normal' like how would i think its anything else? the only reason you dont see it as normal its different to how you think .


I mean thinking about suicide cant be that big a deal if i told my mum and she doesent really care, she joked about it mid argument and also kinda threatened me by picking up a Stanley knife, extending the blade and just setting it next to her like she was going to do it.

i dunno
