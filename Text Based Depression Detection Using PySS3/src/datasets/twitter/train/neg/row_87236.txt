16 and life has nothing to offer me anymoreI am the eldest of seven - my youngest brother has Down Syndrome. We're losing our internet in four days. We might lose our cars and our home soon. I'm an International Baccalaureate student that has been doing so poorly in school lately because of my family's situation and my own depression/anxiety issues. I can't do any of the CAS requirements I have to do for IB because my father is unwilling to drive me to them (waste of gas, I don't get a cent in return, etc.) I've been trying to find a job but who wants to hire a sixteen year old girl who already has a lot of other commitments and who can't even drive herself to them?  (In fact, I'm missing out on a summer job thing my local workforce center is throwing right now because my father was unwilling to drive me to it. Thanks dad. My mom couldn't drive me because she was doing therapy with my little brother and wouldn't be able to take me to it anyway because her license is suspended for six months. I can't drive because my parents won't let me.)

Nobody truly cares about my troubles. Everybody has their own problems. I'm sick of trying to deal with my own - I guess I've finally realized that there's really nothing I can do to improve anything about my life. I've got too many obstacles, whether it would be my own family (especially my asshole father) or school, or my own anxiety/depression issues. If I killed myself it would just be one less mouth to feed for my parents, and I wouldn't have to deal with this awful life I have right now anymore. People would move on without me eventually. I'm okay with dying now. I think it would just be better for everyone.
