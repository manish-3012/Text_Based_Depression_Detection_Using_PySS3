Is there any reason to keep going?Is it normal to be excluded from every group? I feel like no one really wanted to know about me. Lately I just really feel like a big void inside my chest you know? My girlfriend passed away at age 16, 3 weeks ago, after this I'm not the same anymore. I want someone to talk. I don't want to end like this. It hurts to know that everyone that I've ever known can't even notice the bad times that I am going through. And now, this quarantine thing, is just making everything worse. I'm not feeling like ending like this. Alone in a dark room. I want to leave a mark on anything, in anyones life. I feel like no one would notice if I just disapeared. Please, I need to talk to somebody! Please!
