I think I'll be leaving soon
 Nobody cares about me, I am too lonely and I am desolate in this world I never thought of this option but I feel that this way the people who do not care about me now they will be the ones who are desolate
 Also, I'm sad, I feel like I'm worthless, I look at myself in the mirror and see a shadow, I just want to be alone and I have absolutely nothing here
because I'm here wasting my time.
