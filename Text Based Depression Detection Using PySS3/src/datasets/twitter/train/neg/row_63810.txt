Im trynna die you get me?Hey, I'm a 16 yr old male. My life is and endless shitshow of fuckery and I'm trying to end it it, where do I start?

Firstly, I go to a shithole Catholic school, the Catholics are basically evil bastards and have never treated me like I'm a person, the school is pushing me to the edge to the point where normal work feels like it's rotting my brain, and I'm a pretty smart (relatively) kid, so all this weight and expectation is forced on me.  


Secondly, I can not seem to find the right girl for me, every time i try i get hurt, or I waste my time. I just want some intimacy you feel me? I feel fucked because I feel like I'm not even that bad a person, both lookswise and personality wise, but there must be something wrong with me if I can't find the right one, and I feel like shit for having ill feelings to girls who have rejected me, because I know I shouldn't

My home life is also shit, my parents are distant and my dad is just an arsehole. I'm fucking sick of the majority of my family, they don't recognise my sadness as relevant at all. I've been called the victim player many times and there is abuse involved.

I do do "drugs" you may call them, Weed &amp; Psychedelics, nothing else, Psychedelics help me feel better for long periods of time but eventually it all ends and i find myself in the same mental pit. I have attempted suicide via locked inside a hot car, didn't work out. And i also took an almost lethal dose of Oxycontin without thinking out of pure disreguard for my life. 

I don't even know why I'm saying all this here? Maybe it's because i feel like no one cares in my life. I do have a fair amount of friends, but they're all either going thru their own shit or i feel like they just don't/wouldn't care. So there, that's it.
