Today was a good day.I finally realized something. I've always been trying to be happy but the truth is that happiness is simply a lack of awareness. Awareness of the suffering going on everywhere around you. Your own suffering. Suffering that you inflict on others, intentional or otherwise. I think the thing that makes me most dissatisfied in all of existence is the human lie, the pursuit of happiness. It's just that, a pursuit, and one which can never be seized upon for those who have pried their eyes to the immense misery in this world. I've tried being happy, angry, crazy, sad, and a plethora of various other moods and states of being. I just simply don't have an aptitude for emotional processing. So I've decided that from today on I'll feel nothing at all, and if the weight of that decision should become to much to bear I will treat myself punitively and snuff myself out like the insignificant insects that we all are.
