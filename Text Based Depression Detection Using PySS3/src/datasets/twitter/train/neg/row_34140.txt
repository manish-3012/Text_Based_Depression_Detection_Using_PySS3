too many lonely nightsevery night is really difficult and i feel like a few more will do it for me and i will kill myself. even the day gets worse and worse and it's harder to get out of bed to go to school, even to do things i like to do like go to the gym. 

my friends are avoiding me and its been hard/unsuccessful making/reaching out to new ones. it was never hard for me to hang out with friends but now i know i must be a storm cloud walking around and nobody wants to be with me. it was never hard to get with girls even before when I was chubby but i've been curved a few times lately and honestly even just getting with a girl instead of finding friends i need some sort of connection like that....

video games/studying/reading helps take my mind off of it a little bit but i don't even have the patience anymore barely to play a game or even read something short i don't know what to do anymore. i don't even want to go to college anymore because i am going to cost my parents a lot of money where I applied and i cant bring myself to go to a local school because too many people who know me will be there, i am at such a loss i dont know what to do
