I have no confidence in myself and it has caused me to hate lifeI've never had confidence in myself, ever since I was in elementary school. I grew up being told I was smart and talented by all adults in my family, and they were of course lying about it. I've been dealing with mental problems and suicidal thoughts for the past 3 years now and it's only getting worse. As I grew up I realized that everyone was just lying to try and make me feel better and it hit me very hard. I stopped talking to people and I avoid as much social interaction because I just feel like I'm not worth knowing. I lost all interest in my hobbies and I quickly went to doing nothing for hours and hours a day. I always get so disappointed in myself and I feel horrible. I occasionally make an attempt to do something like draw or anything really, but I still always leave disappointed. I recently found a notebook that I kept since the beginning of elementary school to track my progress. I tried drawing in it, and I did so for a long while. When I saw the final result I just felt horrible and I began to cry. I got rid of the entire notebook because I didn't want to be reminded of the fact that I have no talent. I've never succeeded in anything in life and I doubt I ever will. I spend all my time staring at my ceiling loathing every part of my life. I feel I've hit a dead end in my life and the only thing I look forward to is my death.
