Give me ONE reasonI have 2 friends and they have a million friends I'm a no one compared to them. And also I have a social phobia but I am a social person. I only hang out at school and home I have no ambitions, skills, hobbies. I'm like a rock I only exist and I hate it. I can't seek out help because the school, therapist is going to tell my parents and I don't want them to know that I am a suicidal piece of shit.

I have made a plan to kill myself. Not far from my home ther is this super modern building that is about 7 storeys tall. In the top of the building its open and the perfect jumping spot. I will bring a bottle of hard liquor drink it and jump. So in the autopsy they will find alcohol in my blood and think I got drunk and had a fall.

Give me ONE reason I should not do this.
I'm bored with life and I don't care about anything
