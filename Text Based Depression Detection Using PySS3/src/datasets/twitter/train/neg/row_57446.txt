I'm an all around terrible person.I don't want to admit it, but I am.  I've stolen, used empathy to get what I want, and relied on caring people to keep doing stupid shit for this dumbass addiction. 

I've pretended to use family members deaths for an excuse. Family members I absolutely loved.  I've made up excuses for work that were contributed to non-existent illness.

I cheated on every girl I've ever dated.   It was always a stupid "she's gonna do it, I have to do it first " kind of thing.  Getting upset over stupid lies when I'm  getting pics from some girl I'm being just as shitty to.

The girl I had a 3 year relationship with keeps telling me she just wants to "be careful", but keeps telling me how pretty she is. She wants to ruin  me.  I can tell.

I'm a fucking failure in so many ways.  Scored high on the act's and whatever.  I have too much anxiety and am afraid of failure to the point that I don't try . This doesn't contribute to me being a shitty person.   I'm not bragging. I'm a dumbass.  I just wanted to Express the fact and divide I feel.  

Thanks for listening.   This is depressing and self  hate radio.  I hope you enjoyed
