Life doesn't feel worth living anymoreIt has no magic. I have a family who adores me, but I don't want to live only for the sake of someone else. I have friends, but I'm not sure how much they care about me. A while ago I started having a crush on a girl I knew, honestly whilst I got quite a bit of pain in my life, simultaneously it sort of made my life worth living, it added quite a lot of magic. Well, we haven't had much contact all summer, and honestly I don't really care anymore. I'm not sure how much I even want to see her, or anyone else anymore.
