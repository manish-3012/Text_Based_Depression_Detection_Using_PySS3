I don't want to die but I can't live with this strong sense of smell and hearingIt probably sounds dramatic but it is driving me insane. Pretty much any smell I will smell overpowing and it will make me sick to the stomach, nauseous, disgusted, irritated. Pretty much any noise makes me so irritated I cry in frustration. I can't afford to live alone and the house I am in has very thin walls, and very loud people. I can't live live this it is torture.
