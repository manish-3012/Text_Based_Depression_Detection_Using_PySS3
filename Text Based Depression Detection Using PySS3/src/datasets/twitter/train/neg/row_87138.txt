People who got betterMan, when I'm reading people's stories how they finally got better after like 10 years its makes me even more depressed. I won't even try to fight for 1 day let alone 10 years. Do you feel the same? For me this stories are even more counter productive than for example "it will get better"

Sorry for mah bad inglish :)))
