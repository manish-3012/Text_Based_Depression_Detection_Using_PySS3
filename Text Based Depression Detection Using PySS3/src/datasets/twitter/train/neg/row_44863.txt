I Get Suicidal Every Time I Go HomeAs soon as I close that door I get suicidal/depressed. I want to go back to taking Xanax when it happens. When I'm not at home I don't want to do it, but when I'm I want to drink a beer take two Xannies and watch a movie while I'm chatting on my phone then fall asleep and wake up middle of the night not being able to fall back to sleep. It sucks so much. Two days ago I attempted suicide. My mom stopped me. I was on 0.50mg xanax, 6 beers and one shot of whiskey. I also smoked few cigarettes. I don't smoke by the way. I never do it. Next two days were going really good. I had lots of stuff to do. I wasn't at home except for 2 hours. 
Today I had nothing to do and depression/suicide hit me again. I want to do it again. This time I don't want anyone to stop me. 
If someone could help me or is in similar situation I would be glad to talk to you.
