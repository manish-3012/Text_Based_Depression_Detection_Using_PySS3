Here we go again...Yesterday I had the headache. Today I've been crying. Tomorrow I'll want to kill myself. Then there'll be 2 weeks of dullness and feeling nothing.

I've been here countless times. Everytime I manage to get out of it. But it always comes back.

I've wanted to kill myself on and off for about 4 years now. At the start it was worse, I spent weeks or months at a time being almost constantly suicidal. I experimented, you could say, with self harm. I managed to stop myself after 3 consecutive times I was almost caught. Sometimes I still think it can help with all this.

After a while it settled into this cycle: first the headache, a weird loud thought that makes me feel tired. Then the crying, on and off throughout the day. Then the dark thoughts, suicide and self harm. Then the dull period, From a week to 2 months where i barely feel emotions other than dull sadness, nothing is interesting and I dont pay attention to anything important.

I have to thank my dog for his hugs and passive support over the last few years, but now I'm in uni, on my own. No dog, few friends (definitely no good friends), just me and my list of insecurities and my slow decline into the darkness.

I fucking hate this. The cycles are getting more frequent. Having been down this road before, knowing what happens and being unable to stop it just makes it worse.

I... Cant tell anyone. I know that there are people who will listen to me but I know they have shit going on in their life and I don't want to be the reason they're held back. I don't want my parents to think "where did we go wrong?" Or for people to treat me over sensitively just because I want to die.

Fuck this. Fuck all of it. Just fucking kill me already
