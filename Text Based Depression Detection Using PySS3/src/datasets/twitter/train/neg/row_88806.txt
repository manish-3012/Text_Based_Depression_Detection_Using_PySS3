I can't so this anymoreI just don't want to be alive I don't know what else to say nothing will help me to change my mind so really I'm using this as an outlet. I feel numb, nothingness constantly. The only reason I haven't done it is my family, and my dog. Actually scratch that, I do feel one thing, guilt. They do so much for me. They don't know I feel this way but still, they love me so much I can't bring myself to do it. I just exist this shitty existence that I had no say in being thrown into purely because of the guilt inside of me. Of feeling this way, but also if I was to kill myself, the guilt of making my family hurt. Please, can anyone recommend anything. I can't do this anymore but I don't want my family to hurt, please can anyone tell me a way to end my shitty horrible brain without hurting people. I need to be free
