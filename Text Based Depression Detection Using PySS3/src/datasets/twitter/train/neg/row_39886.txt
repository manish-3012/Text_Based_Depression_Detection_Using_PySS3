Some questions regarding suicideI've struggled with mental illness and suicidal ideation for a very, very long time. I had some questions on seeking help I guess.


If I go to the ER for help what will happen? The ER in my town has bad mental health care reviews I stumbled upon. Should I try to find another?
.. and now I forget all my questions. I'll update with more if I think of them. My mind is covered in such fog. Thanks to anyone who replies and in general everyone who helps on this subreddit.
