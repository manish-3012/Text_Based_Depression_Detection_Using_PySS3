I'm trying so hard, even when it seems like I'm notAll I've ever wanted is for someone to care about how I am. I'm never okay, and if the people in my life knew just how not-okay I am, they would take it personally. "Why can't I make you happy enough to want to live?" I'm sick of trying to be the strong one. I just want someone to ask me how I am, and just be there for me when I say I'm struggling, to know that it isn't there fault and be there for me. I don't want to hurt my family, but keeping it in is just hurting them anyway. Thank you for listening, I just need someone to know that I'm trying so fucking hard, even when it doesn't seem like I am.
