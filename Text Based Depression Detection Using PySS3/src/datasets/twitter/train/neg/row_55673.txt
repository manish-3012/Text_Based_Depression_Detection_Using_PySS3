30 dayHi I'm someone who has been contemplating suiside for a while now. I've tried to end it a total of 3 times but was stopped each time. I'm not looking for attention here only for help. I want to look for the good in life, but I feel like there is nothing to look for. So I've decided to give myself 30 days to find somthing worth living for can someone help me with this please. I just dont want to feel like my existence is a mistake.
