Not yetIs it still a watch if it's planned... to be executed in 10-15 years?

I'm so tired of life. All my time is spent trying to recapture those happy moments in the past. I just don't feel that happiness anymore -even going through the same motions.

My family is poor and I'm the only one making money so it's financially irresponsible to die right now... I thought about life insurance but they usually have clauses... but I finally realized that even if I commit suicide, my family can still inherit my 401k. It'll take a few more years but it might just be the kickstart they need.

Anyways, why does it always have to be about the sadness people left behind feel? Why can't people just understand that some people don't want this world?
