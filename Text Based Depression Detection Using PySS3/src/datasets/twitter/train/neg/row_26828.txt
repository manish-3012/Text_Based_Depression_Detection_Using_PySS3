I'm thinking that if I do this today or tomorrow, it might make things easier.I've called in sick from work, so no one's looking for me. I could leave everything behind in two seconds flat. i get shouted at by some of my friends when i say I'm nto feeling good anymore, and this has been coming for some time now. i'm just so fucking fed up and I want it all to end.

the only thing that really ties me to life is horror at the uncertainty of what happens next. I have to go through with this, though, because I'm miserable and want out. i've tried to be happy, but everything's broken down. I've lost the ability to handle it. I want to find a foolproof way of doing this without getting a firearm. i just want it all to stop.
