Anyone ever walk by the hospital/ER?Today I walked through the hospital and by the ER. Anyone do this? Sounds fucked up but I guess it's a comfort thing, knowing where I'd go. I like to think I'd go to the hospital when I'm feeling unsafe but at the same time I want to die so bad. I also used to go to group therapy down the road from this hospital, but had never actually gone in til today.
