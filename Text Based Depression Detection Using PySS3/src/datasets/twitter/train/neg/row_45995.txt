Controlling parent in adulthood ?My father has taken away my personal phone and internet for years now and i did n't complain one bit but still when we go to therapist , he says he watches too much internet on my phone (father's phone) .I wanted to get away from this medicine and therapist business because i am fine by myself. Therapist says that if this habit insist then he will admitted to addiction [ward. Dad](https://ward.Dad) wants me to follow 100 % his lifestyle .Study 24/7 , no internet or video games . I can do in balance thing but he wants to be slave and follow his order although i am 18 years old.

I never harm anyone or want to and mind my own business by exercising , reading ,surfing internet and playing video games.Why should i be dragged in psych ward for such things ? Because i watch internet too much? because i don't want to socialize now? . He wants me to socialize by force but i don't want to.I am fine by myself and happy the way i am. I am not a criminal to be dragged in ward for internet and video game. I do exercise ,read and keep good care of my body . Is that not enough to be a good person? Do i have to forcefully take part in society which i don't want to because i am stressful.

What to do with my parent behavior ? I NEVER harm anyone nor i am a criminal but i am treated as one for not taking part in society.What to do ? I am frustrated mentally and i can't take more of it.
