I hate happy advices on posts about depression/suicidal thoughtsLike look around you, you have so many people who love you! Talk to your loved ones.

Lol I don't have any. I have close people but they won't really love me enough to care. I talked to my friends about death(like after getting old/getting into an accident) as if it was just a light "what do you think" topic, and they said they have never really thought about it. This made me think how messed up I am now since I think about my own death almost every day/other day. I do get jealous of others who have a good support system, and that makes me feel even worse since I feel like a bad person who don't really deserve any of those good people.

Or drink water, make a routine, exercise, blah blah blah etc.etc. all the healthy stuff.

I do wish I could seek therapy. 

I'm a full time student and I don't have the time or resource to seek help either. I don't want my family to find out after my dad's insurance notifies him about any therapy/medication that I started. I'm only thinking of visiting my school counseling center, but am doubtful how much they could help me besides the option of moving on to a psychiatrist.

I'm just so tired of getting the same answers and advices, which won't really solve anything in my life or my mind. Thinking that therapy will only make me vent stuff and not change anything with my life makes me even more hopeless.

I don't want to kill myself, just want to sleep forever.
