I'm back...Had a big long heart to heart with my husband the other night. Promising me the moon. We will move out of the toxic environment whatever the cost, right now. Suddenly, I have a glimmer of a future! Husband is now slowly backpedaling on what he said. Nobody wants us and our pets, he wants a low price in the perfect spot. Of course I do as well but not at the cost of staying here. Which is killing me. So after one day of feeling strong and ready to take on the world, I'm back at the rock bottom dreaming of going to sleep and never waking up again. Now... i'm afraid to tell my husband I feel like this again because he'll just promise me the moon and take it away. OR try and get me medications. I would rather die feeling passionate about dying then live through life feeling like I want to die or feeling like a zombie.  

I've got to get my last affairs in order though. I want to try and die so it looks like an accident. That way my husband could collect life insurance and maybe actually move out. I don't want to suffer though and the only way I can think of is to "fall off" something. 

I feel like suicide is haunting me.
