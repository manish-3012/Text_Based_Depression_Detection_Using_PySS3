Suicidal but it's my little sister's promI'm this close to taking every pill in my apartment, but my little sister is going to prom this weekend, and she's so happy and I don't want to ruin it for her. I know it sound stupid, like it wouldn't ruin any other weekend, but there's something in the back of my head that imagines her in a therapists office saying she had to wear her prom dress to my funeral that's making me get through it. God, I hope I'm out of this depression by next week then.
