What if you kill yourself only to wake up a few minutes later being reborn in the next life?I have never believed in 'past lives' or 'future lives'...

But when it comes down to it... what if you finally end your life to come to peace and rest... only to be reborn? And to go through all the bullshit life has for you, all over again?

It makes me so angry. I feel as though that would be just my luck when I 'succeed'... to be reborn again. I'm so angry at the thought of that. It's terrifying.

That is my biggest fear.

Because if I commit suicide, I just want to rest. I want it all to go away.
