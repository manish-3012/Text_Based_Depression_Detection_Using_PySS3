Suicidal again and everyoneâ€™s sick of hearing it.Itâ€™s been five months since the last time Iâ€™ve had a conversation with anyone outside of work, school, my parents or a medical professional. Itâ€™s been five months since Iâ€™ve had a friend, or fuck, someone that I could at least hang out with. Iâ€™ve realized that Iâ€™ve spent most of my life alone, but five whole months without a single person who wants to be around me by choice? Itâ€™s fucking lonely.

And now Iâ€™m wondering, if all those commercials and brochures tell you to reach out to someone when youâ€™re having these thoughts, where am I supposed to go? I canâ€™t go to the hospital; itâ€™s only been a month since my last attempt and I know theyâ€™d keep me twice as long this time. I canâ€™t talk to my parentsâ€” they treat suicide like itâ€™s a personal offense to them. I donâ€™t have any friends. My therapist would report me. I donâ€™t have anywhere to go, and Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t know if I can make it through the night.

And the worst part is, if I were to die, how long would it take for anyone to find out? A week? A month? A year? No one checks in on me. No one texts or calls or anything. Iâ€™d probably rot alone in my room for days or even weeks before anyoneâ€™d even notice I was missing. And then what? Nothing, I guess. If they donâ€™t care about me now, they wonâ€™t care then.
