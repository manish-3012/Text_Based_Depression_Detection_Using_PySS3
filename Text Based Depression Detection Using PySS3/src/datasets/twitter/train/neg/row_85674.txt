I'll be honestI really have nothing to live for - just the fact I'm posting on here is proof.  I tried to find reasons to live - my biggest problem was loneliness and I tried to talk to people, but nobody seemed interested.  So, after getting to the point where I feel like all I'm doing is pestering those people and don't want to bother them anymore - all I can do is get this off my chest here.  Sadly - you people will probably take more notice to this then even my own family.  Here's hoping I can go through with this.
