I really cant say how much I dont want to die.I see many people here wanting to die cause of various reasons. But for me, its more about having to die instead of wanting to. I simply cant afford life anymore. Ive lost both my jobs, all my savings, and ive tried to get help from multiple people and places but being an immigrant from a third world country severely limits my chances. As it stands right now, my future is hopeless and i think iâ€™ll just die tonight. I dont want to but i dont have any other choice.
