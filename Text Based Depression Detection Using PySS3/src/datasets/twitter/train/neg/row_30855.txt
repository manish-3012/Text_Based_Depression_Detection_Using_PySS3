Friend of mine trying to commit suicide.My friend, technically my ex, has told me tonight that for almost 3 days straight, she was attempting to od on nyquil. The only reason she hasn't was because a friend was there to stop her all 3 of those days. Now tonight, I take her home from work and we're talking and laughing and having a good time, and she kisses me out of no where. She kisses me twice, 3x, 4. And hugging me a lot. She was saying she loves me. Now I've remained optimistic about us getting back together, but as I was leaving, I had an unnerving feeling that she was doing that as a final goodbye. So once I get home, I text her mom and asked that she check up on her. She says she's asleep. Okay, than I explain how "we both know she can be very emotional in times like this and we both know she let's her emotions get the better of her" so she goes to check on her again and finds the nyquil bottle in her room (wasn't there when I was). She says it's half empty. I tell her to check to make sure she is still breathing and she says she is. She than said she would keep a close eye on her.

Tldr; my ex has been having thoughts of suicide and I am wondering what I can do to help alleviate her pain from the break up.
