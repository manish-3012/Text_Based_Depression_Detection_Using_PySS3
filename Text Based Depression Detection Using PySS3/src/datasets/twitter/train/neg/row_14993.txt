Just in a dark placeThe only girl Iâ€™ve ever really talked to, and the only one Iâ€™ve ever liked moved away to New Zealand for 6 months to attend a bible college (which I didnâ€™t think would be a big deal because I had to move away until like September or October), with the last 3 of her journey being on an outreach in some under development country where there will be no internet, communication was here and there because of the time difference and because of our schedules...until the past few days the internet there went out for like the 5th time and itâ€™s been out for 3 days...I know it doesnâ€™t sound like a big deal but itâ€™s just been eating away with me...I just miss her and talking to her so much, Iâ€™m just so lonely as i moved away from home in NJ to Arizona, Iâ€™ve been thinking about death a lot recently. I just turned 18 on Friday and Iâ€™m playing pro baseball which is my life long dream and I had been playing good until recently when I just canâ€™t shake my off the field problems and have been struggling horribly...I should be loving life, but itâ€™s just not there and I just feel like I have no one to talk to
