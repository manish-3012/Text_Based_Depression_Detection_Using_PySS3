iâ€™ve had enoughiâ€™ve had enough from being alone,being broke,being forgotten,losing all of my friends,canâ€™t even cry these days. my parents donâ€™t like me anymore. i donâ€™t even have no one to tell these things iâ€™m just keeping them inside me. i wanna do it,i wanna go to sky,i might have friends over there. i just canâ€™t pretend. iâ€™m just tired.
