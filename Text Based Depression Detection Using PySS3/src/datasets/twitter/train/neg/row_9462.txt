Suicide and friendshipsI know this isn't solely my experience so  I am sure some one can relate to friends only being friends due to the knowledge that your suicidal. Basically I had a close friend who very early on discovered that i was suicidal and has been friendly with me not because they genuinely like me, but because they believed that I "might kill myself if they tried to break of the friendship". This just reaffirms the belief that nobody cares and your a burden anyone that says they do is just a liar that feels pity. Basically my point is I am done telling people or making it obvious until I am either gone or can develop a genuine friendship prior to the person knowing I am suicidal.
