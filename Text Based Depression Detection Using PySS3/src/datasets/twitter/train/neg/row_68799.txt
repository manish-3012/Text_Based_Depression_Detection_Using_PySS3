What is my problem? I seriously don't even get why I'm here right now(r/sucidewatch), I have a house that I recently purchased, I have a decent  car and a fiance who loves me but I feel there is something seriously wrong with me that has only gotten worst these last few weeks.

 I guess I should start out by saying me and my fiance had a break up over some cheating stuff that happen, we where both in the wrong , we both made mistakes but we talked it out and decided we love each other enough to get past stuff and we have a beautiful daughter we need to raise together.

  Sometimes stuff comes up like I will see a car that the guy she messed around with drives and I'll instantly get a small bit of rage but I fail to tell her what is really wrong with me to avoid a fight, or a story comes up that is closes to the time when stuff happen I'll get rage and lie about it, really just anything that reminds me what happens a small bit of rage hits me and I lie about it to avoid a fight but half the time the lie turns into a fight because its like she knows I'm liening but I'm only doing it to protect us because its stupid shit from the past. The same thing happens to her if anything reminds her of what I did to her but to her it doesn't happen much.

  The real problem I have is that there are 2 different version of me living inside of me. I have this really anger grumpy person who is literally set off by anything and then there is this realistic guy who love his family would do anything for his girls and is overall happy,the two personality meet at the worst time because I might be having a really good night and she might say something and there is this other side of me that answers with a really fucked up responds I didn't mean to use like for example yesterday she ask me to get her cookies which I though nothing of while I got up i looked at her and said you know sometimes I just can't stand the things you made me feel in the past, I fucking froze because i didn't even mean or want to say that.(I think about shit before I say it and it just came out of no where ???)  the problem is the happy guy really wants to eliminate the grumpy guy, sometimes I get so stressed out about shit I don't know what to do like I'm almost sure I need therapy for anger management because I'm consistently thinking suicide is the only option to end this. I'm miserably happy, what do I do?
