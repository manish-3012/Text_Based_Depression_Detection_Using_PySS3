Iâ€™m sorry dadThis is an overly long, cringy self-loathing mess, so donâ€™t even read it. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll end up being too pussy to even kill myself so idk if it even fits here.

The hardest part  is having to see my dad every day. I wont kill myself until he dies and it makes me so fucking sad and angry that I even think about hi dying. Hedoesnâ€™t know this but I hear him cursing every night because I just know that he hates how his life turned out. He worked his ass off every day for 35 years to provide for his family and what does he get? A wife who cheated thatâ€™s living with her new bf while my dad pays for all her expenses so she doesnâ€™t take the house, one recovering addict son, and me the other son, who has no aspirations, who canâ€™t finish a semester at community college or hold a job(btw Iâ€™m the reason our family fell apart). Itâ€™s not even like I didnâ€™t have opportunities to succeed, my dad made a lot of money to set me up for a good life and I just continue to throw it all away every day without fail. 

he still gets up and greets me with a smile every fucking morning pretending heâ€™s proud of me, talks to me and tries to help me with my future and puts in 100% effort to appear happy and strong to me. He never shows any weakness our doubt, but I know itâ€™s starting to have a tough time keeping the act up. Meanwhile Iâ€™m too ashamed to even look him in the eyes and give him more than 1 word answers when he wants to talk to me. He probably thinks I hate him. 

All Ive wanted for years now is to just do dope and die but I canâ€™t do that to him. He already went through hell putting my older brother through rehab and supporting him multiple times Iâ€™m afraid if I do that too itâ€™ll break him. Heâ€™s the kindest most honest hardworking person Iâ€™ve ever met, why does he deserve to suffer like that? Why canâ€™t I just succeed at something so he can actually be proud? 

I know he wonâ€™t mention this since Iâ€™m only 20 but I know he wishes he could have grandkids. But heâ€™s almost 70 and times running out. If I could do anything for him that would make him proud that would probably be it. But I canâ€™t even get a girl. I donâ€™t even want it for me anymore because every girl eventually realizes that Iâ€™m an insecure pussy and just(understandably) makes fun of me for it.I just want him to feel proud of something. Itâ€™s  not because Iâ€™m unattractive because Iâ€™m honestly half decent looking, but because Iâ€™m a fucking loser with no social skills. Of the girls I have been with, none of them have taken me seriously, or even been attracted to me. And I donâ€™t blame them, Iâ€™m a weak little bitch and I could never even satisfy them in bed. 


Itâ€™s been years since he last expected anything of me. Now he just tells me he wants me to be happy, but I canâ€™t even do that. I know heâ€™s embarrassed about me, but heâ€™ll never admit it to anyone. Heâ€™s rather be a laughing stock than put me down for anything. Heâ€™s the only reason I hope thereâ€™s an afterlife because he deserves to go to heaven for putting up with this. 

I really wish he couldâ€™ve had a different son, because he deserves better and I donâ€™t deserve the amazing things he gave me.
