Effects of sexual abuse by older sister are creeping up on me.I was sexually "abused" by my older sister (she's 2 years older than me) when I was about 8 years old until I was 11 years old approximately. 

I don't remember everything well but I do remember being her sex slave which included me kissing her, vaginal and anal stuff, role playing, etc. 
The part that hurts me is that I learned to enjoy it, even though some stuff (like the anal stuff) disgusted me greatly. 
Mentally I categorize it under "sexual experimentation" but there's another part in me that categorizes under abuse. 

I hate myself everday and feel "dirty" all the time because of this. I tried committing suicide when I was 14 years old (I'm 27 now) because of what happened and my inability to feel good about myself.

The other part that hurts me is that she pretends it never happened. I visit my parents about once a week and she still lives at home and she never apologized. It's likely she thinks I don't remember or that she actually does categorize it mentally under "sexual experimentation".

The reason I'm posting here is that I'm just exhausted. I'm an extreme people pleaser and I'm stuck in the pattern of not saying anything when people do something that hurts me. I think it's related to the sexual abuse but I'm not sure. I'm not sure of anything except death really. I do know that I'm currently in pain and I do want to the pain to stop.
