thoughts..itâ€™s christmas..everybody is happy with their family while me iâ€™m in my room fucking crying..just thinking about everything going on with life..

i miss my ex gf so much..she already has somebody else and itâ€™s been a couple months since we broken up..but i donâ€™t blame her i was so shitty to her..i fucked up with her like i do with everything 

i literally just feel like ending it all right now..

i think soon will be time where it will happen
