Im not sure I have a futureWhenever I think of the future I only think of me having killed myself or being a dead-beat hobo on the side of the road too scared to ask of anything from anyone. Right now in my life I cant get a job because who knows why, every job I have applied to never calls back or straight up turns me down. Around 5 mins ago I applied to UPS and the website didnt even tell me they would get back to me. It immediately said no. Im not trying to get a job for myself im trying to help my parents, because nearly everytime I walk out of my room I hear my parents talking about what they can do to pay this next gas bill or electric bill. I could care less about getting the new iphone I just want to help my parents but I cant. I cant even get an education because I stop myself, my anxiety has gotten to the point where I have not attended a full day of schooling since around 8th or 9th grade. Im the only one that can improve myself but I cant even do that. Im going to die a worthless individual with nothing to show for himself but this post saying how worthless he is. I cant even speak up about this to my parents because I have a hard time telling anyone how I feel even my therapist when it comes to my depression. I dont know what im going to do or where my life is going except down into a pit of self-pity and constant suicidal thoughts. Ive thought about calling a suicide hotline but im too scared too. I dont want them to bring cops to the house. Im sure im too scared to tell anyone about this because one jackass I knew called called the cops on me while telling me he was "coming over to hang out" and now i dont trust anyone with this. and besides that im too scared to talk to anyone i dont know.
