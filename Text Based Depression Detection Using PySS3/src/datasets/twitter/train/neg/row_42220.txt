I just can't anymoreThe only thing that is making me depressed is school,I'm in the second year of high school and I'm just exhausted
It's been only 2 days of school since I came back from the holiday's and my body is already hurting and have an almost constant headache.
Every day when I wake up and go to bed I just want to kill myself,I cry when I wake up and when I go to sleep.School is very stressful for me.

Unfortunately homeschooling is not an option and dropping out would be very risky atm.
I am just stuck for 2-3 more years in this and I don't know if I can take it,every day is just pain to me.

I know it will get better,what I need is the power to somehow go through school or find an alternative not to just know that it will get better and be fine and dandy.
