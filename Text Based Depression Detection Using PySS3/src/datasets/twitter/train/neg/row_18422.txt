I want to die.My life is hopeless and worthless. Im fucking useless. I'm such a waste of fucking space. I'm near 30 and don't have any career ambitions. I'm poor as shit and can't afford to live on my own or move anywhere. I've been single for a decade and I'm such a fucling pathetic, fugly, unlovable loser that not even trash online dating platforms can change that. Im a lost cause. I really REALLY wish I had the courage to end mybown life.
