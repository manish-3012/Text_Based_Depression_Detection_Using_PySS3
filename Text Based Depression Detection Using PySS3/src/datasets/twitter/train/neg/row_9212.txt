Didn't realize today was Christmas.When I found out, I just thought "today would be a bad day to end it" but it's been on my mind all day. I feel so alone. Why can't I just end it? I want it over. I want it to be over. I'm tired, I'm tired of all of it. Why do I still have to be here? I want it over...
