I was totally cool with not existing.I can't believe my parents were genuinely like "yeah our kid will have a totally awesome and happy life" 

MENTAL ILLNESS HAS TAKEN SO MUCH FROM ME and I can't fucking take it anymore

Awesome, I exist, now I get to work myself to the point of never feeling good enough and lament the years and experiences lost to the shit brain that keeps me in this hellhole (I can't hardly remember my teenage years!! It's all a fucking blur!! Those were supposed to be my best days and I can't even remember anything behind senior year and a few small details!! And now here I am in college trying to be a whole ass human with a personality and I can't because SO MUCH IS MISSING!!!) 

Living was a mistake and I was perfectly content not existing but HERE I AM and I HATE IT THANKS

Idk why I keep crawling back to this subreddit. Probably because I'm scared of myself. Probably just because I want someone who gets it. But i'm so fucking tired and I can't take it anymore.
