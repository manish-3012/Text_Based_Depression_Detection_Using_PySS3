my wife deserves better.. I could help her on the way out...M wife's great, I am not. Can we let that suffice? There's no way I could recount to you the full version of our relationship. She will be a wonderful, producing member of society and will help many, many people, and I will do nothing.

So, maybe I can help her out (given that she deserves someone better than me). If I were to become a person that my wife does not want to be married to (trying to avoid things that would have a permanent effect on her... more along the lines of 'dealbreaker' or 'undesirable' characteristics), perhaps it would convince her to leave me, but ALSO make her feel good for leaving a relationship that is not healthy for her. We have no pre-nupt, and I would be the one instigating the problems, and I would admit that at the divorce, and stage a big to-do about her student debt, after which I would *grudgingly* accept to pay.

At this point, my wife (now ex) would no longer be in any debt, convinced that she is better out of the relationship, and looking out at the world with new eyes.

Now, I'm not sure on the stipulations of when a person in debt commits suicide, but I could either grind away to pay off the debt and then off myself, OR just off myself then, and the debt cannot be allocated to her because we are no longer related. The catch, is that I need to make sure it doesn't look like suicide... IF it were to look like a suicide, then my friends and family would probably be even more devastated and hurt, than if I died from 'unfortunate circumstances'.  But I'm fond of the wilderness, so I'm sure I could get myself into a life-threatening jam if I wanted to.

Again, given that I know she can do better, who loses here? We have no kids, and to be honest, I don't really have many friends. My death would be probably sadden my family, but 'unfortunate circumstantial deaths' happen all of the time, and they are much easier to get over than suicides...

covered all the bases?
