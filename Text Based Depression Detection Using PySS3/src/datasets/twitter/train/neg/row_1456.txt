Think this is itGuess Iâ€™ll just introduce myself first


My nameâ€™s Daniel. Iâ€™m turning seventeen this year. Iâ€™ve dealt with depression and anxiety (both diagnosed) since I was 13. Iâ€™ve had 4 therapists, none of them helped. I grew up in a nice house in the countryside with a good family, good income, etc. Started self harming and starving at 13/14. I used to be the smart kid when I was younger but now Iâ€™m just a fucking idiot. I failed exams last year and Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ve failed all of them this year. I have no talents and no hobbies besides writing stupid stories. I feel like all my friends really hate me and see me as an embarrassment to be around. 

Iâ€™m hideous and fat and ugly and ridiculously short for a guy. Iâ€™ve had one relationship. I think I fucked up a friendship with my close friend the other night because I got way too drunk and Iâ€™m terrified I said some shit or was an embarrassment but I canâ€™t even remember half the night. I donâ€™t know what to do with my life in the future, and I never have. I have an older brother whoâ€™s studying law and graduating and heâ€™s the perfect son. I only feel good when Iâ€™m drunk but have breakdowns and severe anxiety once Iâ€™m sober again. My teachers hate me and they all have even since I was young. Iâ€™ve never done anything good in my life or done anything to make anyone proud. Iâ€™m annoying, ugly, lazy, embarrassing, hopeless and a waste of a life. 

I think Iâ€™m just coming to my end. Iâ€™m drinking more and at this rate Iâ€™m just gonna hit up the junkies at school and do whatever I can get my hands on. Iâ€™m a disappointment of a child and I hate that my family actually cares. 

I almost relapsed and almost did it earlier on a whim. I was gonna do it, but I couldnâ€™t find a blade and couldnâ€™t bring myself to find any strong medication so here I am, being a little bitch and venting online.
