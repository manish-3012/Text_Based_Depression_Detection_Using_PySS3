This is it, I should really do it nowI want something to change. I canâ€™t keep living this miserable life. My family doesnâ€™t give a shit so why should I. I really should do it right now. I have a knife besides me and my mom told me to go screw myself. Ha I guess sheâ€™s gonna feel really bad once she finds me. That will probably take a few days since she never check on me.

Anyway, I want something to change and this is the change I need right now. Itâ€™s too much work to start developing as a person and all of that fucking shit you have to do to improve your life. Nothing helps and no one is gonna help me. Iâ€™m gonna cut my arms open. I want peace so badly. Iâ€™m probably not gonna go through with it, but I really fucking want to.
