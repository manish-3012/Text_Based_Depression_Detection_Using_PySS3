please help mei feel as if i have been hated throughout my entire life. i was bullied a lot in gradeschool and it got so bad that they would actually physically hurt me. I would come home and neither of my parents cared, would say "toughen up"  or something along those lines. I thought once i got to highschool it would get better since i wouldn't see any of my grade school bullies, but it actually got worse. it really hurts to say this but i was sexually assaulted by a group of boys and i never told anyone. After that, i would have a panic attack if any male would even look at me. I've gotten better now that im out of highschool but now i feel like im such a waste of space and my whole life has been people who just use me to make themselves feel better.
