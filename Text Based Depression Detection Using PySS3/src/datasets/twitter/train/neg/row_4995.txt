Someone to talk to would be nice.I've had feelings of "ending it" for a long time now, and some weeks are more regular then others. It seems to coincide with lack of sleep; I used to think it was triggered by financial reasons however I seem to have suicidal thoughts despite the amount of zeros my paycheck ends with.
I have a wife and child and a secure job, but this doesn't do much to fight away the thoughts. And they are scary thoughts, and quick ones too, like "what if I just carry through this red light". 
Some advice would be nice, I think? I'm not entirely sure. I'm thinking by talking about this I can at least find a method to hold it all back a little, because I don't want to die, really. 
Maybe a recommendation
