i donâ€™t know....hello,
i donâ€™t have anyone irl to talk to so i guess iâ€™ll just rant here 
iâ€™m 16 years old  
i feel so lost....
i feel like a disappointment to everyone. i wanted to just live life like a normal teenage girl. i can tell that my parents are disappointed in me....i didnâ€™t do anything for my 16th birthday, i didnâ€™t go to prom and i skipped my last day of school when everyone was saying goodbye to each other. i feel like such a waste of life, like i could have been something. i was an intelligent child but now iâ€™ve just become a depressed anxious mess who is afraid of everything and has no talent or social skills and is likely going to kill herself at 16
i just feel so separated from everything else, like iâ€™m on one side of a window watching everyone else enjoy their lives and be happy and iâ€™m desperately trying to break the glass and join them but i canâ€™t. at this point i donâ€™t even feel like iâ€™m living. i feel like every day that passes is just counting down to the day that i finally snap and go through with it 

these sad feelings are a permanent problem for me...iâ€™ve been depressed for a few years now and have thought about suicide even when my life was decent. i just feel like i donâ€™t belong and no matter what iâ€™ll do iâ€™ll never be happy. itâ€™s getting worse and worse. iâ€™ve given up on all my ambitions because i just donâ€™t care anymore. i had important exams recently and i havenâ€™t gotten my results back but i already know that iâ€™ve gotten bad grades because i had no motivation to study.
 
i did have one thing to keep me alive during all my worst moments..thereâ€™s this singer that i really like and i always promised myself that i would see him live no matter what, and thatâ€™s such a simple goal but it gave me something to look forward to. however he committed suicide a few months ago and now that one small thing that kept me going is gone forever. i know i sound silly but itâ€™s small things like that which just add up and eventually push you off the edge.

i used to have the perfect group of friends...we had the same interests sense of humour and weâ€™d do things together often etc..itâ€™s a long story but theyâ€™re not my friends anymore and now i donâ€™t have anyone at all and iâ€™m so lonely every day. i feel like iâ€™m going insane because iâ€™m so isolated and iâ€™m the only person i know who doesnâ€™t have any friends to go out with this summer....my dad is in hospital and my mum works every day so i canâ€™t even do anything with my family. iâ€™m home alone every day and i can feel myself going insane because i have nothing to do and no one to talk to

iâ€™m going to a new school in september which means i have to start over and make completely new friends. iâ€™m scared....iâ€™ve gotten less confident when talking to people and donâ€™t trust people as easily anymore after my old friends left me. iâ€™ve always managed to make friends and now i feel so pathetic because i have no idea how the fuck i did it,, like where did i just find these people who happened to share my interests and enjoyed my company as much as i enjoyed theirs. the whole concept of meeting new people and forming relationships with them is so alien to me now

i have other problems too, i have anxiety and a phobia which iâ€™ve had since i was very young but it seems to just be getting worse..and now i donâ€™t eat as much because food triggers my phobia and it stresses me out to eat. this makes me more depressed because i know that iâ€™m not living life to the fullest...i avoid so many things that are enjoyable simply because of this stupid phobia controlling my life. i donâ€™t know how to deal with it anymore. iâ€™ve tried telling my parents about it but they donâ€™t think itâ€™s important. iâ€™m bad at communicating my feelings so i struggle with explaining how bad things really are for me. even now as iâ€™m writing this i still feel like i havenâ€™t gotten my point across and that i wonâ€™t be taken seriously 

i know iâ€™m only young but i really canâ€™t see things getting better. iâ€™ve waited and iâ€™ve tried to make things better for so long but it just doesnâ€™t work. im constantly screaming for help and no one is there. iâ€™m weak, iâ€™m giving up. i canâ€™t do this anymore. im so scared of killing myself but i know i have to do it. i just wish that my life could have been more fulfilling. idk what iâ€™m expecting from posting on here but oh well
