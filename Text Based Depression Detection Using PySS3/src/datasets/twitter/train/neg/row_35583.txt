What to doI have struggles with suicidal thoughts for over half my life, and lately it has gotten so severe that I am scaring myself. I am 24 and have severe BPD, anxiety, and depression. I haven't left my house in over a month because my anxiety has gotten so out of control. 

Little back story, I have a fiancÃ© who can't keep it in his pants, and cheated on me while I was out of state having a Medical procedure. Which caused me to have a full emotional shut down. I go from being completely numb to feeling everything and making a suicide plan, within minutes. 

I am unable to leave my home which caused me to lose my job and I have been alone a lot since I have been back in town after my procedure. The state I live in doesn't have insurance for non working 20 something's with mental health problems. 

I am trying to find a way to release without hurting myself and feel that I'm running out of options. My fiancÃ© doesn't know what to do so he just ignores me. And if I try to find way to make myself a tiny bit better he tells me it's wrong. I just want to stop thinking about these horrible things!
