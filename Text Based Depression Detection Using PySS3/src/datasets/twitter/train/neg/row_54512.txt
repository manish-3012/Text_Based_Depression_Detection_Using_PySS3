It is all so pointless really...Everything is starting to feel pointless.
I can do this or that and I might feel better temporarily, but then it's back to hopelessness. 
I look around and all I see is pain, and struggle, and people staying busy to avoid thinking and feeling how I do. 
I don't want to live a life where I'm just doing things to avoid feeling depressed.
What kind of life is that?
I think maybe a better job, more money, more friends, more hobbies will help, but I've had them all and it's still the same. 
There is this deep sense that none of this matters. 
My life doesn't matter.
The little bit I contribute to society does not matter. 
I'm alone.
I'm empty.
I'm numb.
I'm bored.
I just feel like giving up.
