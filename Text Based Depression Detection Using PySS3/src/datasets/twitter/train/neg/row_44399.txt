17 years old, autism, social anxiety...Hello,

Ever since I was little I had trouble going to school, my parents say that in kindergarten I always cried a lot when being dropped off at school...Later on during my (short-lived) school career I remember being quite anxious during classes (at times) and being alone on the playground a lot of the time, I used to walk around the playground by myself a lot when my 2 other friends were still eating during the midday meal or when they were playing with other kids.

A few years after that I started to pretend to be sick so I wouldn't have to go to school as much (I knew I didn't like to go to school for some reason...but I didn't fully realise why I felt so bad at school...It was strange.) Then when I transitioned to a new school I started getting more and more anxious about going to school and being around other kids/teachers, a teacher noticed and spoke to me about it and I started crying, from then on I basically haven't gone to school.

I was diagnosed with autism soon after by a Psychiatrist and I went to a few different psychiatrists/psychologists but nothing really helped...Then a government organization called 'Youth help' (roughly translated) got involved after not going to school for a while...They offered me 4 hours of home-schooling / week, which I really do appreciate, but it hasn't been easy always following lessons because of anxiety and / or being tired because of staying up all night. Since I rarely go outside I don't lose much energy so it can be hard for me to sleep, even if I try.

I'm 17 now, apart from trying to follow lessons, all I ever do is listen to music and / or play games, a few years ago I tried to learn a few things like programming, scripting for a game...But I'm just too stupid to do any of those things well.
Even if I were to follow those 4 hours of home-schooling / week It'd still be hard for me to ever get a high-schoool diploma considering how stupid I am.

I guess I just wanted to share my story.

I've been thinking about suicide lately but I doubt I will act on my thoughts in the near future, thank You for reading and sorry for my poor writing skills.
