I am a failure. I only hurt others. Why should I live? I only hurt others. My mistakes hurt others. People hate listening to me. No one likes how I cope, because I hurt others. I canâ€™t think straight. My head is full of sour. It wonâ€™t stop. It wonâ€™t go away. I donâ€™t know what sweet is, or what honey is, anymore. Love isnâ€™t real to me or for me. I only feel lust, or dependency. Iâ€™m not a good person. I want to cling to people but canâ€™t. Iâ€™m too self-aware. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster. Iâ€™m a fucking monster.

I hate myself. I hate everything that I do. I hate everything I have done. I am not a success. I have never succeeded. I have failed to rise above my station and my lot in life. I have disappointed everyone that I know. I have ruined myself. I have unknowingly tried to ruin others. Why should a ruinous thing be allowed to live? Am I not cancer? I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer. I am cancer and I consume and must be destroyed.
