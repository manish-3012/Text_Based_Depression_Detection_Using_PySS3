I really just wish someone gave a fuck about meThis is my throwaway account thatâ€™s why it has jake Paul as the name itâ€™s a joke 


I remember when I was a kid and I thought Iâ€™d have a wife or girlfriend when I grew up, what a fucking joke. Instead here I am stuck in my fucking room because of the fucking dumbass quarantine and no school just wanting to kill myself because no one gives a shit about me

Iâ€™ve started texting this girl that I asked out and she of course rejected me because Iâ€™m a lowlife piece of shit. She always hits me up first and sheâ€™s the only reason basically I have any hope at all except deep down I know she doesnâ€™t give a fuck about me and will never love a useless loser like me

Because of the fucking pandemic I donâ€™t even have soccer, the only thing that kept me going every week, the only time when I feel myself and can express myself and donâ€™t want to fucking kill myself. My best friend has just ghosted me the last few weeks and Iâ€™m completely alone, the only person that even texts me is this girl but she wonâ€™t hang with me and even if she wanted to she couldnâ€™t because of the quarantine. 

Iâ€™m not gonna make it through 3 more weeks of this I just wish I had a gf who cares about me and would hold me close and tell me itâ€™s gonna be ok and I wish I could say this stuff to my friends but Iâ€™m a man and I canâ€™t show emotion or I look like a pussy, I just want to cuddle with a girl and be warm and happy Iâ€™m such a loser idk I just want to be happy again itâ€™s been so long
