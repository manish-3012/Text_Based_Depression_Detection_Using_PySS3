Need advice for the next few days.Even though my life on one side seems to be improving, I am experiencing more frequent desire to escape life through suicide. It has been almost every day this week. I have many worries, some of them are probably overblown but others might be legitimate. I have lifelong depression and I can't seem to take care of myself. It takes a lot of effort to even do one thing a day if it means leaving my apartment. I am usually very poor, and I live in a lousy apartment in a gang neighborhood and I am worried about that. I'm worried that the girl I like may actually like me back and I have a lot of fears about getting my heart broken, because I lose my mind, I lose all preference of living or dying when that happens.

I am currently suicidal, but I think if I'm careful I will make it through the night. What I need is some advice for the next few days, because I am worried about the progression of these thoughts if this keeps up.

Thanks for helping.
