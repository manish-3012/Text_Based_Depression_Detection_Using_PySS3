I haven't seen my partner in three months, my dysphoria is out of control, and thoughts of suicide are swarming my head.Before I get into everything I'd like to state that I am autistic, diagnosed with severe depressive disorder, anxiety, and a FTM. With everything going on I'm feeling things alot harder then usual.

It's honestly a miracle I'm alive today. My partner and I met almost two years ago at a inpatient hospital for the same reasons and we've been thriving ever since. With quarantine being up and neither of us able to drive we haven't seen eachother.
I have no friend to talk to or see besides them, while they do. So it's really hard to see them hang out with friends.
Their parents will let then see their friends but won't let me come over because of us being 45 miles apart.


I actually fell sick with pneumonia right before March 7'th and had to stay home from school and my partner four extra weeks before lockdown.
They still fully support me and love me but I still feel so empty and I haven't been held in so long I can't even stand when my parents give me a hug. I know that sounds odd but I'm not a very huggy person. The only person who holds me is my partner.

I feel hopeless still and everything hurts. This doesn't end. I wasn't able to see a movie with them on my birthday. I don't know when I can see them again.
I want to die so I can stop this horrible loop of suffering  but I know they need me as much as I need them.
I want to dissapear.
