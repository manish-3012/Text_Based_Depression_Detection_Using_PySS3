I overdosed yesterdayI tried to end my life yesterday with 15 tablets of thyroxine and I fell asleep and I only had a headache, did it not work or were they just not strong enough. I don't actually wanna die now so I hope nothing's going to be serious I just need to know if I'll be alright or is it too late to save me
