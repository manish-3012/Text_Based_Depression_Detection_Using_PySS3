I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m missingIâ€™m just empty inside. 3 years, I donâ€™t know why either. Iâ€™ve thought about ending it all so many times, and Iâ€™m still thinking about it as I write this but I know I never will because of my family and loved ones around me.

Iâ€™m 20 years old. A college student. A hopeful medical student (but that seems further away day by day). One of two sons. I have great parents, and a great brother. They give me everything I need, want, and more. I never have to worry about my next plate of food. Where Iâ€™m going to stay. How Iâ€™m going to get somewhere. How Iâ€™m going to pay for college and medical school. Everything in life is given to me. I should be so thankful, and so happy. But somehow, Iâ€™m still not. 

I have a beautiful girlfriend, who I see myself with for the rest of my life. Sheâ€™s doing great stuff with her life, and together I can see a flourishing future and so does she. Again, I should be so thankful, and so happy. But somehow, Iâ€™m still not. 

What am I missing? The question that keeps me up all the time. How with these relationships and people, everything material I need and want, am I still not happy inside? I donâ€™t know, but I want to know. I want to be able to fix it because I hate being this way. 

This just touches the skin of it, but I really donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m missing. Hopefully I can find it sooner rather than once itâ€™s too late.
