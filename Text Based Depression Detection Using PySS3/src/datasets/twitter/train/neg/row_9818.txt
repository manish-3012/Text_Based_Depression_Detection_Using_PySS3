Married and doneI got married earlier this month, so I should be happy. Problem is, my life has reached a dead end and I don't see the way out.

We're living at my parents, both of us unemployed and without a chance to get employed (no respectable experience, no career path, and this damn virus). My only dream is to get the fuck out of here to my wife's home country, but it'll take months to get my visa, and then there's the virus - not the optimal time for a move, is it? It feels like I'm going to be stuck here forever.

I don't hate my family, but we have many differences and I want to live my own life. We used to live on our own, but due to personal circumstances we came back to my family house. It seems it was a mistake.

Unemployment is getting to me. I've tried applying in various places, with no success. I want to be a translator, but freelance life is tough. I don't know how to find clients, advertise myself, operate a business, pay my taxes. I want to last until I can move away from here. But god fucking dammit, I'm stuck here for now and I feel like life is passing me by. Maybe some of you can relate. What a joke this is.
