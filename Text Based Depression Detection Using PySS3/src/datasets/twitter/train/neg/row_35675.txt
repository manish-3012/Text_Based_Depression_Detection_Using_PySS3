QuestionI made a post about this a little while ago but i did it while completely out of it so iâ€™ll keep my question short here.. well try.

Dose anyone else genuinely feel like they dont belong in this world? 

The world is changing, views and ideals, on the surface its great, people and animals getting more rights ect, but then you look deeper and find so much hatred and toxicity. To the point im not proud of being bi or being a furry because of the communities and the former friends i had there. 

Every day it just gets worse. After four years of psychological hell- and to a lesser extend my entire life till now, i thought adults would be mature. But idk anymore. Once i wanted to end it because i wanted to escape abuse and constant terror, now i want to do it to escape the world. 

I want to be anything but human, because i have very little love left for a majority of the human race. A dreamless eternal sleep would be so much better than seeing this world fall into chaos any more. 

Iâ€™m not getting a happy ending. Thats all i know anymore.
