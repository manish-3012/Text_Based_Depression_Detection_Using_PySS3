I don't want to liveIt's 4:39 am. I don't have a bad life. I'm selfish and inconsiderate, blahblahblah. I don't want to live. Life is a chore to me. Even if it isn't bad. It's just. It's still not what I want. Nothing is ever enough for me. 

I just don't want to live. I don't know what to do. Should I just kill myself? Should I just take the little money I have and run? Should I just tell my psychiatrist to up my dose? Should I break up with the only man who has ever loved me and break his heart for no goddamn reason? I feel trapped. I want to be free. I want to be not alive. Death feels like freedom.

I don't know what to do.
