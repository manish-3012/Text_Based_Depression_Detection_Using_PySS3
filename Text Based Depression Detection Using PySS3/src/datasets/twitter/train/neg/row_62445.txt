Need help now, I think this person I'm talking to did something bad.. he's being suicidal and I am not good at this.We're chatting. Only started talking a week ago. Tonight he hit me with a wall of depressing stuff (I'd post but I don't know where he lurks) but basically the "I've never been with a girl at all, no friends, no life" stuff. 

Welp, in the middle of this post, he logged off. If anyone is good at stalking I could really use your help, maybe to find him online elsewhere and somehow tell his sister or something. I don't know. I don't know how to handle this, what to do. I will gladly post whatever communication you need in a PM, but please help me.
