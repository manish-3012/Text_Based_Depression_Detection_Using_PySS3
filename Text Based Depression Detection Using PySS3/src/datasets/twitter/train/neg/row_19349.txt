Have you ever fantasized?Have you ever fantasized about it?  Had it consume your every thought? Played out different scenarios and felt the peace through the fantasy that the pain was over.  I don't think I could ever do it, but my thoughts are consumed.  I have played out half a dozen scenarios, to the detail.  Watched myself through my minds eye, saw the release and the peace and longed for it.  Have you ever wished for them to just happen to you, knowing you could never fulfil it on your own.  But dreamed and pleaded for it to come to your front door?  I've been waiting for my day to come and it never does, my pain and hurt and anxiety just build everyday...  Who know maybe one of these days ill grow a pair and finally fulfil one of those thoughts, until then only in my mind.
