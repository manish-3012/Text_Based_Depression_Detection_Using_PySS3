I Can Never Escape MyselfThe memories never fade, my body remembers it and so do I. All of it. Every blow, every threat, every word, every bit of it. Seared into my soul, engraved in my consciousness, woven into the fabric of my being. 

I just want to burn it all, get rid of it all, even if I have to get rid of myself in the process.
