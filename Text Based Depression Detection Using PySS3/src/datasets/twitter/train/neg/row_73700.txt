TiredI've been feeling tired and unhappy ever since I can remember.

I've tried everything. Years of therapy. So many antidepressants. It never helped. I shouldn't be this unhappy, I don't want to be tired like this forever but it does not get better.

I will overdose soon. Opiates, benzodiazepines, alcohol, promethazine. It will probably take a long time before anyone will even notice me being gone.

To you, the reader: Please take care of yourself if you can. And thank you for listening to me.
