What's the point?I'm 18, my brother is 15. The 15 year old brother is going to get a job before me, because I'm a lazy piece of shit that can't get simple things done. I just sit around playing video games and sleeping in the day. No matter how much I try not to, I seem to ruin what little positive relationships I have with friends I care about, and it's eating at me more and more. I never thought I'd be as horrible as I am now, but here I am, I've always had really bad depression and it's been tearing at my soul for the longest time, leaving me unmotivated to do anything. I want to end it all so I would stop hurting people with my being a burden to everyone I know. They'll feel upset with me dying but hey, they'll forget about it in like a month or two and I'll finally stop being such a burden. I just hope my unmotivation doesn't bite me in the ass and prevent me from doing it
