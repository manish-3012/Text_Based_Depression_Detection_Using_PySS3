Owning an entity is fucking workâ€¦and I just want everything to stop. End this simulation, delete my avatar and roll the end credits. Thanks for involving me, itâ€™s pure work and no fun. Iâ€™ve lost consciousness for a few times, it felt great minus the waking part. You wake up in hospital and your first thought is â€œoohâ€¦fuck.â€ And you deal with the consequences, which consist of more and even less desirable work.

Yeah Iâ€™ll pass the waking part, eternal demise on ice please.
