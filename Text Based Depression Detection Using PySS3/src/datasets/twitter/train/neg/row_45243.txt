Have It All. Not Any BetterI have everything I ever wanted except happiness. I'm super far drunk right now so forgive me if I spell anything wrong. I have a good job, a good income. I had a love life up until recent (and before, not new to me) but it will never work out. Earlier things in my life kinda destroyed any hope for a normal relationship romantically. I work hard as I can day and night to make a secure life but never really stopped to ask who I was building all that for. Now that I'm secure financially and in my career it just leaves me in thought mode. Thoughts alone to myself. The scene in "walk the line" about "you have nothing" really hits home, "big house... big car... all empty, nothing...". I understand now why celebs kill themselves. You have all the riches and fame in the world and you're still unhappy, so now what?I've been to therapy and even that seemed like just another grab for my money. You can bet your ass on my worst week when I missed therapy nobody checked in as long as I paid the bill. But come my last session all she cared about was whether I would pay for the hour missed. 

I have nothing and nobody except my money which I used to love but now I hate. I really just need somebody, anybody to help. I helped a fellow redditor a while back, hoping it would make me feel good. I still hate it all, want to die and be done with the suffering. My problem is I have plenty of options, but I don't see any of them being as blissful as death. 

Don't worry I'm not going to end it tonight, but I've been considering it heavily. If I reach that point I certainly wont be posting on reddit.
