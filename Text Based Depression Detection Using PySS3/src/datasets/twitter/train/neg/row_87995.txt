I want to die so hard, I'm living in constant painI'm in such pain that it's starting to feel physical. My life sucks and it's only getting worse. I hate thinking that everyone is living their best lives while I hate to deal with my misery every day all day long. I suffer of severe depression, body dismorphia and eating disorders. Not only I'm not good at anything, my personality sucks and my body sucks as well too ( if not worse ). I'm not even able to have decent human relationships and I'm basically just a fucking loser. I've been trying to get help as much as I can, even with professionals, but the only thing that they keep telling me is that everything is temporary and everything will get better sooner or later ( even though I've been dealing with all of this for 8 years so I don't believe them, because I doubt they really understand me even though I keep explaining and explaining ). Anyways, everyday is just a fucking torture and I should absolutely end everything as soon as I can because I am so fucking tired. Also DO NOT SAY TO JUST HANG ON BECAUSE EVERYTHING WILL GET BETTER OR THAT I CAN DO IT, BECAUSE IT'S BULLSHIT AND IT WON'T HAPPEN. If you say that, or that life is actually beautiful or that I should try to """JUST BE POSITIVE U.U""", let me tell you something: FUCK YOU!
As soon as I find something effective to end this fucking misery, I'm gonna do it and no one will stop me.
