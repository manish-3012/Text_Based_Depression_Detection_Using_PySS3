I don't have time for this...Every visit I go to see my psychiatrist or therapy session gets more bothersome because I know I should be open and honest but at times I feared that I could end up going back to inpatient in the Mental Health care unit. I just needed to stay afloat for the next two/three weeks until my college spring semester is over. I couldn't bear to drop everything and miss a ton of work at college. But yeah, I feel like that I am lying at every visit and couldn't tell them that I tried killing myself but it failed or that I'm still cutting and had a relapse with my bulimia or bruising myself. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm stuck. I honestly don't have the time to put my life on hold and get much more intensive care for myself.
