When you're suicidal at workI was admitted for a few months earlier this year and since my return have put all of my effort into proving I'm worth my weight around here - to my team and to my bosses. I'm finally being respected and included. It's really hard to keep the "brave face" on when you're one-track minded as I am today especially and I'm scared of the people around me are noticing. There's no one that I can talk to. All of my usual coping strategies are either not working or are unavailable and I just want to go home to bed.
