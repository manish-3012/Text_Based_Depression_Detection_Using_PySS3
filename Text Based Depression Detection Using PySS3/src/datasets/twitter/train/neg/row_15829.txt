Why does my brain do this?I can't understand what my problem is. I've been taking to a psychiatrist, been to therapy, tried different medications, been through two whole TMS therapy that didn't work, I have people who love me, people who support me and hate that I feel this way. Yet all I do is want to jump from a building and end everything. I don't want to hurt/punish everyone I know and love, but my brain keeps haunting me with these stupid thoughts.

I feel like I am broken and that's why I should end it all. I'm broken financially. I don't know if I'll ever get out of debt. I have a job I'll probably get fired from for drinking. I have a substance abuse problem. I got my degree but I don't even want to use it. 

I just don't understand what I need to do. I feel so lost, alone yet I'm not.
