What couldâ€™ve beenWhen I was younger, about 10 years ago, I decided that if my bully was in any of the same classes as me, I would kill myself. We were transitioning to a new school and I knew that most people would be going, including some of my other bullies, but he was by far the worst. This year of my life had no solace, so I truly believe that if he ended up in any of my classes I wouldâ€™ve gone through with it. The way I wouldâ€™ve done it was by falling off a building 3-4 stories up from the ground, which I had roof access to, and which wouldâ€™ve most likely have been fatal. My bully ended up moving to California, and Iâ€™m still here today. Whenever Iâ€™m feeling suicidal, I think back to that time, and sort of wish he was in my class.
