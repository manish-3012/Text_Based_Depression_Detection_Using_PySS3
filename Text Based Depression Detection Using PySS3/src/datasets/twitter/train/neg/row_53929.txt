The thing Iâ€™ve wanted most for the longest time is to die. Iâ€™ve wanted this since I was a young child at around age 10.I given myself so many chances. Every time I get suicidal I tell myself just push through. I try my best not to involve others and just focus on what needs to be done. I never do it correctly I always fail. Now Iâ€™m stuck in a situation where the doctors canâ€™t help my leg pain and Iâ€™m stuck with crutches and I canâ€™t keep a constant job. Iâ€™m an international person I grew up with friends from all over the world studying in a school in Asia. Recently my best friend got married and I went to his wedding in Russia which he had to buy me tickets for because Iâ€™m too broke.. I saw how all our friends have lived girlfriends relationships and I was deviated how I wasnâ€™t able to secure any of that for myself. Iâ€™m happy for them but I want a small piece for myself and Iâ€™m just not able to secure anything. 
Iâ€™m disabled I have polio and Iâ€™m super depressed and girls just get turned off by me. Itâ€™s been 15 years since Iâ€™ve had any sex or touch or anything like that. Iâ€™m really over this life, I hope everyone enjoys what this world has to offer because I certainly dont. Iâ€™m giving myself one last chance with this new job Iâ€™m trying to land. If I donâ€™t score a girlfriend and make some friends and get out of this situation Iâ€™m going to end my useless pathetic suffering life. Fuck you god.
