If anyone wants to talk, PM me.If anyone is feeling depressed, considering suicide PM me. We can talk on the phone, through messages, text messages whatever you want.  I'm not a trained professional or anything but if you want someone to talk to, I'm here. A suicide hotline is probably best, but if you'd rather just talk to a normal guy then I'm here.

EDIT: I do have a job and will obviously be sleeping at some points but I'll respond to you with a time (unless I am asleep) when we can talk if I am unavailable at the time. I won't ignore anyone.  It is important to remember I could be asleep when you message me, so at some points it could take around 8 hours for a response.  Don't come to me for immediate help, call the suicide hotlines.

EDIT 2: I would like to further state that the suicide help hotlines are the BEST option. They will keep everything confidential. They arent going to call the cops or your family, they just want to help. That being said, I'm here for people that just want someone to listen to them. Im just a regular dude trying to help. I will give you what advice I have and do everything I can, but the hotlines are your best choice and I urge you to call them.
