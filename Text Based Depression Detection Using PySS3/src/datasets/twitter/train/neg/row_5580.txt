It is hopelessI fucked up so much l had so many chances to fix things and l never did anything .  
Its hopeless and scary everything feels too real and too unreal l havent been awake in years and the small short moments im awake in reality are scary and unbearable its hopeless 
Im sitting in the floor of my bathroom in the middle of the night l want to cry but cant l cant do anything l am weak . I feel like im not here at all 
I want to remember this so im typing it this is almost rock bottom and l cant do anything because nothing is real and everything is real l wish id die tonight  lm not on drugs so l dont know why im like this always has been
