Goodbye to those memories.Goodbye to the good times I had. You are all great memories that make me happy, but at the same time I can't stand the nostalgia...knowing that I will never be able to relive you. And if I can't, there's simply no point in living anymore. If I've already reached my happiest, even if I have more to learn and people to meet, what's the point if I'm going to be miserable through it all, just constantly wishing I was as happy as I was?

I have a lot. I have all my senses, all of my limbs, a roof over my head, food, a shower, a bed. I have people in my life that care about me, them being the only reason I haven't left sooner. Nice house, a potential future ahead of me, and a lot of people that make me feel like I'm a good person.

But I cannot feel anything anymore. I cannot feel love anymore, I cannot feel euphoria (without drugs) anymore, I cannot live in the present moment anymore. It's been years since I've been myself. But I dropped the ball. I don't know how, but something happened where who I was became lost and now I'm stuck in only those memories and guilt. It has barely gotten any better. Again, it's been years. I don't know why everybody tells me I'm a good person but the voices in my head hate me, disagree with me, are telling me I should just kill myself at this point.

My mind and I used to be best friends and now it's turned on me and I still don't know why. And I don't know why I need to know why. But it's out of my control, and what I default to every single day. It does not matter how much I've learned, I feel like I'm making no progress in life. Like I'm on pause or under construction. But it's not ending and I'm not seeing any light.

Granted I didn't see this coming as fast as it did, so maybe it will leave just as fast as it came one day. But as I sit and wait for that day to come, as I fight for answers every single day, nothing works.

I am certain that I will never, never be that happy again. I just want to leave.
