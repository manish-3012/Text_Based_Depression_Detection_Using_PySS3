I've been struggling since I was 13. My mother has borderline personality disorder and it has always made her react more than the normal person but since I was young, whenever it is directed at me, I'm a useless piece of shit according to her and I cant even count how many times I've heard things like that. 

My goal in life is to go to college for nursing and move to Alaska after for the job. I'm afraid shes just going to freak out and kick me out while I'm working towards it. Just tonight it happened again where she freaked out. Pushed me backwards by my neck bruising my muscle. 

To be honest I cant and havnt been able to stop thinking suicidal thoughts for 3 years now. It's so often and frequent. Now they're so vivid I even dream of it. And when I think about it I get a feeling of peace and it scares me. 

Im lost, everyone. My confidence doesnt exist and hadn't for so long and I dont know what to do besides stop existence for myself.
