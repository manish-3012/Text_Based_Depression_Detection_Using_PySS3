About cuttingI have been so tempted to cut, should I just just try it once I NEED SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY DEPRESSION I know people who cut, they seem better than me maybe I should just see what it's like because I've tried starving myself, throwing up, repeatedly hitting myself nothing makes me feel better. People say cutting releases a hormone that makes you feel better and right now I need something
