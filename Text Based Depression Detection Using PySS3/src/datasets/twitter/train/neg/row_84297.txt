I've always wonder if i would prefer hell then to live like thisCONSTANT! CONSTANT! ANXIETY! covers my life like a dark cloud. I might just end it this week because I'm afraid of the endless obstacles my life would put in my way. I'm not afraid to die or suffering for a couple minutes from cuts that would eventually kill me. If there is a hell i (which i don't really believe there is one) i wouldn't mind as long as i don't relive this life again. FUCK MY LIFE I WILL EVENTUALLY LEAVE THIS EARTH WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE
