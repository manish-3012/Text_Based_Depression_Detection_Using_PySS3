Just a little poetry to tell my storyI stand at the edge, the sun glowing a hazy orange in the depressing, quiet evening. I stand there, staring back at so many I know, with my back to the oh so tempting black sea. They stare at me, wondering, what shall I do next? The glistening .45 rests at peace in my right hand. One bullet loaded, for one miserable soul. My hand works its way up to my head, as friends and family work their way to me. I train the gun to my head, and scream "You never loved me, none of you. You have your sweet lives, your great jobs, your wonderful lovers, yet I have none of those treasures." The outside world couldn't begin to fathom the thoughts permeating inside this head. Only the sweet release of the trigger shall end my pain. How sick and tired I am of this world. "I hate you all. Everyday I seem to get better, then I look on social media or find out something great about one of you, bringing my self esteem to the fiery pits of Hell, asking me to come and join it." As I began to pull the trigger, slowly, I said my final words, "None of you are worth living for." ~bang~
