I Dont Know If I Can Carry OnIn year 8 of school ot when I was 13 ish? I become overwhelmed with a storm of sadness and I couldnt figure it out. I didnt want to say i was depressed but as time went on it got harder and eventually led to me self harming regularly, I know the self harm wasn't good but for about 10 seconds all my troubles disappeared. I felt free and happy in those short seconds. My parents found out and I had exams so the thoughts got stronger but with an anxious feeling added onto. I didnt want to go outside I distanced myself from my friends and family, eventually leading me to try and kill myself multiple times, the closest I ever came was being hit by a car by ACCIDENT, I did not purposely put myself in that position but I was there, and whilst i was knocked out i was happy because i thought my life was over. Everything was flashing before me and I was free. Then I woke up, sadness came back into me and the sharp breathing took control of me. I thought I might have fucked my lungs up and was hoping I'd die right there seeing those random peoples faces at the end of my short life. But no i stayed awake and carried on in life. The sadness faded a little bit on my first year of college but it shot straight back up st the end and i eventually dropped out on my second year, i gained weight and began to cut again. For a good 6 months I have been in education or work. I sat at home and played video games. The thoughts are stronger than ever and I really want to take my life. What can i do?
