I am not going to lie.....These past couple of months have been really hard on me..... I've been struggling with a lot and I just want an out. I don't see anything getting better any time soon and I don't know what to do... I am really freaking out over here..... I am making plans to get out my current job, which is exacerbating my depression, but I haven't gotten any job offers. I have been going in and out of job interviews for the past year.... Its been really hard....

I can't really complain about this because I know there are people out there who have it worst.... I am just really frustrated with feeling like I am stuck... I just want all of this to end.. I am not going to lie, I am starting to think that ending it would just best for me.
