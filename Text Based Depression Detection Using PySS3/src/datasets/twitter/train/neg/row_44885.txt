I was living a lie.Just got my DNA test results back. I have been living my whole life thinking I was a good portion of an ethnicity I am not. I feel like I have been living a lie. I am shocked and scared and I feel beyond guilty for ever having misrepresented myself. Fuck. Who am I? I feel like Iâ€™m living in somebody elseâ€™s body. I feel like dying. I donâ€™t know what to do. I genuinely feel like dying.
