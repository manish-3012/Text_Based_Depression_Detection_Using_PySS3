Fighting a losing battleHey, r/SW. I'm between a rock and a hard place and need a third person perspective. I've been dealing a very aggressive form of schizophrenia for the last couple years with what I would call little success. I've been having abhorrent thoughts of ritualized mutilation towards myself and loved ones, something that almost ended in my son's death last time. I'm scared of losing myself, a fear that most of my doctors have done little to dissuade me of. It's like standing on a cliff facing and having to watch in paralyzing fear as it starts to crumble away. Needless to say, I've been questioning if suicide is the answer, to prevent harm to my family and to prevent a complete delusion from taking hold.

To be honest, I have ready access to a firearm, but I'm loathe to try right now out of concern of someone waking up and intervening. I'm more or less just waiting until evidence starts shoring up that things will improve, or an opportunity to acts arises.
