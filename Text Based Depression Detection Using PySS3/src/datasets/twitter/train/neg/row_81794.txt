I can't handle this illness anymoreI have ocd. And with that I have disturbing thoughts and disturbing false memories. I have memories of things that I think never happened and they are so bad, I can't handle them.

I also see evil in this world and I can't take the anxiety. I'm scared and alone... Everyday is a struggle to wake up. Everyday I dream about my death.

I wish I had never been born.

What did I do to deserve this punishment?
