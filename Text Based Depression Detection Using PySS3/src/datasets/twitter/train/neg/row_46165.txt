Not today not tomorrow but I am doomedThis existence is miserable lost so many already best friend dying and I canâ€™t fix it. Beloved pet had to be put down to prevent suffering. Loved family and friends died some expected some not. Approaching mid life can buy whatever I want and I want nothing I solely exist as a curse to weak to stop it. I am no saint and memories of me being a bad person haunt me. I so wish I could go back and not be a douche bag I toy with ideas off religion and redemption but Iâ€™ve already been down that path. Somehow I have become so creepy over the years I cannot even bear to talk to family because of such tremendous shame. I want to be mentally healthy and happy and feel itâ€™s impossible I know to much darkness to go back.I know everyone here feels the same. All I can do now is try to be kind and generous untill fate takes me or I take me. Be kind and generous
