I miss my son who I canâ€™t see because of my mental health, Iâ€™m not working because of previous suicide attempts, Iâ€™m home alone a lot of the time and Iâ€™m just over it. Iâ€™m over it. Iâ€™m so alone.The title says it all. Iâ€™m exhausted. For over a year I have been counting down hours until I can sleep and when I wake up I start again.

My son is 5 this year, his grandmother and father will be taking him to schools in his district that he can go to- and Iâ€™m not there. Such a huge and influential moment in his life- in arguably his most formative years. Itâ€™s a very long story, with a lot of sad parts, but in the end I removed myself from the picture because I wasnâ€™t a good person to keep in frame. Thereâ€™s nothing worse than having a sick parent, and thereâ€™s nothing worse than not having your parents- I know that personally, but I didnâ€™t want my son to see me completely decompose in front of him.. Last year alone I tried to end my life twice and was hospitalised both times and held in police custody for the last one. 

When it comes to why I left my son I canâ€™t explain to you why I chose what I did, but it worked for his family and for his routine, and theyâ€™re a lot happier now. They all sleep a little easier and his Grandmother told me a few months ago he was doing really well in kindy.

I made a blank Instagram account a few months ago and use that to check up on him. Heâ€™s so big now. And he looks just like me. Truth is the last time we spoke was on FaceTime in January and my 4 year old son stayed on the camera with me for 3 1/2 hours just playing games, pretending to be witches, goblins and riding brooms- I loved it. I love him. I miss him so much and I could tell in that moment he missed me to. I feel like I can never ever get past this. Me being sick. Me always being sick. My Dad was very violent and abusive when I was a kid, the raping started when I was young and lasted until I escaped at 16. Thatâ€™s over 8 years worth of memories I can barely remember but wake up in sweats and tears over. My Mother isnâ€™t close to me either, and I suspect itâ€™s because she blames herself for what happened when she left me as a kid with my dad...

Thereâ€™s too much going on in my mind. Iâ€™m mourning everyday. Every. Fucking. Day. I have a partner now who I have been with for a very long time (not my sons father) and he is very understanding, but he still doesnâ€™t get it. No one does. The people who were meant to help me find a way to get better when I tried to kill myself BOTH times last year donâ€™t even know what theyâ€™re doing.. Iâ€™m just a burden. Iâ€™m a burden who brought a child into this world and couldnâ€™t care for him- and I feel that every day. I miss him every day and Iâ€™m sad for what we lost. Iâ€™m sad for how he will feel as he grows and wonders where I am.

This week is the first week a mental health team have properly reached out to me to try and secure a (student) therapist for me to talk to- and I think itâ€™s too late. Iâ€™m just too tired again. I donâ€™t want to be in this house with my own thoughts and my own nightmares and the memories I mourn for not having... 

I just want to move on, but the only way I can do that? Is ending it myself. The last time I did it I was caught unexpectedly by a passer-by, a stranger. Iâ€™ll be smarter this time. Ill do at least one good job before I go. 

Thank you for giving me a place to let this all out before I go. It feels better than holding it in or worrying people who do not need to be worried anymore.
