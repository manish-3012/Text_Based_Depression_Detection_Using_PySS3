not now but somedayi just typed up this whole damn post just to have it fail to post. 
i have, since i can remember, promised myself (and a few trusted "friends" who have never taken me seriously) that when my mom dies i'm going to off myself. not for the usual avoiding the guilt reasons. my mom is my best friend. she is the only person who has ever been able to truly understand me. i love my mom more than anything or anyone and everything i do in life is to make her proud, or at least try to. i cannot fathom living a life without my mom. i cannot see any point in living if i can't have my mom with me. i am always paranoid about her health and safety. i've been aware of my depression since i was 11 or 12, and i've had my fair share of suicidal ideation about my own stupid life but i've never had a plan. so when the day comes, i guess i'll just have to wing it. i know no one is going to care about this but i needed to type it out and store it somewhere other than the notes in my phone. thanks
