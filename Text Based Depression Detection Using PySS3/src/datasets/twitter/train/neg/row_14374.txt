Death seems to be the only thing I can controli just moved country to be with my boyfriend. Now I am not allowed to work temporarily due to immigration process and I am living on savings. I look at all the jobs that my studies have prepared me for, but i don't have a desire to apply for them. I finally realized i'm too introverted to want to interact with people constantly for work, which is literally the description of all the jobs my studies prepared me for. I'm at a loss. My boyfriend keeps introducing me to new people, trying to get me to "network" professionally. I understand his intentions are good. However this makes me feel even worse. There is nothing i can control. I'm living in my boyfriend's house, not my own. I'm eating his food. I don't have any employable skills. And in the US without a job i cannot even go outside the apartment since I won't have money for a car. I don't even want to drive a car because I really don't have 3D awareness when I am in cars. My boyfriend is also super careful about his car. Whenever there is a tiny scratch he freaks out and gets mad about it for days on straight. I don't ever want to drive his car with this type of responsibility. I don't even want to be in it to ride.  I tried biking around yesterday and the cars next to me were going 80 mph and there is no bike lane on most roads or the bike lanes were taken up by parked cars. I freaked out and pushed myself until i reached home safely. I feel like there i have no control of my life whatsoever. i'm just a burden on my boyfriend. The only thing i can control is my death. i've been having thoughts of death for a week now ever since I got to the new country. Suicidal thoughts are not new to me as they  happened before. But each time it happens it lasts for so long and it feels so bad. I don't want to do anything because i'm afraid I would actually realize the thoughts of suicide if I get too triggered.
