I am a useless, friendless, piece of shitThat about sums me up. I have no friends/no social skills which I could use to make friends, I'm incredibly withdrawn and alone, I have only work in shitty jobs for most of my life and I have not been with a woman in years. I've stopped trying to be honest. I don't see this getting any better. I'm almost 30 and my life is still such a mess. I could not tell you what I've been doing for the past 9 years. I never finished college, not because I was unable to, but because of pure stupidity. I've alienated everyone around me outside of my family due to my paranoia. I never make new friends or if I do, it's mostly out of pity since I'm pretty pathetic. I don't exercise or eat right since I feel I have nothing to live for. If I wasn't over six feet, I would be obese. I have no one to blame but myself for life. I'm making one last shot at a decent life at a coding bootcamp. If I don't succeed there, then that's it. So far, I've only been able to code simple things and I really struggle with harder concepts. I am a cancer to everyone around me and I don't have the money or insurance to get therapy.
