Iâ€™m probably going to take the plunge soonI canâ€™t take this world anymore. Everything in this modern world is lies and manipulation. I spend almost everyday holed up in my tiny apartment in my horrible city just trying to make it through another day. Iâ€™m a recovering alcoholic and thought Iâ€™d find happiness in sobriety. In my years sober Iâ€™ve gone to a darker place than drinking could have ever taken me. I canâ€™t even find the mental energy to go see my family who live 30 mins away. 

I ordered a ton of Xanax off the dark net and am going to chase the entire amount with some whiskey and hope to God I donâ€™t wake up. Fuck this world.
