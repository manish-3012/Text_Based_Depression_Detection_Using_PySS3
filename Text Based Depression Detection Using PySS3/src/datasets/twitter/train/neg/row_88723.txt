Life is meaninglessI just slept 13 hours thinking about my high school crush (3 years ago). I imagined how we talked, how we just were hanging out and how similar we actually could have been. It was so beautiful but also very depressing. I didn't so shit since then, social anciety kept me 99% of this time in a closed room. Now Idk what I should do, I am a creep, a looser and worse I very bad person. I think there are only two options for me prison or death. Society shouldn't be obliged to take on the burden of me. I loved her so much and I wished I didn't hurt all the people that I interacted with. Hopefully I will have to strength to commit my suicide. Wish me luck.
