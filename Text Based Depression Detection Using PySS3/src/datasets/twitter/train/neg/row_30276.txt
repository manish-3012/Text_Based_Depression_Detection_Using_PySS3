I'm not strong enoughI'm not strong enough or beautiful enough or talented enough to live in this world. Every time I try and be myself I get shoved under the carpet. All I get are backhanded compliments. I hate myself and how I look so much. Why is everyone else so beautiful? Why can't I be beautiful? I can't keep living anymore, not with the way I am, and the way I look, and just everything about me. Not with how I am living. I cannot keep living. I'm going to write my note and leave. All the pain that I've endured can't possibly be worth anything.
