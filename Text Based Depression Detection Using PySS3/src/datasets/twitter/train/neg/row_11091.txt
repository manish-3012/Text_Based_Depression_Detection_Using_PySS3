I donâ€™t like this body.Iâ€™m otherkin, specifically catkin, Iâ€™m a cat trapped inside a human body. Iâ€™m not supposed to look like this. Iâ€™ve had these feelings since I was and they donâ€™t go away. I just want to leave this world. I know if I do Iâ€™ll be reincarnated into a cat again. But something is stopping me from doing it. Please I just want to go back to my right body again. All I want is to be a cat and not this ugly form I have. Please kill me.
