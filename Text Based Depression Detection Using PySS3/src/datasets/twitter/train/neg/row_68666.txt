I donâ€™t know how to go forward. I want this to end.I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m supposed to do with my life anymore. Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for 6 years now and Iâ€™m not sure if I want help, I donâ€™t know what my next steps are. The only reason I havenâ€™t followed through with an attempt yet is because Iâ€™m afraid of failing to die, and I donâ€™t want to suffer through physical pain. I donâ€™t have any good means to kill myself but I desperately want an end to this pain, but I know that will likely never come. Any form of happiness is temporary and is always met by worse and worse depression. 

Iâ€™ve talked to therapists, hotlines, the friends that still give a shit. This world doesnâ€™t care to keep you safe and happy, I donâ€™t know why they bother attempting to stop people from killing themselves if they wonâ€™t bother to help improve peopleâ€™s situations and give them support. They probably just donâ€™t want to see or hear about it. Iâ€™ve had many times when I thought today would be the day I finally do it, and Iâ€™m only held back by my own fear now. 

What am I supposed to do beyond suicide? If I can be convinced somehow that things will somehow â€œget betterâ€, then what do I do when they only get worse? What kind of life am I supposed to live in pain? Is it really that wrong for me to want to die? I want a good solution that will kill me because I donâ€™t have any hope of getting better.

It would have been easier to never been born.
