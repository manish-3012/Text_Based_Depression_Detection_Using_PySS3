A Never Ending CycleThis morning I'm paralyzed with sadness
Writing this brings me comfort somehow
About to head to work, again
This routine, this rut, this cycle will be the death of me.
The world doesn't care, but why should they?
Im just a speck in a sea of countless ones and zeroes.
People try to say what makes us human is the love and goodness we share with others.
But we always forget, human nature is to be human..
And humans have gotten this far by leaving a trail of blood behind.
Humans are alright I guess, theyre not all bad. But shit.
Now.
How far do you go after you've lost all sense of purpose?
Because I am slowly on a downward spiral, with no end in sight.
I need help. Even after going to counseling, all the meds I take every day.
I need help..

Edit: sorry for sounding poetic and shit, I wrote this in my notes this morning and I thought it was the best way to convey how I've been feeling
