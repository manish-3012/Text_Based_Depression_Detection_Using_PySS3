Why do I still wanna kill myself?Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself several times when I was younger been in &amp; out of psyche wards put my family through hell... itâ€™s been about two years and I havenâ€™t made anymore attempts Iâ€™m actually pretty successful now with a career that I love. I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m depressed but for some reason I still wanna die. Just kinda nonchalantly think about it the idea of maybe shooting myself has the same appeal as getting out of the house after a long day of work and getting tacos, get all excited to do something &amp; ready to go and then say fuck it and just sit back down... I feel like Iâ€™m rambling at this point but Iâ€™m not really sure what to say or how to say it but I donâ€™t want to stress my family Iâ€™ve fucked with their emotions for a decade.
