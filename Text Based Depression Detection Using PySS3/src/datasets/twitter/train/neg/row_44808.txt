Should I not have the option of legal assisted suicide?!I hate hospital, there is no support there and the staff frequently abuse patients and we are never believed by the police or management. I have trauma from a painful life, my life has always sucked and nothing can change it because I have an incurable illness that is medication resistant. 

I talk about suicide to the mental health team so much that I started to feel empowered to do it after years of being to afraid of deformity and surviving it. I've researched numerous ways and I've finally found the one with the smallest chance of survival available to me it, and it's quick. 

I have doubts about doing it, I still have some dreams but they're so outrageously ambitious that I'll probably never accomplish them. I came to that realisation today and I'm going to prepare to go MIA for good. I told the nurse and she will tell the doctor and he will have me sectioned which will trigger worse symptoms and instead of dying in peace, I'll do it while being tormented by psychosis and mania.  Why do I have to go through this and people with physical health problems have the option of dying in peace, in a clinic with their family there?
