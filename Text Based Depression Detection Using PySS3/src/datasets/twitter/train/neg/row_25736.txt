please help also I'm sorry this is a total messThis feels really petty and I'm not sure where to like post all this without alarming the people near me. I think I hate myself. I think the world would be like a better place without me in it. This isn't like anybodies fault but my own I think, I think my personality is just inherently aloof and useless. I don't want this to be like a pity party, I'm not really like sure what's i expect out of this. I've just been having really intrusive thoughts that i feel I should act on, like killing myself. I think what's holding me back now is that everyone in my life is good and I don't want them to blame themselves for it. I'd hate to scar the people I love but also I want to opt out of it all. I don't want my face or my body I look like Quasimodo had a really rough day. I'm newly an adult and the whole thing is hitting me like a truck I feel so isolated from the people I knew and I don't know how to reach out to them or make new friends I hopelessly fall in love every few months only for me to like just realize that like those emotions are better suppressed. I don't want to bother the people I know with this because I feel like it'll ruin whatever cool veeneer I have going for me. I'm sorry this is a mess. I don't worry about like planning it and going through with because it feels like more of a moment to moment impulse thing like some days are great but all it feels like I need to act on my suicidal impulses is one particularly shitty day. I'm not sure, I feel like a little ashamed posting here but like I'm kinda desperate for help.
