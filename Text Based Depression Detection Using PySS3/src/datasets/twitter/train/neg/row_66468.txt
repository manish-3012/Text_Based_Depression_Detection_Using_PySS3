Desperately seeking an escape. Feel like I'm SCREAMING for help but no help is ever enough.I've struggled with low self esteem, depression and anxiety for over a decade now.  My mother, sister and two friends are very supportive but nothing they can say or do is ever enough.  The underlying feelings don't change and I find myself withdrawing to prevent being a burden long-term.

I've been in therapy, *again*, for three months now.  I'm not really sure it's helping.

All I want is to get away from my own fucking thoughts.
