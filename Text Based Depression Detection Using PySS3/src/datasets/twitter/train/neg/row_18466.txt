How do you get through the day knowing/feeling its completely pointlessI just wonder how people don't just drop everything and end it, when you cant rationalize the point. I'm know some people can rationalize the point, and that the reason i can't is because im severely depressed and anxious, but while I'm down in this place where, logically it makes sense to kill myself, what do I do on a day to day basis to not follow through? Something happened in my life has developed a problem so huge that I feel it would simply be easier to just die and not have to deal with it. It makes me feel so bad that I can't imagine being dead would be worse. if anything it would just not be this. I genuinely dont know  if i can handle this problem. My brain feels unable to register any way around it. And i truly dont believe i can work through it. What do you do to get through the day?
