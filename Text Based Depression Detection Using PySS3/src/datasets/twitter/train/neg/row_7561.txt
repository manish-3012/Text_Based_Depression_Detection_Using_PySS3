I am just so tired of my lifeI really dont know how to say or describe the way I feel. Its like I have so much ahead of me an It dosn't amount to anything. I used to think it was because I was doing bad in school but I have better grades than ive ever had in my life right now. It is getting harder and harder for me to even find a reason get out of bed in the morning. I lost my best friend a while ago and now even though I have friends ive never felt some hopeless or lonely in my life.

 Im always the last one in the loop with all my friends, and the only way I hang out is if I am the one who tries to set something up. I know this isn't something to throw it all away for but I just feel like such a burden or a fuck up. I cant remember the last time anyone made me feel like I was appreciated or welcome and it makes me feel so empty. I try and act like being alone is fine or that I like the space but every day I have to wonder what is the point of even going forward.

I am not on the edge of ending my life but I feel this dark energy right now that scares me... I guess I just need a way to vent
