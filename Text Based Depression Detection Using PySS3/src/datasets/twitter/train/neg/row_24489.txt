Now I understood law of my life!Whenever I try to do something suddenly bad things happen to me and disrupt me from doing so.  But, now that I become a University student and I have made some kind friend who treat me equally so I thought my life will be better than  ever but reality seems to be more harsh than I have thought. Something that destroy all I have accumulated and all I got happened the moment I got a chance to turn my miserable life into better one. 

I understood. My life will never change. As long as I go on living this life I won't be happy because what is out of my control interfere with me. I lost all interests about anything, nothing appeals to me, this life has no meaning anymore. 

I cant forgive  those who are happy because of their good gene inherited by their good parents fortunately. After all, life is determined already when we are born. After all, life is totally depending on our parents. 

When we born, life is kind of over. If we are determined  already when we are born, then why should we go on living in vain? Whether you will be happy or not is depending on parents's genes regardless of their attitude towards you. If they abuse you but their genes are good you will be able to happy, but if they have bad genes even though they are so nice to you your life will be so fragile that you slip your chances every time you're about to catch.
