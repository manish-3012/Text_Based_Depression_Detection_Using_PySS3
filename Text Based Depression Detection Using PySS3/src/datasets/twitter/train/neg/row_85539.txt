I have nothingI have nothing that makes my life worth living. Over the years I have turned into a cold heartless fucker. I hate it, but there's nothing I can do. I can't feel anything other crippling depression. And the inability to do anything that would help society. I'm a social outcast. I'm actually typing this at work, because I get ignored by everyone. No one gives a shit about me. Not even my parent. I hate my life and I don't want to kill myself, but sometimes I feel like I should just do my family the favor and end it.
