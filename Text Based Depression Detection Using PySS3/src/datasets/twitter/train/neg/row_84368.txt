I'm tired of disappointing my wideIf I leave now, well my wife she will get over it.
My 3 1/2 yr old daughter, she might know the good dad, but she won't know the piece of shit I was... 

And my 9 mo. Old , he won't know what the fuck happened...

Edit: thanks everyone for the kind messages. I won't do anything drastic, some messages did give me some good perspective... I just fell null and void... lot of sadness now. Thank you
