Happy a lot of the time but I still constantly think of suicideThe title kind of says it all, I really am happy most of the time now. Sometimes I get depressed and go back down in the dumps but most of the time its not like that and yet I stil l think of suicide a lot. Sometimes I still wonder if I'm better off dead, even when I'm happy and not depressed. This has been an issue for a while now and I'm not sure what to do.
