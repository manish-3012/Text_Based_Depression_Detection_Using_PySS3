possibly pregnant pondering panicPartner and I tried the responsible condom business &amp; this ONE time it gets all stuck inside me. Now my period is late. We already have five kids (blended), some rough financial struggle &amp; mental health issues to address but my ex-husband drove me to the last abortion clinic I ever went to &amp; the sadness it left inside me never went away. Now I'm stuck again with an unwanted pregnancy to just "deal with" &amp; I am so sad I can't panic, like something stuck in my throat or swallowing back tears that only seep out slowly at the most inappropriate of times: driving to work, sitting on the couch with the kids after school &amp; at my desk at work. I can't stop the sadness and I can't tell my best friend or maybe he will also be sad &amp; suicidal. I feel alone &amp; scared. 

If I just walk out the door &amp; keep walking until I fall down somewhere far enough away I can't hurt a soul then this despair may finally end and whatever horror is inside me will never come to be.
