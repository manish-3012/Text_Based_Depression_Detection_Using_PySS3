WaningI don't know what I'm doing here.

I can't figure out who I am. I know there's millions like me.

I'm not a nice person but I'm manipulative enough to make people think I am. I'm apathetic and selfish. I lack drive and purpose and I can no longer genuinely connect with other people. I've isolated myself into becoming an incurable cynic and misanthrope. I'm a sycophant at work but I won't talk with my family anymore.

There's no goal, no passion, and no hope. I don't feel capable of love. It's all gone. I'm tired of repeating the cycle of healing and waning and crashing and rebuilding just to have the foundations poured more sloppily each time.

Someone told me once that just because you can't find a reason to live doesn't mean you have to die.

But I can find many releases in death. It's not a solution: it's an escape. The pain of realizing I am awake each and every morning is unbearable. I can't do this anymore. 

I have only one goal in life. I'm not going to make an attempt in a dissociated state. I can't risk waking up anymore.
