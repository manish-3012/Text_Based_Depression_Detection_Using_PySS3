My best friend just told me that who he is to everyone he knows is a lie, including to me. He's also rambling about suicide. What do I do?I'm just really concerned because he revealed to me just now that he has been depressed for a year and I had no idea. He doesn't seem to have a clear grip on reality right now - he says that he "plays a part" to everyone he knows to make them like him when the guy he is to us "really isn't who he is." When I asked him about it further, he couldn't concretely back up who he actually was...he just kept repeating that he was worthless and that he often dreamt about suicide. And on top of all of that, he started rambling about how things would be so much better for him if he committed suicide because then he wouldn't be in a constant state of misery and fakery. I'm having a hard time responding to him without freaking out or wanting to call the cops and sending them to his place. I have to add that we are both in college, he lives off campus and I don't have a car to reach him with. He admitted to being drunk maybe two hours ago but I don't know if he's still drunk.

What should I say or do?

We're talking on facebook and he's said choice things such as "if no one would be upset by my death, i'd already b edead.well, maybe that shi[p has sailed" and "my whole life is lies.  ypu care about me hurting myself, but the real me doesn;t care. i wouldn't want you to be harmed, or anything. you still have worth to the world but me? i could die tomorrow, and i would be happier"
