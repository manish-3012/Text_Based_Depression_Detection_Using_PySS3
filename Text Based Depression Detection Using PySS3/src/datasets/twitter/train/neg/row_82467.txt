I've been trying to decide if tonight is the nightI went to bed early last night, and woke up at the very end of the work day today. I missed my entire shift, having slept through my alarms. My only friend is having a shitty day himself and isn't available to talk. I don't want to tell him I need to speak with him, I don't want to decide to do it after he says no and possibly have him blame himself. 
It's not that there's no light in life, it's not that there isn't good times. But these days feel so terrible, these failures in my life are too much. I plan on driving out to the middle of nowhere, getting high and cutting my arm open so I bleed out. I can't go to the fucking hospital again, this has to end. It has to end. I'm going to write my note tonight, then I'll see if I can find a quiet spot.
