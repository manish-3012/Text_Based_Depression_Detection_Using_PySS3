I want to die, but I don't want my death to affect othersPersonally, I've come to grips with the fact that I don't want to be alive. I have no immediate plans on killing myself, but I really don't see any reason to keep going.

The only things that are pushing me forward are my family, my students (I teach dance), my friends, and my girlfriend who I'm currently on a break with. Without them, I wouldn't even hesitate to kill my self.

I'm miserable, I'm always in pain from the Lyme Disease, I see no real light at the end of the tunnel. I'm completely fine with dying, but I know that no one else will be fine. At this point it feels like I'm just going through the motions and hoping eventually people will stop giving a shit about me. If that happened I could finally do it knowing it wouldn't crush anyone. 

Any tips? Literally, anything at all
