will it work?if I was to take sleeping pills to attempt to kill myself (https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B087CYVLJW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabt1_La1PFb99TEDY2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) 
how many would I need to take for it to be fatal?
would it even be fatal? 

the purpose here is to die (I won't this is all hypothetical I beg no "don't do it", I love you too dw I won't) but I don't want it to fail and I have brain damage, or just it to fail at all. are those strong enough if I ate enough or would I need to try something stronger?
