I need someone to tell me everything is going to be okDon't want to take out too much time out of your day so I will make this short and sweet.

I had enough, there ain't ever gonna be a change in my life. I swore to myself that I wouldn't go back to my old habits and I'm back doing it. 

I was so close to running into my parents room telling them that I started cutting again but I couldn't. I couldn't do it knowing how hurt they would be. 

I'm messed up big time in the 17 years ive been on this earth and I can't get that time back. I was always hurt from a young age, never had any true friends, never will. Always been called very dirty names and treated like an outsider. 

I'm pretty convinced my own brother doesn't care about me either. I've always been that one kid that was very quiet and kept to themselves. People saw this as me being some weirdo or a loser.

Everyday I wish my life would change for the better but I think I'm giving up. I guess this how life was meant to be. The only reason I won't take my own life is because I'm too scared too. My dad already worries so much about me and I wouldn't want to hurt him anymore. 

Anyone out there that understands me?
