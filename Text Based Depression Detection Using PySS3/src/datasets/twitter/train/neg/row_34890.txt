About to talk all my pillsI have no one to talk to, I have serious behaviours problems and I'm more and more thinking about suiciding with pills.
I think I just need someone to talk with me but I don't know what to talk with people.
I have no friends, no job, no girlfriend/boyfriend, no family anymore because I discussed with my mother in an aggressive unforgettable way. 
I'm always drowning in those episodes.
I'm from Brazil.
