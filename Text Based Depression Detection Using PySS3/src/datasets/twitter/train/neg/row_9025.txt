I have everything readyI have the alcohol. I have 114 high dose pills of a medication that "should not be prescribed to a patient at risk for self harm". I lied to the walk-in doctor and feigned a condition that I do not have to get them. They're so pretty and I love them. 

I want to talk about it with my therapist but I want it to be a decision I make myself. If I tell her that I have these prescription medications, she'll probably have to call the police. I can't tell anyone. Everyone hates me and I am nothing but a burden. I don't want to go on inpatient again. I'm going to throw my SIM card off of the balcony so I cannot call anyone when my survival instinct kicks in. I know that most overdoses do not work but my biggest one got me intubated and that was with an OTC. 

I don't want to bide time anymore. 

Soon. Not tonight but soon.
