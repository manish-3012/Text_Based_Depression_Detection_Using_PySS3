I'm no longer suicidalI'm no longer suicidal, I still want to die though. And just because I'm not trying to actively end my life, that doesnt mean I'm "living" it either. I'm afraid of what would happen if I fail a suicide attempt. Would I be sent back to the hospital? Will i be arrested? Or will I be left with brain damage? I wish I could just stop living. 

I started going back to therapy, but it's not helping. I still feel like my therapist just wants we to "stick it out" because she wants my money.

I wish my life would end so very badly, and I feel pathetic just sitting here wishing it to end. 

I'm taking action to try and make my life "better" like doing things outside of school, but I feel worse by doing that. I'm so numb and so cold so very cold I'm so cold I'm so numb and cold cold and numb so cold and so numb cold and numb cold and numb so numb and so cold cold cold cold numb numb numb cold and numb numb and cold 

I'm going to sleep now, I hope I dont wake up.
