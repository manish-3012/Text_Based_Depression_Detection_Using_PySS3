Just generally feeling like you're out of stuff to doYa know I'm not really depressed or anything, its just that I've come to the realization that what I want out of life is not entirely obtainable, and the bits that technically are, are such long term goals that realistically I'm not going to achieve them.

Its like, there is a way in life where I would be content but I know for certain there is no chance of me getting there. Not just "oh no, ill never have the nice house and fast car" but that its legit not possible.

For the past few years I feel the only reason I even wake up is because I can't actually sleep anymore. Everything I do is a distraction. I got a job and it ate some time, I built a PC and it ate some time, I got into retro PC restorations and that ate some time. But its really just filling in gaps.

I lost my first job when I moved, got another, lost that one, got another, and it was when I was working for minimum wage that I realized that my dream wasnt obtainable, and that I was going to be stuck in this cycle of working for next to nothing, and trying to burn time with entertainment for the rest of my life.

And ive been told that everyone does that, and everyone just accepts it and sinks into medicority, but that's not good enough for me. I don't want a two bedroom apartment and a used car god dammit, why would I just accept that? How do people wake up in the morning in a cookie cutter house with a minivan and 2.5 kids and think "its not what I wanted but its nice". 

Now I've just given up, I'm taking whatever happens as it is. All I do anymore is play videogames and jerk off to pass time, if I go homeless, fine, if I starve and die, fine. I don't want to settle for a life I don't want.
