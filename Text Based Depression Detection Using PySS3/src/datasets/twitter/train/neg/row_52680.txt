I'm fucking done with lifeI don't even know what to write here. I'm almost 21 years old, I have BPD and my life is fucking shit. It's always the same shit and I'm always alone. Whenever I try to be as normal as possible and try to make friends it either doesn't work or they leave me one day. I've been going lengths, tried all kinds of ways and different personalities, tried to really to work on my issues, but it always ends the same. No one gives a shit about me, no one likes me, everyone hates me. Just now, the only friend I had for about half a year now, well anything I consider friends for which it doesn't take much anymore, cut me off too. And this is not a one time thing. Those things happen all the time. Why are all people such fucking selfish assholes? Why the fuck is live so shit. You can't have anything. No friends, only shit jobs that make you want to die more, no time, money or energy for anything you want to do or can do, nothing you enjoy. Why the fuck should I even bother continue living in this world? And don't come with this temporary problem bullshit. This has been going on all my life. If things go better, they actually don't or only a little and only to get a lot worse after that again. I've been going through this all my life so far and I'm done with this shit. I fucking hate me and anyone else who has anything. Fuck those people, they don't deserve to be happy and should die just as well as me.

Only thing I have to do is get some heroin. That's easy. Only need enough to overdose and die and some place where no one will find and "save" me. I won't need money anymore anyway, so that doesn't matter. Then maybe I can at least be happy once and die being happy.
