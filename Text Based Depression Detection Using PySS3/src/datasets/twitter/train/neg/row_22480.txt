I dropped the ball on a couple of projects this year. Completely. I can't live with the guilt anymoreI have a chance to see my family next week to say my goodbyes.  This has been a very long time coming. It's been painful to be in a complete limbo in life with nobody or nowhere to go, and failing with what I do have. Everything keeps piling up and getting worse and worse and worse. I can't carry this anymore.
