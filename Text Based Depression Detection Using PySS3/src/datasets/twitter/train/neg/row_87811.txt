Me (a poem).Me.

Some of you might think that this is a joke,

But I assure you; this is real, folks.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

Everyday Iâ€™m under overwhelming stress,

I always feel like a complete mess, always trying to impress!

I try so, so hard to be perfect,

It was my â€˜reputationâ€™ I was trying to protect.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

I questioned my value as a human being,

And it was with this negative voice whom I was agreeing.

The voice told me I wasnâ€™t good enough,

I wasn't worth that much,

I would never measure up!

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

Andâ€¦ I believed that voice,

But I didnâ€™t have a choice.

There was no escaping it,

Not even a little bit!

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-
 
I doubted my every move,

Questioned every approve,

Always trying to improve!

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

Everything I did wasnâ€™t good enough,

Iâ€™d get frustrated when things got tough.

I was falling down this endless downward spiral,

My life was starting to become a living Hell!

I was in this bottomless pit of despair,

Always feeling like I would never compare.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

Sometimes I would lose my will to live,

Because it was myself whom Iâ€™d never forgive.

My self-esteem slowly deteriorated,

I was unable to complete simple tasks, I was so frustrated!

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

I felt alone, sluggish and weary all the time,

I felt like a failure, like I was out of line.

I felt worthless and out of control,

Failure was certain and broken was my soul.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

However, some of my friends had proven true,

They listened to me when I was feeling blue.

They made the suicidal thoughts go away,

Even if they came back later in the day.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

If you or someone you know is feeling particularly sad,

That youâ€™re hurting so, so very bad.

Just know that youâ€™re not on your own,

Know that you arenâ€™t alone.

Here are some ways to make you feel better:

Search up BiteBack, KidsHelpline or contact a counsellor.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

To some, this poem might come as a surprise,

But I just needed to open your eyes.

To this day,

I still feel those ways.

But Iâ€™m working on getting better,

Even though I still feel a bit bitter.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

Some of you might think that that was a joke,

But I assure you; it was real, maybe too real, folks.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-

This is an older poem I created for this school thing called a Poetry Slam. We had to present the poems and while everyone talked about their favourite things in life, I wrote about this so naturally, I never presented. 
Anyways, should this be a regular thing? Should I keep posting my poems? Or nah, this stuff is lame and itâ€™s absolutely dreadful.
