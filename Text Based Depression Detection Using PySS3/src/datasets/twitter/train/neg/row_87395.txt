Feel Stuck and WorthlessSo, I graduated from High School last year and haven't done anything worthwhile since. I work a dead end job in a dead end city that's going belly up. I didn't apply to any colleges because I thought I would be dead before I graduated, and now I feel inferior to all my friends who've all gone on to good colleges. 

Every time anything goes even a little wrong in my life, the first thing I think of is "Why bother dealing with it, kill yourself."
I have had a vague sort of idea on how I would do it, but I don't actually have the materials needed to do it. The main deterrent has basically been the thought of my family having to deal with it. Sometimes I wish I would just be diagnosed with a terminal illness with very little time left so no one could blame me for dying, and they could have some closure.
