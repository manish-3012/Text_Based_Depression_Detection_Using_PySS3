I hate that I'm not afraid anymoreBut at the same time; it has helped me feel the most free I've ever felt. I finally feel as if I have an essence of control over my life.

I want to ask you guys here a question. What helps you hold your grasp on reality - what helps you wake up each and every single day regardless of how shitty and crummy it may get. Because as of now, I don't know where to get a hold of that grip. All I wanna do is let go and finally be free.
