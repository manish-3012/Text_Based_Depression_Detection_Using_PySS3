I just need someone to tell me I'm still human.I'm having such a hard time lately. I've been beaten half to death and raped by my ex. I've been constantly told I'm garbage, I'm trash, I'm nothing. I wake up screaming a lot. I feel like I need help, but my brother has so many problems, I feel too guilty to ask my mom for help. She always hugs me and tells me "at least I have one normal child."


I don't feel normal. I hate my reality. I hate looking in the mirror and seeing all the scars and remembering what they're from. I don't feel like a person. The internet is where I feel good. People seem to like me. They tell me I matter. On Facebook, I have so many friends and followers. It makes me feel not alone.... but now I feel like they only liked me because I was fat. The gym became my escape. I lost so much weight. And then.. no one liked me anymore. They didn't compliment me because I "didn't need it" anymore. Yesterday I lamented that I have to wear children's clothes now. I was mad. I was told no one cares. And to stop bragging. I feel like an adult trapped in a child's body. No one cares. They said I'm lucky I have to wear children's clothing. I am getting so much hate.


I like to write. I took to reddit instead. I wrote stories. I felt so proud of my stories. They got cross posted. People are laughing at me. They're calling me trash, a pig. Just a fat American nothing. Everything I post is down voted. My Facebook friends don't like me anymore. All my friends in real life left because I'm so quiet. 


I'm so lonely. I feel like trash. A pig. A child. I feel like I don't want to feel anymore. I just want to be human.
