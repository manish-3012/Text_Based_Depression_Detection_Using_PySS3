helpI feel suicidal today, maybe one day everything will be okay but right now it doesnt feel that way, infact it feels the exact opposite, i feel like i wont make it past today. honestly does anyone ven care? int his moment in time it feels as if no one does. yeah sure in the back of my mind i know some people do. butt right now the pain and numbness is clouding my head and i feel like it has to end. I have to end. No one said life was easy but why does mine have to be so hard. I dont care what you think of me. I'm just venting, its what I do, I'm fed up, annoyed, over, plain and simple. im done. would anyone notice? would anyone care? i have what i need so whats stopping me? I dont want anything stopping me.
