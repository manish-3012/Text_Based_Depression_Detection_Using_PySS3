I donâ€™t believe my mindMy mind isnâ€™t me. Itâ€™s not what I want to be. I know itâ€™s wrong but itâ€™s screaming at me. Nothing awful, or things that should concern others, but itâ€™s yelling.

I feel delusional. I feel like my reality hasnâ€™t been there for the past 4 years of my life. And whoâ€™s to say Iâ€™m not doing it again right now? I barely remember a moment from the past six months. This disconnect, this utter confusion, makes me want to kill myself. It makes me believe that if I should smash my head in this would all make much more sense. Iâ€™ve tried for too long to make sense of it and itâ€™s pretty much just me convincing myself that Iâ€™m normal. Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m fragments of what I used to be. I look at photos of when I was a child and I sob. Such innocent and I never meant to turn out like this.
