I should kill myselfThat's the sentence I repeat in my mind, when I'm sad. It gives me false sense of hope, a hope in death itself. The eternal darkness but it's actually hopeful. Can you imagine? I thought too much about why I'm like this, life I guess, childhood traumas and all that.

I don't really know what I expect from life, it's just- I think to myself, when I'm sad, I say "I should kill myself", but that makes me happy, but then I'm like realllyyy scared of death for a moment, because what if death was eternal agony instead of darkness? 

I really hate uncaring, harsh and rude people, but I'm like them, because I'm bitter in my soul.

I'm so afraid of death, but at the same time I find my happiness in it.

I hate being alive, it's a burden for me, but I don't want to hurt the ones I love. I'm trapped. I already tried ending my life once, got over 50 stitches on my both arms and wrists, I don't want to do it again, I wish I was never born. I hate myself. When I look at the mirror and see my face, I just want to cut it to pieces, because it looks soo dumb and desperate and blank.
