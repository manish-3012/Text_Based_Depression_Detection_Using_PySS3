I cant beieve I'm back here.I never thought I'd be posting here again. I'm a wreck. I just snapped on my fiance and I didnt realize that I've been doing it for months. I am already on mood stabalizers antidepressents. What's wrong with me. Why am I like this. Why cant k control my angry. Why cant I fucking let go of th abuse of the past. It's gone it happened why xant it just go the fuck away. Jm in my head and I cant ber out. I'm a fucking wreck. I dont believe she loves me. I dont belie e anyone loves me, I legitametly hate my self. Theres nothing about me to love. Theres nothing about myself I'll ever love. Everyone sees me as a failure but no one will say it.im so tired of this. Fuck my entire life. I dont know why this happens. I cant bemieve I feel like this again. I've been fine for months. Why does god do this to me. Please help. I want to just drive away from my sisters and walk into a forest or desert and just wander until I die. What's wrong with me. Will I get better will I ever love my self. Will they ever leave me alone and go away and stop taunting me. What's the point of life, I'm feeling so worthless and down that I dknt sre apoint. I'm so scared to die but it's so appealing right now.
