I wouldn't mind someone to talk to...I'm sorry for taking up your time with this generic post. I don't know what I'm really doing anymore, real life just confuses and bores me, and any though of the future is pretty bleak. The thought of offing myself is constantly barging into my brain, and I just want someone I can talk to about this. Please, if someone could just chat, that'd mean the world to me.
