Is this normal?If I didn't have friends and family members to see tomorrow for Mother's Day, I might off myself. The only thing keeping me from doing that is the thought of my loved ones being in pain. Is this normal?? Edit: And when I have these thoughts, I think of myself as being selfish. Dafuq?
