My Death Will Be More Meaningful To Me Than My Life Has Ever Been.My failures burn onto my skin from attempts to douse inner pain with the outer ulterior.  
They now serve as self inflicted reminders of the unsteady understanding I came to terms with as a child. A promise to my paradigm.  
I once shredded my skin raw believing it would grow back stronger, to protect and hide who I really am from anyone else.  
Now I realize I am completely open and without shelter, spilling and spelling out my injuries like a gutted dog crawling into death.
Still I try to slink deeper into my dysthymia, I consciously concede to this self destruction.
Because I am not safe anywhere else.
I cannot and will not let anyone come closer for fear of the healing skin they held peeling away as they leave.  
I have already missed the forest for the trees and the trees for the leaves, I can now only hope that  

the leaves will fall and  
die, rotting and hiding  
my physical failures
