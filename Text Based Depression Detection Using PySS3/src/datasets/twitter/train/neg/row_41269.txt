Things aren't all goodAt the moment I keep thinking about killing myself, 4 years ago I nearly jumped off a motorway bridge, I suffer massively from several mental health issues, all of which are severe, I hide how much they affect me. My teachers at school keep laying the workload on, I'm failing most my courses and am looking set for a terrible future, I can't turn to my parents as their views on mental health issues will only worsen the issue, I don't want to dump this on my friends as I'm too nervous, I have developed insomnia over the course of this year, I can't sleep most nights, I mean it's 5:23 am here and I haven't slept, I've tried, but I couldn't.
I may seem like a kind to not be interested in dating, although I would actually like to start doing that, but my social anxiety stops me from doing anything.

I'm stuck thinking of my own death all the time, I can't see myself living well, my mental illnesses stop me from living normally

And I'm too anxious to say it
I force myself to suffer in silence

I wish I was normal
But I'm not.
