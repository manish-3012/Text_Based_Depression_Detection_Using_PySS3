Just got back from the bar.I just went to a bar for the first time in years. I was there with my husband and two of his coworkers. Everyone was talking to each other and having a good time except for me. I thought I would be able to break out of my shell a little and have fun but I just sat there and only talked if someone spoke to me, which only happened a few times. They were good people and they seemed fun but I just don't know how to talk to people.

My husband got very drunk and was flirting with the bartender and talking about his attractive coworkers, but I know he would never cheat on me. He was being very outgoing and having fun, and I'd only seen him like that a few times. I just feel like I'm holding him back from being himself and making him miserable. I'm always down and never do anything fun and I can tell it's really affecting him.

I know I'll never be able to make friends or have a job and I can't even bring anything into a relationship. I really think the world would be better off without me, I don't contribute to society at all, I just make people uncomfortable I think.

All night they were telling me that it's ok to be shy and they used to be shy but I don't think they understand the extent of it. I really don't think it will ever change for me. I try to get jobs but usually quit within a week because I'm just so awkward and I can tell people don't like me.

Idk what to do, I can't afford a therapist or antidepressants and I don't think it would help anyways because I've tried it before. I just want it all to be over with, I'm tired of trying to be happy and normal.
