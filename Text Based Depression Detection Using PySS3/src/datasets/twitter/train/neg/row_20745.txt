Iâ€™m sorryI just want the pain to stop, I canâ€™t even trust my memories anymore.
Everyday is a struggle.
I might be insane
Iâ€™ve hurt people and Iâ€™ve been hurt. 
I donâ€™t want to spend my life in a nut house, or as a shell of what I once was. 

To C-   I hope you make it as a writer, youâ€™re like my brother. We used to talk about game of thrones , novels, and girls for hours. Those were simpler times, better times. Never blame yourself, you always had my back.

To J-  Stay off the drugs and keep skating. Who knows? You might go pro.
 
To I- I remember the love you gave me. I remember how you made me feel, it was fucking amazing.

To T- I understand why you did it bro, and I forgive you. We were so fucked up, but we were just kids. We didnâ€™t know any better. If I knew your pain, I would have told you I loved you more and been more patient. We were just stupid kids

To N- You tried your best to help me, Iâ€™ll always love you. 

To E- please stay perfect, donâ€™t let the world change you. Youâ€™re going to rule the fucking planet. If I wasnâ€™t the best older brother, Iâ€™m sorry. I love you like youâ€™re my own kid.

To dad- You werenâ€™t the best man or husband, but you were the best father. This isnâ€™t your fault, itâ€™s mine

To mom- I fucking love you, words canâ€™t explain it. I hope we meet again. Heaven is your embrace. This is my fault, not yours. 

To that little girl- Youâ€™re a mirror to my soul

To all the people Iâ€™ve hurt- Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m fucking sorry, Iâ€™m fucking sorry, Iâ€™m fucking  sorry. 

To God and the angels- I tried my best, please forgive me. Iâ€™m still hoping youâ€™ll save me.

When itâ€™s over, I hope I spend eternity in a beautiful Forrest with a clear view of the stars.  I hope I live carefree like a child again. I hope I get to hug my mum again.

I know I donâ€™t have the balls to do it, but life is pushing me. Maybe Iâ€™ll live and look back at this as a bad dream. 

If youâ€™re reading this, fight for as long as you can, then fight some more. Then when you canâ€™t fight some more try to find someone to fight for you.
Follow your heart. Donâ€™t judge and donâ€™t hate. You canâ€™t run away from your heart, or your shadow. The past and future DO NOT exist, so be here now. Feel how your heart beat, follow itâ€™s rhythm, hear the earth under you, and watch as your thoughts come and go, Canâ€™t you feel how peaceful it is? 

I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m saying anymore, but letting all this out feels good.
