I just want to stop the tears.When I'm alone I cry all the time. Ever since my wife died 5 years back I've been sad. The constant sadness made me depressed so I stopped doing basic things like looking after myself properly &amp; ended up getting bullied at work. Life went on like that for 3-4 years, every day another comment, more depression &amp; it was all just a dull background roar to the grief of loosing her. 

Cut to recently &amp; I a spate of bullying gets me angry. One of the bullies mentioned my wife, words were said &amp; I ended up resigning. 

Now I sit here &amp; wonder what happened to me? The guy who had it all, the wonderful women, the great job, the big group of friends. It's all gone now. I've nothing but a TV, a cat &amp; a roof over my head. The roof will go when the money runs out in Feb. 

So what do I do now? Get a new job? Why bother? Everyday is suffering for me. Everyday I live is just suffering for other people. All I want to do is go to sleep &amp; wake up in heaven with my wife. I don't want to kill myself, I just want top stop the tears.
