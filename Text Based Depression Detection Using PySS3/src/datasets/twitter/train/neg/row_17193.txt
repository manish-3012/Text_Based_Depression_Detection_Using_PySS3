It's me againSorry, I have no one to share this with, it's about my girlfriend, she's the only one who I can trust but I donÂ´t want to worry her or to put pressure on her, and I don't trust my family or friends to ask for help.

We have been together for about 2 years and few months, and now she's my entire life. But over the past year I haven't been offering her the best I could, I've been not listening to her about what I can do to improve the relationship, and she has been not totally enjoying us. I know I'm guilty about too many things, and I has been on me the whole time. 

I don't even know what I'm writting, I just want her to be happy,  I want her to love me for who I am, and I know she does, but I'd wish it would be enough. 

I don't want to worry her because over the past weeks, whenever something bad happened, suicide thouhgts came to me, and, as time passes, those thoughts become stronger adn stronger. We've just chat about breaking up, and she's my life, I have no one else to be my support, and I want no one else. Now, if I have to live without her, I just want to die.
