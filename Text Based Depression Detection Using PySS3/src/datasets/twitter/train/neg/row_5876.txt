Got in an incredibly minor car accident, but afraid of consequencesUh...

Long story short, I pulled a hit and run on somebody after panicking. After we had pulled over. Like a dick. Doesn't help that the guy in my passenger seat was screaming about the guy possibly pulling out a gun when he reached into his passenger side. It's worth noting that it didn't look like I did any damage to his car, though I only saw it from an angle and from afar.


He might have got my plate, I'm not sure, but I'm very concerned about whether or not he did. Like, I'm prepared to kill myself if the cops show up. I can't go to jail. I can't afford a fine. My life will be ruined. I'll have to die. 

It's really petty, I know, but I am stressed the fuck out right now and ready to blow my brains out of they show up. I don't wanna die, but I don't want to live in misery over something small. I know I'm being paranoid, but my stress levels are through the roof. I just needed to get home. I didn't see him coming. I don't know what happened. It's the second accident I've gotten into within a span of two weeks, and I feel really shitty.
