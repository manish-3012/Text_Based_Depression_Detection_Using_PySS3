Unemployed, lonely, suffering with depression and suicidal thoughtsI quit my job back in October because they wouldn't promote me from part time after two and half years with the company. Ever since then I haven't been able to find work which has made my depression worse. I have a BA degree in English Writing but it hasn't done anything for me. My mother passed away when I was 19 and I miss her a lot. But Anyway, I'm 27, unemployed, still live at home and I have no stable relationship (actually never had one with a female...). I have keloid scars on my back so I'm very insecure and it destroys my self esteem. Anyway, I feel pathetic constantly, and this is cliche, but I'm starting to feel like suicide is the only way out. I can't seem to make any progress in life no matter how hard I try...and I'm just dead inside.
