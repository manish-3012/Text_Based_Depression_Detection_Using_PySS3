This is well overdueLong time listener, first time caller. 
I've been battling with suicidal ideation since I was in secondary school, so... Around 11 probably? 
I've had a couple of pathetic suicide attempts with paracetamol overdoses, all that bought me was a night in hospital, treatment with NAC and some disappointed looks from my parents. 
I've been thinking for a long time about actually trying a fatal method. 
I struggle every day to cope with the emotions going on inside my head. I either feel everything at once or nothing at all. I'm diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. 10% of BPD sufferers complete suicide, and I can't help feeling that I'm just gonna be another statistic. My problem is this: I'm training to be a mental health nurse. I got into the field because I wanted to use my lived experience to help others... But I really don't think I'll ever be well enough to help anyone else. 
I had a meeting with my uni recently because a lecturer found my suicidal tweets. I was expecting that they were going to offer some support but actually they just asked me to stop posting tweets like that because it reflects badly on the uni. 
I'm not looking at this with tunnel vision. I can visualise every single person who I think would be at least a little affected by my death. Family, friends, colleagues. But why should I suffer to spare their feelings? 
My ideas are either a ligature/hanging, or a well thought out drug overdose. I spend a good part of every day fantasising about this and I just can't think of why I should put up with this pain anymore when i know there's a way out...
