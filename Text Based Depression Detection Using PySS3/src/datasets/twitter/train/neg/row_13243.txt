Should be dead.I should be dead now. I am currently cutting myself and don't want to stop. I can't control my body. 

I am 18 male and live with the parents who are currently divorcing. I have no friends. No girlfriend. Nothing. I am alone in this cold, empty room.

I don't want to wake up in the morning.
