I think everyone is waiting for me to goIâ€™ve been suicidal since I was 12. A mix of bullying and abandonment issues with a touch of mental abuse. I was 13 the first time I tried. Then next day as I was throwing up in the toilet my dad asked if what I was doing there. A few months later he found the note and basically shrugged it off. Iâ€™m 17 now almost 18 and Iâ€™m in college. Iâ€™ve tried jumping out my grandmas car, hanging, and even tried death by disease(high blood pressure).  Iâ€™m not as bad as I was back then but even now I get days where I feel like maybe if I do kill myself, every one will just say it was a matter of time
