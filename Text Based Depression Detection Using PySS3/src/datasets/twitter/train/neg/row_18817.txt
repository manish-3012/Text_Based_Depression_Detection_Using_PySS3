why do I even botherMy first suicide attempt was when I was 12. I jus entered middle school and my depression skyrocketed because a lot of friends left me behind and my parents' expectations.

When I was getting counselling from the school (which lasted two days and never happened again) the friends I had left and my parents told me how stupid I was to attempt. I felt more alone than ever but my parents refused to get me real counselling on the grounds that "my depression didn't really exist".

I'm 23 now and have had several attempts since then, only two of which I actually tried to go through with. Again, after the few weeks of mandatory therapy (which ended up being redundant since the therapists told my parents everything I said) my parents, instead of being there for me, told me how annoying it was to deal woth someone "faking" suicidal tendencies.

Nice to know that nothing jas changed and NOW I have zero friends and no support system. Wondering why I even bother anymore.
