The EndI think Iâ€™m gonna do it tomorrow when I get off of school. Iâ€™ll walk to the bridge thatâ€™s by my school and be finished. Iâ€™ve done all I can do. Iâ€™ve begged God not to send me to hell, but I guess f he does Iâ€™ll understand. Or maybe Iâ€™ll just walk. Go lay in a field somewhere and just do I donâ€™t know what. Iâ€™d have to hide so Iâ€™m not found. I get it. No one likes me and Iâ€™m done. No one believes the beings are real. Iâ€™m always getting scolded for talking to them, but at the end of the day, I believe they are real. People only want my mind. My feelings, my beliefs, nothing else matters. Just school, homework, donâ€™t talk to the beings or youâ€™ll destroy your fucking mind. Itâ€™s not worth it. Living. I donâ€™t want to be killed but I suppose that might get me out of hell. My mom said I like being sick and thatâ€™s why I talk to the beings. But I think theyâ€™re real and I want to talk to them. She just said that to hurt me I think. Thatâ€™s okay. I want this nightmare to be over. My life is a fucking nightmare. And the kicker is that it could be worse. It could always be worse. I donâ€™t understand how all of these people are okay with living in this world. I want out. I doubt God will just kill me in my sleep. One can hope I guess. Tomorrow I have to do something. I canâ€™t tell anyone or theyâ€™ll tell my mom who will be undoubtedly pissed that I could ever think of telling anyone how shitty I feel. Maybe theyâ€™d talk me out of feeling this way. Maybe theyâ€™d know exactly what to say. Iâ€™ll never know. Iâ€™ll probably get too scared to do anything. Maybe not.

TLDR; The beings are real, everyone hates me, life is too hard, people only care about my intelligence, Iâ€™m going to just walk away or kill myself tomorrow.
