I donâ€™t even know whyIts been like a routine almost. 

Just going out to the balcony, try to jump, chicken out, break down crying and going back to try to make myself bleed as if it does anything useful.

Half of the things I do donâ€™t even make sense, and I couldnâ€™t really form a concrete reason as to why would I try and contemplate suicide again and again, nothing other than an overhanging sense of- what exactly, I donâ€™t even know.

I should be concentrating in school, try to maintain my grades, deal with the exams.

I should be, but I am not anyways.

At least I know why I go to the balcony every single time. Probably because there is no bath, the knives are dull as heck, I donâ€™t fancy hanging, nor is there a place to hang anyways; this is not America, and as much as I hate myself drinking detergent doesnâ€™t seem to be an effective, nor intelligent way to off myself.

(Eye roll)

What the heck am I even doing with my life these days.
