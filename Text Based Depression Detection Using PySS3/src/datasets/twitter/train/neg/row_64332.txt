I met someone.So, at the moment, I'm working in a retirement home. And on the second floor, there is a young girl, sadly I don't know her age, but I know her name and found her on FB. She's single and really beautiful, no age there either. In the moment now, I don't know if I should just message her and add her to a friend, because I'm scared of the consequences that she might doesn't like me or something, she smiles at me at work when we see each other. Now I'm not sure if she's just nice like, to everyone or only me, I can't tell. But why do I write this to you, you might wonder? It's because I planned to end my life on 31. of December. But maybe, this could save me? I realize that this sounds really abusive, but being with someone that I love is so important to me... I hate being single. But atm, I just don't see any point in life... I mean, if she says no, I still can kill myself and it's all over right?
