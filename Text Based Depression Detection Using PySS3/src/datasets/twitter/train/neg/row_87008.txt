Should I die in the ocean?Im 19 years old in college, i have an eating disorder, i was abused as a child for 11 years, i was raped in college and i have many substance addictions that most people dont know about. Im just so tired of dealing with the disappointments of the world. Long story short, I went on a vacation with some college peers to feel better (spring break) and I think it would be best to die on the beach. I feel peaceful here. The rip currents are rough this week and it would be very easy to take some pills and walk into the ocean and slip away. The only thing that's holding me back is my boyfriend and dad. (I'm not sure how to leave them). What should I do?
