Recurring suicidal ideations despite â€œknowing betterâ€Created this account today specifically to post here. 

Throughout my life Iâ€™ve had recurring thoughts of suicide despite having a â€œgoodâ€ life. I have many things to be grateful for;

-	I have a well-paying, enjoyable job with good benefits that gives me a sense of purpose 

-	I have family who I *know* loves me

-	I am in relatively good health for someone with my illness (arthritic condition diagnosed at 22)

-	I am fortunate to have a serious education 

-	I have a solid support system 


Why then do I feel this way? Itâ€™s because that, in spite of all of this, I know the pendulum will eventually swing back the other way and for every good thing that happens to me there will be a negative at some point in the future. 

Itâ€™s this cycle, this perfectly natural unavoidable cycle of life that I canâ€™t stand and that makes me want to just remove myself from it all. Moments that should be joyous and fun are constantly muted because I am too acutely aware of their impermanence. On top of this, I also know that even the most well meaning people who love us will eventually disappoint us in some way. Itâ€™s inevitable and that makes me very sad. 

On top of this, I self sabotage my chances to have fulfilling romantic connections (which is something I would really like to have) because I would rather keep it as some â€œalmost perfectâ€ unreachable state than allow someone to love me, be their natural imperfect self, and eventually hurt me too. 

I was physically and emotionally abused by my mom growing up and it had all the implications one would think. It negatively impacted my attachment style, it led to suicidal thoughts and self harming as a teen and I have disassociated a lot. Iâ€™ve been in therapy throughout my life and it helps, meds just make me feel like a zombie or gain weight. 

I donâ€™t want to die, necessarily, but I often question how much I want to live. Will my highs ever feel good enough to make up for the lows? Iâ€™ve had genuinely good moments but if Iâ€™m being really honest most days pass mundanely. 

What makes this particularly ironic is that I work in health care and am constantly trying to help patients get away from the very feelings I often feel myself. 

If I didnâ€™t have people in my life who relied on me I donâ€™t know if I could find enough of a reason in anything else to stay alive. Not when I know that nothing good will last.
