The only reason I'm alive is for other people. What about -my- emotional well-being?My welfare is about to run out, and so my family's pushing me to find a job. I'm 22, never held a job before, and nobody will hire me. I'm expected to walk outside in the heat for eight hours a day looking for a job, begging people I hate to give me a job I hate. Ironically, the only way I can see my life getting worse is if I *had* a job. I don't fucking want to flip burgers. I'd just want to kill myself day in, day out. I've job hunted before, and I get turned away at every opportunity. Literally nobody wants to hire me. Better for my mental state, worse for my financial state.

I've honestly thought about what would happen if I just flung myself into traffic. Oh, but everyone else would be sad if I died. Oh, but my niece would grow up without an uncle. Oh, but your mother loves you. But what about me?! Should I continue hating every fucking second of my life because other people want to see me alive? I've also heard to think of you meeting your future self. What would they say if you said you want to die? I see my future self either homeless and alone, or *literally* insane from all this stress.
