what counts as a suicide attempt?because there has been times where iâ€™ve tried to kill myself but iâ€™ve been stopped before i could actually do anything, does that count? 
and thereâ€™s been times where no one stopped me but i still did something harmful, obviously bit harmful enough, but does that count? 
and thereâ€™s been a time where i ended up in hospital, that must count right? 

iâ€™m just confused about what a suicide attempt actually is, and if anyone has any answers then please share them with me x
