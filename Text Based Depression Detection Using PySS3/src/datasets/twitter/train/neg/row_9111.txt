Please help meI have been suicidal for almost eight months now, ever since I considered it as a viable solution to my problems. I tried meds, no luck. I am in therapy, but yet here I am, still obsessing about suicide. I don't know how to stop.

I have a medical condition that causes me to be ill quite often. I have been trying to cope, but as things progress it becomes harder and harder. My mind keeps turning back to suicide as the logical answer. I don't know how I even thought of it in the first place. It is so strange. Maybe my body is telling me to do it because I am not fit to continue. I am so lost and afraid. I just want to feel better again.
