I wanted to get this off my chest. Sorry my reasons aren't as good as yours.Yesterday I got back from the hospital. My boyfriend (now ex I suppose) called the police on me. I was minutes away from killing myself when they showed up. I spent 3 miserable days in a psych ward and the ER, until I told them I was "just upset when I said I was going to kill myself". I know I need help, but going to any ward won't help me. Going back would push me over the edge, I know that for sure.

Honestly, all I want right now is to die. Iâ€™m so scared of doing it, but I just canâ€™t live like this any more. Iâ€™m a very weak person. But I canâ€™t put up with feeling like this. Everyone says it will pass, and Iâ€™ll get over it, but if it means another minute of this pain then I canâ€™t take it. I want to die so badly but I can't. 

Imagine this, youâ€™ve got a perfectly fine life, no troubles or cares about anything, and then suddenly, someone comes into your life and throws that into turmoil. Well I guess thatâ€™s not exactly what happened, he didnâ€™t mean to do that. I never knew that what he told me he loved me; Iâ€™d become dependant on that. I isolated myself and he became my only support. Then one day, he got tired of me. He left me with no life to go back to, nobody close to me to go to for support. When he told me he loves me, and that heâ€™d love me forever, that was a promise to me. And he broke it.

Maybe dying isnâ€™t the only thing I want. I want to get back together with him. I want to be able to rebuild my life, but I canâ€™t do that if I donâ€™t have him to support me and care about me. Maybe I want to get back together with him even more than I want to die. But dying is a lot more likely to happen. 

I wish I could talk to him about it, but I don't want to pressure him into a relationship again. I wish he'd just give me a chance. I need him to take a chance on me, otherwise I won't have anything to get better for.
