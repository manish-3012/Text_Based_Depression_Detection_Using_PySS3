Itâ€™s been really bad latelyIâ€™ve been suicidal for a long time but itâ€™s never been quite this bad. Lately it just seems like thereâ€™s no drive for me to do anything, like I have no purpose anymore.  I donâ€™t have the energy to do anything, and even when I do it just seems pointless. I just want to stop feeling this way, but I know there are people who need me, so I donâ€™t feel like thatâ€™s option is open to me. Itâ€™s really frustrating to be suicidal but feel like Iâ€™m trapped in life. Itâ€™s not thereâ€™s much wrong with my life, I live a pretty good life, I have an apartment, Iâ€™m engaged, I have really cool dog, and some friends. But even with all that I still feel like life isnâ€™t worth living, my fiancÃ© would be better off, the dog likes him more anyways, and none of my friends would really care if I was gone. My fiancÃ© is really the only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself, heâ€™s told me before that Iâ€™m his only reason for staying alive, and I donâ€™t want to be the reason that he dies, I want him to have a long and happy life, I just donâ€™t feel like he can do that with me here. Iâ€™ve always felt like my life was going to end at my own hands, itâ€™s just so frustrating to be ready for it and not be able to. I just want to die, but I have to stay, for him.
