today is the daylife has brought me nothing but pain. why cant my life be normal? why cant I be normal? nothing brings me happiness anymore. I count the hours go by as the day progresses, hoping I can go to bed soon. at the same time, I fear waking up because of the hours of anxiety I get. it's ironic because i cant sleep anymore because of  it. ive lost my appetite. I only eat once a day or nothing at all. i can only down coffee and I've ended up losing 20 pounds in the past three weeks. nothing helps anymore, not the massive amount of antidepressants I'm forced to take every day, not the support of my friends, not the opportunities I have ahead of me.

life is unbearable, and it's getting more and more painful each day. i just want it to stop. i just want to sleep.
