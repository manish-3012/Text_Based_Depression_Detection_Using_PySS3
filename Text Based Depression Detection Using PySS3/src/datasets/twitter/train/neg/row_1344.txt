Iâ€™ve told no one, until now.Iâ€™m dizzy. Iâ€™m broken. Iâ€™m full of every negative emotion. Iâ€™ve just gone cold turkey off my SNRI and I know thatâ€™s unhelpful but I donâ€™t even care. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for years. Had a solid attempt 9 years ago. Landed in ICU for days then the psych ward for a week. Iâ€™ve learned all of the coping mechanisms and they worked for a good long time, but havenâ€™t at all for about a year now. Iâ€™m too far gone. I know I could reach out to anyone and theyâ€™d try to help me, but there is nothing that will help. I am excited to be dead. I broke my brain when I abused prescription pain medication in my 20s. My brain chemicals will never recover. Iâ€™ve been happy since then, but I cannot be any more. 

I want to die. I need to die. I am going to die, and I am excited to be done. 

My only regret is my kids....Iâ€™m sad for them.
