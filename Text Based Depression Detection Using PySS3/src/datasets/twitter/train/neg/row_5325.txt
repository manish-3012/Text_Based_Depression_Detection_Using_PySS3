I think I attempted suicide...MaybeI always've been pessimistic about life and everything, but past couple of years everything has gone to shit. I've been without a job for over two years, I'm back at my mom's home, I have the equivalent of $500 bucks right now, from selling my phone and buy an used one, and my girlfriend is buying me food to keep me going. I'm 27 and I can really feel the pressure of "getting my life together" from every side, even from myself.

Truth be told the only reason I haven't done it yet is because of my girlfriend and the support she gives, but if it wasn't for her I guess my fucked up expectations wouldn't let me sleep. I've also been having one the worst weeks. I've been locked up at the apartment for the past five days, GF was away for work during the weekend, she gives lectures all over the country. She came home on sunday, I picked her up on the airport and went to her place, she was super tired so we just hanged out a little and I came back home.

I couldn't sleep, just wanted to sleep and the anxiety and self-depreciation started hitting, I've felt this many times before. But lately it's being getting worse, and I've lost my hopes of actually making things work. 10 long years of this same bullshit, same repeating thoughts, same voices saying I'm worthless. Yesterday, a new one came up, a thought that actually makes me tear up just by thinking of it again. "My girlfriend doesn't deserve this shit"

She wants to have a family, and kids and the whole happy family package. But I'm never gonna fit on that, actually I'm gonna destroy her dreams by being pessimistic every day, shattering every bit of hope, alienating myself and and her from other people and just being a burden for her.  If we eventually get a kid, he will probably be fucked up by my genetics or worse, I will contaminate the poor kid with my depression and be a shitty father cause I'm to depressed to care for my own child.

I live by the beach, and yesterday after basically that line of thought up above, I waited for everyone to go to sleep and by 2 AM I went to the beach with the intention of running up in the water swimming as far as I could, then swimming some more until I couldn't feel my legs and then swim more until I couldn't feel my arms, for then to pass out in the sea. The beach around here also has the largest shark attack probability of the continent, so maybe I would get bitten by a shark and bleed out.

I went to the beach, put my feet on the water and chickened out. I guess some survival instinct still kicking, and sited there for about two hours trying to gather the courage to go in the water and end it all, until I appeared out of nowhere asking if I had drugs to give him.

&amp;#x200B;

I came back home, and slept through the whole day, over 16 hours of sleep. I've just waked up and is already dark again. I don't know if I will go to the beach again to finally do it, but I'm sure as hell thinking about it. I tried looking about a therapist, but I don't even have the money to go through with it and I don't want to go to someone who will fuck me up even more. I'm more scared of being numbed out by pills forever, than dying at this point. Is this even an attempt? Am I just being a drama queen about everything? How the fuck do you stop being depressed and get a functional life?

Just don't know what to do right now, or what to think right now
