Sisyphus was a loserI did well in classes. I learned to push the boulder uphill.

I got into a good college. I bought nice shoes to help push the boulder.

I graduated! I pushed the boulder successfully for the 100th time.

I lost a ton of weight. I got better at pushing the boulder.

I made an effort. I pushed the boulder again.

People said I'd be free from this boulder by now, what gives? Seems to me like there's still no relief. No matter how many boxes are ticked. 

It's still me, alone, rattling in this effigy. Ready to be lit aflame.
