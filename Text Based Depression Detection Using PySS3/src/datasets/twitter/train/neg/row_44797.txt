i feel alone in a room full of peoplemy psychosis is definitely coming back. i can feel it. my mental health team don't believe that i can be aware of it coming back but i know it is. i can hear everything again and every time i'm near people all i hear is silence. it's like i'm floating away. it's so quiet around me in crowded spaces. it is silent everywhere. but it's such a loud silence. and i feel so alone. and distant and cold and sensitive. i feel immensely suicidal but i can't be bothered to sort it out. i just want to take a lot of stuff and sleep for a couple days. i can't keep waiting for it to pass. i don't think i can bear going through this again. honestly i'm scared it's going to lead me to accidentally killing myself. i feel very alone and isolated. my angel of a girlfriend is trying so hard to be here for me, and she's doing so so so so incredibly well at her own recovery. i hate myself for relapsing and bringing everything down. she deserves so much better. i just want to walk away from everything. or blow my brains out. i can't deal with this all over again. it's so loud and so quiet. i wish i could hear people. i wish someone could hear me. i can't be hospitalised again. i'll definitely kill myself if i land in hospital again. i can't take it. i can't get help because i'm already in this fucking joke of a system and they don't believe im at risk. i will never be taken seriously. i either have to ride this out, or obliterate myself before it starts. my head hurts.
