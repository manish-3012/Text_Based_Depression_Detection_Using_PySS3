An update to a since deleted post I madeMade a post here Sunday of this week. Iâ€™ll recap before the update. 

Iâ€™m so deeply unhappy with my life, I see no future where Iâ€™m not just depressed. The only glue I had holding me together was the hope that this girl Iâ€™ve been talking to for over a year would like me and want to have a relationship. We went on a date on Saturday, it went really well but Iâ€™m just not sure that it can bring me enough happiness for me to not end it all anyways.

Today she let me know that while she likes hanging out with me, and is excited for our prom (weâ€™re going together in 2 weeks), she isnâ€™t in a place right now where she wants a relationship. At first I felt relief. I donâ€™t have to worry about trying to not fuck up a relationship. Itâ€™s been a few hours though and I feel worse than I ever had in my life. I updated my suicide note for the first time in a year. My life is completely falling apart. My grades are going to shit. I just donâ€™t think I can find happiness. I want to die so bad, and now I have no reason to keep holding on. I donâ€™t blame her for what she said, she can feel how she wants, I donâ€™t want to force her into a relationship she doesnâ€™t want to be in. Our prom is going to suck now though. Iâ€™m just going to be an awkward mess the whole night. I donâ€™t know what to do and the only alternative to this shitty existence that I can see is slowly becoming more and more a good idea. Rant over. I want to die.
