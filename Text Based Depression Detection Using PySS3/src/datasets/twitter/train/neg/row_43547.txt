Why do I even bother tryingAs someone with ADHD and Autism, I think it's about high time I realise that I'm the one responsible for my own trauma and pain.

Let's face it, I don't know how to talk to or interact with others. When I was younger I'd always end up getting into a fight with others, even though I often tried to do the right thing. 

Lots of people told me that I was going to fail out of school. My grades weren't so bad because they were at least good enough to enter university. I mean, I always wanted to be in the top set for everything. 

People said that I should accept my limitations and not try to be someone I'm not. Maybe had I listened and stopped doing all of that, I wouldn't be where I am today. 

I perhaps wouldn't be feeling so damn unhappy and anxious all the time. Maybe I should've just dropped out and stopped feeling like this. 

Let's face it, it's tough for me out here. If I claim that my bad behaviour is due to some tick, people will say I'm using an excuse to get out of something. 

Well, if that's the case then look at how I'm feeling. How do you expect me to understand how you're feeling if you're going to act offended and worked up over every little thing? 

I know I'm messed up. I can't change that. Fucking believe me, I'd do anything to change all the bad things I did in the past.
