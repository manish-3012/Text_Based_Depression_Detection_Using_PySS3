I'm giving myself two years. Two years to come up with a plan for doing it so my family isn't that hurt.I don't live in the US. If I survive a suicide attempt here, I'll likely end up in jail.  

I'm going to kill myself when I return to the US.

I'll have two more years with my husband (in this shit hole country I live in), two more years to write to my son and let him know I'm not mad at him, and I shouldn't have over reacted.  Two more years to finally stop lying to myself.

There is no hope.  This world is an evil horrible place with too many people.  Everyone lies, and most of the time, for most of my life, I've believed the lies.

There is nothing to be hopeful for.  I'm the most pathetic failure known to man.  And I can't lie to myself about it anymore.  

I'm not going to allow myself to believe the lies anymore.

There is no hope. None.  I have failed at life and death will hopefully be the only thing I succeed at.  I'm a burden to my husband anyway, and it will only get worse when we're back in the US.

I made it about 4 days without coming onto this sub. I thought I had found something to be hopeful about, but it's all a lie.

I just need to face the truth.  An overdose should do it. I'm sick of being poor and worthless and a failure.

All my worst nightmares have come true.  I give up.  

I've worked so hard for years and nothing has come of it.  I'm worthless.
