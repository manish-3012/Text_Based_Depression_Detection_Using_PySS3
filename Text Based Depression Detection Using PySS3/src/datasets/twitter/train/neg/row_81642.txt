(Question) Would it work if I saved up enough money to hire an Aftermath suicide forensic clean up crew before my suicide, and scheduled them to come after a day after my suicide?I have literally no clue how it works. My parents are already tens of thousands of dollars in debt even though my dad has a really high paying job, so I donâ€™t want to burden them any more than my actual suicide does.
