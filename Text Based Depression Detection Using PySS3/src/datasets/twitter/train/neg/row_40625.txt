I'm stuckI need help. I don't know what to do.

My mom has been suck most of my life. I've become mom 2.0 for my 5 younger siblings. My mom is going through therapy for some horrible stuff she went through. Has a result she decided we were moving.

 I was told on my birthday (1 month ago) we were moving and that I couldn't bring my dog of 2 years (got her for my birthday).

I was devasted. But I couldn't tell my mom because of her current state. It would ruin her. I cried almost every night. Head smothered in my pillow till i couldnt breathe. I worked full time, went to school half time. Took care of the family the rest.

I collapsed a couple of time from lack of sleep. My grades plummeted. I had to fight and try to get my dog a home. My dad told me two days ago that we had to send her to an adoption center (the pound).

I tried everything. I has no choice. I took her to the pound today. We move tonight. She has high anxiety and she nipped at the woman who grabbed her. They muzzled her and told us to leave to make it easier.

I didn't get to say goodbye. She cried has they pulled her away. I just had to walk away.

Now my dad is upset I can't help load the truck. I can't move. I can't breathe. I've been suicidall before but never like this. I can't let my mom know. 

I want my dog. I want to leave.
