I know I should give upI should just give up. I am apathetic, diagnosed sociopath with one really friend. I had a fucked up childhood, I am almost 18 now, I know I will never be sane like other people. I have no real reason not to give up other than I don't want to hurt my only friend or my sister. The only two who would care if I died. Maybe. They would get over it eventually though.

I am disgusting, I only hurt others and I rarely care, I cannot fall in love, I only feel pain, I can't remember a time I was ever truly happy.

Someone please help me.

Please.
