Strangely CalmI've been thinking a lot recently about how much of an asshole I've been, how I've been losing all my friends, how I can't open up to anyone because they dont know what to do and will leave, how if I dont tell them, they think I dont trust them so they leave anyways, and how I can't keep a straight mentality. I'm bipolar and unmedicated, I dont trust myself with medication due to past OD Suicide attempts. I want to do it again but I'm not freaking out about it like the times before, I'm extremely calm and almost content. Like it'll be okay if I'll do it. only the small rational part of my brain is holding me back right now.
