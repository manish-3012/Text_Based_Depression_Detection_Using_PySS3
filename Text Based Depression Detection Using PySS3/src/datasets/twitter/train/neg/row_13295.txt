Enough is EnoughMy Life sucks, my Mother hates me and my dad went out for "something" and never came Back. I think it would be good If He's gone forever. I'm going to do the same Thing s my dad did but in another way. I'm going to hang myself or drink something that could kill me. I mean, no one will miss me. Life is something i never signed up for.
