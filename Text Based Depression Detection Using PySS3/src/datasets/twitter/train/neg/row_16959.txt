Im going to kill myself as soon as I get a refill on my medicationI'm tired of it all. I'm lonely but I can't talk. I live in a group home that I don't like at all, I lost my mother, I lost my home, I have no friends or family to talk to. It probably won't be until Monday, I don't have money right now, but as soon as someone pays for it I'm going to do it. I know it's stupid since I just got approved for disability money, but I'm tired of waiting for a home. It'll be months til I get a better home and this place will continue to treat me like shit and cause me to lose my sanity.
I miss being a child, because at least I had mental health counsellors always by my side even if my mother was neglectful, and if I was still young I could have avoided this mess.
