Considering ending it soonI've gotten to a point where I'm seriously considering ending it soon. I've always had trouble connecting with people and making new friends but in the last few years since high school it's gotten severe. I have no friends that I spend quality time with, and it seems to be impossible make new connections. I've never been in a relationship. And since I've been out of work my days have devolved to playing video games by myself for hours on end. I've been told to find new interests but nothing ever engages me enough to stick with it.

I've been subtly preparing for quite a while now by distancing myself from the two close friends I grew up with, as well as my family. I got sober a year ago and I find myself asking "for what?". I've played the psychiatry game for years and tried scores of meds but I always end up in a place where I want to kill myself. I'm exhausted, I honestly might just go through with it.
