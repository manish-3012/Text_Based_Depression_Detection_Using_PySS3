I think I'm done with life. I'm so sick of being alive. I'm so tired of feeling so unhappy all the time. Summer is almost over, and I'll have to start going to school again. I'm supposed to be a junior (16) but I don't think I'm gonna be there this year. Ive always had social anxiety, but it's gotten so much worse. I'm the 'quiet girl'. No one at my school seems to like me, as most of them have tried to talk to me before and realized how awkward/weird I was. What they don't understand is that I try so damn hard to think of things to say to them, but they're always gone before even giving me a second chance. I wish people at my school could be a little more understanding of people with anxiety. I would love to sit and talk with someone about anything, I love hearing people talk about stuff. People just assume I'm some weird freak simply because I'm a bit anxious talking to them at first. I just wish people would be a little more forgiving of my social mistakes, but I know they'll never be. So unless my asshole alcoholic uncle lets me do homeschooling(which will never happen), I'm gonna have to kill myself. I'm too afraid to go back to school. I feel like a ghost. I might as well already be dead. The world is fucked up and sad anyways and I'm tired of seeing it.
