Here it isIâ€™m done. This is it. Itâ€™s never going to end. Iâ€™ve been trying for so long and itâ€™s just too much. Everything I do fails. I am a loser. I look like a loser. I have accomplished nothing in the 19 years Iâ€™ve been alive for. I just started uni and I already know it isnâ€™t it. I chose to do this just because I didnâ€™t want to disappoint my parents but now Iâ€™m once again proving to myself I canâ€™t make decisions and I donâ€™t know myself at all. Iâ€™m too deep in too quit. Besides, nobody will believe me anyways. But truth is, I am more depressed I have ever been. During quarantine I went through the worst episode ever. I have tried telling my councellor multiple times that I just canâ€™t be alive anymore but they wonâ€™t listen. Itâ€™s always this â€œcognitive thinkingâ€ and â€œyou just need to stop thinking negativelyâ€ and you know what? I take it all because Iâ€™m a loser who canâ€™t speak out. Now my coping mechanism is counting out pills for overdose and not eating for days because I donâ€™t deserve it. I donâ€™t deserve loving parents, I donâ€™t deserve this life and the anxiety is just too much. So I think/hope it will just end here. I am terrified of the pain of death but more terrified of the long-term pain life will cause me.
