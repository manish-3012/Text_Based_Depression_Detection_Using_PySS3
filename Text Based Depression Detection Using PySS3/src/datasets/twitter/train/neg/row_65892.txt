Why make the effortTo preface this I'm 16
I went to Disney world with a group of 150 people in my school band. We have to be in groups so I asked my best friend if I could be in his, and he said yes. On the 27 hour bus ride there I sat by myself and didn't make any contact with any friends. Except where I talked to my crush Kaleigh, which was basically every stop. I've never had a committed relationship and I'm a sophomore, and I felt very connected to her. I've been attracted to her for months, and planned on acting upon it at the hotel in Orlando. But, we never got time. Then at Epcot, the first of four parks we've been to, she leaves the park (against the rules) with two guys, one named Ian who she just started talking to that day. He asks her out, she says yes, I spend the next two days with my heart in the garbage. It ruined my once in a lifetime trip to magical Disney World. On top of that, my group of friends takes every opportunity to either make fun of or leave me somewhere in the park. I spend half my time trying to find them instead of riding rides or seeing shows. We're at a hard rock cafe now and as I'm typing this I feel like absolute shit. Nobody at my table has seen me type this. They're all focused on their phones as well. When I get home I want to end my life and the only thing holding me back is my family. I average a C in school, my friends couldn't care less if I'm with them or not, my family only loves me because they're obligated to, I spend all my time and money on video games because it's my only escape from my life. I know that I sound like the typical angsty teenager but I feel like my life has no worth. What do I do about it?
