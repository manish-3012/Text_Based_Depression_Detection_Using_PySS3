WSPD suicideAs tomorrow is World suicide prevention day then what better day to kill myself? Iâ€™ve been trying to prevent it for many years and now I feel like I canâ€™t. 

Iâ€™ve asked for help, Iâ€™ve tried to make my life better, Iâ€™ve lived with mental illness for nearly 25 years. 

Why not? There is nothing stopping me.
