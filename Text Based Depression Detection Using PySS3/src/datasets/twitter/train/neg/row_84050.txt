Hi all,
I donâ€™t have a lot to say, mainly because I have a feeling of emptiness, hopelessness and mostly unhappiness. 

Currently my days are consisting of doing ridiculous amounts of cocaine, any opioid pills I can find, Valium and all types of narcotics.

I know it is bad for me but I keep going back for more and more because I just donâ€™t care what the outcome is if my body canâ€™t handle it anymore.

I need to stop because my family and partner donâ€™t deserve to have me go like that but I donâ€™t have the will to live let alone get help for my drug abuse.

Donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m trying to achieve by writing this post, maybe itâ€™s to get things off my chest but who knows why this brain does any of the things it does anymore.
