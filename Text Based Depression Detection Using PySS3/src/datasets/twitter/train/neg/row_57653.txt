I'm a 27 white male survivor of an attempt, reconsidering...I want to be a writer but I can't get a job, I'm trying to break into some kind of industry, I took too much time doing nothing, too much time depressed about doing nothing, too much deliberating my future, I don't feel anyone wants to hear anything I have to say, the world feels so cur shingly indifferent to me, I have projects with friends that I do but I get distracted, I can't do anything right, no one wants to talk to me, I live at home and even though my parents mean well, they are filled with hate and love Trump, it's hard to like them, sometimes I feel like I may be bisexual but I've been assaulted by gay men and I have been molested by my teacher, I feel contaminated by this, I feel like no one will ever love me romantically again, my ex left me for someone with more money, I don't feel like I have anything to offer anybody, even though I have problems with my parents I'm scared of losing them, scared of moving out, I feel like I can't do anything right, I hate myself and I feel that I'm fighting a meaningless battle against a wave of indifference that just simply doesn't care for me. I hate that I feel so much self pity and hate, I don't feel like I can ever get out of this, I hate that I tried once but sometimes I feel like maybe I was right in the first place. I lost a friend to suicide... I saw the warning signs but I didn't think she'd do it. I don't think there was anything I could do. I met others that attempted suicide at the clinic, I don't know what happened to them, I'm scared they're all dead, I wanted to save them but you can't save anyone, I can't even seem to save myself
