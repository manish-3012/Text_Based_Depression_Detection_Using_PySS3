Mysophobia destroying meToday was just awful again. I cannot live with this desease anymore. One mistake today and a whole room is closed off for me I'm too afraid to enter it now. And whoever else goes in there just spreads the dirt contaminating other things in the process.

But of course I can't stop people from doing that which will continuosly shrink the area I can live in until I just reach a point where I can't live, eat or anything anymore because it's all dirty. I should just end it all now. I have taken different medications and treatments for 5 years now this is no longer a temporary problem and thus needs a permanent solution...
