Itâ€™s too late for everythingIâ€™m suicidal as fuck but I know that if I died tomorrow, no one except family would show up to my funeral, and for them it would be out of obligation. Iâ€™ve been depressed and had panic disorder my whole adult life and itâ€™s caused me to isolate and lose friends even though Iâ€™ve tried my best to stay in contact with them. Iâ€™m just not enough. It makes me feel like I was never enough and that none of my friendships were true. I wish I would have killed my self when I still had friends and people who would have cried at my funeral. But maybe they wouldnâ€™t have cried
