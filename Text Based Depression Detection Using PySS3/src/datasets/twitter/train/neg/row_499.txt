I have a small penis, I've never had a gf nor do I think I ever will. Don't know if life is worth living.I'm 26 years old and other than the woman front my life is going great. I'm graduating med school next year. However, I have a pretty small penis, and I feel like this is the main reason that at 26 (almost 27) that I've never been in a relationship. It's not that I'm not confident- I've read books on how to have the best techneaque, I perform oral on command. Please don't try to pass me that bullshit that size doesn't matter. I've twice had women, after seing my size, decide they aren't in the mood and go home, and never talk to me again. I've heard pleanty of lady friends talk about various guys with large ones and how great they are. "Size doesn't matter" is a lie made up by women to try to seem less shallow than men, when in reality they are just as bad. I think we have convinced ourselves that everyone who no longer wants to live is mentaly ill, but I don't buy that. If I knew for sure that I would go my whole life w/o a relationship, I would not want to live, and I don't think that makes me mentally ill.
