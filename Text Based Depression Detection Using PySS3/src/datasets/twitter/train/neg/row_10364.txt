What should you include in a suicide letter?I've written a couple before but I wasn't ready to go thru with it and they weren't very well worded or a good final goodbye to leave behind. I think I'm almost ready now though. And I don't want to leave them wondering or any loose strings, so what exactly should you include in a letter?
