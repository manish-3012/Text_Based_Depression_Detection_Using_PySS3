I Suppose I Should TalkI don't have concrete plans, but I always think about it when a train comes into the station. The only thing stopping me is my indecisiveness. Thought about therapy, but I'm on the high end of the cost ruler and at $200/h my insurance only covers 2 sessions. Paying that much to stay alive doesn't seem that attractive.
