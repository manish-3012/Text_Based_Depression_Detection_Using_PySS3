Any thoughts?I plan to kill myself a month from now, i will cut both my femoral arteries after a week of taking an anticoagulant and an antiplatelet.
I have thought of jumping into the Nile (I live in Egypt)  but I prefer something more private, I also thought of overdosing insulin but I might easily be saved before I die. 
Do you have better ideas? I want something that is guaranteed to work. 
The reason why I donâ€™t want to live is because I am a sad person, I always have been always will be. I was depressed as a child and still am (Iâ€™m 24) why keep suffering when I can just feel nothing.
