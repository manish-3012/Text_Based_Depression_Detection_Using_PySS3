I'm not sure how I feelI feel suicidal. Not because i am depressed but because I am content with myself. I come from a loving family, I have a girlfriend whom i care about very much and my grades at school average out to be around B or B+. I am not a religious person therefore the prospect of eternal damnation without relief is one that I do not believe in.


I'd like to consider myself a rational, intelligent human being and the conclusion I have come to regarding my life is one where I have accomplished all I have set out to accomplish. You may say, "You're still in school, what could you have possibly have achieved?" and i respond by stating that I don't believe in aiming high. I understand my strengths and weaknesses and I set my goals according to this evaluation of my inherent abilities. I do not wish to become married nor do I want kids. I have contemplated this for around a year now and the only reason I believe I am still alive is because of my wish to embetter the world. I see many problems that have become entrenched in society that I believe I can help fix, however as I continue to educate myself, I see the widespread issues that cannot be possibly addressed in a single lifetime. The daunting task I have not even started has become so overbearing that I do not think I can even comprehend it any longer.


Therefore I have reevaluated my goals and realised that anything that I want to experience has been experienced. Thank you for reading.

Tl;dr I am content with my life and believe ending it is the best course of action.
