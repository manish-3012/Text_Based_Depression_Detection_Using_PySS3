I want to be better, but I think it's impossible...I have cancer and so does my dad. His is life threatening but mine's under control. I was abused as a kid, my family hasn't talked to me until about a month ago but still one of my brothers is in hiding. My mom is miserable, she's gotten into some bad addictions. She regrets everything she did to me when I was little I think..I've forgiven both my parents, but they don't know how to interact with me. I was bullied all through school. I'm so lonely. I was raped by a person who I thought cared about me, over and over again. I have no job, no friends, no hope... I'm just sitting here cutting the hell out of myself for no reason.

TL;DR: I'm screwed up and worthless. I'm ready to end my life tonight.
