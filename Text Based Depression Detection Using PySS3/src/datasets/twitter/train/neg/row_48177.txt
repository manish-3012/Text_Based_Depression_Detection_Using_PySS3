How do you deal with passive suicidal thoughts?[25M] Iâ€™ve recently learned that a lot of people have these thoughts, to many different extents. The passive thoughts have challenged me. Iâ€™ve had the thoughts nearly every day for a year, but never a thought to act on them. so I figured it best to just talk to people about it. Iâ€™ve learned itâ€™s common, but that having them everyday isnâ€™t too normal or healthy. 
Iâ€™ve recently quit my job which was causing me a ton of self-loathing (despite the high pay and healthcare). so the depression has definitely subsided a bit. That being said, now I donâ€™t have health insurance to see doctors. 
I was hoping that someone might be able to share their experience with these passive thoughts. Obviously I know life is worth it and things will pass and blah blah...but Iâ€™d love to get past the thoughts
