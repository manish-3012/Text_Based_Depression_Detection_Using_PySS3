I'm a failure over and over againI was planing on going to school but now I know I'm not going to make it. I wanted to study and get a purpose in life but due to something I dont want to get into here it's not gonna happen.


Now I dont know what to do, I've been planing to do this for some time now and everything went to shit just this year. If I could erase this year from my life everything would be so much better, but here I sit in all this shit. Everything seems hopeless and I know there are two ways out of this and that's the easy and the purposeless route.


I was really hopeing to go to school and now all my friends and family think I'm going to go to school and I don't have the stomach or the courage to tell them about my situation. I don't want to be a fucking disappointment anymore.


I'm getting older and I feel that it's soon going to be too late for me to start over. The shame of living at home without any job with this fucking failure. Walking around and knowing that everyone's disappointed in you and that you haven't amounted to anything this far and probably won't in the future either.


I feel like I don't want to know what to do next, I don't want to walk around with my head slumped down.
