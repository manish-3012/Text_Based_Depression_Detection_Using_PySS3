don't know what to do anymoreI'm married, I've been married for a long time. He was pretty bad for a lot of it. During this I met my best friend. He was there through thick and thin. Meanwhile, husband is bad husband but GREAT father. Fall in love with best friend, meet up with best friend, have best time of my entire life (yes, I know, I cheated, I know even though my husband did it isn't ok, I know I am a bad person, I know I made bad choices.) Tell husband PRIOR to this that I don't love him anymore and want a divorce. Don't even know where that will take me because I have no skills and no money or job. Best friend says he is ready to move 300 miles to be with me, but can't for a while (sell house, etc, it takes time, I know). But he says some things that make me second guess everything. Meanwhile husband has been trying, wanting to go to counseling, wanting to fix everything and that has been fantastic. He really is a different person toward me. He says it's like I slapped sense into him and he doesn't want to live without me. But every time he touches me or kisses me I cannot stop thinking about my best friend. But I know deep down I can't do this alone right now, and I don't know how long it's going to take my best friend to do anything - and he said some things to like I said, make me second guess everything. So I tell him I can't do that to my kid. My kid needs normalcy and stability. Friend says okay, but he can't talk to me for a good long while. So now I'm losing someone I love so damn much and my best friend and honestly I've always wanted to die before because life since day 1 has been shitty - now it's just amplified.
