I want to kill myself but I'm terrified of what happens after.I have it all planned out. From how my family will pay for my expenses, to where I'll go to do it. It's still hard to think about. I end up sobbing everytime I do. I worry about my girlfriend, but I have to hope that one day she'll be okay and know this was always about me and had nothing to do with her. I feel bad about leaving my dog behind. My mom has early on-set dementia and I know it'll break her heart. 

But despite all of that, I still want to do it. I want to go so desperately. I hate being here, and not just because of my life and my personal reasons. There's endless suffering everywhere I look. Everyone is so hateful and uncaring and our world is falling apart. Everyone says to just ignore it, but ignorance just hurts those suffering more. I'm tired of being here and being powerless to do anything. I'm tired of being trapped in this cycle. 

I'm just too afraid to do it. I don't really believe in God but I was raised as a Baptist and the idea of hell scares the shit out of me. I've done a lot of bad stuff and I know if it is real, not believing in Jesus will get me a one-way ticket to the firey pits. Or maybe even something else, something worse. I'm sure there's lots of other religions with equally as terrible outcomes. And I'm scared that if I leave this hellscape I'll just end up in another one. At the same time, I figure I'll end up there anyways, now or in fifty years. 

So I'm stuck in this cycle. I'm so close to just giving. I'm tired.
