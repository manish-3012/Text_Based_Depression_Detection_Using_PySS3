I don't know what to do anymoreI feel like I'm worthless right now. I'm trying to adjust to a new job and a new career path and people treat me like I'm retarded. All that's keeping me from finally just saying "Fuck it all!" is a cocktail of vodka, cigarettes and the ocassional blunt. I can't feel anything but sadness and that maybe I shouldn't have pussied out when I tried to buy a handgun 5 months ago. I wish I could make the pain go away but I can't find anything that would help. I just don't know what to do anymore.
