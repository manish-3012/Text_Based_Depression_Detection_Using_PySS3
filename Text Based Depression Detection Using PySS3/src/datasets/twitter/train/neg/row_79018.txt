pros and consI have been thinking a lot about the pros and cons of killing myself lately, and since I don't want to encourage anyone, I'll try to focus on the positive (ie. the cons of suicide).

One of my best friends intentionally overdosed on drugs when I was about 22, and today more that 20 years after, I still wonder if there was anything I could have done to prevent it. One of my major concerns, is not causing more damage by ending my life, and the possibility of someone feeling like I do about my friend (however remotely possible that is), always make me take a step back.
There is of course the "unfortunate" accident approach, but as life have shown me again and again, things doesn't always go the way they are planned.

Unfortunately the list of pros seams endless, so I would love if someone could help me add something positive to this.

I am agnostic and refuse to believe in anything that cannot be proven, I have read the holy scriptures of several religions, and there seams to be a unifying lack of reason behind them all. I don't write this to bash religion in any way (my apology to anyone it might have offended), but to prevent this from being a debate over my "soul".

I don't think my personal story is relevant, it is not that different from other stories I have read, The details might vary, but we all seam to have the same goal, to stop the pain.
