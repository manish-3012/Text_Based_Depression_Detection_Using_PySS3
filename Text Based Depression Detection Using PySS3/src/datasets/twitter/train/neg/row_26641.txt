Life going nowhere so might as well quitI am a 20 year old college student whose family is in financial hell and is several thousand dollars in debt.

I am majoring in history which will not put me in a good position when i graduate. I wont be able to get a job good enough to support myself. Probably looking at the last 50 years of my life at burger king if i don't end up dead.

I have severe depression and anxiety, and i cannot afford a doctor's visit to get medication.  And the last time I did, my physician gave me an arbitrary medication that did nothing to help me. 

I literally see no way out of this.  I'm poor, my family is poor, so I'm going to live my entire life poor and die poor and I literally cannot afford to be alive anymore. On top of that I do not want to burden my family more and cause them further expenses when I could just be dead and out of their lives

The only thing I have going for me are my friends and my boyfriend. But they are nowhere close to understanding my issues and I feel like I cant talk to them about it because they have never had to deal with shit like this. 

For a life as worthless and doomed as mine, is suicide really such a disagreeable option?
