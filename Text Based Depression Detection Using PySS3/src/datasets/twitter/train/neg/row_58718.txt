He broke me into a million shattered piecesI'm feeling suicidal right now and have been on the suicide prevention hotline chat queue longer than I can handle. My boyfriend broke up with me this morning and blamed absolutely everything on me. He said it was because I want this relationship too much. I asked what I had done wrong. He said I did too much. We spoke about this the other day and he said that I do 95% of the work and he does 5%. He felt bad because I end up doing everything, but he doesn't want to do more than 5% of the work to maintain this relationship. He said that he was trying to "fix" this, but he didn't do anything. He keeps telling me that he's trying to make things work, but he hasn't done anything. Over the past two years, he has blamed everything on me and I have believed it. I have one friend and she's not responding to me. I don't have anyone besides him and her. No one wants me. No wants to be my friend. No one wants to interact with me. All I've ever done in life is be a good person, but it doesn't matter if you're good, no one cares. Everything is my fault regardless. I can't deal with it anymore.
