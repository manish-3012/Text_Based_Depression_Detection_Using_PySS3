Itâ€™s just all so pointless and thereâ€™s no solutionIâ€™m 30 years old and I have been mentally fucked up for a decade now. 

I live alone and I never had a serious relationship. I am dying from boredom and loneliness. I constantly feel like Iâ€™m under attack. The air is polluted and the building is too noisy. 

All Iâ€™d like is just an hour a day to take the ear plugs or the headphones off and stop  feeling like Iâ€™m in a war zone. 

But i canâ€™t. My life is eight hours on the computer working from home and then moving three feet to play video games and watch TV. I have to keep it on constantly because it drowns out the outside world and my bad thoughts. 

I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m living at all. Itâ€™s always something or the other. 

I donâ€™t think I can live like this much longer. I am screaming for help but no one is listening.
