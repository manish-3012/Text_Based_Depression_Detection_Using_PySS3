I'm 16 and I can't live like this anymoreI poured out my emotions and my problems before, just to delete the post minutes later. Long story short, I feel alone. I'm the shittiest 16 year old ever. I don't have many friends, and the ones I do have don't talk to me. Nobody invites me anywhere; the last time I went to a friend's house was in 5th grade.

I moved away from my life when I turned 11, moving to Florida from my hometown in Rhode Island. And I've been alone for the past 5 years. Its miserable. I wake up every day to the same thing, and have been for five years. Even summer is lonely. Nobody is there for me. There's nowhere to go here either without a car. At first I could do this, but now I just can't... This can't be my life.

I want to end it all. "I think I'm going to take the last 30 acetaminophen pills I have left and see what happens." That's what I tell myself whenever I'm ready to end it all, but something keeps me from doing it. I guess I don't want to make my mother grieve, I'm one of her only reasons to be happy. At least I think so, that's how mothers feel about their children, and my brother was a major fuckup so now I'm trying to be somewhat normal, but I'm too broken now for it to even convincing.

It's obvious I'm miserable. Depressed. Angry. Hopeless. Everything I can think of, and I'm it. I don't know how I can keep functioning on a day to day basis, and its obvious my mom is probably getting fed up with me being miserable all the damn time. How dare I stop caring. Jesus, I feel stupid for posting this, like I should end it all since people obviously can't help me. At this point, I don't think anything can help me.
