I really wanted to end it tonight.I just want to die. I was googling how much ibprofin would be enough to kill me when I heard a little tap on my door. 

My four year old niece called to me so I opened the door. She gave me a big hug and told me how much she missed me, and that she wanted to hang out with me today.  I love her so much.  

I really just want to die. I can't though because my family would be devastated. My uncle killed himself, and the grief killed my grandfather, grandmother and nearly my mother. We haven't been the same since.  

So I just stop existing. If I am not at work or school, I just sleep.  I don't have time for a nervous break down, I have too much to do.  But nothing gets done because I am useless and have no money to take care of the things I need to take care of.  I really hope this migraine is an aneurism and I die in my sleep.
