UnendingI'm not even bothered to make a throwaway for this. Had another near attempt last night. Everything just goes in loops that I'll never get out of, but the fact that I didn't actually attempt makes me tell myself it's actually not that bad. I got so close. I would have been so determined. Everything fell apart, it always does. This happens too frequently. The health service doesn't care. They toss me away and leave me for dead, they say I'm not ready for therapy. That leaves suicide as the only option left, but they vilify me for that too. I can't win in life, I can't win in death. But at least in death I can't feel the wrath of others when they blame me.
