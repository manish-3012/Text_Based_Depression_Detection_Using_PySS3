I will do it this time.I'm not depressed (I went through diagnostics and I'm not) or anything, but I want to kill myself. I've been planning to do it for about a year, without much success, but I'm completely determined this time.

It's hard to explain why exactly I want to do this. I just never felt like life is worth all the effort. It's just mediocre for the vast majority of it. School sucked, university (at least the two months before I stopped attending) sucked even worse. Now I'm stuck on campus without money, place to live (they'll kick me out of campus at the end of December and my parents don't want me to come back).

So, following my parents' advice I should get a job. But there's a problem with that. Call me lazy as much as you want, but I don't want to do it. I see absolutely no logic behind working. My life is shit as it is, but now I have to make even more efforts to live it. Here comes the idea of suicide.

It's pretty reasonable. If I don't want to pay for subscription, I cancel it. If I don't want to "pay" for my living, I stop living.
