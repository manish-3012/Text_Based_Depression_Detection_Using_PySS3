I'm really angry.I've felt suicidal before, but this time I feel homicidal too. Not scared. Not depressed. Just the level of angry IDGAF where a multiple murder suicide keeps going through my head.

Intellectually I know I've hit a new level of dangerous. I don't really know how to handle it. Don't have anyone to talk to that isn't involved. Can't afford therapy. Can't afford to ignore it.

I don't think I will act on it but the rage fantasy wouldn't stop and I'm still pretty emotional. I came here so I can get it off my soul. I'm sickened. I'm disgusted. I feel like destroying what I resent. Make a blood soaked mess of it then off myself.

I have a lot to live for. I have children. I have a wife I love. They are good to me. I can't tell them how dark this is inside me. It's not them. It's not on them. It's not something they should have to carry...at all.

I'm sick of my immobility. I'm sick of being a door mat. I'm sick of watching my father's gluttony while I sit hungry in the dark. I'm sick of not being seen. I am sick of working like a slave only to be punished by the system I work so hard for. I'm sick of behaving while criminals line their pockets. I'm sick of it.

"You should not despair in humanity for you yourself are human." -Einstein. He was a self absorbed fool. I see how people are. I watch how short sighted they are. I am not so blind or turn a blind eye. Humans are horrible. They would turn me into something horrible. I could be their monster. I could be the thing to blame.

...I won't give them that satisfaction. Watch me starve. Watch me suffer. Watch me slave. Watch me do it all with a clear conscience and an open heart. You may be blind, but not me. I see you. I see you. I don't need justice. I have my soul.
