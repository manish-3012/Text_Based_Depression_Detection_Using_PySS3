My friend mentioned me in her suicide note, I don't know what to say to her nowFirst off, she's alive. She posted a long note on Facebook and while she didn't say my name specifically, she quoted things from our conversations. Conversations other people were aware and or part of. I'm not the only person she quoted conversations from, there were maybe 4 or 5 other people. 

As soon as I read it I called her but got voicemail. I left a message telling her not to give up. But I haven't talked to her since, aside from her telling me she was safe. 

I don't know what to do now though. I obviously have to address this with her but I had no idea what to say or when. This is the largest suicide related subreddit, so I figured this was a good place to go for advice. Thanks in advance.
