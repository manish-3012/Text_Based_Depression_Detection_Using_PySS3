today is my lastiâ€™m at work right now, i donâ€™t want to be. my heart is aching too hard for this to last much longer. the person my mom loves isnâ€™t real, iâ€™m not real. iâ€™m gonna go home tonight and take as many random pills as i can. the notes are already written. i am okay with this one being the end. that is okay.
