I don't see how anything gets betterFor pretty much all of my life, I've struggled with depression.  The longer I have it, the more and more crippling it becomes.  The things that I used to love bring me no joy anymore.  I push away anyone who gets remotely close to me but at the same time I sob and I cry because I feel so alone.  I feel like not a soul cares about me.

I've tried an antidepressant, and it made me feel like a zombie.  I was going to a therapist, but I didn't trust him.  After I was forced into a mental hospital for a day by a doctor, I have no trust in anyone medical anymore.  I just lied to the therapist and made it seem like I was fine.  He just fed me the same crock of bullshit anyways.

I wear a mask around everyone.  Every time I start to open up to someone, I get hurt more.  I live a lie and I hate it, but at the same time I'm afraid of opening up and being hurt more. Everybody leaves me, anyways.  When I was younger, I loved everyone and I always forgave and I always wanted to help others but people only abused and hurt me.  I'm afraid of having that happen again.  That's one reason why I'm so deep in the darkness, because on top of my own self-hatred, I feel like others dislike me as well, or else why would they use me and hurt me like that?

I have a nice scholarship to a great college but I have no idea what I want to do with my life.  I feel like my future is so bleak and hopeless.

I just don't see how there's any hope for me.  I don't even know what it feels like to be happy, I'm just so empty.
