I donâ€™t have an interesting titleThis is really long btw. So if nobody reads it I understand

I donâ€™t even know how to start this off. Iâ€™m just in so much pain. My mind has become my prison. I have so much self hatred. Iâ€™m also self destructive. 

I moved halfway across the country after high school cause I thought itâ€™d make me happy. Start new and leave all the negative behind. Move in with my dad and start working full time. I eventually move out to my own place. I was so unhappy about my job. I would also feel embarrassed to tell people where I worked. 

So my new mission was to find a better job. Family member hooked me up with a really great job. For a 21 year old kid with no degree this job was great. I was prob making too much money for someone my age lol. A lot of dumb spending and lots of drunk nights. 

The job really did help me out. I use to live in this duplex that had nasty carpet. I had no furniture and I had no plates or anything of that nature. Just my bedroom stuff, one entertainment center with a tv in my living room, and some rickety old stained blue recliner. 

Eventually I put down wood floors and furnished my entire place from top to bottom in a matter of months. I even opened up a good credit card and started building my credit. Was the first time in my life I was able to save money and not live paycheck to paycheck. Lol I even had a health savings account that later paid to have my wisdom teeth removed. I really went far and I was proud of myself for once. 

It just wasnâ€™t enough though. I was still in so much pain. A job I loved turned into a job I loathed. I think I was genuinely happy for a couple months max. I ended up working there for two years and some change. 

I left when I decided I should go to school. Iâ€™m in a town with a great school and my family has gone to this school for generations. So I put in a month notice at my job and started taking steps to get myself ready for the college life. 

My first semester was a breath of fresh air. I loved it. I loved going to class and doing something I actually wanted to do. That lasted for a whole semester and a minimester. My next full semester? I almost failed this semester. I was very close to getting out on academic suspension. I stopped going to class halfway through. I donâ€™t even know if I want to do it anymore.

Iâ€™m just running in circles. I think something will be good for me and I go and do it. It helps for s couple of months then Iâ€™m back to square one. The amount of hate I have for myself in just ridiculous. I donâ€™t think I hate anything even remotely close tot he way I hate myself. 

At my school getting your ring is a big deal. Man I cannot fucking wait to get it either. But after I get it then what? Will it really make me happy?What happens when I finish my degree? Will I be happy then? Will I want more? What happens when I get a job I want? Will that be the turning point? Nothing is enough for me. It just keeps going. Itâ€™s a never ending pursuit of nothing. Fucking nothing. 

Iâ€™m visiting my friends in another state right now. 
Reconnected with an old friend. (Not the one Iâ€™m staying with). Things went well and things kind of flames out. Wasnâ€™t good. This year comes around and things actually go through. She was very standoffish though after we were with each other the first night. I thought maybe I did something wrong. She continued to be short with me the next day. Then I went and got hammered for the football game and sent some dumb ass drunk texts and I think Iâ€™ve really fucked it up now. She didnâ€™t even want to talk to me the next day after.

We are suppose to do something tonight for New Years. However, I feel that wonâ€™t go through. I just went a fucked it all up with some stupid drunk texts man. 

I just canâ€™t get a win and if I do get a win it helps me out for a month. 

Iâ€™m a hypocrite, a liar, selfish, and just about everything else. Iâ€™m just out here dying and Iâ€™m getting closer everyday to just saying â€œfuck itâ€. I just donâ€™t know how much more I can take. Iâ€™ve been dealing with since this I was 15. I just didnâ€™t know what I was when I was that young. 

I donâ€™t know how far into 2018 Iâ€™m going to make it. 2018 might be the last year of my existence.
