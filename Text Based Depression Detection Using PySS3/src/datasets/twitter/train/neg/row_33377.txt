Why bother living?Iâ€™m at the point where I see no actual value in my life anymore and have no reason to live, Iâ€™ve wrote my suicide note and have resources to kill myself so I might as well go through with it. I literally have a permanent background noise in my head of suicidal thoughts 24/7 and the only time they properly stop is when Iâ€™m self harming and seriously I see no point in fighting it anymore. The only reason Iâ€™m still living is because of my parents and I know I canâ€™t keep that up for ever so why bother keeping it up at all. While drunk I told some of my friends how I feel and how I self harm which was just unfair on them as they donâ€™t know how to really react to it and so just worried them all for no reason, and now I feel like I have no choice now but to put an end to it all. Anyway not sure why I even wrote this but I kinda just needed to tell someone I guess.
