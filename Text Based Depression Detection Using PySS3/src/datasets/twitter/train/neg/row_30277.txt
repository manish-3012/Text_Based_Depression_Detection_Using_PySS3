I think I'm ready.I've already posted here a month ago, but I feel like I'm coming to peace with the decision.  My life isn't going anywhere, never has, and I just don't want to fight anymore(if I ever did that is).  My original thought was that I would stick around until both of my nieces' graduate and go off to college in about 4 years.  I feel like I'm playing the waiting game, so sooner sounds better than later.

The one person in the whole world who should love me more than anyone else doesn't want to look at me anymore.  She's ashamed that I'm her kid and that she raised me.  She doesn't care if anything happens to me, as long as I keep her out of it.  Threats.  At least, this is the personality she defaults to frequently(Multiple Personality Disorder).  

A lot of people who don't know the full story usually say that she's just mad and in the moment.  The problem is that hearing these words and their inflection for 25 years on almost a weekly basis is too much.  It hurts so bad to hear someone you love so much go from saying you were a miracle baby to wishing they miscarried you like the others.

It seems to be the best thing to do for myself and for the part of her that's tormented by my existence. I've done my research.
