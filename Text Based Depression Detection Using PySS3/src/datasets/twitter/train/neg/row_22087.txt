Anyone too scared to kill themselves?I think about it a lot.

But I'm too scared, I'm too scared of what happens after :( 
Would I know I'm dead? Would I still be the same person?
Would everything just be gone?

ITs too much for me to go through with it, which then makes me feel, not annoyed, but, sad? That I cant go through with it :(
