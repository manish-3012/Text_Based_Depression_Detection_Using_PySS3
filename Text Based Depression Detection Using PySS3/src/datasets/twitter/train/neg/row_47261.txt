Best friend threatened to commit suicide, but I don't know if I can call the cops pleaseh elp1. He wants to get into an Ivy league uni next year and I tried to google what would happen if I could the cops but nothing came up but if I ruined that for him he'd just find some other time to kill himself
2. He's really good at pretending to be okay, so if I do something right now he could just pretend to be fine
3. His parents don't believe in mental health and I'm not allowed to talk to them about this 
4. Idk how the entire suicide watch process works but I don't want to ruin his life right now

At this point IDGAF if he hates me but I really want him to be alive but I don't want to ruin his life

I'm on the waiting call thing for Suicide Watch for advice and I've contacted our school counselors but no responses I really don't want to call the cops on him please help
