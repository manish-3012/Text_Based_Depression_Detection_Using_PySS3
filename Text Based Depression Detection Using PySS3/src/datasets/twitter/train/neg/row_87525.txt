I just want to dieSo tired of being positive. So tired of convincing myself every morning that things will get better. Guns make me sick to my stomach but Iâ€™m really fucking close to just getting one &amp; ending it. Tired of ODing and waking up in a hospital bed. Tired of all the therapy and meds. I donâ€™t know who I am. The one consistency in my life has always been my suicidal thoughts. I feel comfortable in them. I donâ€™t understand why people donâ€™t think itâ€™s my right to kill myself?? Whatever
