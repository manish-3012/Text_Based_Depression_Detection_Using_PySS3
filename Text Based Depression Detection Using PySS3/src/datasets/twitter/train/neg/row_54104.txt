i'm scared it's going to hurtthat's about it. i don't want to put in the effort of buying nitrous oxide. i know that's the least painful way to go. but i can't deal with it anymore. i want it over with now. i have a bottle of ambien, a bottle of over the counter sleeping pills (diphenhydramine) and a bottle of amitriptyline. and some nyquil. i'm going to take it all because i'm afraid of it not working. but i'm so scared that i'll stay conscious, that it will hurt, that i will feel it happening. i just want to go to sleep and have it all go away. i'm drinking whiskey right now to relax myself, and because i think it will help the drugs kill me. but i'm so scared. i wish i could just have someone here to hold me while i go.
