I gotta agree that nothing will ever change my mind about how ridiculous and pathatic both this world and society truly are.Like the title Said i might be kinda like Rick from r&amp;m because of how hÃ© doesn't give a damn but this shit drives me insane lately with the whole Floyd thing on the news 24/7 and the quarantaine it's feels like the zombie apocalypse and 1984 combined at the same time which make me wonder is this real life or is it an Never ending hellhole.
