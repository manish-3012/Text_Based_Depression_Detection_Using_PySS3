How to get support?I told my parents that I recently made an attempt at taking my life and that I am finding it really hard to just exist, they chided me and made me feel extremely guilty, then I went to the only friend I had, told her the same and asked her if she could just be there for me for a few weeks at least and to guide me through this if possible, she just told me that I was needy and clingy and too emotional for a guy, and that if I am so far down the line maybe I should just do it and she ghosted me, where do I go from here, I literally don't have anybody else left in my life that could help me, and I am starting to feel like these support structure that everybody keeps talking about only exists in fiction
