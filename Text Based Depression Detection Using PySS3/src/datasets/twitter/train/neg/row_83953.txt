Nothing in meLiterally nothing. Past 10 years, nothing. No creativity, nothing unique, nothing special, nothing. Not smart, learning disabilities. Laughed at every job I go to. Laughed at school. Laughed by my family. No friends, never been in a relationship. No interests, or care about life. Not attractive.  Nothing. Some pyschosis feelings are back. Lifes a bitch. Why have I not ended it yet, I don't know. Sometimes I feel really damn close. Fuck.
