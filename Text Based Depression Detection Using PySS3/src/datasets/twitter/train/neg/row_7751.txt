Need motivation to go through with itThere is not even a single reason I should exist. I am completely worthless. I am fat, ugly, unintelligent, not funny, lazy, talentless and American. Only my own cowardice keeps me from shooting myself. I need someone to help me. Give me the motivation I need to do what needs to be done.
