Friday at 2If you look at my post history you can see why Iâ€™m going to do it. What matters here is that Iâ€™m going to do it this Friday at 2, after Friday prayer and after I tell my boss that I lied.


Iâ€™m not posting this to try and change my mind, but announcing it makes it that I have to hold myself accountable to achieve it, and Iâ€™m really excited to do it. I havenâ€™t been this happy in 2 years.
