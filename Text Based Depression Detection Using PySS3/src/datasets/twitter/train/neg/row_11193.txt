Unemployed for 6 yearsNever had a job, never been called back. Have years of experience volunteering in various jobs but no one gives a shit about volunteering. I'm still a worthless leech in their eyes.

I'm autistic. I come off as awkward and unlikeable. I've done everything I can to try and stop being so fucking innately loathed. Medded myself up. Started wearing makeup and girly clothes. Practiced with an OT for hours each week to come across as a human. Cut my hands to deter me from stimming in front of people. Bit the inside of my cheeks and my tongue to force myself to put up with lights, traffic and sound.

Makes no difference. No one will take me on. Disability employment services can't find anything. Applied for every job in my area, even things I'm not qualified for. Nothing.

Uni is hell. No assistance for r-words like me. I'm too stupid for the coursework and they know it, why would they waste time helping me?

I'm not going to survive. At this point I don't want to.
