I can't stop the flash backsI've had a few... let's just say traumatic experiences. I recovered pretty fast, especially considering what happened, but lately things have changed.

There are a few people who are often around a place where my friend group hands out, who are really insensitive about the topic of my trauma. They never shut up.

They're the reasons I've had a lot more trauma flashbacks, and I don't know what to do anymore. I feel disgusted with myself, and can't look in the mirror much.

I want to die. I don't want to tell my friends- I feel like my other issues because of that are burden enough to them. I can't keep living like this.
