Treated like shit - Ready to end my life.My life hasn't been easy... I attempted suicide first at age 8 by jumping in front of a car. Again at 15 with insulin overdose. Last time was 26 or so, overdose on opiates and antiemetics and tied a bag around my head. I spent 2 weeks in a coma in the ICU, but I swear I just can't die. I'm 34, a single parent of two sons... I've tried so hard to keep it together but I've been faking it every day, and I know they would be better off the sooner I am gone. I work in healthcare and have been bullied since day one, first for my sexuality, then progressed into more. About 20 people in total have been harassing me. I went to HR and they fired the homophobic nurse, but now the others are even worse. My manager told me a month ago  that I'm getting a promotion and will be working at a different site because of the bullying. However, I haven't heard an update and when I asked timing, I was told "in a few months". I don't believe anything will change, and I can't have another day of this. 

I have been applying to other jobs for a year, but my career is in a very specific field with only 1-2 openings a year in medium sized cities like mine. I bought a house in March and have other bills to pay and have full custody of my sons, so I can't just leave my job. When I am dead, they will be in good hands with my mother. 

I'm so sorry to them, and I promise them they will be better when I'm gone, and they will get over it in time. But I can't keep living in misery day after day just to keep them happy. I'm posting here as a way to give myself permission. I know that suicide has always been the end of my path, I just didn't know when. Now I do, and I'm so relieved. I'm sorry boys.
