I sent my husband away to have fun with his friends, and while he's publishing photos all over Facebook, I'm wondering whether to finally slash my wrists once and for all.What's horrible is that I'm about four heavy scotch-and-sodas into drunkenness right now and that I keep bursting into what sounds like psychotic laughter. My husband and I got into a bad fight this afternoon, and though I've tried to recover, apparently I haven't. We were supposed to go over to a friends' place, but I opted to stay home since the effects of our fight landed me with really badly swollen eyes and I didn't want to subject myself to any questions or my husband to any suspicion.

Anyhow, we got invited over to our friends' place, but I've been feeling increasingly alienated since my husband starting posting photos of all the fun they're having while I'm at home breaking into hysterics. This isn't the first time I've felt this way. The last time I had an episode, it was over the summer and I called the suicide hotline that PostSecret provides, but the guy who answered tried to talk me into going to church, but I have some serious misgivings about god and all that jazz, so that didn't really work. I tried to call my sister, but she's not picking up. I don't want to call my husband since he's already going to have to clean up some sort of mess regarding me one way or the other, and I just want him to finally have some fun without me weighing him down.

TL;DR: I'm pathetic, and I sent my husband away to have some hurrahs with our friends whilst I drown my sorrows in scotch and contemplate ending it all once again because fuck it, I'm done.
