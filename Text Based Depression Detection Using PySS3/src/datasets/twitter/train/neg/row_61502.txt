Seeing dead bodies on the internetI used to be subbed to the subreddit watchpeopledie about 2 years ago and I've seen a lot of gore on the internet in addition to that. I've seen suicides where they shoot themselves and their eyes pop out of their unrecognizable face. I've seen people get ran over by trains, there was this one video of a guy cut in half from a train, still living. I've seen people jump off buildings, their body bounce on the cement like a small trampoline. I've seen more, and this makes me feel like after I die, I'll just be another body. Another body people will see. Meaningless, unrecognizable, and utterly nothing. I am already nothing, but I can't seem to get what I will look like after I shoot myself out of my head. I'm so worried I will fail. I don't want to fail.
