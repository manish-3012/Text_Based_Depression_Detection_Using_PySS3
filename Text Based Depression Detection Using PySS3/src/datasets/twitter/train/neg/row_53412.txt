Cheated on twice in the past 3 months, can't get off opiates.For the past week I've fantasized about killing myself. My girlfriend of 3 years, who I trusted with every ounce of my being, slept with another guy a few months ago. It wasn't an unconscious fling, her friend tried convincing her not to but she was dead set on cheating. I foolishly took her back after many tears and fights and promises that it would never happen again.

Well it happened again. Ridiculously drunk at her friends party and her ex-boyfriend shows up and kisses her, she gives in and they made out but at least it didn't go farther than that. 

I've been addicted to opiates for more than a year now. I've tried cold turkey and only made it through 3 days before succumbing. The only way I made it that far is blocking out every potentially negative thought but I only felt empty inside. Nothing brings me joy. I hate everyday that I'm at work and my straight A's have plummeted since finding out this.

I've fantasized time and time again about hanging myself or jumping off a cliff. About writing notes to my loved ones apologizing, but it brings me a sick joy to think about how she would feel; how she would go through the rest of her life with horrific guilt knowing that her impulses caused this.

I don't wanna hear "Bro you'll find someone else!" I promise you that you don't understand. I won't trust anyone again after this after the things we've experienced. We've had LSD trips where we've literally gazed into each other's souls and cried our eyes out for each other. Things that very few people have ever experienced, things that showed me that there is a spiritual dimension of reality. But I don't really care about my higher purpose or achieving my ideal self. It's not worth the suffering
