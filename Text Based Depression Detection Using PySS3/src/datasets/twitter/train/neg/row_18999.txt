I have mood swings unlike anyone I've ever known, probably mood disorder, if I spend the entire day suicidal basically depends on what random first thought I have in a day.Does anyone get this? If the first thing I think about is something in particular that is usually a suicidal thoughts trigger for me then that day is cemented as a day of suicidal feelings in which I do nothing but try to distract myself.

but then those days you wake up maybe not feeling so bad, a little bit motivated compared to usual, still anxious and terrified and self loathing, but just that getting through this next day might be more worth it. Those days are easily turned round into full on suicidal days too.

I'm empty and just trucking on at this point but why, for what purpose? What is literally the point in trying to survive if that's all you can do. Is it okay for me to accept living isolated, just taking care of my cats and never really leaving my flat because being a hermit is easier. Can I justify this by saying "it's better than dying" and not feel guilt for not doing all the things everyone else has to deal with?
