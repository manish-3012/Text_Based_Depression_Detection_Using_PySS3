I want to die but I also want to take others out with meI had thoughts like these for a very long time. Every time I imagine dying I think about hurting others as well. My sister for example is someone I want to die before I die. Sometimes I think about getting into a car and just driving over people till I just crash and die. Tbh getting help seem much more harmful than not getting help because I know theyâ€™ll tell my parents everything and I wonâ€™t be the same again and I hate that. No matter what I do I feel like it would only worsen. I rather just do the first option but thatâ€™s not an opinion.
