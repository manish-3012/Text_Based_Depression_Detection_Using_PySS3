I Need an excuseEvery night of my life I cry myself to sleep and get physically ill thinking about who I am and what I've become. Every day I show up to school and am immediately lively and cracking jokes left and right. I have great friends, a good family, and every opportunity in the world.

Why do I try to kill myself?

I want a reason. I want someone to tell me there is something wrong with me because I hate myself. I don't just want to be chalked up as an "angsty teenager". I want an excuse for the way that I am and it's disgusting. I am a pathetic, emotionally and intimacy starved man who can't seem to control his own anger for himself. I just want to connect with other people legitimately. I want to speak to someone and tell them the truth, the whole truth, about who I am. I lie everyday to hide the tiny little things I am so ashamed of. I am also incapable of completing the most simple of tasks. Today, I was unable to unlock a door.

*Unlock a door*

I left my own mother in the rain because I couldn't do it. It made me sick to my stomach and I cried for hours after it happened, but I don't know why these things happen to me and why I feel like I should kill myself. 

I want to pity myself instead of hate myself.

That is repulsive.

So here I am, lying down at the foot of stairs. I tried to strangle myself but it didn't work so I'm just... Laying here.
