Part-of-a-life of a lonely 14 year old girl.I hate it.
I hate all of it.
Ever since I was 5,i've hallucinated.
When I was in kindergarten though 3rd grade,I convinced myself everyone liked me. Even though I knew they didn't. I was that girl that was always cheerful and loud. But once I moved,I became anxious and was quickly put as an outcast. I hate it. I told a friend about my hallucination,another overheard. Everyone started to circle around me and make fun of me. My friend tried to help but it didn't work. Everyone I loved and knew lied to and/or betrayed me. I've lost touch of reality and never payed attention to anything. I started to fail my classes because I was too busy of thinking of how I should and when I should die. I keep thinking two opposite things at the same time. I started to hate my own talent. I never thought I was beautiful and I never thought I was smart. I never liked anything. Everything I know is a lie.
If you took the time to read this most-likely-confusing rant,thank you.
