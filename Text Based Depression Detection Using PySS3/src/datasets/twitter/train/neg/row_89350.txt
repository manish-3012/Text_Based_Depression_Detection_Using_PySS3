Help! I canâ€™t do this.I donâ€™t know what to do. I have no one to talk to. I canâ€™t do this anymore. The stress of everything plus my depression and anxiety getting worse. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve tried going to drs and psychiatrists but they just tell me itâ€™s all in my head and itâ€™s fine. I nearly killed myself two nights ago but I didnâ€™t have the means. I do now though and I donâ€™t really know whatâ€™s stopping me.
