Sometimes instead of wishing to be dead I just wish I was never born in the first place.Life is just so difficult and frustrating I donâ€™t know how people enjoy it. I feel like whenever Iâ€™m not distracting myself with bullshit Iâ€™m just thinking about how unhappy I am.

Idk Iâ€™ve been happy when I was a kid, but I just wish I didnâ€™t have to be here anymore. Iâ€™m just not right for this world. I canâ€™t be what I want, I canâ€™t socialize with others. I canâ€™t do what my parents want. I just want to go, and yet I know itâ€™s because of how selfish I am.
