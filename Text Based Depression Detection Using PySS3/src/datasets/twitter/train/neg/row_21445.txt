A waste.I feel like my life has been a complete waste. I donâ€™t want to kill myself Per se. However at the same time I hope and pray everyday that I wonâ€™t wake up on the next. I hate existing. I hate being. All my friends have surpassed me, financially, emotionally, life has continued to progress for them. And for me it has not. And I know that it is my fault, so Iâ€™m not mad at anybody. But I just hope I die very soon. Life is horrible and I donâ€™t want to be apart of it anymore.
