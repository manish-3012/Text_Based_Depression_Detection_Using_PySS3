Every move is a mistake.I had a panic attack this morning and tried to cut my own throat with a shard of glass. Even if i didn't start to feel sick and my arm had seised up from the earlier part of the attack, i don't think i'd have managed it but i wanted to.

I've felt so poisoned and poisonous for so long and nothing ever helps. Friends and family react like i'm speaking in tongues when i even slightly vaguely mention depression.

Every day piles more stress on my life and every attempt i make to improve myself or fix something backfires.
I wasn't supposed to turn out like this.

I'm scared to even try and sleep now, the attacks always come alongside insomnia. I guess i just wanted to write something somewhere in case it happens again. I don't feel in control anymore...maybe i never have been.

I tried. I really did try.
