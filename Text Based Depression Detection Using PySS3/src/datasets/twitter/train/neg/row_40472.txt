I feel uselessI basically have the perfect life as others say. I have good grades, I have a nice family, I have supportive friends, I have a girlfriend. I still don't know why I can't see myself as someone great. I just get so disappointed every now and then. I always try to uplift myself but always fail because I see something totally disappointing. I'm always afraid of being happy or proud of myself because I know I would not do good later on and then i'd be sad again. I am anxious about almost everything. Sometimes I just think that I deserve the worst. My confidence level went down and is still going down as time passes by and I've had several suicidal thoughts but I just can't do so because of the people around me but I really hate myself already like so much and I don't know why I can't change my mind.
