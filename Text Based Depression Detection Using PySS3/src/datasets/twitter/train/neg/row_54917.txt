doing so bad in school :(i'm getting a 74 in chem 48 in functions 80 in religion and 60 in bio. my marks last year were so much better. i want to commit suicide. i hate myself. i'm at school in the library and i'm trying to hard not to cry. i also recently just moved out of my parents house and i'm so lonely all the time. i rarely see my friends at school because they're all taking arts subjects and i'm taking math and science so we don't have the same lunches or classes :( i want to cut myself so badly rn and weep into a pillow but i can't because i'm at school. last year i got a 97 in science, 80 in math , 94 in religion and like 80s and 90s in all my other classes. i want to die. my average went from mid 80s to a 66 because of depression. i'm a worthless scum bag and i want to kill my self
