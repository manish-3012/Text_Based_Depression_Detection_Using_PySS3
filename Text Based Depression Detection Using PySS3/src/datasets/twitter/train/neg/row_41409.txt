Im uselessI'm 15 years old. My parents and sisters always tell me that im useless, they often tell me that i dont have future on anything that i will fail everything and they also tell me everytime that i will not be successful beacause im useless. Iam a normal guy who is living like normal teenager. Ive always wanted to kill myself:( but idont know why i can't do it. there are sometimes that i cant stop crying because of the pain. The words that my parents and sisters tell me everytime  really hurt me so much. They dont understand me, only my Girlfriend does, i dont wanna tell her because iam afraid that she will left me:(or she will also think that i am really useless.i think the reason why they are telling me im useless is because the thing that iam only good at is playing games and watching. I dont often helped them(ik im useless). I dont do housepld chores all the time, i always play games but when they asked me for help ill help them. I hate my self,everytime ithink of that word ive always wanted to kill myself, they are not proud me. They often blame me for everything, they got pissed every time. I hate my life. I dont wanna get attention or anything i just wanna share what i am feeling rn:(sorry for bad english grammar i came from another country..
