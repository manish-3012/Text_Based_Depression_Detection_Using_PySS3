Please tell me why I should notI'm scared as fuck. Scared it might hurt. Scared I might fail. But you never know if you don't try, right? I've still got a few weeks left until I have fulfilled my immediate responsibilities. I'll help my so with a housework that's due in january, I'll return some things to their owners, and I'll clean my everything up.

I don't feel particularly bad as long as I think that it's going to stop soon. It's the only thing that keeps me from going crazy right now. 

I buy the expensive food as if it's my last meal. I waste energy and money by leaving the heater on and showering long and hot. I don't care, I won't be there to pay the bills.

I don't want to live for other people any more. I can't relate to any of them. And I hope somewhere, those people who are responsible for this mess that I have become have a nice laugh over the story how they made a 5yo swallow their dick. I hope it's at least funny for them.
