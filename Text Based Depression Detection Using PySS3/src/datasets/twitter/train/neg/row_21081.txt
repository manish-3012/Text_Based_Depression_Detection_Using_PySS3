Im a 15 yr old studentWhat is the least painful way to suicide? Bcz my dad treats me like a dog. And he treats everyone else great. it's been more than a year and my dad still doesn't count on me. I got the best grades in school to got respect but he didn't even say good job. He always tells compliments to my elder brother even though i am more successful than him. So i don't want to live anymore and the best way to be free is being dead imo.
