Someone I met here on Reddit has been telling me he's going to kill himself since September last year, I feel like I'm being manipulated at this point.So around September last year I contacted someone who was having suicidal thoughts. I tried being their friend and just being someone who was there for them and for awhile I thought I might be able to help. We've talked off and on since then.

They told me about the fact that they have a crippling disease and how their parent got a restraining order on them because of a misunderstanding. I've tried time and again to tell them to get help or to go to a food bank at least so they can eat but they always have an excuse to not do those things. Every time we talk I end up leaving feeling like a POS because I don't know how to help them. Every time I talk to them they tell me they are going to kill themselves today and I feel like this is just emotional manipulation at this point, someone who just wants to wallow in their depression and take me with them. I know I sound selfish but I don't know how to help this person or if I should even keep trying. I've tried to show love to them I've tried to figure out what interests them, what they would do if they could but it always comes back to "I'm killing myself tomorrow" and I don't know what to do.

Should I just stop trying? Should I be persistent and put aside my own feelings? How could I even try to help someone who refuses to get help insisting it doesn't work for them?

Any advice is welcome,
