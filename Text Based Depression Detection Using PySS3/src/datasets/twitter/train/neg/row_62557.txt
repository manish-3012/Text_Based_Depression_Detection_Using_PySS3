sick a tiredI'm sick and tired of this sub. I dont really get the point of going on reddit and saying I'm going to kill myself. then someone offers advice and people say naw I'm going to kill myself. 

i think this sub shouldnt be anonymous and bitch ass niggas who think they are in a bad situation should have to stand behind their words and face the repercussions of there false alarms and wolf calling. 

I know some will say.. hey none of this ..but isnt the point of this caring for people and helping? I see countless posts of people under 18 saying there going to kill themselves and they have tried everything... 

YOU HAVENT TRIED EVERYTHING. CAUSE IF YOU TRIED EVERYTHING WITH EFFORT YOU WOULDNT BE SUICIDAL ON REDDIT... 

..look in the mirror and take control of your soul..
