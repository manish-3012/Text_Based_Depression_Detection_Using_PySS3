Best friend committed suicideMy best friend committed suicide today. I found out in the morning and it feels so unreal. They were my closest friend. I knew that they were struggling and we had both talked about our mental health struggles. The saddest part is I was going to see him today when he came back from the army on Christmas break. We had all planned on visiting him and spending New Yearâ€™s Eve together. I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s really real. I donâ€™t know how to cope. He was so young. Only 19. I tried to help as much as I could but I never knew it would come to this.....
