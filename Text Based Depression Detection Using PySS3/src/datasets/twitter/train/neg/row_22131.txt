Really suicidal atmIm all alone, my doctors dont seem to care if i call, im replaceable to my family, im a failure in school, i have no friends, im a dumb piece of shit and nobody even cares. I'll never make it in life or be stable and its driving me insane. My family dismisses my thoughts and destructive behaviour. I have an eating disorder, people at school hate me, im worthless, i have no hope and im constantly freaking out about the future and i dont have the right mental health guidance. I dont see a reason to not attempt suicide again tbh, i just cant take this anymore
