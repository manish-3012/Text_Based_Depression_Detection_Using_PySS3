Birthday todaySo today I welcomed the 27th year I've been alive.

&amp;#x200B;

All day I have been getting messages from people wishing me the best etc. and like the idiot that i am i continue to be. I have put a happy face on and said thank you to each and everyone of them. if only they knew.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been keeping a log of negative thoughts I have had since 1st Jan 2020 and after today its been filled up, every page with some kind of negative outlook on life and my life going forward. I hate life. if that isn't already apparent. Every single day i have to drag my ass outta bed to do nothing (since being furloughed) apart from play video games that i don't enjoy and only play because there has to be something other than silence to fill my day, i then speak to my girlfriend who is still working(from home) and we have what feels like the same conversation every day, about the weather, our dog and a couple of generic subjects.

&amp;#x200B;

today has really made me think. my thoughts as much as i try always go back to darkness and the eventual outcome becomeing suicide. this isn't anything new, i've been depressed for years but never allowed myself to be treated for it, yes. allowed.

Every few weeks my mum will ask me "How you feeling.. mental i mean" and she always gets the same reply, yeah i'm feeling good.. if only she knew the stuff i think about doing almost daily.

I came to the realisation that I'm waiting for them(mum and dad) to go before I do. My mum has always been good to me and my family so I can't do that to them, kids being buried by parents is something I hate the thought of and would hate to be the one who broke either of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a large amount of savings hidden away from my girlfriend so she won't have to worry about our house and enough for her to go on and enjoy life without me. it's not something i am proud of but then again my life isn't something i am proud of either.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, i don't really want any attention.. I just feel a little better when I get things written down.
