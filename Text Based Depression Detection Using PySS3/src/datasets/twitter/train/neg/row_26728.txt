Iâ€™m gonna kill myselfIâ€™m sick and tired of this shitty world. Thereâ€™s no point to life once you donâ€™t have one. Iâ€™ve struggled with depression since I was 8. I talked to a therapist and it didnâ€™t help and got anti depressants. Didnâ€™t work so now Iâ€™m on a new one that hasnâ€™t done shit. My parents suck and guilt trip me and my sister multiple times a week and I hate it. Now Iâ€™m rude to them 24/7 because of how they treat me. All they do is make excuses and make me feel bad. Theyâ€™re toxic without even knowing it. So Iâ€™m ending it all. Within the next week or so Iâ€™m gonna OD.
