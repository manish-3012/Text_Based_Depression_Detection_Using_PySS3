Rant about being a FtM, pre-op, in a male dominated specialty (trigger: rape mentions, suicide)As a roadside assistance driver/battery technician , I:

* Love what I do.
* Am great at what I do. 
* Get regular praises from both my boss and clients.
* Get good numbers with ratings, good (battery )sales, and high survey scores.

Every day I: 

* Get out of my truck and hear a comment about my "gender" such as "wow, girl power!" " I love when a girl works on cars! "

If I'm with a female member (member = customer or person requesting roadside service), men will drop what they're doing and make it a point to involve themselves. I've seen guys set down their groceries and rush to the situation to "help" me "open a latch" assuming we're both stuck with car trouble (even when I'm wearing my uniform ),after I've just got there, listened to the member and  stuck my hand under the hood for five seconds.

(Usually I stand back and let them struggle to go for it for a little while, then I introduce myself as "X" with "X" company and the situation is handled. )

If I'm with a male member: "Is your car okay sweetie?" (Assuming he's the roadside service technician).

* I've also been "touched " before leaving a location.  Some try to claim they were feeling my "back pocket for tools to help out" (Seriously?) I've been "pulled" into hugs, I've gotten soft touches on the shoulder and the lower back while working on cars, or unlocking a car with a lock out stick. This isn't an every day thing, but I can't go about a period of two weeks without it happening. 

* Get called "sweetie" "babe" "little lady" (what the fuck?), when closing up shop or completing a repair.

* Keep it professional at all costs. If I feel unsafe, I'll pack up my tools and not say another word.

When I come to lifelong  "friends" about it (none of my friends are female )

* Im told to suck it up. First and foremost. 
* I'm told it's all in my head and people do "shit like that" because they "genuinely like me".
* when people go out of their way to make a comment about my gender, my friends respond with the logic "if a person sees a duck, they're gonna call it a duck".


I've come to Reddit /advice blogs about this and have been told:

* to suck it up, first and foremost.
* That I have probably shown more emotion than I think I have because of my gender and "it's too late to be professional now".


The effect it has on me:

* I suck it up and deal with it for the 12 hours I'm working, more than you'll ever know. Thick skin isn't something that lasts all day, you put it on underneath your uniform.
* I retain a "cop mentality" with a sense of urgency and stoicism and professionalism. I'm very no-nonsense, no-bullshit, one word answers only if I have work to do. 

* When I pull into my driveway, I cry in my truck every night for a week now.
* I never sleep. 2 hours, then a wake up. Constant insomnia. 
* I contemplate suicide sometimes. I've written letters out. I've made plans.
* I'm isolating and socially distancing myself from "friends" because they just dont get it.
* have been single for six years
* my negative self talk is getting out of hand. I really hate myself. I feel as if I'm somewhere between a man and a child. These people make me feel like im toting around double pigtails and pinafores. And it works.
*I've "quit" life. 
* I desperately need comfort but won't allow myself to have it.
* Mistake attempts to console me for patriarchal patronising and sexual ulterior motives. 
* I've vowed to never reach out, one-on-one again.
* I avoid co workers like the plague.
* Keep having flashbacks of rape I endured as a teen.

Worst of all: 
* I don't know where genuine kindness stops and sexual ulterior motives end. Every friendly advancement is mistaken for "approaching " and I will be hyper vigiliant. And hostile. Constantly in survival mode.

...And Being FtM somehow makes it all worse.
