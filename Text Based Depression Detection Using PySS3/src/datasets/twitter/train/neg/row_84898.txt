I feel like literally everything's suggesting me to kill myselfI really want to try, to find happiness in my life, to make myself feel better. And I don't really want to die. But everything around me tells me to do so. Due to my health issues I'm scared of going outside, my friends even invited me to many events but I genuinely *can't* take part in them, my health problems won't let me. People think I don't want to meet with them, that I don't want to go out, that I don't even want to talk. I'll be in graduate class this year and I know I'll miss half of the lessons because of my health. As I did the previous year. I'll probably won't pass the year, I won't go to university, my life will be even more ruined that it is right now. I just, I just can't. It's too much. I cry every night because I can't even do shit. If I didn't have health problems, I know I'd try to get better (mentally), I'd meet with people and, I don't know, I'd just live my life because now I'm definitely not doing this
