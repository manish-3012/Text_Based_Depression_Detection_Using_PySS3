BlackmailHey guys, Iâ€™ve been talking to this guy for almost a month now, 2 days ago we almost started dating. He asked me for nudes and i refused to send them. Heâ€™s threatening me that he might hurt himself if i donâ€™t send them. I was so scared and i sent one, without my face showing, after that he was like send one with your face on it, i refused and he keeps telling me some really mean shit like i deserve to die and if he ever meets me heâ€™ll hurt me himself. I canâ€™t send him a naked pic with my face showing because im so sure that heâ€™ll blackmail me. I really donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve never did him something bad. It was all because i refused to send him a naked pic with my face showing. Im really freaking out. Any advice is welcomed.
