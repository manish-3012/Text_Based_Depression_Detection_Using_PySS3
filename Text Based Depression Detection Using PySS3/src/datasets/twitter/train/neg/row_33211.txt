I just need help from fellow members of this communityI truly do understand that there are people here who struggle with so much more adversity and pain than I do, and I can only relate with them to a certain extent, but I truly need advice at this moment. 
My mother has always had a plethora of aspirations for me and goals set for my life that were outcomes of her shortcomings, and in many families parents want their kids to be successful, I get that. But all she does is guilt trip and manipulate me into doing things I donâ€™t want to do (are unhealthy for me) and have no reason to strive towards. For a while our relationship has been unsteady over this fact, but it constantly gets worse by the day. She oftentimes reminds me of what a failure and disappointment I am. In her eyes I will never be even merely close to something she is proud of. All of this has made me suicidal and always coping with cutting. I understand that anyone can become better, but I pull all nighters studying and I graduated junior high marked top of my grades with many awards, but she doesnâ€™t care and finds me absolutely stupid. Just today she told me that it wouldnâ€™t matter to her if I was dead. I get that there are ppl in this r/community who have it much more worse on immense scales, but I need advice to deal with this because I am sick of getting neglected and put down by the person who I used to perceive as the worldâ€™s biggest role model.
