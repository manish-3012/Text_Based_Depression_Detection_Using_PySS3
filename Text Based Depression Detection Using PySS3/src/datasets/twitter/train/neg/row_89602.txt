Is it weird to feel trapped?In my own home? I feel caged, stuck in a house with people that really don't get it. It's not really worth my time to try and explain it to them.

I just feel so out of place in this world. Everybody's fighting each other, or turning their backs on each other. I feel broken, lost, and alone. I feel like I can understand the people here in this subreddit, despite the fact that I've never experienced the same things 100%.

I've made a couple new friends since my last post on here who have really supported me and helped me greatly. But the things I've gone through this year are still weighing down on me. Most days I don't even think about it or worry about it (too much), and some days, like today, I've thought about it. It still hurts me so much, and I feel like this horrible person who doesn't deserve to be alive.

I wish people could understand.
