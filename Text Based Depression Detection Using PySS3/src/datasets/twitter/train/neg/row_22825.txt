A person I follow on Twitter is threatening suicide, said she swallowed a bunch of pills, and deleted her accountI'm not sure what to do right now. I'm kinda freaking out. The account is @ExistentialEnso and the username Thorne. They deleted their account about 20 minutes ago after lashing out at people for two hours and seemingly getting progressively worse. 

I have screenshots from their account (which i'll wait to post in case there's rules regarding that) and she has a personal website that, while not giving her specific address, does say her full real name and the city she lives in (one of the bigger cities in the country, unfortunately). 

Should I try and call emergency services or what? Heck, i'm just as concerned that she'd be shot or something if I did that.
