My car is either getting repossessed, or I'm filing for bankrupcy. I think my choice has been made.If I lose the car...I lose everything. Even the chance to make things right. 

I cant believe I agreed to that loan. I knew I shouldn't have...but I even put it in my name. I'm 23 and I have nothing. My credit is destroyed. I want to work to fix it, but panic attacks keep me from even leaving my house. 

My partner quit another job...ill be honest and say I don't really know why...we could have started to dig ourselves out, but they couldn't handle it. 

I cant work right now because of my mental health...so why should they. 

Come 1/8, were done for. I'm done for. 

I'm done.
