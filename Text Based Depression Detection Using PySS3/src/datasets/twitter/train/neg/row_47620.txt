Please, give me some adviceI do not feel like my life has any chance of improvement. My relation with my family can be described as anything from cold to downright abusive. Even though I have friends that support me, I've never been, despite trying countlessly and failing each time, in a romantic relationship with anybody and recently I've been trying to explore my sexual identity - I am probably bisexual. I do not come from the US but a foreign country and given my current financial and educational surroundings I feel that my only chance for a hopeful future is by studying studying abroad in a college in the US. I've spent months preparing the best application I could but failed and got defered yesterday from my dream school; turned out to be partly not due to my fault as there was an external error in one of the documents. My entire life I feel like I make the wrong choices and do not have the courage to keep making those wrong choices in the future.
