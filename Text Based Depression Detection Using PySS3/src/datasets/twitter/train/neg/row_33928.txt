I don't know what to do anymoreMy girlfriend of 3+ years just broke up with me. I was planning on asking her to marry me on Christmas Day. I've had an extensive history with depression and suicidal issues. I've never wanted to kill myself more than right now. Any advice would help a lot. And please none of the "just don't do it" "go to a therapist" etc. I need serious help.
