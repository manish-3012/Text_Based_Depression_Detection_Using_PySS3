i figured it out...although i know that when you guys are reading a post, you know that it's a triggering topic, but just in case. please do not read if you are triggered by anything weight related.

anyways... i figured it out. i figured out how to barf up my food. not exactly the best experience, but good enough. i've been trying for a while now. i finally did it. honestly, i'm proud. although i know it's bad and i should stop... i still feel proud. i want to lose weight, since i'm disgusting and all. so i decided that barfing and starving is the easiest way to go. although i wouldn't mind leaving the earth either, not like i really care about anything here. welp... have a nice day yall :D
