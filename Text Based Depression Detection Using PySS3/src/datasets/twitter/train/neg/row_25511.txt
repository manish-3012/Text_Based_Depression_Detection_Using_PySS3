I'm just about done with my life.I'm done guys. I really have nothing to live for. I'm a useless piece of shit that has no value to this world. Why should I keep on living if I know for a fact that I won't be successful? I'm too depressed to do anything. My life has been full of tragedies and suffering, and my life is a constant cycle of waking up to go to school, being miserable, and falling asleep. I wish I could just escape from this world. I fuck up everything. I'm a big fuck up. I wish it could be better but everything is my fault. I just want to sleep forever so I can escape from this world. I'm a disappointment to everyone. What also sucks is how nobody in my life has a single clue I'm fucking dying inside.
