My best friend died and now Iâ€™m lost.I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me, i havenâ€™t felt this bad in months but I canâ€™t help thinking everything that could go wrong will go wrong, everythingâ€™s getting messed up for me

I recently lost my best friend (around a month ago) and I canâ€™t stop crying as I look over the photos of us, Iâ€™m 17 and we had been friends for 10 years, I canâ€™t imagine life without her and she was like my sister. I used to sit next to her in many of my lessons at college and now I canâ€™t bare to walk into them because all I see if her empty chair and I start to remember her trying to make me smile on those days where things arenâ€™t working out and me telling her every single thing about whatâ€™s happening, itâ€™s so insane to think that sheâ€™s gone, I know itâ€™s so stupid but she meant so much to me and I canâ€™t imagine anything without her, we had planned to go to university together and live together and do everything together, sheâ€™s helped me through so much and I canâ€™t do anything to help her, sheâ€™s gone and Iâ€™m just stuck here until I myself die.

Itâ€™s so stupid that Iâ€™m feeling this way and Iâ€™m sorry but I canâ€™t stop thinking that I want to be with her, my mother doesnâ€™t care for me and my father isnâ€™t around anymore and so if I did kill myself nobody would care and i would be ok, I would be with my best friend and nobody would miss me and Iâ€™d be happy with her again.

I keep thinking about her and the way her eyes used to light up when she smiled and the way she used to  make fun of me for not pronouncing words right and how she used to come over and stay at my house every single weekend and now Iâ€™m laying here in my bed writing this and looking at a photo of us I have in my room, i canâ€™t bare to take it down because Iâ€™ll feel as if I am disrespecting her and I donâ€™t want to do that, I wish she could tell me everythingâ€™s going to be ok but I would know sheâ€™s lying.

I miss her and I canâ€™t bare to just stay here and wait for death, I wish she could tell me that sheâ€™s here but she canâ€™t and I would give anything to see her again.
