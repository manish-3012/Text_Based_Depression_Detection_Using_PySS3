I can't sleep (but I'm still so tired)My joints are killing me. I'm 21 and i feel like a decrepit old man. My body is in pain. My mind feels totally out my control. Im pushing my friends away. Therapy is not working. Medication only marginally helps. I dont feel like there are any meaningful experiences i can have. I still feel so dependent on my parents. I feel like a burden. I cant remember what I did this week, everyday feels the same--that terrifies me. Ive been in an institution, but that didnt help much. I force myself to excercise, socialize. Its agony, doesnt make me feel better. I dont know what to say in therapy. I dont know why im writing this.
