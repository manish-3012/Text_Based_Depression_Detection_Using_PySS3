Sausage biscuits and sunrisesIdk if this is the proper sub to post this in. Idk if there's even a point to say it. But idk what else to do. I've had issues since I was a teenager, but these last few months have been something else. Without going into too much detail right now, my heart is broken. Yeah, it's about a girl, how cliche haha. But really, it's all about me. I've tried so hard but I'm just fucked in the head. Plus, trying hard isn't always good enough in the real world. There's something wrong with me that I don't know if I'll ever be able to fix. Seen shrinks, been on meds, I know it helps some people but I'm also not one of them. And frankly, I'm just sick of talking to everyone in my life about it, surely that feeling is mutual. But it feels like all I can do is sit here and be miserable. At least it's a beautiful morning lol. I spent the whole last night, since about 1 or 2 in the morning just wandering around my city, basically just to find places to sit and cry. I tried to meditate, ended up watching the sun begin to rise over the river, which was actually the best part about this. Now, I'm sitting at a McDonald's with no idea what to do with myself, just, fuck. I feel more alone than I've ever been. Just when you think things can't be worse, an even more terrible feeling is right around the corner, and they just keep coming and coming and coming and idk how much more I can take. I don't know what to do. I don't know why I'm writing this, just to maybe feel less alone? But whatever. Who really cares anyway.
