Would like to be in the ground.Not feeling life right now. Everything has been incredibly disappointing. Both relationships I thought I had over the past 2 weeks or so have been bullshit and I feel so let down. I struggle with self harm as well and havenâ€™t done it for a decent few days until tonight. I cannot stand my family as it is plagued by my parents narcissism and favouritising towards my younger siblings. I donâ€™t really know if I want to go on. But the most painful thing for me is that my friend hasnâ€™t been talking to me tonight because of a few reasons. 
Quite recently she got a girlfriend and I was really happy for her, she said donâ€™t go looking for her Instagram. I looked for a laugh and found it really quickly, I then said it to my friend and she got really upset. I told her I was sorry and that I was an asshole numerous times. This evening I saw her art accounts story saying that she had lost a lot of motivation for things. Then around a few hours ago I sent her a slightly disturbing meme I found on here and she said no. I am going to block you now. And now I cannot help but think that this is my fault and that I am incredibly annoying and nobody wants to be around me. 
I donâ€™t know if I am able to do this shit anymore. Iâ€™d like to be pushing up daisies by my next birthday. I donâ€™t know how I will do it or when I will do it. But I donâ€™t want to ruin everyoneâ€™s Christmas by me killing myself, if they would even care.
