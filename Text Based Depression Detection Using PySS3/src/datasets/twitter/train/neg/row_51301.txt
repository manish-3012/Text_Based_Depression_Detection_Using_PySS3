I think it will be my last year...I truly just want to leave this world. I feel so alone and unwanted. I have broken a lot of my morals, my values, the things I thought I lived for turned out to be illusions. The real world is not a world I want to be part of. I just want to live in my head, but it is not possible.

I think I am insane, not in a bad way, but in the way that it is not easy for someone like me to survive devoid of extreme suffering. I think that the only thing stopping me is fear. Fear and insecurity appear to be the two things that destroy someone the most irrevocably doesn't it...
