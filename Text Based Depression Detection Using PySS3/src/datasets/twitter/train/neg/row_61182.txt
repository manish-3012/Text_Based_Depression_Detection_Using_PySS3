Rejection hurts.I applied for this job at my school. Very low-paying, but great experience and it was a leadership position that would look good on a resumÃ©. The interview went great in my opinion, and the girl who conducted the interview told me she was sure I'd get the job. Unfortunately the interviewer was not the one hiring, she just passed her notes to the hirer.
Unfortunately for me, I had previous contact with the lady hiring and she was aware of my mental illness, my self-harm and my previous suicide attempts. I got the rejection email for the job today that vaguely stated "I lacked the necessary skills for the job". 
This may sound ridiculous, but I can't shake the feeling that perhaps I wasn't hired because the lady who was in charge of hiring didn't want a crazy person on her staff team. She had also threatened me back in October that if my self-injury continued she would ask me to leave residence.
I may be looking too deep into the reason, but still, rejection hurts. I desperately wanted this position and knowing that part of the reason I didn't get it could be because of the scars on my wrist hurts even more.
Thoughts?
