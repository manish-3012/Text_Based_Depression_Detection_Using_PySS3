why should i want to live?i just want to die. i don't want to do anything or think or feel. i don't have a reason to want to live. i don't have a way to kill myself and i doubt i ever will so thats why im making this post. i was born a mistake and i hate my parents for birthing me. i wish they aborted me when they had the chance. im just a burden really, all i do is make people mad and disappointed with me. i dont understand why people say that i deserve to live when i really dont. im not doing well in school right now from the lack of caring about anything. life is just so annoying i don't want to deal with it anymore. i hate everyone and everything and i just want to die.
