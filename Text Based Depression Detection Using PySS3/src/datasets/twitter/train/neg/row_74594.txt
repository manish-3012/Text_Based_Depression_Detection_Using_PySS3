Pointless rant I donâ€™t know why I botherDoes anybody else ever feel like they werenâ€™t ever meant to be here? I guess I think too much. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be comfortable living. I donâ€™t ever see myself growing old, having a family or any of that shit. I think Iâ€™m just meant to be miserable for the rest of however long my life should be. Even when Iâ€™m â€œhappyâ€ I still feel like itâ€™s not enough. I feel like there should be more. I donâ€™t know how to describe the oceanic void I feel 24/7,  does anybody else feel it? Am I just fucked up? Doomed? Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m a robot, just going through the motions, just scavenging for a tiny drop of any feeling I can find. I used to want to travel and do things; but whatâ€™s the point, in reality? Wherever you go itâ€™s just space. I used to think it was my job that was making me unsatisfied and leaving me feeling completely hollow every day. But even when I got a new job, nothing changed. I feel so numb to everything, I just want to feel what other people are feeling. I donâ€™t understand why I got this fucked up, half ass brain. I feel incomplete. Why is living such a miserable fucking bitch.
