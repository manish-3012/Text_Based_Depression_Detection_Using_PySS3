How do I reach out? Who to?Hey everyone, not posted here before but seeking some clear, honest guidance. I feel like my view of when to ask my friends for help is distorted.

All weekend and yesterday I've been on the edge. I've self harmed. I'm extremely suicidal but I know deep down I'm too scared to do it. I just wish I was dead.

I don't know how to reach out to my friends about this. I need support but I'm anxious of telling anyone due to worrying I'll see attention seeking/ exaggerating. 

I've called my friend who I usually reach out to about low moods a few times but she's been too busy to chat. It's made me feel even more alone and now I feel stuck. 

Basically: what words can I say to ask for some help?
