Is it time yet?I had been depressed for years and manage to take my mind of it for a few months last year doing drugs and getting drunk every night but now I can't stand the look of that stuff and everything I had surpressed has came back. I don't feel anything anymore. I have breaks down every other day but don't have the capacity to feel happiness again. I have one more year of university left and I can't decide it I want to end it now and avoid the debt and suffering for another year or go through the pain even longer, so at least I made my family proud one last time. If God is truly watching then he can see the pain and if he is a god I want to follow he can understand my decision. 
Also I am becoming concerned my friends are being to notice as they have seen some of the marks i have on my body.
