I have no hope?I feel so alone. I have borderline personality disorder which obviously makes my moods terribly out of balance. 
Iâ€™ve tried talking to psychologists and doctors about how Iâ€™m feeling, but because of the BPD they just see that I got out of bed that day, or that Iâ€™m not manically crying, or that any suicidal feelings/attempts are just a result of the disorder and impulsivity, and that if I really wanted to kill myself I would have. 
Donâ€™t get me wrong, I have an incredible partner, who despite enjoying pushing my buttons to a limit of anger, I adore. Heâ€™s so so supportive and is definitely millions of miles above anyone else I have ever been with. 

I guess my reason for writing this today, is because I just found my restraining order. I was raped in my sleep 4 years ago, and it was finally over last year. Or so I thought. I have recently found out he is trying to appeal against his sentence as he and another judge believes the sentence was â€œtoo longâ€. All I ever hear from people around me is that I should be lucky that I got â€œjusticeâ€ from what happened. But, how can anyone justify justice? Itâ€™s different for each person. No amount of years in prison is going to take away the damage, the mental instability or the fact I want to die every single day. 

I guess Iâ€™m just genuinely not happy with my life. Itâ€™s one thing after another and I always promise myself it will get better but it never does. 

Iâ€™m screaming for help, but I donâ€™t think I can be helped anymore. 
Maybe this is how it ends.
