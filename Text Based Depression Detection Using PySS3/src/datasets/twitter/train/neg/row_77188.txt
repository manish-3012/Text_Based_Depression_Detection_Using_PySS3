My story ends here.Hello. My name is deathofmightymouse, and i'm tired. I'm just tired of life. I remember when I was younger, I had such amazing dreams for myself. Now i'm 16 with what my social worker called "Double Depression", Agoraphobia, Athazagoraphobia, anxiety and suicidal thoughts and tendencies. It's just not worth suffering through anymore. My boyfriend doesn't want to deal with me anymore, and I don't blame him. I don't even want to deal with myself. People say suicide is selfish, and that's why I haven't done it yet. I'm the least selfish person I know. But i'm tired of making others happy when I can't make myself happy. I'm not going to stay alive just because people will be sad. Seriously. THEY'RE the selfish one. If someone is so fucking torn up and broken inside, they have a right to end their life. They shouldn't have to suffer because someone else thinks things will get better.

They don't get better, and i'm living proof of that.

I have so many pills I can take, I can slit my wrists. I don't care, I just want this all to end. I dropped out of school, gained weight, stopped fucking caring. All I feel is pain, all the fucking time. It hurts to live. I don't want to do this anymore.

Jordan, if you see this, I love you, and i'm sorry I had a shitty childhood. I'm sorry I wasn't able to get over it as fast as you would have liked. I'm sorry i won't amount to anything because i'm poor. I just wish you could get past those things. I love  you.

You redditors, you've probably seen a few posts on my main account (Not giving away info). You've helped me. But i'm just tired of going back to the starting point. I'm sorry everyone.

I'm so, so sorry.
