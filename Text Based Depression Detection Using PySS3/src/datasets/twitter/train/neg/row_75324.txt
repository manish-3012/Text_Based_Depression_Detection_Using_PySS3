Does anyone feel like they were too analytical for their own good?I think about life, meaning, death, and what I want to do a lot. Moreso the first 3.

I believe life has no meaning and you have to fine one, I don't believe I'll ever find a reason good enough to finish life normally. Even if I want to do something really bad, I'd fall back into meaninglessness afterwards. And knowing makes me not want to even try.

I know I'll probably meet tons of nice and cool people in the future, I also know I have an awful, unlikeable personality and no long term friendship/relationship would last so this makes me not want to try.

New life experiences aren't worth it, to me.

I imagine my families reaction to my eventual suicide and it just doesn't convince me to care about their feelings after I'm gone. I feel like I've been alone all my life... on the inside.

Two years ago, the thought of suicidal people kind of pissed me off and they still kind of do. I don't like posts on here were people just post "I'ma kill myself homie" and that's it. Boring posts. I don't like people who keep saying they're doing it and never do, I wish they'd stop kidding themselves.

And here I am, after thinking about all this shit I've come to a point where I can't unthink it and I'm definitely going to kill myself, before 40. Possibly even 30, I plan on 25-30 maybe. After having sex and attaining a nice body, I don't want anything else here. 

After so much thought suicide just makes so much sense. There's no depression involved, it just makes sense. I can't go back to when I couldn't think this way and was like everyone else. Knowing it's all pointless and tiring has put the nail in the coffin for me.

I did this to myself.
