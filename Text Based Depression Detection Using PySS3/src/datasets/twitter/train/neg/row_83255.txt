WHO DO I TALK TOi want to explain how i feel to somone but dont know who in my life to. I would never tell my mum as she already deals with enough with my brothers autism. My best friends are both logical and will just debunk any cause for sadness and not actually help. My ex girl best friend was the only one ive ever expressed it to but we have drifted and im not going back to her she never really cared. 

Most of my numbness comes from how lonely i am. At school im friends with everyone but never get invited to anything at all adding to my loneliness and pain. The people i would express my pain with this topic with are my closest mates from school who do go out regularly without me. If i were to explain this to them it would feel like a guilt trip to get them to invite me out. 

I struggle with accepting myself and who i am because i dont get enough validation that i am loved and as much as i tell myself it doesnt matter i still think about it and how i just want to end my suffering and life. 

IDK WHO TO TALK TO PLEASE HELP.
