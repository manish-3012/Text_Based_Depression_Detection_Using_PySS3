I have a plan. I am ready.I've been thinking about it for months. I stayed alive for my friends and they've abandoned me. I've thought my new living situation would get better and it's gotten worse. I thought I'd be able to find a full time job and I haven't. I found out that I'll never be able to have children and my disease has no cure. There is nothing for me to look forward to. There is nothing I can do change my situation. I want to say goodbye to the few people in my life who care about me, but they'll just try to talk me out of it. So I'm saying goodbye here, because I just want to say goodbye somehow.
