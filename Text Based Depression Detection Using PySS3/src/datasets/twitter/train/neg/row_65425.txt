Missed 2 weeks of classes because of depression/suicidal thoughts - was just told I'm going to be suspended. What's the point?I had to switch my anxiety medication a few weeks ago and the new one I got put me at the lowest I've ever been. I was having constant panic attacks, I was depressed, and suicidal for the first time in my life. I almost ended it, but I talked to my doctor and scheduled multiple therapy visits, and 2 weeks later I'm doing a lot better. 

In this time I missed 2 of my classes 8 times and the other 2 classes 3 times. I managed to pull myself out of bed for some classes but the first few days I couldn't even get out of bed. My therapist told me to talk to the adviser on campus so I did. She told me today that since I'm now failing 2 classes because of my absences, and I was already on academic probation, that I'm going to be suspended. She said that since I still went to class some days I didn't qualify for medical withdrawal and that if I had broken my leg I could have had an excuse (her actual words). Not exactly something a former suicidal person wants to hear, that I should have hurt myself to get an excuse. 

Now I feel like a total loser, and hopeless. What do I do now? She told me I have to write a letter of "what I will do better next time" and wait for a committee to decide if I can come back, but even then I wont be eligible for financial aid anymore. This is community college and I can't even afford that. 

I feel terrible and like my efforts to get better were useless
