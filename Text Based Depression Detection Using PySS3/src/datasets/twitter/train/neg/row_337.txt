My cat died todayHe was 21 years old. I've known him my whole life. And even though I know that he's had a long and happy life filled with love and affection, I can't stop thinking about him. I've been through so many tough times and he was the only thing that was always with me and never left me alone. Now I don't have anyone. No friends and no family that I can rely on. I just don't know what to do, nothing seems real anymore.
