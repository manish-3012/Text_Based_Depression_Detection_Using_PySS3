I just broke up with my girlfriend of 10 monthsShe was the first real relationship Iâ€™ve ever been in and the first person Iâ€™ve ever really loved. I still love her and I will for a while but she didnâ€™t want to be in a relationship if I couldnâ€™t guarantee it would last and since Iâ€™m going into college soon and having to deal with the stress of that and moving away I couldnâ€™t guarantee it. I hate that I had to do it but Iâ€™m pretty sure it was whatâ€™s best for her in the long run but the idea of going on without her makes me question if itâ€™s  is worth living. Itâ€™s even worse because I know this is the most teen drama bullshit Iâ€™ll probably ever encounter in my life which just makes me want to die even more.
