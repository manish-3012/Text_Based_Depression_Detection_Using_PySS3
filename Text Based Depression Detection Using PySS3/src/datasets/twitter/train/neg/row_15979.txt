So I don't have the guts to do it but I want to be able to commit suicide so here I amI have clinical depression, and in the middle of a burst of it my girlfriend broke up with me (This was a little over a month ago). We were kinda obsessed with each other and I'm still obsessed with her, but she has moved on. Nobody has said anything that makes me not want to kill myself. I just can't enjoy anything anymore, I'm in so much pain no matter what I do. My grades are slipping, I have the most important tests of my high school life coming up, and I'm supposed to be looking at colleges, but I don't care about any of it anymore. I don't want to live without her, and no matter what I do I can't move on.
