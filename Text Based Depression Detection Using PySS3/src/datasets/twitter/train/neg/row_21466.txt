I hate myself.This is the thought train I've been on for awhile now. And I absolutely despise and hate myself for it. Yet I can't stop going down this trail in my head. All I can think about is being dead and killing myself because I'm a vile and worthless human who shouldn't be allowed to walk the earth any longer. 

This is my thought trail: 
All I see is everyone around me getting jobs left and right and me not even being worth an interview. I see myself, working miserable fucking jobs since I was 16 and working my motherfucking ass off for this useless piece of shit of a degree and I see me getting paid $8.25 an hour, while my gf, whose had everything in her fucking life handed to her on a silver platter, not start working til she was 20, not having any degree of any sort, in the work force for a bit over 6 months, getting a fairly decent job that pays nearly $10 an hour. That's what I see. And it makes me want to shoot myself.

This isn't the first time I've ever thought about suicide. It's the first time I've ever really wanted to do it though. I am a selfish awful person who just needs to go.
