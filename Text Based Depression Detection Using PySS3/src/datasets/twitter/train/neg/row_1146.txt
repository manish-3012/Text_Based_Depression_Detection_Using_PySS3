Covid 19 has ruined the only thing I've ever wanted in life.I know this is going to sound so insanely trivial, especially considering what others are going through but this means a lot to me.

Ever since I was in the second grade, I've wanted to work in the theatre, I don't need to be rich or famous, I really don't care about that part, I just want to call the industry I have loved for so long a career, to truly live the phrase "Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life." well I finished HS in June and earlier this year, (January) I had flown out to Toronto with my dad and I auditioned for an exclusive theatre program, one of the best in the country. Long story short I got in, and couldn't be happier....

&amp;#x200B;

but now all this... the entire industry I love so much is gone, the stages are dark, actors and crew out of work, with seemingly no positive news on the horizon. I'm paying a large amount of money (All I've got) to move to Toronto and peruse a dream that may not exist anymore, paying so much to attend online classes,  I'm not good with online classes either, I don't like how little personality comes through when interacting online. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so overwhelmed all the time, it feels so unfair, I've worked my entire life just to live my one dream, just to have it taken away overnight and there's nothing I can do about it.

Thanks for any help you might be able to give. I'll respond to any comments, thank you all!
