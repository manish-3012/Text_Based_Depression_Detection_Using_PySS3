This is one of the most insane things I've ever endured, and I wonder if I'm going to get shut out of my career field and end up killing myself.Background:

I graduated from university in 2014.  My CV:

3.69 GPA, honors in the major, biology.  GRE:  163 quantitative, 167 verbal, 4.0 analytical.  One second-author publication in a good journal.  A year's worth of research.  Several other volunteer positions related to biology.  A year-long post-baccalaureate course in which I learned molecular biology techniques they don't usually teach in undergrad.

I have failed to get into graduate school two years in a row, and have failed to get any lab tech jobs.

I've been talking to an admissions consultant.  I have done mock interviews.  Literally the only problem she appears to have with my interviewing skills (because she thinks I look great on paper and that my personality is fine!) is that the level of enthusiasm I express is not commensurate with the level of enthusiasm I feel, and this is in large part because I am a dyed-in-the-wool introvert, I am suffering from depression (yes, I am in therapy and taking an antidepressant) and think that if I start sounding enthusiastic about something it'll quickly turn into sounding maniacal.  I am also a shitty salesperson.  It's awkward to toot my own horn more than a certain amount.

Literally everybody I know is stumped as to why I haven't gotten in.

At this point, I honestly wonder if I'm being pushed out of biology in some way or another, and if that's the case, I might as well bow out of the world, because I refuse to do anything else.

EDIT:  Oh, and here's another funny thing:  all the labs I'd really like to work with the most that do stuff that really excites me are in universities I CAN'T FUCKING GET INTO BECAUSE I'M NOT FROM A UNIVERSITY LIKE THOSE ERGO I'M NOT GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEIR GRADUATE PROGRAM.
