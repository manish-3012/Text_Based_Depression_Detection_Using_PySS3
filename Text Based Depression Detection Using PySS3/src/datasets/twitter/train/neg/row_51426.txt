I made a noose.Title. I don't think I'm ready to do it yet. The butterflies and nervousness betray me. I don't even know if I'll ever be able to do it. I don't even want to. The only time I'm content is when I'm sleeping. I don't dream much but that blank passage of time that you feel when you wake up has me yearning for more. I want my existence to be 100% that. I don't want to leave my girlfriend, who is depressed, with questions. I don't want to leave my rats with no dad. I don't want to leave my uncle without a nephew. It's getting harder to rationally think though. I'm becoming more selfish, why should I continue living if I'm not getting anything out of it? I hate my job, I live with my parents who only love money and have put me in debt. I have one friend who I feel would mourn my passing. I don't really have anyone else I'm close to outside her, my girlfriend and my uncle. My mum would be sad but she'd get over it. She's lost a child before. I made a noose earlier and just sat with it strangling me for a bit. It felt much more like being put in a choke hold than I thought it would. I've been to therapy, I'm on anti anxiety and depression medication, I haven't been to work in over a month. 

I'm sorry about the rambling nature of this post but I needed to get it out there to someone. Time zones are weird so it's more than likely that no one will read this. There's just something cathartic about hitting the post/send button. Much better than writing in a notepad file or a diary. 

For now I'll listen to some music. Some Ween and Bloodhound Gang should help.
