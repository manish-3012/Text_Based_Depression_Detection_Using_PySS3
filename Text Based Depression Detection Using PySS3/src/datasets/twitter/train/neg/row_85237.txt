Rationalizing what I'm about to doAny advice?
I'm finally seeing someone about my suicidal tendencies, thing is what should I expect? I have trouble articulating and explain my feelings about the issue
I've been preparing my notes and everything for a year now however Its easier said than done. I know if medication doesn't work what I will do and I sincerely don't want my family to suffer on my behalf. As such since I medicate with marijuana I plan on quitting before I go. ( which pisses me off because I've tried overdosing and it failed, heroine. But it was completely pain free )I just feel this would be unfitting and create many doubts about me with my parents... I don't want my parents to think I was an addict 


I've been depressed all my life (as long as I can remember and I do not have a good memory) and as of the past 2 years I've been getting much worse. I just feel like I was wired wrong. I can't remember a day I haven't cried myself to sleep. I cannot make close connections because I hate life and I don't trust people. Getting medication is really my last hope but really what could change and how do I make the doctors job easier
 
My moms brother committed suicide and her mother was never the same, neither was my mom. My dad is also bipolar depressed etc etc I just want to be understood in death even if I can't understand myself. I only know I want to die by any means necessary. Maybe joining the army would be a great way to rationally see how badly I want to die
Sorry for making no sense at all, my thoughts are so convoluted I know I'm sick in the head and it's for no reason I live a pretty great life
