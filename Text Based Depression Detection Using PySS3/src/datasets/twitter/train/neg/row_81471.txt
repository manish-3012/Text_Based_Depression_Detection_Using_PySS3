It's over for cripples. I can never be a real man. I refuse to continue this shitty existence in this ugly and useless body.I'm done. I am already suffering every day since two years. I always endured the pain, always had hope it would get better, but it won't. My genetics fucked up completely. I need to live for the rest of my life with a crooked spine. Because of a growth disorder my spine grew curved (kyphosis / scoliosis), my back looks like one from an 80-year old. The fact that there's no way of changing it destroys me. My 20s just started and my life is over. The option surgery will make things in longterm only worse. I did everything right in my life, I was always working hard for my success, I did nothing wrong. Now I'm getting fucked up by my trash genetics. My ugly back will make it impossible for me to ever get a girlfriend, my pain will make it impossible to ever achieve anything at work or in life at all. Everything I've achieved so far in life is worthless now. I can't enjoy life like this, I refuse to continue this shitty existence. I'm not even a real man, I'm just a fucking joke, an ugly cripple who's waiting for his end. Don't fucking tell me it'll get better. It CAN'T get better, that's a medically proven fact, I need to spend the rest of my life in this ugly and useless body. What's the point of fighting a battle I can never win? Getting help is also pointless, nobody can give me a new body. I'm not mentally ill, I'm physically ill, ending it is the only logical option. I wish I was aborted or killed at birth so I wouldn't need to give me the final bloody headshot.
