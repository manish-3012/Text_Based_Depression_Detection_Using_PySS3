What's alright?I have just been thinking about this.
Why is it when someone gets's raped, everyone is like "oh it's alright if you feel uncomfortable, or don't want to have sex or sexual contact."
but when someone like me. Which has been social dumped more times than you can count, and have been betrayed, by all the people who meant something. People I have opened up to stabbing, me in the back which their knowledge about me. 
Says he has a hard time trusting people, and open up to people. 
They all just say I'm over dramatic, or that I just need to get moving on.
Can't people see it's the same situation in some way? It's not as simple as just saying, "Now I trust you" it's as hard as a rape victim just going out, and having sex.
