Just thinkingJust one of those days when I woke up and feel like shit
I think of the women across the world who can get a guy in the USA and had long distance relationship for three years.
And the guy still love her.
Like wtf


My Ex have made my life so bitter and full of anger I thought I can easily walk away from that shit that I have to go through with that cheating abusive guy.


And Iâ€™ve always feel so so ugly 

At this shit rate with everyone else getting married at 20 kids at 22, Iâ€™ve lost that window and here I am.
What kind of person Iâ€™ll become
Iâ€™m such a failure 

I think suicide is only an option and itâ€™s comforting
