Betrayed by the two people I trusted most. [Video Rant]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeZQVCZBFGs

Best friend and GF have been lying to me for months. I don't want to feel anymore... I can't take this pain. Breakup wont do any good, I am far too attached to do it, and she will hang on by a thread. i dont want to be anymore, ive no one to share anything with, and cant talk to anyone. Im not sure i can trust myself, let alone other people anymore. I dont want to deal with anything.
