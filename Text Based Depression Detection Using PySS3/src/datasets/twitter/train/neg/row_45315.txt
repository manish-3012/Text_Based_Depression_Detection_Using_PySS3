I don't have anythingSo... hello! I know the title seems overdramatic. I do have some things. But I don't have enough to keep me living. But st the same time I don't have the courage to die. I live far away from all of my family. I live with a friend who doesn't really care about me unless it suits him. I have a cat. I was born with quite a few birth defects that make it hard for me to live daily life. Because of that, I often have to call out of work for days at s time. This gets me in trouble with my job, and I can't get a doctors note because I have no insurance. I'm also trans and all I want is to transition but I can't afford that. I'm bedridden right now with my best friend blaming me for things I can't control and my parents begging me to come back home, but there was a reason I left. I just really want to kill myself and I don't care how much it hurts or what I go through, I just dont wanna put anyone through the trauma of someone they know committing suicide. I can barely see or think straight and I'm really considering just taking a whole bottle of these sleeping aids and letting that do what it will to me
