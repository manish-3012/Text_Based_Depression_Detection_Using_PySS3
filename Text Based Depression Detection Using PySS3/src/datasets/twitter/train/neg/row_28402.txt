I think I'm doneI haven't had the easiest of lives. I was born with a few medical conditions which have always prevented me from being normal, most notably I have what's called Freeman Sheldon syndrome. Basically my face looks weird and my legs don't work properly. I had tons of surgery to fix this and it feels like nothing has changed. About 4 years ago I ran away from home because my mum and stepdad were beating me up while my siblings ignored it. Ever since I can't help but get the feeling that I don't belong anywhere. I currently live with my grandparents whom I love dearly but they can be restrictive. I feel like I don't belong anywhere, everyone in my life be it friends or family I eventually manage to push away. I've lost faith in the world and in myself. I have nobody else to talk to about this as not even my former therapist truly understood how I feel. I just want to know if there's anyone on here who feels similar or can give any advice? I'm struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts at the the moment so someone to talk to would be appreciated beyond words.
