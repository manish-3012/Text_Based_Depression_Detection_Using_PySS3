i am so profoundly miserable.i remember wondering in earnest how people could ever commit suicide. how could things get so bad that they decide it is worth it to end their one life. but our lives are traps we spin into and canâ€™t often untangle from. history matters. what happened matters. what will never be matters.

i spend all my time alone. i have a loneliness in me since my early teens that cannot be touched. there is always someone more important than me. always someone more attractive than me. iâ€™ve felt insignificant and worthless for some time. iâ€™m a failure of a person. a fuckup. a man with a pervasive lack. a creature who cowers behind pride. a grown-up boy, not a man. a thwarted joke. 

on my morning walk i dream of not being me. with desperation like a rat in a cage i spend all day looking for ways out of my life but i am truly stuck. i just hope that when i die i will silently appreciate all the joy we had before she left. and i wish for it not to hurt. iâ€™ve had enough pain.
