ByeI think it is time for me to go. My family won't talk to me. Anyone I grew up with doesn't like me. Heck, I think my husband doesn't even care. Everyone in my workplace thinks I'm an idiot right off the bat. Feeling so lonely. I'm a waste of space. What is the point if I leave this earth now or in 50 years?
