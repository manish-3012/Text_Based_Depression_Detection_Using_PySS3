I donâ€™t know if anything can make me happy anymoreIâ€™m in my last year of high school and nothing is motivating me to keep going except college. I know my life will turn around with college but right now itâ€™s very hard to keep living. I have amazing friends and a great dad and great things in my life but I hate myself. I hate how I look, I hate how Iâ€™m hung up over a boy, I hate how I cope by hooking up with people, I hate that I want to kill myself, I hate that I think about suicide at least 3 times a day, and I hate how different i am than I was before March. I need to get my shit together and I donâ€™t know how. I want to work out again, I want to find out whatâ€™s wrong with me mentally, I want to feel motivated again, I just donâ€™t know how and where to start.
