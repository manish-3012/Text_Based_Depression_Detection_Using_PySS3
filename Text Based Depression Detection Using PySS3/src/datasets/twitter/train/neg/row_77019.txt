god why wasn't i just born a manwent to a big birthday party for my gramps this weekend and all my family and their friends were there. I realized how little they knew about me, really. 

im trans and this was the first time meeting them after being fully out. i was misgendered so much and i just cant take that. i just want to be my mom and dad's son but they'll never truly see me that way. i know they love me which makes it even more difficult.

i didn't develop social skills (i isolated myself a lot as a kid) and im dealing with my own deeply rooted anxious complexes (which has seriously hurt people in the past) im going to therapy but it feels so goddamn pointless

im gay but all the people who have been interested in me are people who are "usually into women" so i cant find love until i actually look like a guy. or else i need to have the same painful conversation over and over again where i explain why i have a problem with their attraction to me.

so this all boils to blah blah boo hoo i can never be a guy and my life is awful. and i just have to end it. i have to make it stop because all of this is in my head and my body so there are no external factors i can blame it on so im just fucking suffering all by myself. im thinking after this christmas then its over.
