Am I fooling myself?I've spent 44 years being alone.

Granted that's not entirely true, I've had my dalliances, but the majority of my life has been alone. I'm currently riding a 6 year solo stint where I haven't even exchanged meaningful words with a female.

Haha, sorry for side track into my patheticness, my question is due to my plans for future. 

My entire life has been filled with being alone, and no one understanding me. I finally gave up on southern Californian OC living and decided Oregon style was much more suited towards my own.

But really... Who am I kidding? 

I've already sold my condo and have the money to buy a home in OR, but will anything really change? Shouldn't I just buy a gun and save myself more years of pain? Changing location isn't going to change my life, right?
