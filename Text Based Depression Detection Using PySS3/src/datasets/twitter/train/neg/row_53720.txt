I feel like everything is going opposite to how it is supposed to...Sory if this doesnt exactly follow the guidlines but I have no one to talk to and I just feel like I need help... let me preface this by saying im doing my final year of highschool. I quite smoking weed. I quite drinking alcohol. I've been trying to get more sleep... and I feel like my whole life has just fucked itself. My marks at school have gone on a kamikaze dive. I failed my first SAC last week and have since failed 1 more and got 50% on another and basically guaranteed to fail me Chem SAC tomorrow and it feels like the more study I do the worse my marks are which makes it so much harder to find any reason to do any study to try improve my marks. for the first two terms I did pretty well, just below average (still a lot worse then last years marks) but I am at a private school and all my class mates are doing so much better then me. this is my final full term of school and I go to bed every night fighting back tears knowing that I have wasted my parents money. I have wasted my time. I try to study but I just cant... It feels like every time I breathe im taking in lungfulls of thick smoke that suffocates everything I do. I cant talk to my parents about it... my mum is over emotional and would either berate me for claiming to feel this way. My father is the least emotional person I know and would just scoff and walk off. Currently the only thing keeping me from taking my parents car, blocking the air exits, putting a funnel from the exhaust into the window and literally suffocating myself is the thought of my siblings being sad and my parents being sad. But I think they would get over it eventually?
