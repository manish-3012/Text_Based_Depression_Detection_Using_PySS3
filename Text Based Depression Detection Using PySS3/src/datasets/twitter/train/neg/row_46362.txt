I am angry.So for the first time I feel this incredible anger. I am angry that I feel that way. I look at people around me who live life so calm and relaxed, nothing stresses them out. I want that life. Why am I like this ? I don't deserve feeling like that. I just want to be happy. What makes me most angry is the feeling that death would be so easy and would end all the bad feelings. I don't want to die. But why is my brain always thinking about it. It wears me down. It keeps me from reaching my goals. Sorry for the rant but I am so angry with myself right now.
