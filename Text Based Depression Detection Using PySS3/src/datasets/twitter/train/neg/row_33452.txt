Cuddling with SO last night and I kept thinking I want to dieThatâ€™s fucked up right? A beautiful, tender moment and Iâ€™m thinking of death 

When he left my flat I felt anxiety and I was actually scared that I might attempt to kill my self 

ThÃ© urges are getting stronger and as days pass Iâ€™m learning more info on botched suicide attempts. Iâ€™m scared that soon I might figure out how to do it successfully and I might be brave enough to do it
