What is the pointI reached my goals. I got my degree and started in my dream career. I had a wonderful boyfriend. I had my dream body. He turned out to not care about me in the end and is fine moving on. I gained my most of my weight back. Ive consistenly been abandoned by family and friends. The idea of ever finding love in this world seems pointless and impossible. How can you be so alone despite trying to hard to help other people find happiness? How can you find hapiness when images of being assaulted or abused are flashing on your mind? Why did I work so hard to be able to support myself and now im sitting in this sad apartment all to myself with no one around. Its exhausting to even think why I should wake up tomorrow. I want to leave so badly and never feel this pain again.
