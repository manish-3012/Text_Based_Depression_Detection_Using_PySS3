I ducking hate everythingEven on Christmas I can't be happy. My parents are stupid and I can't take it. I grow attached to something and they always take it away from me. ALWAYS. They want me to be unhappy. I can't take this I am done. I hope someone laces my moms weed with something and she gets so sick. I can't fucking take this anymore I can't be happy once I am they feel the need to stop it. Well fuck you. Fuck you. And fuck you. I'm done.
