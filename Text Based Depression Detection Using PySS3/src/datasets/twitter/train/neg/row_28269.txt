Suffering from IBS, can't take it anymoreMy life is over. I can't function normally. All I feel is fucking pain and burning and it just came out of nowhere. I need help but there's no cure, all I can do is """control""" it but not even that works. I'm so close to just ending it all, but I'm such a fucking coward that I can't do it. I'm so scared. I don't want to hurt my mom by doing this, but I can't keep living like this. Jesus christ someone fucking help me
