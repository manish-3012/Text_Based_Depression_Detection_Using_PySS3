I don't know what to do. I've been unemployed for over a year, sold off nearly everything I own to make ends meet and currently live with my parents. What's the point in going on?Went to school for web development and after endless doors slammed in my face and constant rejection I just can't deal with it anymore. I can't even get a job at fucking Mcdonalds because they think I'll just quit when something better comes along. Fuck this shit.
