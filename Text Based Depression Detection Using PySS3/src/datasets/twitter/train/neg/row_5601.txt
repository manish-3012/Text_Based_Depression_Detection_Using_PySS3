I have BPD and itâ€™s ruining my lifeMy dream girl left me, I lost my job, and I had to take an incomplete for a class, my friends donâ€™t reach out, people probably think Iâ€™m crazy, and Iâ€™m on academic probation. Iâ€™m probably going to have bpd for the rest of my life, and I donâ€™t want to see bpd ruin other aspects of my life.
