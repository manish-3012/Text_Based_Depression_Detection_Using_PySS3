I need helpI have friends I guess but no one who is super close like a best friend or someone who can help/talk to me. I think people expect it, they definitely did a couple of years ago when I was outwardly going through an intense breakdown (I didn't recover from it but they don't know that). I'm saving money right now so my housemates aren't short on rent and so my family can afford a funeral. They think it's for my top surgery (I'm FtM). 
Nothing is happening now but I'm planning.
Got a lot wrong with me both mentally and physically. I think maybe I have Aspergers or Autism but I dunno if a diagnosis will do any good. My body is cooperating less and less (as in lacking coordination, tremors, tics, etc) and it's gotten in the way of my aspirations and hobbies. 
Things got better for a bit but as always it's worse again, it always is. My life consists of mainly depressive/anxious states and very small respites. I don't think it's worth sticking around for the respites, as good as they are.
I think I'm trying to find someone or something to talk my way out of this plan, I don't want to go, but this is so hard. I wish I could live. I wish I was able to socialise and connect with the world like everyone else does. I'm in the process of getting help but I've done this so many times, it's tiring. Honestly, part of me is trying to get back on my meds so I have the means to overdose.
