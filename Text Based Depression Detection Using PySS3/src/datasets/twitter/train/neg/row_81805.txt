At the tipping point.My head is a mess. This'll make little to no sense, structure wise. I just.. can't see myself going on like this anymore. It's been going on for far too long. I'm 22 in under a month and I've been self harming since the age of 9, suicidal thoughts from age 13, 9 attempts on my life thus far and I can't even do that right. I'm so fucking lonely, ugly, depressed, in debt.. the list goes on. The past few months I've been out, drinking, taking drugs. Not giving a shit about my life and honeslty hoping it takes the edge off or pushes me over the edge into being able to kill myself properly. I've seen therapists and psychiatrists since the age of 16. I've been medicated since that age, going through countless different ones. Nothing helps. I don't have the motivation for life anymore. It's not for me. My parents dont give a fuck about me, I meet people, make friends and I end up fucking things up both accidentally and on purpose. It's a vicious cycle of destruction to others and myself. I'm better off alone. And, I'm better off dead. This world isn't for me.
