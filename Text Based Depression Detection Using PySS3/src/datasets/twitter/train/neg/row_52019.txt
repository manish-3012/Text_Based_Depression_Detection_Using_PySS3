I Texted the Crisis Line Too MuchI think Iâ€™m limited to it now or something like that. I hate life so damn much. I havenâ€™t and wonâ€™t amount to anything. Everything Iâ€™ve tried has been a failure. This has been going on for too long now. Iâ€™m motivated now. I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself sometime tonight in the woods. I canâ€™t even describe how I feel right now, it just feels like a mix of sadness and nothing.
