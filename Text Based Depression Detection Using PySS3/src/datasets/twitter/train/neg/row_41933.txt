mixed bipolar.sounds like the official diagnosis for me. my mind's all kinds of fucked up. mania and depression at the same time? i feel sorry for the people who have to look at me.

shame. guilt. disgust. self-loathing. apathy towards death. they're festering rampantly.

i'm trying real hard to hang in there, guys.
