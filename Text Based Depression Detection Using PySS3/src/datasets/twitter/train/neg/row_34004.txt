I hate everyoneSick of all these horrible people hurting me for no reason I just want one person I can trust. My parents don't give a fuck about me, my friends are all gone, and my ex girlfriend cheated on me. Fucking cheating whore espero que te pudras en el infierno, pinche perra loca. I can't open up to anyone, friends are impossible to make. Therapy doesn't work, I'm about done with this shitty life. This ain't living, my head hurts so much
