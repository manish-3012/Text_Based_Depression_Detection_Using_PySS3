Hi there!Throwaway account...
I never thought I would be the one posting on here. I am contemplating on the idea of ending it all, but I figure this is just a 'low' time in my life. I can finally be open and honest because I am the biggest fuck up in the world. It all started when I was 14. I was going through puberty and for some odd reason, one that I cannot forgive myself for, I raped (well technically. I had touched her down there. Still) my sister. MY SISTER. and it has almost broken up my family, put my mom and dad through hell, not to mention my sister. I was sent away to a military academy where I will remain until I got go to college. My dad allows me to visit 4 times a year, for 1 week periods. I fucking suck. I asked him if I could come back, because I know in my fucking heart and soul that I would never ever even think about doing that ever again, but he said he just can't risk it. I don't blame him either. Here at this military academy (I've been here for two years) life sucks. The food, the people, I'm constantly harassed by my superiors, I've lost contact with all my friends back home. Back when I was still at home, me and my mom would fight. And after my dad found out about what I did he beat the shit out of me. Literally. That still affects me today. My mom only called me names. Disgrace, fuck up... etc. Those have also stayed with me. And it's all true. They were at the brink of kicking me out of the family. Just leaving me to fend on my own. I'm not becoming the person they want me to be and since I cannot redeem myself I figure I might as well end it all. Not to get back at them, just to be done. I just feel like why should I go on, y'know? I can honestly say I have nothing to live for. I'm tearing up already, so I'll post this and edit some if you guys ask for details. Can anyone out there relate? Or I'm I just too fucked up?
