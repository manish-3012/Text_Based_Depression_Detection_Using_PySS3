I was raped by my father.I don't know what to say. I never met him before then. It was this summer. We talked for the first time in April. We got along well. I was happy to finally know him. I stayed with him at his motel and it happened and I didn't say a word the whole time.

My mother found out recently. She made me report it. I've had to relive it a million times. I'm so... exhausted. I don't want to do it. I don't care if he walks free or hurts anyone else, I had gone a long time without thinking about it and now its in my face and my mom knows and i know what she thinks of me. When she found out she threw it in my face like i wanted it.

all i can think about is how easy it would be to take pills. to just go to sleep. to just make it all go away.
