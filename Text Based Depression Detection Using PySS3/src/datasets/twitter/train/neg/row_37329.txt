Mom attempted suicide-can you help me talk to her?I've looked through a lot of the resources here on r/SW but I am hoping some of you can give me experiential advice. My mom attempted suicide two days ago and is on 72 hour watch. (I am 21 and I have siblings as young as 10.) I haven't seen her yet and I'm not sure if I want to. Of course I am angry and sad and a lot of other emotions but I don't know how to see her. I would have no idea what to say-I'm sure "Why the fuck would you do this?!" isn't appropriate but I feel too angry to tell her I am glad she is safe and can't wait for her to come home because I don't want her to come home for a long time until she is healthier. Maybe I shouldn't see her for a while? Can reddit help?
