Iâ€™m sick of feeling so dumbI have just lost all motivation for anything, Iâ€™m at work just trying not to cry. Iâ€™m just going to be alone tonight like I always am which doesnâ€™t help. I just donâ€™t feel anything and Iâ€™m so tired of it
My life used to be so beautiful for an amount of time. I just give up, one of the two things that have been on my mind for months is just craving to die. But Iâ€™m really scared to die, I just know I wonâ€™t make it till 2019
