There's nowhere to goIt's been 10 years of depression and contemplaiting suicide, and I'm in the army now. No one gives a shit about me.

All of my emotions are forced, I smile, laugh and sadden on que.
I don't look good, and I can't form a good conversation, so to everyone I'm the guy you say good morning to and talk over a ciggarette with.

I'm forced to be with them all day for weeks, and It's eating me from inside.
I'm a lonely cunt who can't be alone and if anyone knew what I feel I'd be branded as the suicidal weirdo like so many times before.

I can't get pills, and my only solution is to chain smoke and asphyxiate myself to half consciousness, when the deprresive thoughts close in.

I can't do this anymore. Every minute that passes I feel closer to hanging myself.
I want to live, I want to be happy again one day, find friends, learn in college and form a family.
I don't want to die.

Please help me.
