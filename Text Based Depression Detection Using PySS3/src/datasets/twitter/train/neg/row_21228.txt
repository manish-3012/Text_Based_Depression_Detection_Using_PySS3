Seems Like the Only Rational ChoiceI have been depressed for a lot of my life but I was always able to turn depression and grief and angst into art and valuable things.
In the past year I've become chronically ill (LYme and chronic fatigue syndrome) and I haven't been able to really do *anything at all*.  

I am a burden on everyone, I don't think I can finish school even tho I am one semester away from finishing, and I can't work because of the fatigue, but I can't get disability because that shit is fucked up and doesn't help as much as it should.

I literally am a parasite and everyone would be better off without me.  I see no way out of this because I don't have the money to travel to get better medical treatment or more experimental lyme treatments that may help and I can't work to make money and so i can't get anywhere and I don't have the energy to do the art and the music that I want to.  I'm getting old (22) and I hate to not make anything of myself.  and i'm so stressed about all of this

I told myself 6 months ago that i'd kill myself if i wasn't better in six months.  I think this is it
