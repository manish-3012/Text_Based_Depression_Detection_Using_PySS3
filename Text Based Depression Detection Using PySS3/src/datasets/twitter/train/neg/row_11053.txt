Goimg to blow my brains outAnd I'll do it once I get the gun. I actuallt never thought I could ever go towards this direction, even thought I've been having suicidal thoights ever simce 4th grade. Anyways, now I'm 15, I know I might have a great life ahead, but right now nothing good has happened to me, and I'm always in this state of sadness and extreme anger that I desperately want to escape. At least then I'll be able to tell people things I would never tell them before I finally kill myself.
