i dont want to be gregor samsai am a muslim, torment in afterlife haunt me just now, i am not close to my god but   the crazy story about how i will repeat my death over and over again eternally is scary.  so i ditch jump and picked this.  pills,  weed and sleep, 24 more to go. 
i got gf, but seems like i have done this "drama"  too often and fail to end it. and it just happen she got things to do.  no its not about her,  

sleep tight.
