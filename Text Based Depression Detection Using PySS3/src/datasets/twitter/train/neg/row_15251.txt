I feel worse now, don't know what to do.I just got off the phone with the Suicide Hotline. While telling them why I felt the need to call they put me on hold, and ended the call first. After hearing that I may not be specifically at risk of killing myself but have been there before they seemed to have lost interest and pushed me off the line. 
I would really love someone to talk to. I haven't been this lost in my life. I feel so alone and so in pain. I don't know how to deal with this anymore. The self loathing I feeel for myself is beyond anything I've ever experienced.
