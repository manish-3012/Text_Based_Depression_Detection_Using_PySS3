Where can I runaway for a day or two?My brain keeps telling me to kill myself, because it's tired of everything in my life right now, and that I don't have any reason to live anymore. I barely eat, I haven't been to any of my classes for a week, and I skip work. I just went to Walmart, and bought a bunch of Tylenol and Advil, but then I stopped, because I know I can get better after I visit my doctor and take my antidepressant meds, but my doctor's appointment is 1 and a half week away, and I'm too tired to "fight" with my brain. 

I live in Dallas area, please tell me where I can runaway for a day or two, and what I can do to distract my brain from stop telling me what to do. I drove myself down to Arlington yesterday to visit a friend, I felt a bit better, then I came back home, and it got worse. I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy.
