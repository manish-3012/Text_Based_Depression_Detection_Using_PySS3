Just got out of an appointmentJust had an appointment with my psychiatric nurse and I feel even more suicidal. Like, here, let me tell you all of these things you already know and have heard literally every single time you've ever mentioned suicide. "You have to pull yourself up out of the hole." Mother fucker I know that I've had times where my brain WASN'T obsessed with begging for death and making plans, so fucking excuse me for wanting some goddamned different meds instead of the fucking bullshit, "just keep going," bullshit. There's no fucking point.
