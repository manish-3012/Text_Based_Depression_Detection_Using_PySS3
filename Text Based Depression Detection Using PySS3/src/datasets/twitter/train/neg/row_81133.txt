Why do I bother if I know I won't amount to anything.Everyone has something they're good at, it could be something like art, coding, or sports, but I am not really good at anything, I'm just barely getting through school, and I try new things whenever I get the chance, but I've never found anything I'm good at, and as I get closer and closer to becoming an adult, I realize that if I don't find something to do, I won't have a job, which means I can't afford to pay for a place to live. This has put me in a really dark place, I really want to kill myself, as I'd rather be dead than working at McDonalds and being homeless. Tonight may be my last night, I plan to find a nice tall bridge and "go for a swim."
