The legitimacy of my thoughts &amp; feelingsMy family has done a number on my mind. I'm going to be 40 years old this year and I still think that my feelings and thoughts have no legitimacy. I try to stay away from my family as often as possible, but sometimes it's unavoidable. I'm trying to keep this short because I don't want to bother anyone with the details. I just have to know that there are other people out there who feel like their voices are not being heard or that they're being dismissed or that thier ideas and feelings lack legitimacy. What's the point of sticking around if you can't even have a voice or an idea that means anything to anybody? What's the point of being here when the people who say they love you make you feel like a dumbass who has no idea what she's talking about? If your feelings and thoughts and ideas are meaningless and wrong, why keep going?
