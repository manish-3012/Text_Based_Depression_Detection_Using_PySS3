Hope.Funny word, isn't it? People always say to hope for a situation to end, or hope for it to get better. Hope for life to improve. "It always gets better!" "You'll be ok! Just be happy!!!". I'm trying to believe that, but in all reality, I don't know if I can. Life has been hell for years for me. Life hasn't gotten better, it's gotten worse. Going from being assaulted, physically and mentally all my childhood, to being assaulted mentally and physically as a young adult. I'm sitting here, questioning if I even fucking matter. If hope even really exists. I'm sitting here, alone, wishing it would all just stop. Drugs don't help. The pain I put myself in doesn't help. Nothing helps. I'm just done. So fucking done...
