Not sure anymoreMy first time putting anything on here, so sorry if Iâ€™m doing it wrong.
I honestly want to just die, everything pver the past year has built up since my grandfather passed away, my girlfriend of a year and a half left me and everything just feels like itâ€™s fallinf apart.
My grandmother is upset with me because I never see her anymore because Iâ€™m so focused on my schoolwork and itâ€™s either that or Iâ€™m laying in bed trying not to end things. 
Iâ€™ve stood atop the seven arches more times than I can count lately and I just donâ€™t know what to do.
My mother and I have never been close, her boyfriend hates me and my father left when we were young.
It all sounds clichÃ© but Iâ€™m just so worn out I want to die
