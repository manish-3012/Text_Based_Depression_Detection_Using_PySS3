Everything is wrongEverything is wrong in this life. Born with a crap face, messed up my body because I spent (and still am) my whole life just sitting in my room, sometimes making art, but mostly barely moving the whole day, being tired, being unfit, being unhealthy. And I mess up every single friendship. Seriously I make one bad move and people seem to never be able to forgive me. My parents are judgemental, my dad especially, being extremely racist and homophobic and transphobic and sexist. I haven't had a relationship offline. I'm an 18 year old girl and I'm behind in everything. I'd say I'm kind of smart but it sucks sometimes, you notice the hypocrisy of people and the crappy state of the world too much, plus how is anyone supposed to care about my intelligence when my outer appearance sucks and most people judge you for that? I'm too much of a realist to be here, I wish that mindset hadn't been rubbed onto me but when you grow up with everyone around you being angry and negative how are you supposed to find happiness in anything? I'll be very surprised if I make it to the end of 2020.
