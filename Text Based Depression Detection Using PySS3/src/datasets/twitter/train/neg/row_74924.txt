FuckWatching a movie alone in a few days, celebrating my birthday alone in a few months for the maybe 6th time. And oh God I got a terrible haircut trying out a few haircuts, can't wait for the bullying to start.


No hope, only solution is leaving unless anyones got ideas



I'm alone, ugly, live in a drug ridden area (I'm not a drug addict or user)



Want to drift to sleep forever so badly. It's unbelievable
