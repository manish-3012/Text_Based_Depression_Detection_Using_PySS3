I've lost everythingLike the title says, I have nothing, I've had a lot o problems and other shit going on in my life, but I was staying strong, for my girlfriend, that I truly believed, that we'll be together forever... And It's been exactly 39 days, since she left me. For 39 days I don't have a reason to live and everything gets harder and more exhausting. We're still friends, I told her, that even after breakup she can tell me everything and that was a mistake... Cause she's Talking about her new lover... And that sucks even more. The only reason that I'm still alive, was the hope, that she'll comeback to me one day, but now she has a new boyfriend... I don't want to live anymore, I have no one and nothing, everything gets worse... I can't take this

Sorry if I misspelled something etc. English isn't my national language

Help me please.
