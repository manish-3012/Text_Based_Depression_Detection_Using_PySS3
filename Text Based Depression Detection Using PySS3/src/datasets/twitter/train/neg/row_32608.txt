UselessI feel like i can get a more serious answer from the people here.

So a little background, i'm 16 years old. I know that you guys are going to think that 16 year olds can't feel real, true love, but i did/do. My girlfriend recently broke up with me and is messing around with other guys, I love her so much it literally physically hurts when i think about her with other guys. Lately I've been feeling worthless and pretty shitty because the girl i love so much doesn't love me back. I only feel happy when i'm completely fucked up. I smoke and drink the pain away as much as possible. I've contemplated suicide before but I don't want to hurt my family.  Is there anything i can do to get over this feeling of uselessness?
