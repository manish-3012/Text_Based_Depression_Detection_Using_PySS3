Considering suicide to avoid a terrifying experienceYou may or may not be aware of something called sleep paralysis, where you wake up but cant move and hallucinate evil demonic creatures. I have yet to experience it but I am bound to at some point. I'm at the most susceptible age and my mind fucks with me all the time, making me fear ghosts and demons and all that shit.

I have read many accounts of this and it sounds so fucking, unimaginably terrifying. I do not want to ever experience this. If I did, I would probably end my life afterwards. I am so terrified of experiencing this that I am seriously considering suicide. 

My life doesn't have much going for it anyway. Is living really worth the risk of going to bed every night and risking evil incarnated?
