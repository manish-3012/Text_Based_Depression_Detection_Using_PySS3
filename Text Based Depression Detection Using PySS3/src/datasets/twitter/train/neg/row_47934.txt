Currently contemplating downing my bottle of xanex with a beer and a cigarJust staring at the pieces. Why shouldn't I.  I just want it to go away.  Everything.  Just go away.  I just don't have the balls to go through with it.  I just want the anxiety to stop, the depression to stop, the dry heaving, heavy breathing, lack of friends, everything I touch going to shit, every girl I touch realizing I'm a cynical asshole... I just want it to go away.
