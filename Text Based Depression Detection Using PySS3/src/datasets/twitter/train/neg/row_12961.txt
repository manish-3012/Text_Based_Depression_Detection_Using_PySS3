Why do things change so fast?Do you ever feel ok or even good and then the feeling to do it hits you like a ton of bricks?

I had my mind made up a few weeks ago. Was already drafting goodbyes in my head. I made some progress and got good news about treatment... then itâ€™s like a light switch that flips and makes you feel all that hope you felt for a fleeting while was an imposter. It felt so nice for a moment and makes me even more angry that Iâ€™m back to feeling like I will never stop hating my life because of the rage and disappointment I feel at how itâ€™s turned out. Iâ€™m just ready to be at peace. 

If you read thank you for listening to me scream pathetically into the void.
