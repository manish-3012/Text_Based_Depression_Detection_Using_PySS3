This is my first post... uhhhIâ€™ve been suicidal on and off for years and lately Iâ€™ve become pretty decided on ending it. I threw myself down the stairs this morning, but it didnâ€™t really hurt anything. Things with my boyfriend are going okay Iâ€™m just so scared heâ€™s going to leave me if I get more depressed, since heâ€™s also depressed. I tried to vent to my best friend about my life and she basically blamed my sadness on not following her advice and that didnâ€™t help at all. I reacted negatively to her saying that and now she wonâ€™t talk to me. Iâ€™m not that close to my roommates or any of my other friends. My boyfriend lives 4 hours away and to be honest Iâ€™m just so lonely and feel so hopeless like I donâ€™t really want to see my future. I really just want to die. Sorry for all this, anyways, yeah.
