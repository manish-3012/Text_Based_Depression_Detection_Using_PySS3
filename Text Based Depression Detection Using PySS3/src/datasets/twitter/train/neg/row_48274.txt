Shooting myself to â€œThatâ€™s the way it isâ€ from Red Dead Redemption 2Iâ€™ve reached the end of my journey, my wife doesnâ€™t love me anymore, I donâ€™t have any realistic dating prospects post divorce because I donâ€™t really have a social circle anymore and couldnâ€™t make one if I wanted to because of COVID. 

This song is the perfect way to go out, Iâ€™ve had a good run, I just hope my son understands that everyoneâ€™s journey ends, mine just ends here.
