I want to kill myself because I am aloneMy ex boyfriend, the person I love most in this world, wants nothing to do with me. He was the best thing that ever happened to me and him leaving was the worst thing to ever happen to me. I donâ€™t want to live in a world where I canâ€™t be with him. Every day weâ€™re apart kills me even more. I donâ€™t see a point in anything anymore. All the good in my life is gone.
