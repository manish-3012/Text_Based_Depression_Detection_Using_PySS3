My mother just wants to stop living to end her depression /alcoholism and doesn't want anyone to help her anymoreI can't find a damn way to help her.this situation goes on from 13 years of depression, but the last 4 she's just expressing her need to end it. Until now there was always some thigh we could say or do it could at least give her an input to try and get better but now she just wants to be alone and stop eating and drinking. 
I don't have a good relationship with depression, I don't really understand it and approach people with depression because i don't know what to say or do 
Plus the last 13 + years dealing with my mother made me more afraid and uncomfortable dealing with it. 
And now I'm tired, I'm out of ideas, I'm, I don't know.... I'm really afraid it will go wrong
