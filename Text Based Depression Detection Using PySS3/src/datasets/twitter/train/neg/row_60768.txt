I think Iâ€™ve finally snappedI realized today that everything Iâ€™ve been doing is for everyone else. I donâ€™t want live. This is pointless Iâ€™m not attached to this world. Iâ€™m going to carefully plan this out. I canâ€™t afford to risk anything to chance. Iâ€™ve made the decision to go with A combination of Jimson Weed , morning glory and belladonna nightshade. I figured if Iâ€™m going to die I might as well trip abit. Over the next couple of days Iâ€™m going to slowly gather what I need from only and nature. Iâ€™ll post again when itâ€™s time to go. If anyone has any botany knowledge let me know.
