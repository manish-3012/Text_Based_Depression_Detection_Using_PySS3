Planning to OD this weekendI'm planning to OD this weekend. Wanted to do it today after getting panic attack at new job that I really need to stay afloat but I couldn't withstand the anxiety. Called HR of another company I really wanted to work for but they wouldn't have me because I'm in extramural college (I'm 30). Due to COVID situation I'm in great debt (can't make rent this month...) so I had to cancel my education so I called that company back today. The recruiter remembered me (we had an interview 2 months ago) and they had highly positive feedback about me but she needs to talk with the supervisior and said that she'll get back to my by the end of the week. If not for that I'd be trying to OD right now but I'll wait. If this won't work out then it's lights out for me...

The financial situation isn't the reason behind it all. Things have built up over the years and I tried getting help. Seen 2 therapist over the span of 3 years, been medicated and not much has changed. Getting BA degree was something I was looking forward to and now that I have to cancel it I lost last bit of hope that I can turn around my life. I get serious panic attacks whenever I start blue collar job (which is what I can get in my city right now). I guess it just hit me that even when I'm pushed against the wall financially the job offers right now really trigger my suicidal thoughts tenfold...

I got my bottle of wine ready to chug down pills with... It's a matter of time. These next few days I'll be thinking about what to write to a stranger that will find me. It might take days if not weeks because nobody ever comes over to see me anyway...
