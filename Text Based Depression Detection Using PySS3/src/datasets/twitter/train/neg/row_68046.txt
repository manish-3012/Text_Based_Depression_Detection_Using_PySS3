Failed a Class for my major, and about to fail another one. Why should I not do it?I am currently failing my Data Structures Class, and I bombed my Calculus Midterm. If I have to retake these classes and pay tuition again at my school, I will kill myself. 

I never took the initiative to be better or to overcome my problems in class over the first few weeks. Online classes just made it so much harder and everytime I take a Test, I forget that it's open-note, because I think I'm on the cusp of cheeting. Now, it's too late to turn the path, and I know that I can't transfer because I failed.

I don't want to tell my parents about it, because if I do, I will face a barage of shame and disappointment from them, knowing that they pay so much for me. I already failed to get into the schools my dad wanted for me, and the future looks so bleak. IS there any reason why I shouldn't do it? Help me.
