It's been a rough week...I never really thought I'd be here. But right now I'm lying in bed, unable to sleep because of the heroin withdrawal, and I really, really, really can't find the motivation to get up tomorrow and go to class and suffer through... All of it. And I can't help but think how much easier it would be if I didn't have to be anything. 

I've just been... Hit so hard this week. I'm in crippling, awful debt and will be decades after I leave school. Whether or not it's a cliche, I loved this girl, and she loved me to, and then.. She didn't. And it's not just that, I've gotten over girls before, I could do it again, but it feels like the straw that broke the camels back. It would just be so much fucking EASIER to give up. Not get drunk or shoot up or get high every single night to help me escape from the boredom and the shit and the same thing over and over and over. 

It really isn't your responsibility to listen to any of this. I just don't have anybody else who gives a damn about how I feel right now, so I'm kind of... Venting to you guys. I don't know if I want to die, but I can tell you that I want to give up. On feelings and work and money and drugs and life... And I guess dying is the only way to do that. I don't know.
