Am I lazy or a bad kid?
Iâ€™m 16 and going to high school. I like to play video games in my spare time. But by no means do I prioritize it over life. I go to the gym 5 days a week. Eat healthy. Get good grades. But I donâ€™t really like doing anything else. Not that Iâ€™m lazy Iâ€™m just an introvert and shy. So I play video games quite a lot and my dad hates it. He is an old school guy who likes hunting and fishing. I have been going with him ever since I could remember. For the last 5 years Iâ€™ve been going with him but not wanting to, but I was too scared to say anything. But now I finally told him (in the most respectful way I could) that I donâ€™t really like fishing or hunting. So he thinks I donâ€™t go because of video games, which is not true, I just donâ€™t enjoy the things he enjoys. I have had a job since I was 12 but they closed down so I donâ€™t have a job right now. So he just thinks im lazy and ungrateful. 

All I can think about is what he thinks of me. Itâ€™s gotten so bad that I have been thinking about ending it. I know itâ€™s stupid to think so hard about someone elseâ€™s opinion but I just feel Iâ€™m not good enough I have severe anxiety everytime I have to go over to his house and I just need someone to vent to.
