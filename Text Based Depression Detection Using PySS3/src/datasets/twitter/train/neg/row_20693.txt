I'm fed up with suicide being called selfish. I deserve to kill myself if I want.I never chose to be born. I choose to survive for my family, when I do go it won't be them that finds me. I'm currently living for others which makes them selfish in this case. They only care about my death because they like having me in their life. Remember when family guy killed Brian griffin. Was that selfish of them? Its their show. If they don't want a character they can do what they like. If we complain then really we are being selfish. They gave us the character and have no obligation to keep him alive. Same with me. Its my life. They may miss me but they'll miss me because they want me there, not because I do. And if you still think I'd be the selfish one then I guess that's too bad because Ive done enough living to deserve this choice
