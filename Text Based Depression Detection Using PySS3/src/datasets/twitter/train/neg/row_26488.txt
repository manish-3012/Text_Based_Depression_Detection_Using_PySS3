I donâ€™t feel like I belong hereI mean in this realm. Whatever this reality is. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m meant to exist in this way. Maybe Iâ€™m just lazy. I donâ€™t know. sometimes Iâ€™d rather kill myself than do a single page of homework. I donâ€™t have what it takes to make it here. I feel like an alien. Too odd and unstable to function. I feel so isolated and different and I just want to go somewhere else. I know if I kill my self my family will go through absolute hell. They love me. I know they do. And to make the idea of killing my self even worse, I have a girlfriend. I love her so much and I know she loves me too. I know if I die she will be completely devastated. It wouldnâ€™t be fair to her or any of the people I love. part of me wishes they hated me so it would be easier for them to accept. Sometimes I think of sabotaging my relationships with everyone so my death might bring them an ounce of joy. If I could have it perfect, Iâ€™d want to slowly fade away. Iâ€™d want to be forgotten about by everyone. No one can miss me if they didnâ€™t know I was even here. I wang my face to be forgotten. My name. My voice. My body. Everything. I want it to disappear from everyoneâ€™s heads. I feel like my negative thoughts and emotions arenâ€™t even mine. When I look in the mirror I donâ€™t think â€œfuck Iâ€™m so uglyâ€. I hear â€œfuck youâ€™re so uglyâ€. When I crumble under the weight of the slightest responsibility or expectation, thereâ€™s a separate voice telling me â€œI hate you so fucking muchâ€, â€œlook at yourself, youâ€™re fucking patheticâ€, â€œdo you honestly think they wanted to talk to you?â€, etc.    I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with my brain. I donâ€™t know why I feel the way I do. I donâ€™t know what else to do. Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m tired. I want to live in the next realm. I want to float through existence. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to make any difference in this world, let alone survive. And I feel too scared and tired to commit to trying. Idk. Iâ€™m in a lot of pain. I hate it. And I hate hurting the people I love. I wish they hated me. But I know that canâ€™t happen unless I make them hate me by hurting them and I canâ€™t bring myself to do that. I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel so trapped.   I donâ€™t belong here. Iâ€™m not meant for it.
