Life isnâ€™t for everyoneEveryone around me leaves me , having abusive father  beat the shit out of me for years  and mother standing there doing the same shit but in emotionally way . siblings dying in shitty ways , growing up and wishing everything to get well and still getting unlucky trauma after trauma. 
Burning so many bridges   that you have nowhere  to go anymore . 
Fuck this world, i just wish speeding bus would do  it for me cause whatâ€™s the point of wishing for better if you live unhappy while wishing for better luck  in this lottery aka called life. 

 It isnâ€™t for everyone and once you realize you arenâ€™t lucky enough  , youâ€™ll leave it behind . 
I might aswell leave this shit behind and hopefully find peace.
