It's been a year since my last note here, and I've relapsed and it's getting worse every time.I thought I could go on. I thought I've overcome the hill, and nothing could bring me down. But here I am again. I feel like a mess, my head is in a jumble, and I can't concentrate on anything. Everything is a blur. My day goes by so fast I can't grasp when it's morning and when it's night. 

I've fought so hard, to find a reason to go on, but even from my first recovery, I've realized I was never able to find that. I never recovered, I never did anything, I was only lying to myself. I still can't find a reason, I see no future, I see nothing. I'm just a hollow sack of meat and bones that moves, acts, and breathes without reason. My life has no meaning. As people have always told me, I think of the people that I would inflict pain on, but what can I do when I feel so miserable, and I just want a release from this fake life and fake laugh that I must carry on with?
