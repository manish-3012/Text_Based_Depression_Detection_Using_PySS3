I'm worthlessI'm going to try to lay down everything that makes me want to kill myself.

I'm at the end of high school, but I don't know how to do anything and I'm too depressed and anxious to work, or drive, or do practically anything. So, in the future, no matter what I do, I'll probably just be a leach on society.

My classmates, as well as the news, make me feel like there's no saving the human race. We're just a terrible species.

I'm horribly confused about my sexuality and my gender. I don't know who I am or what I like. 

I only have one real friend. Other than that, everyone hates me, understandably. 

There's only one person I know that would be willing to be my boyfriend but I'm not attracted to him but I'm pretty sure he'll be the only option for my life. 

Everyone else is probably enjoying Spring Break and here I am sobbing into my bed sheets like always.

Tl;dr: I am worthless, and deserve to die in my eyes. 

If anyone cares at all I would appreciate any words of kindness or help or... I don't know just anything at this point.
