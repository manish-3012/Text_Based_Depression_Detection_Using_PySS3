Financial crisis, evicted from house, lost my only lightI feel like everything's gone to shit. My fam had financial problems for a few years. But we just roll on, then one day we were evicted. I can't shake the feeling of restlessness since I need to take care of my mum all the time back then, and I lost my girl bcs of that.

I got into college before that, and she's like the only reason I think I have a shot at this. But I spent less time with her, going back almost always on weekends or whenever I have a free time. We were serious since our family knew abt it and we visited each other's place during the holidays.

Everything went to shit now. I miss her a lot, its been a year but I still feel as if its yesterday. Tried to go on but I feel burnt out. She seems happy now with her friends, lost my world as her friends were mine too. My mind keep telling me that as long as she's happy I am but can't fool.myself any longer.

Not at peace at home or studies, always feel like something's going down. Can't sleep and I just want things to be like before, go home, see her smile.
