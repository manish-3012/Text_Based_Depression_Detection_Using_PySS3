if i dont pass these GCSEs im going to kill myself.16 years old, the fact that im suicidal at this young goes to show the absolute joke lf a country that i live in, if i fail this maths mock tomorrow thats it for me, fuck the UK government, fuck everything to be honest, i know i have my 'whole life ahead of me', but if my whole life is a 9-5 underpaid hell of a job then thats no life i want to live, all this because the incompetence of our government and the fact that they think that 6 months of learning time can be made up for in less than 2, fuck my life, i quit this bullshit, blame the tory education sector.
