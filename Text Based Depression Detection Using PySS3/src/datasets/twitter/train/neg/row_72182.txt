Iâ€™ve been trying to dieHey everyone, I hope you are all okay and I wish you all happiness. (Format because Iâ€™m on mobile) 

Iâ€™m sorry, but i gotta unload this somewhere- 
Iâ€™ve been trying to die for years. I didnâ€™t necessarily recognise what I was doing at first. I always felt apart from humanity.

No. I canâ€™t even do this....

Anyone else been killing themselves with drink and drugs because theyâ€™re too scared to just end it dramatically? 
I really respect anyone with the courage to just end it. They are our bravest. I envy them as being stronger than I could ever be. I have a love for them they will never know. 
 Iâ€™ve been contemplating suicide since before I was ten years old. Now Iâ€™m not n my 30â€™s and still feeling the same. Itâ€™s embarrassing, Iâ€™m such a piece of shit.
