I have no oneI have no friends left. My one best friend I have tries to help me but she also lets me know that I overwhelm her and I have character flaws. I just lean on her as a cry for help, but she doesnâ€™t know how. Now sheâ€™s feeling down so I have to suppress my own emotions to help her. But also one of my character flaws is helping her, so Iâ€™m stuck. My boyfriend tries to help me, but heâ€™s never honest with me about what he wants so then when I do something he said was ok, he turns around and sulks because it wasnâ€™t really ok. Both of their lives would be better without me. Theyâ€™d mourn for a little, but were young, theyâ€™d recover. I just canâ€™t leave my mom, sheâ€™s the only one who wouldnâ€™t recover. But I have the notes in my backpack, I stopped taking my depression medicine, and Iâ€™m ready to find the tipping moment where Iâ€™m 100% tired.
