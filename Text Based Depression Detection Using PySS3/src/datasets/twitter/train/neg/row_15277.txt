You know what? Fuck everything thats what.I fucking hate my life. i Don't go to school hardly at all anymore. I only go to work so i can get money for gas weed and video games. My parents hate me. My dad told me hes gonna leave my mom because im making her crazy. I only have a hand full of friends that live an hour away in college, so i see them once every 2 weeks. I just fucking hate the world and i dont know what do do anymore. I burnt the shit out of my arm last night just because punching myself in the face did not hurt enough. My cars breaking down and i hardly have any money to fix it. I just hate my life right now and i cant see it getting any better. I feel like the world would be a better place without me in it. I'm lazy, anti-social, and dont like following most rules(like at work). I'm very tempted to just drive my fucking car into the river and never look back. How the fuck am i ever gonna be happy if my family hates me, as do my bosses at work. If i had a gun i would just shoot myself because it would be quick and i could get it over with.
