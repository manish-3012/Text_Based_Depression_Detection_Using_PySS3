Middle of my First Year of CollegeI am here because I don't know how to handle the anxiety anymore. I just got out of my first exam of the term, and feel pretty in the dumps. Started studying for my math exam tomorrow, and realize I don't know anything about what they are testing me. 

Problem is that I know I have been putting in tremendous effort so far and I have been maintaining A/Bs in all my classes. 

This contrast of confidence has gotten me really put down. I can't shake the feeling that I have forgotten to learn since high school. In either 2 years or until I get a stable job, my parents are paying for my college tuition and classes. It drives my emotions to the ground knowing that I am going to end up disappointing them. 

I really feel like there is only two ways out, one with death and the other with the disappointment of my entire family. I can't disappoint them, I do not know what to do. 

Thanks for reading.
