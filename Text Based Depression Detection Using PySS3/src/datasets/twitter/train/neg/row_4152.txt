LonelinessI do not understand the social norms of my generation. I always feel like a separate entity, and that I will never fit in.i have friends, but have never felt truly the same. I am an alien who will never truly be human.

Tomorrow I am going to end it all. I am going to walk to my local bridge in the middle of the night, so as to avoid attention which could potentially hinder my efforts, and I'm going to jump.out of sight, out of mind. The fall will not kill me as the bridge is not far from the water. I will either die by drowning, or more probably by freezing to death. 

Hopefully in darkness I will be at peace
