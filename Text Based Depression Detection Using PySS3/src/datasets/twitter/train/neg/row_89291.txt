I don't know if I ever felt a moment of happinessI didn't experience major trauma or anything else that would justify suicide, the only reason is, that I seem to be unable to feel happiness. I've experienced situations, that should make me happy, graduating from school, a relationship without any real conflicts or meeting nice and understanding people. I just barely acknowledge it. On the other side I don't feel anger or sadness, when a family member dies, also just acknowledgement. 

That doesn't really cause me pain, but it makes everything so tiresome, nothing motivates me, nothing promises any change of my situation. Ending it all really seems like the most convenient solution.
