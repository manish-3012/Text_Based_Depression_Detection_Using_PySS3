A poem(Not a good one but whatever)

January is the coldest month

Bare trees, bruises


I wonder how old youâ€™ll be when you think about me for the last time

And realize I was just some stupid kid you knew

No Plath or Hemmingway

With bold and striking headlines

And crowds of weeping families


Neighbourhood chatter is muffled by the whistle of the winter breeze 

â€œItâ€™s tragic, reallyâ€

An assembly, forced and bitter tears, hugs and handshakes

Home cooked meals on my motherâ€™s doorstep

Was it worth it? The helium? The breezeblock? The rope? 

I hope so, I really do

January is too cold for me
