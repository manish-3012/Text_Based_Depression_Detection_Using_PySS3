What's the point?I've been Suicidal for awhile now. Usually my friends will tell me to go to the ER whenever I am. Here's the catch though. I've been there so many times, I could probably use both hands to count. (About 15.) Its gotten to a point though that whenever I show up to the ER, the nursing staff and Psychatrist tell me to go home because I've been down the same road of Suicidality before. What do I do? I want to kill myself but I don't. I want help, but I don't really receive it. I'm fed up with people telling me that there are there to help, and then them not helping me. Fuck. Sidenote: I'm seeing a psychiatrist and Therapist. I'm on meds that have recently been changed. I just can't seem to be happy. All I ever am is sucidal. I'm fed up with it.
