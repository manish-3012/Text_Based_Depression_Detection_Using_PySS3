Honestly I have no clueI really want to die, but at the same time I don't. I want to be somewhere else, not because my family hates me or my life is terrible, but just because I know that it could be better. I feel terrible saying "oh life could be better" because my parents are one of the largest reasons I'm still here, as I feel dying would just burden them. I want to die to see what comes after, but am too scared that it'll be worse, or that my death would be a painful/slow one.  I've started having anxiety attacks very frequently at night time.  
Here's a hot take, dreaming is bad literally always. When you have a nightmare/bad dream, you end up panicking and feel terrible waking up, but "good" dreams are just as bad. You don't wake up and suddenly have a great life after having a good dream, it's always back to your normal one, which personally makes me very sad and wanting to go back to that dream. Basically the fact that we dream is a curse. Kinda like showers, you don't feel like taking one, until you do in which case you want to stay there. Idk I'm just rambling and contemplating whether or not to send this. I just want to talk with someone who can't judge me correctly because they don't know who I am.
