Update, still miserable. I've pushed everyone out of my life, my ex husband went for all my friends after the divorce and either slept with him or tried. The only ones he didn't sleep with were the ones I caught in the act before they could. I feel so alone. My family are addicts, my friends betrayed me, I can't move on..
I don't want to do this anymore.
I am to the point that I'm mad that anyone is in my life at all that loves me.
I stay for them and now I'm pushing them out to make it easier for them when I make my choice, or take action.
I wish people would just let me fucking die.
