I'm strong I know that but I'm reaching my limit that I might just end it the second I break....There's still good in life, but I've been making a bunch of mistakes that's taking toll each and every time I make one.

It's getting harder and harder to forget them and every time I remember them I lose my sanity.

The thoughts of suicide makes me feel calm and free... it's becoming an addiction.

The problems in my life keep on creeping on me and the only escape is death. 

I can't trust the person I talk to anymore, I feel more alone than ever. Talking to other people makes me sound like a pussy because that's what I am right now, an idiot and a coward.

I tried to exercise, hiking, other forms of positive things and it worked for a short time but once my depression kicks in its hard to get rid of it.. The anxiety, panic attacks, chills, paranoia, despair... I start crying randomly now.

Nothing is interesting and fun anymore and I feel like I'm hurting other people.

I should really get help before this becomes worse, do depression pills work?
