I just need to choose a place...My car is almost ideal. It is in need of repairs and has been parked for months. If I hid in the back, my body wouldnâ€™t be found for awhile. One problem is that once Iâ€™m in the car, Iâ€™m in; I wonâ€™t be able to smoke in the car and I wonâ€™t be able to get out of the car to smoke. My plan involves getting drunk and I smoke when I drink. I donâ€™t want my plan derailed because my drunk ass needs a smoke. Another problem is that my car is the only valuable thing Iâ€™ll leave behind in this world. My family could sell it to pay for my funeral. I would hate to ruin its resale value by using it as a tomb.

Iâ€™ve considered getting a hotel room. I like the idea of prepping the bathroom for my suicide and then enjoying the main room until Iâ€™m ready to go. I also really like the idea of dying near running water, even if itâ€™s just a shower that wasnâ€™t turned off. The problem is that I would need the room for at least 2 nights. 3 to be on the safe side. I know I shouldnâ€™t be worried about money because Iâ€™m dying, but the thought of dropping a few hundred bucks on a decent hotel room gives me pause. Also, would that dying near water thing be worth it if room service comes knocking the first morning to find out why Iâ€™ve been running the shower all night?

Iâ€™ve also thought about getting a tent. The upside to the tent is that my death would look like an accident if I did it right. My family might get a life insurance payout if I pulled it off. The downside is that doing it â€œrightâ€ would cost more than the hotel room. If I hid the tent in the woods at the edge of town, my body might not be discovered until the winter, but everyone would know what I had done. I donâ€™t really like camping. The only upside was the potential life insurance payout. If I canâ€™t finf happiness in life, shouldnâ€™t I at least be content when I die?

Iâ€™ve also toyed with the idea of â€œaccidentallyâ€ locking myself in the garden shed on a rainy night. Maybe I drunkenly lit the barbecue to keep warm and accidentally died. But the shed locks from the outside and the barbecue needs to be plugged in so I donâ€™t see how I could make it look like an accident.

What do you think? Where would you kill yourself if you decided to end your life?
