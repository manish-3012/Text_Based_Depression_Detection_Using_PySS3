I'm tired of feeling worthlessI'm tired of pouring my heart into people who pretend they care only to get "bored" and then treat me like garbage for no reason or explanation. I only have so much to give and it's all been given away with nothing to show for it.  
  
  When you're told enough times that you're worthless, its must be true.
