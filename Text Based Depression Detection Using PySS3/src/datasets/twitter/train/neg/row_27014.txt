I need someone to talk to, if only for a few minutes.I'm Em.
I've never posted on reddit before, but I need help and this came up.

I am suicidal and don't know what to do.
I have felt suicidal for a long time, I am diagnosed with borderline personality disorder,  recovering drug addict. 

I don't leave my house (I live in a rural area and do not have a car.)
I  don't have friends
I don't  have a  job since I found out I have a chronic illness and havent been able to work for complications with that.

I just sit in the same chair in my kitchen from when I wake up to when I go to bed.
I only go outside to smoke a cigarette.
My dog is all that is keeping me here.

I don't know if I should have started a new thread or gone to another but I can't take it anymore
