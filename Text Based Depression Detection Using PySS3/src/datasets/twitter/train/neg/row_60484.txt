Used my legs as a punching bagIn May, I hated myself so much that I started to beat my legs up so no one can see any marks. Since May, my left wrist was hurting so bad. Went to finally get it checked and I got a hairline fracture. It sucks to have everyone ask what happened, and I gotta make up some bs excuse when in reality I hate myself.
