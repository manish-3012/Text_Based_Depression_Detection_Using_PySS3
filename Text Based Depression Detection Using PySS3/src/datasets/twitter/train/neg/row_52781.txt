Ever since my mom died I havenâ€™t wanted to liveEver since my mom died at age 6, Iâ€™ve felt utterly broken. Iâ€™m 21 now, and the grief hasnâ€™t left me. The fucked up thing is, Iâ€™m actually becoming successful in life by most peoples standards. But the more successful I become, the more pain I feel due to my mom not being here to see it.

Iâ€™ll be dead by 30.
