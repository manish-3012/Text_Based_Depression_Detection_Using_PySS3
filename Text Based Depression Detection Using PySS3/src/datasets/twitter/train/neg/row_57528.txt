I can't do this anymoreI'm done, my life is a literal dumpster fire. My mentor for my future career has ghosted me, my college education is going to go to shit because I can't afford it. My boyfriend's mother thinks I'm not good enough, my own parents have stopped giving a shit about me. I can't do this anymore, I'm done.
