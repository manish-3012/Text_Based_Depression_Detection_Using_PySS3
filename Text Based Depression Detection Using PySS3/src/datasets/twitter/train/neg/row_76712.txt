Life beyond lossI met Robyn in 2010 as a virgin and she the same. We met in college in MI. We were in college until 2013.  In 2013 I moved to her from MI to CA for a shitty job.  I got a better job in 2015 but still fucking overload workload. She had a miscarriage in 2016 and again in 2017.  She left me after the second.  Literally everyone in my family is telling me that I need to "come home".  I miss sleeping next to her so fucking much.  I miss hanging out with her.  I miss being her lover.  I haven't contacted her since we split on a friends advice.  I don't fucking know what to do.
