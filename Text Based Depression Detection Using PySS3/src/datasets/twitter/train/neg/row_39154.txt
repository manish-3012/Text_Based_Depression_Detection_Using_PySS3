They really donâ€™t get it, do theyEvery friend I have opened up about my suicide problems act like dumb fucks I swear, they be ignoring my words and diminishing the situation, saying â€œjust smile! it will make you feel better!â€ or asking me every day â€œare you feeling any better?â€ ??? Iâ€™ve been feeling the same everyday, just because I pretend to be okay because your dumb ass doesnâ€™t get it, doesnâ€™t mean it ever gets better, why would something suddenly change lmao
