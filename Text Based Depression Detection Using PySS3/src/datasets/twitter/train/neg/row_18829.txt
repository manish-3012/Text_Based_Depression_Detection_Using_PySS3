so... I still wanna dieafter surviving an OD, you'd think I'd have a bit more of an appreciation for living but I honestly just wish I hadn't called that person who called in the ambulance. 

I hate that my family says that if I do something again, they'll kill themselves. I hate that they spent money to keep me alive. I hate having these mental illnesses. I hate that this one person who was supposed to be there for me is the one who's causing the biggest problems. I hate that I still find myself wanting to be with him. I hate how I am. I hate being alive.

Everything's always just so tiring. I just want to not. exist.
