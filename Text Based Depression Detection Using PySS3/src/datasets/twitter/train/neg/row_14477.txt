I think time is running outI think I've failed on getting out of the hole that I found out I've been digging myself into years. So much of the advice I've heard won't help me. I don't really have the will or want to push through the next day, let alone year. I'm at the worst point I've ever been. If someone tells me I need to be strong I have the urge to curl up and tell them that it doesn't. I'm a weak, little person and it doesn't seem like making out is possible or even very rewarding
