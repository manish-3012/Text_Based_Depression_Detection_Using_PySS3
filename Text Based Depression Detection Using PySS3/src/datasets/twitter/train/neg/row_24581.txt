Wanting to dissappearI've been thinking a lot about this recently, and I think I just really want to dissappear.

Not by killing myself (although it is one option on my mind), but by just... leaving. Take what little money I have, and go live elsewhere, far from the ones I should call "family", but really don't give a sh*t about me. 

The more I think about it, the more I want to do it. I have a plan. It would be like another chance to me... One last shot at life, if you will.

Of course, I know this is not going to be easy. Actually, I know for a fact it's going to suck â€“ no home, little money, no job ? Recipe for disaster, right ?

But I'm ready to risk it. Soon enough.
