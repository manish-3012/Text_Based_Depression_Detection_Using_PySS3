Contemplating is a hobby at this point.I think about killing myself so often that I've started thinking of it as a hobby. The process is always the same. I lay on my bed, browse reddit, feel sad and start thinking about ways to kill myself. The most common way is finding my dad's gun and going to the middle of nowhere and ending it.

While this has been the routine for the past two years the last part of this routine was always to think of what would other people say; slowly that step has gone away and I've started asking myself what would change. The short answer is nothing would change.
