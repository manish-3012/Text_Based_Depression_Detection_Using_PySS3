AlcoholI thought a lot about drinking myself to death but I'm not sure if that's even possible. I though about just getting some liquors and chug them but I read that would rather put you in coma.

If I wasn't such a coward I'd just jump from a bridge or in front of a train...


Sorry if this is an inappropriate, weird post but well I just found this sub and don't know where else to go with my thoughts :(
