iâ€™m trying so hardi feel like i shouldâ€™ve killed myself while i had the chance. i canâ€™t go back now and i feel stuck here. i donâ€™t wanna go on but i donâ€™t wanna burden anyone more than i already have by killing myself. at least i have music. but i know how easy itâ€™ll be just to escape this place. i donâ€™t want to seem entitled wishing for a better life because i know i have it good. iâ€™ve come to terms with the idea that iâ€™ll stop existing but i just donâ€™t feel anything anymore. iâ€™m trying to see the bigger picture in this as i know i am truly insignificant and iâ€™m just a drop in the ocean so my death wouldnâ€™t mean much on a larger scale. iâ€™d just be burdening the people who like me.
