I want to take the easy way out and I don't even feel ashamed anymore

I just want this to all end. I don't want to try anymore. I don't want to face another day. I know I can probably get better, but it's not even worth it to me. It's not worth this suffering. I know I have things sooooo good compared to so many people, but it's just really hard for me to handle. Giving up is the easy way out, but I just don't want to put up a fight anymore. I know it's selfish and I will probably ruin many people's lives if I go through with it.. but that won't be my problem when I'm gone. That's not something I'll have to feel guilty about because it will all be over for me. I know that sounds horrible to say, and before the guilt of potentially going through with it would stop me, but this is just where I'm at. I'm coming to terms with it.. which is honestly scary but also very freeing. My life is in my own hands, I can choose to continue, to better myself, but honestly, I think I want to take the easy way out.
