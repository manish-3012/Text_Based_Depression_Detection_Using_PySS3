I've tried for a long time, I can't anymore.I'm just scared now more than ever of what I can do to hurt myself. I have no one to talk to about my issues because truthfully, it's tiring. I have suffered from depression all my life. After I had my son (now 22) I found a purpose. Well all that is now out the window. My kid is grown and living out of the state. We do communicate. My husband doesn't understand depression so I have to understand that he doesn't understand and it feels like a lot of pressure on both ends. My late dad is gone now 2 yrs and my mom is very sick and has terminal kidney failure. Diabetes turned to heart disease then we found out she was born with one kidney. She lives with me. I get sick a lot. I don't know why. I haven't been in the doctor's to get a check up in about 7 yrs. I was always in and out of hospitals when I was younger. I have scoliosis and I had my surgery when I was 14 five screws and a bar. Now I'm always in and out because of my mom. (I don't know why I'm so scared of hospitals.)It hurts me so much to see her like this. She's only 67. I'm 41 and I can't take it anymore. I don't know when but I feel it in my guts that my time is up by my mysterious mind.
