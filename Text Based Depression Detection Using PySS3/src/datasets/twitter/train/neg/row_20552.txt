i just want to be deadi hate life everyday i find something to be miserable about today the weather sucks and it's cold. I always cry a little bit everyday sometimes i dont even know why im crying i just do. I think about my ex bf everyday i miss him a lot but i'm also still mad. There's other things too but i wont go into detail i just want to hang myself or jump off a building.
