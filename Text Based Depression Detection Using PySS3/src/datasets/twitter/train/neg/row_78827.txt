times are hard, redditors.i feel like a robot sometimes. I want to cry but the tears just won't flow. My ex stole my kids from me, the meaning of my life I had relationships with psycho and manipulative women and I feel like crap.  Can't work well, been acting mediocre. Parents and some friends have mental health issues (clinical depression/ schitzo/ bipolar) and dealing with them makes me feel worse. I feel like their mental issues has rubbed off on me and sometimes my head is at the edge of contemplating suicide. Wtf do I do. I have no meaning in life right now. Do I just keep busy? I have the wrong set of friends too. They don't care they care only about themselves. Basically ?I am stuck.
