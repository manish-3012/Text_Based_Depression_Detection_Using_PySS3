I may kill myself soon.Basically the title. Have struggled with mental illness the majority of my life, and after being suicidal for a while when I was 9, I resolved to kill myself after highschool if I still felt the same way. Well its almost the end of grade 12, I have only developed more mental problems since then, as well as physical health problems, 
 and after breaking down a year or 2 ago and resolving to live life just to experience things and learn (because its a bit better than the high possibility of not existing at all after dying), things were better for a while, but the shit I feel and think every day and endure alone is making that not even worth it. I almost killed myself again today, for the third time in the last few months. Afterwards I went back to a friends I had been at earlier, and acted normal, as if nothing happened, felt pretty normal, then as soon as I leave my mind is in the same place as before. It made me realize how much I rely on distractions on a daily basis. The only thing that's stopped me is not wanting to hurt my family and friends, who I love but don't share much with, as I havent told anyone about even a fraction of the problems that I have in my day to day life. Had a thing with this girl I really connected with that just wants to be friends now, but thats not gonna happen lol. Also the particular mental illnesses I have tend to worsen with age, and with my current situation and having wanted to die at such an early age, Im not sure I want to stick around to see myself in 10 or 20 years. The next time, I will probably leave.
