I can't feel
Last year I was happy, I could laugh, I could love. I don't feel anything anymore. So I tested this theory. Around March last year I went to an amusement park, I have always been scared of heights, I rode all the rollercoasters without screaming or feeling scared. I didn't feel anything. This year I feel so disconnected from everything. I don't feel myself. I used to laugh at everything. I feel so fake and I hate it. I still have my old friends but I have realized that they aren't my friends they don't care about me. Then I realized the one person I could talk to and they would help didn't care about my problems they just care about themselves. My mother only cares about her boyfriend. So I have no one. I am alone. If I can't feel why should be alive? If no one cares about how I feel why should stick around? I always feel like a third wheel even with my own best friend. I can't even get a therapist because my mom doesn't believe me. So I am here. I don't know what to do?
