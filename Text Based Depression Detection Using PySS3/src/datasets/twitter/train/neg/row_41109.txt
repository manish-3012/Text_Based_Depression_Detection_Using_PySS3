Nothing to live for sick of livingI have literally nothing left to stay alive for I'm already making plans to end it when I get enough money to buy the right drugs depression and anxiety have crippled me since childhood and it appears theirs no way out of it have no friends or girlfreinds and I. Pretty much dependant on my mum like a child since I have no job and  I can barley look after my self. pretty much every girl I've ever talked to has either ignored me or even laughed at me I feel if go on like this I'll soon explode what's the point of life if I don't even bother to get out of bed some days I can barley even stand  to look at myself in the mirror any more I hate myself that much
