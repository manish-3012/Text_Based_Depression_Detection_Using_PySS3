I feel like I am a dissapointment towards my parentsSometimes I feel like I do not belong on y family. I'm the dumbest among my siblings, I constantly rush to make decisions and fail my parents. Whenever I do something that I thought would help them, ends up disappointing them at the end. Last week my dads Pendrive got infected by a shitty virus. He asked me for help and I followed some tutorials online and somehow lost all the files.  All my siblings have degrees in engineering and I have interest in filmmaking and photography. I'm currently in the 5th semester of my visual communication diploma but I feel like my dumbness if has caused them to spend a lot of money for the tuition fee. Please help me, I am constantly thinking of running away and disappearing.
