I canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself and constantly feel malaise and sadness.Everything feels exhausting all the time.  I never have motivation to do anything and life feels shallow and pointless.  Iâ€™m constantly in emotional pain with nowhere to put my finger on the cause and itâ€™s never ending.

I canâ€™t stop thinking about how I should kill myself, and just rest forever and fade away.  Like being conscious is just too much anymore.  It gives me a stress headache.  I donâ€™t want to be awake anymore I just want to fall into my bed and sleep forever.

Iâ€™m lonely and worthless as a human being.  No one wants me.  No one talks to me.  I just bother people with my presence. 

Iâ€™m trans.  Iâ€™m doing okayish financially at this point (after going through trauma and homelessness) but I still hate myself for it.  I just see a monster when I look in the mirror.  Iâ€™m disgusting and thereâ€™s nothing I can do about it.

Thereâ€™s just no future for me.  I canâ€™t get rid of this lump in my throat and emotional pain.  Itâ€™s too constant.  I just want to put a bullet through my brain and silence it all.  Let go of my responsibility and the chore of life and just be at peace.

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
