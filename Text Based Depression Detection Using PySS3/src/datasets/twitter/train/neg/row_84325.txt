I have no ideaThe only reason i havent killed myself is because i dont want to make others sad. Im not happy but im not sad either. I take other peoples idea of their own happiness and make it mine. I feed off of other peoples idea of life because i dont have my own. Any relationship ive ever been in was only to give the other person what they wanted, me. Im so ready to give up because i truely honestly have no idea what i want out of life or what i want for my self. I have no goals or ambitions or dreams of how i want my life to be. I just do what others expect out of a person and that is simply to not give up on life.
