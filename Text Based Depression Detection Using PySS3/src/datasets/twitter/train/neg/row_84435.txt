A life without the one person you wanted to share it with. I'm not a coward because I feel that death would give me peace.  I have fought many battles and this is just one... I shouldn't have lost in, 4 years down the drain because she wouldn't fight for us.  When a person gets sick you take care of them. You allow the person to rely on you in their time of need. You don't give up on them. You don't toss out the words you said up until the very ending. You don't walk away from me.

I want you back :(   It isn't fair after all those words you said to me. You say I didn't keep my promises but I only promised you something that takes a life time to earn.  Not something you gain in a short amount of time usually. I never glanced at another woman or had interest in anyone else besides you.   I can't handle this suffering. I shouldn't have to.  You should be here with me, just as I was there.

Why am I being punished for this, all I did was get sick,  I continue to fight hard and progress to succeed but it's not enough for you, nothing I do is enough for you, you rather be with someone new.

Fuck depression.  I'm broken and totally alone.  I wanted a life with you.  I don't want to handle this anymore =(   I want to live but not like this.  SOMEONE please help.
