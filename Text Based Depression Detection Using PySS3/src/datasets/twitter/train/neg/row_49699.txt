I have chickedned out so many times, it's time to finally go through with it.I am a 32 year old man who has nothing to live for. I cannot hold down a job to save my life. I was recently laid off for a job, which I actually enjoyed. It wasn't because of my performance, 3 of us were let go. I have no life, outside of working, and now I do not even have that. I am constantly anxious, and suicidal. I am still here, because I think about how much my death will hurt my family, especially my Mom wo is already on the verge of a brekadown herself. I cannot care about that anymore though, because I am a prisoner of life, and death is the only way out. I am of the belief that if you are not able to live a full life then what is the point of living. I do not have a method down solid, but have a few ideas. The problem is I do not even have enough money to die. It's ironic that I do not have enough money to live, or even die, haha.
