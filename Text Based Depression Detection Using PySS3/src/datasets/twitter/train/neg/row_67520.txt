Back again today with the thought of putting a plastic bag over my head, gone.I'm definitely going to shoot myself in the heart. I feel this is going to give me the cleanest death (emotionally) I can feel. 


Everyone says it's not going to be successful. I sure hope not. Its gonna suck if I'm paralyzed. But I'd prefer to be paralyzed than physically tormenting my own body and my cats. I first though abouts suicide when I was 11 or so about 20 years ago and it hasn't left my thoughts. EVERY DAY. This is all I think about EVERY DAY.


Yesterday I came here wondering any philosophy behind suicide. I STARTED feeling a little better after I deleted my post but my cat started infuriating me and I smacked her a bunch and spent the rest of the day in bed. I'm up today feeling my options, which I've known since I was a child. Any ideas you guys have would be great. 


Please don't reccomend that I talk to someone. I've seen a dozen therapists who have been relentlessly malicious toward me. That is not a helpful person.
