Feel like I lost myselfThis past year has just been really hard. I started as a straight A student and am now failing all my classes. No one likes me, the only people who are around me are only in it for my money. At my job I know everyone hates me, I'm not exaggerating or anything its just a common fact. I nearly overdosed on cocaine. I got caught up in prostitution, and drug production. I've last track of all my friends. Now all I'm surrounded by are people who just want to use me. I let them because I don't have anyone else. I don't know how to escape it all. This week I'm getting a draco. I just feel so lost in this mess, and I don't have anyone to turn to. My family kicked me out when I was 14, this gang has been the only thing there for me over the years. If I leave I'm leaving the only people that have been there for me over the years. Who bailed me out of jail. Who took care of me when I OD'ed, but I know theyre only there cause I bring in the digits. Everything feels so blurry. I'm going to turn the draco on myself.
