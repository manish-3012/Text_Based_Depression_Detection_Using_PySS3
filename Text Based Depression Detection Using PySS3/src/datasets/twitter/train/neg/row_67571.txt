helpthis is something i sent someone today, i'm currently drunk with a knife on my hands and i really don't know if ill make it through the day or if i want to.


i didn't wanna bother you with this and wont be sending any more messages after this, you can stop reading now and delete this if you want, its ok.
I wanted to say this to someone and since you kind of know me i'll say it to you, i get the emotional charge that would come with and don't wanna pile to you day so i kind of hope you are not reading anymore and have gone about your day. There is some decent chance i won't be making through next week, i've tried to kill myself in november and failed, woke up with the regret of being alive knowing i wouldn't have it in me to try again for a long time, its been piling on since then and im getting the same feeling of hopelesness and desolace i had that day.
I'm so tired of pretending right now, all the fake smiles, fake laughs, fake conversations, if i have to fake one more smile or say that im ok one more time today im gonna break.
It's ironic i always considered myself so rational and logical and in the end its emotions and mental disorders taking it all from me, what i know and believe is so disconnected from what i feel and think it lost all importance, i know i'd have much to offer to a partner or a friend but all i can feel in social interactions is everyone is better of staying away from me, fake a smile and a plastic conversation and end it as quickly as i can, never real, never vulnerable, adding layers to protect myself and for as much as i logically want to break through them i can't, its so thick now its so much work and i'm so tired, i have failed to make a real human connection all my life and have never had a real friend or a real relationship, which seems to be what i crave the most, completely effortless for most people and even though it's the biggest source of my anguish i'm failing to do anything about it. I could say that logically i don't want it and would flick a switch to end the desire if i could but i understand all the ways it would effect my brain and in the end that's all there is
I Just wanted to be happy and i tried so hard for so long i don't know if i can keep trying, i set a lot of difficult goals i thought would make me happy and worked at it for years, i accomplished so much and now everything is worse because i feel the same and have all these things for nothing, everything seems to be for nothing and i'm lost. Abandoning all possible positive outcomes to end this darkness and all the negative ones seems a really good trade right now, i guess if it comes to it i wanted to leave this last note somewhere as a last piece of a real me if i ever had one.
