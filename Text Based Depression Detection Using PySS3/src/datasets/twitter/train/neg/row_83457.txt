im donemy friend told me if i ever needed to say something i could say it on here... well here is what i am saying now. I am done with everything. I am pretty sure some people would be thrilled for the fact that i am  not in their lives anymore. At least i will not be that "disappoinment" in their lives anymore. I have set the date when to do it, and that is on Saturday. I should have done this years back, but i made a promise to a friend, that i would not do it. But now... I am going to break that promise. It is getting too much to handle. YES I AM COWARD. at least i am not afraid to admit that. I can not handle what life is giving me. I can not handle the fact that my mother does not want me around. My father is not here, so yay...! My mother does not love me. Say what you want. SHE DOES NOT. She keeps reminding me how much of a disappointment i am to her. At least when i am dead, she will have one less mouth to feed, and one less "headache" to handle. Then school is just super dandy! I AM SICK Of EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING. I know as hell when i am not wanted. So why should i even bother sticking around now?
