tired of being worthlessIve considered ending my life before, but lately its got a lot worse. I feel as if I have absolutely nothing to live for. There is nobody in this world that loves me, I have no family, my boyfriend dissapeared. I feel completely alone. I'm so tired and I can't find any reasons to carry on. I feel that the world would be better off without me, I am completely unloveable. I get no pleasure out of life anymore and i'm not sure what to do.
