Can someone please tell me i'm going to get through this.I am disabled and in intense pain.  I do not want to die, but I keep having visions of me hanging myself, putting a gun to my temple and pulling the trigger, and other suicidal thoughts.  Thinking about cold metal of a gun against my skin is incredibly soothing.
