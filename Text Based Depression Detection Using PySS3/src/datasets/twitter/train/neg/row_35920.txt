I don't know where else to turn.I've been with my current SO for about six years now. They've been extremely depressed and frequently suicidal for as long as I can remember. I've literally lost count of how many times they've made attempts, or at least given it serious thought and talked about it in great detail. I've done everything I can to help, considering that we're long-distance. 


I encouraged them to make life changes that would put a stop to situations that were contributing to the depression. I helped them get into therapy. I reached out to get certain trustworthy members of their family and a local friend or two involved in the situation, trying to help them build a support network. They've been on countless different meds and have probably had around eight different therapists. They've been admitted to an inpatient mental facility more than once. The meds don't help, don't help enough, or cause other problems. The therapy apparently helps, but that doesn't change the fact that nothing's gotten better. 


It only seems to be getting worse. No matter how much the situation as a whole seems to have improved, the depressive spells are only getting more and more frequent, darker and more hurtful, triggered by smaller and smaller things or nothing at all. This is such a vicious, ugly cycle. I feel completely useless and defeated. I'd give anything for even the tiniest victory, or at least one single night where I can sleep with some kind of peace of mind.


Six years is a long time to fight a losing battle, and I've never gotten a single real indicator that this isn't one. 


No matter how hard I fight for them or what I try or how much I hope, we always end up back here. The good times mean everything to me, but they're so small and short-lived by comparison, so easily shattered.


I don't want to give up. 

I love them so much. I don't know what to do.
