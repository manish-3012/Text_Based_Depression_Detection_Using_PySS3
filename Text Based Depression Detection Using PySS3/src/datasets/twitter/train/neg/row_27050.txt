Not ok after thisA msg I recieved... much like all the rest before. It hurts so bad. This. This is normal. This is my every day. No one has compassion. My illnesses are my hardest challenge in life. My body is literally my greatest challenge. And then I have ppl say shit like this. Really makes me want to stop trying at all. Today was so traumatic. And that's not even in relation to this small message. I'm livid. One real friend please. Just 1. Just 1 real friend. Please. Just 1. Just a real ass. Not fake. Not judgmental. Not impatient. Just one good f*cking friend...... I have GOT to stop helping everyone. It isn't returned. F*ck this. I rly wanna bash my head into a wall til I bleed.

"I don't want to keep saying I'm sorry or that I wish I could help"

"there's nothing I can do to help you"

"I honestly think if you didn't put all of your focus into the pain it wouldn't be as bad"

^^^^ from someone I had a crush on. F*ck everything. Why. Why?!?! It was a great lesson. Trust no one and never speak your feelings or weaknesses.
