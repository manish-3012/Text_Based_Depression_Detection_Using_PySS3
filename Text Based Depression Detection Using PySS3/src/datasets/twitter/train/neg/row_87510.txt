Iâ€™m a mistake and I know I donâ€™t deserve to be hereI know Iâ€™m a mistake, my mum has said it to me multiple times, I know she meant it because she doesnâ€™t drink or smoke or do drugs, I barely see my dad and I live with my mum and her mum, I get yelled at for the most stupid shit, then whenever I say something about it they lose their shit even more, Iâ€™m so fucking over them, I canâ€™t go live with my dad because then I wouldnâ€™t be able to see my girlfriend, I feel like sheâ€™s all I have left going for me anymore, but even with her I still feel worthless sometimes, right now is one of them, Iâ€™m writing this while on the phone with her, she doesnâ€™t know I think, god I hope not, sheâ€™s away right now and I donâ€™t want her to worry about me, I donâ€™t want her or anyone to waste anymore of their time worrying about me, Iâ€™ve wasted enough people time and energy and money, Iâ€™ve wasted people, I am the biggest waste of space and oxygen and atoms and just everything, I donâ€™t know if I can keep doing this, it barely feels worth it anymore, I want my child happiness back, I miss being happy, I miss my girlfriend, I miss happiness rn, I feel like Iâ€™m losing it mind, like I could die at any second and no one would care, I feel like cutting deeper than normal but I have almost no way to hide it, I donâ€™t have any other outlets at the moment, it was music but itâ€™s to late and Iâ€™m in the phone, I had ranting to her about how I felt but Iâ€™m scared she is going to leave like my ex before her did, Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to scare her away or worry her, I hate worrying her and I hate worrying everyone, I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing all this, itâ€™s not like it matters to strangers Iâ€™m the internet
