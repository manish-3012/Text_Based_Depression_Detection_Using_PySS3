Ready to dieI have a husband and daughter...I know Im a shitbag if I kill myself but itâ€™s been so long... And things arenâ€™t going to get better anytime soon. I donâ€™t have that type of time left in me, Iâ€™m ready to clock out.

I donâ€™t want to hear hospital too. I go there for a week get a bill and cone out worse off than before. Talking to a doctor doesnâ€™t fix my problems. Just adds another bill. Going on disability just to move to a studio apt. is another bandaid. Problems. So many problems mixed with CPTSD. Being triggered nearly everyday. I canâ€™t live like this. Death is my only answer.
