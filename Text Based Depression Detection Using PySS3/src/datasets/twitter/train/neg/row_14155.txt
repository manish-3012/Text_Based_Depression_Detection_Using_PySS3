Knowing â€œwhyâ€ I feel the way I do, does not help.I donâ€™t get the idea that if weâ€™re introspective, and if we understand our feelings and where they come from, itâ€™ll all get better. I feel like shit. I know I feel like shit, and I know why I feel like shit. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything â€œwrongâ€ with my thinking here. Logically, feeling shitty and wanting to die is the correct response to how my life has turned out. 

I find it really hard to believe that thereâ€™s some other perspective on my life thatâ€™s going to change the fact that I feel like shit, and make everything okay. There are people in the world whose existence makes the world a worse place, and Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m one of them.
