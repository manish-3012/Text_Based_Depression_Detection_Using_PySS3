question about the suicide hotlineMy thoughts of suicide have been getting worse and I need to talk to someone but I've read about them calling the police when you mention suicide. I know this sounds ridiculous but I'm scared. I've spent an hour looking at the number in my phone but to scared to go through with it. I know that if I slip and say that I've tried before (in my Irrational reality) I could end up being put under watch somewhere. Honestly that scares me so much.

Am I wrong?
Have you called before?
If so, what was it like?
