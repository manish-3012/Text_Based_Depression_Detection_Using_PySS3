How do I talk to them about thisI'm not sure if i just have moodswings or something but im very suicidal right now, I want to tell my roommates but I'm worried it's kind of a "boy who cried wolf" situation because they've seen me like this before and maybe they won't take it seriously? I have no insurance ... barely enough money to survive. It's all my fault. Idk how to take out a loan im already in 80k medical debt anyway. I'm a 19 yr old teenage idiot with no family. My roommates are my only friends, really
