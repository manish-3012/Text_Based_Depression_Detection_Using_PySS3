How would I do it?Hello, this is a throwaway account and I want to commit die but my options are running out. I do not have access to a gun, pills, I don't want to hurt anyone like gassing myself in my house, I doubt cutting myself like they do in the movies would work and I don't have any tall places to jump off of(my preferred method). My main plan was to ditch school and drive somewhere and jump(I had it all planned out and everything) but I recently got into a car accident so that ain't gonna work out(it was a 7 hour drive). I was supposed to get a new car but my report card came in and 4 F's didn't exactly make my parents happy, so that's also a no. 

I live in the Riverside County(Jurupa Valley) in Southern California which is essentially the middle of fucking nowhere(nowhere to jump from either) and I'm not sure how to kill myself. It can't possibly be that difficult can it? Humans are so delicate yet I can't seem to find a way to do it.

Please help me. This is literally my only option. I'm 17 btw and as you could imagine this makes it only a million times more difficult because I have so many restrictions, can't even ride the public bus like wtf. As of right now, my plan is to find and tie something heavy to my neck and push it into water to stop myself from bringing my head up but that's not very painless like jumping cause that would be more of an instant death(or a lot of pain but I don't think I would even live long enough to really feel it). The only other thing I can think of is getting some kind of gay app and *persuading* men to help me out. Thanks for reading this super long and boring post.

**Telling me not to kill myself is not a solution and kinda a waste of time, thank you very much.**
