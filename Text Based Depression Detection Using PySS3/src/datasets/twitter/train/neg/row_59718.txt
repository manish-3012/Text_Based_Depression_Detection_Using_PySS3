Toxic familyLiving in a house of narcissists and manipulative people is absolutely the worst thing ever. Literally want to die 24/7.

Got shouted at for no real reason and kept my cool but then got pushed to be angry and pushed to my worst just to watch my brother smile and turn it all around and act like I'm the bad guy. And of course my mother picks up for him and says I'm overreacting.
