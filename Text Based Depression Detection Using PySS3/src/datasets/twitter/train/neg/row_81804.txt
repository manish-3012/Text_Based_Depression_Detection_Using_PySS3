What is my life...Hi.

I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. I'm just gonna get straight into it. I am 18 years old, and I have no true friends. All the people that claim to be so-called friends are a bunch of fucking fakes. They totally ignore me at gatherings and only ever get in contact when they wanna brag about something or they want something of mine. For example, some fucker rang me to brag that he got with some girl at his formal and hooked up for the night. Yet, he knows I am depressed because I have never been in a relationship, never kissed or fucked. For me, that was torture. Another example is that a 'best friend who would do anything to help me' never contacts me for months and then swings me a huge suck-up message because he wants to borrow my Walking Dead DVD set. I don't want to move because my family is here, I have the best job ever and earning tons, but I hate everyone here and I hate myself the most. I am 18, just out of High School, prom was a disaster, after party was worse, I am suicidal, depression and anxiety, a lot of people know and don't give a SHIT. I have never really wronged anyone... all I do is give and give and give and all I expect is a little... I don't know... happiness? Still a virgin, yet everyone around me is getting into relationships, getting invited to parties, getting intimate and here I am, lonely, wishing I was aborted. I try to make efforts, but always get fucked over in the end.

I don't know what to do anymore, and I am almost ready to give myself up. I'm just a lonely degenerate and I hate everyone.
