Not sure if this is the right place to post this.For quite a while i have been in quite a weird spot with suicide. It has been on my mind as an option for a couple of years now, but i am so scared of two things involved. I am terrified about the horror of it not working and living the rest of my life with a disability due to it, and i am also terrified of the pain of the act. Despite the fact that i haven't done the act, my life is absolute crap and i can't see it ever getting better. What am i supposed to do in this situation? Am i a pussy for not being able to kill myself despite not really seeing another way to live my life.
