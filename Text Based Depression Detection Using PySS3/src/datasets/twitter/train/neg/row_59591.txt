I relate to this heavilyI used to have this idea that graduating from HS and getting into college would change everything and I could move in with my boyfriend and have a good life... but my grades in my community college classes are slipping and I wont get the degree I want and be able to graduate from college with all my friends. All I want in this world is to have a good life but it feels like things are relentlessly falling apart. I dont actively want to kill myself but sometimes I just want to stop existing for a little.
