Why the FUCK am i like this.Im a stupid ass person but tl;dr I am attention seeking and am trying to find something wrong with me (liek trying to be depressed and somehow convincing myself I deserve it). I was feeling better and Iâ€™ve been clean for a month or two but when my mind gets overwhelmed, like a sudden wave of thoughts (they can be both happy and depressing) my left arm quivers. Like itâ€™s a rapid shaking that just happens and sometimes itâ€™s a full body shake. Iâ€™m like 100% sure that itâ€™s jsut me trying to give more attention to myself by faking this quiver and I hate it. I want to die bc I deserve it. I have the perfect life (a loving family, rich, doing well in studies, loving friends, no abuse in my family, safe neighborhood). I do feel rlly happy sometimes and I donâ€™t fucking deserve it. I deserve to shoot myself and die because I havenâ€™t done anything that helps others (I may be successful but thatâ€™s out of everyone elseâ€™s hard work not mine and it doesnâ€™t even benefit them) and yet Iâ€™m getting all these luxuries. My parents are spending so much money on me and when I think about, they get nothing in return. Not only that, but I act like a spoiled brat and i cause them so much pain. I donâ€™t deserve to live and Iâ€™m too weak to kill myself. I hear that ppl with depression canâ€™t even fathom looking forward to waking up but Iâ€™m out here excited for the morning to eat a great breakfast. I just fucking deserve to die so much. Iâ€™m such a disappointment fuck fuck fuck
