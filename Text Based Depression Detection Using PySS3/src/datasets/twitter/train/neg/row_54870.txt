Want to dieHi. Idk if this goes here. I dont care if this goes here or not. Im having a shit run at life. I want to be done. At every, "things cant get worse" moment, things have gotten worse. No friends. Cps took kids. Homless. Not a drug user,  never abused my children.  Just 1 person from my past trying to destroy me for no apparent reason,  and winning.  On antidepressants,  just increased them too. Still. Life is shit and people suck.
