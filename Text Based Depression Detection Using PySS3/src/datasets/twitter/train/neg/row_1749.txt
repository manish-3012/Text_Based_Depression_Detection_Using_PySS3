Planning to suicide by the ocean so I can hear the waves one last time before I leave foreverOn the beach alone at night is exactly how I wanted it , I hope the moon and stars are shining and itâ€™s warm out . I will write a good bye letter to my parents and brother. I hope they know it wasnâ€™t their fault and that I will be at peace and that death with bring me joy because it will mean the end of suffering for me
