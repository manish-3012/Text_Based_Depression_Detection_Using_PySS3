Only special to my momI wish someone other than my mom found me special. I day dream all day about being a professional athlete because I know thatâ€™s the only way Iâ€™d be loved. Some people can just be themselves and people like them and Iâ€™m jealous of it. I just donâ€™t fit in so I want an out. I lay in bed all day just waiting for time to pass so I can then go to work so I can just come back home and lay in bed all day again. I feel like a slave that only lives to work. I have work in a few hours but maybe I should just no show and end it. I wonder if they would miss me at work or if I would just be replaced.
