Everyday I think about whether I'll kill myself, and I feel like I'm getting closer to doing so [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fv6h5x/i\_need\_a\_plan\_to\_run\_away\_as\_soon\_as\_covid19\_ends/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fv6h5x/i_need_a_plan_to_run_away_as_soon_as_covid19_ends/) for context, only if you want to jump down the rabbit hole that is my life, I'll summarize, but there's more detail in my older posts, and sorry if this just feels like repeat.  
Im 12 btw  


I just feel like I'm my family's punching bag, they scream and yell all the time and expect me to just keep a smile on my face, they say how my feelings and my situation don't matter and tell me to just deal with it, when I'm not smiling around them, my dad will scream and yell at me, try to cause problems with me, and implement unnecessary restrictions (such as making me and my sisters talk for an hour straight each day, at 9:30, when we ussually go to bed, he stopped this though), and then use the excuse "oh I'm just human so I can get mad like that" or "it just brings the whole mood of the house down"  
It's become even worse since my stepmom came back, because now my dad just lets her scream and yell at us because "she only means well", he mindlessly agrees with her whenever she says my problems don't matter.  
My sisters are generally loud all the time, and whenever they see that I'm even slightly annoyed or just not happy, they repeatedly say hi to me almost every 5 minutes just to get a reaction out of me.  
And overall, no one cares anymore.
