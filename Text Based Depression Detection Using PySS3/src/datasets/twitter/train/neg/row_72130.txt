How can I stop thinking about it?I don't generally have a trigger, nothing dramatic, just because everything sucks and pressure from uni is too much and thought it would just be easier if I killed myself. I've been trying to get help, saw a counsellor and called the suicide hotline today, but nothing seems to work and the more I talk about the issues the more I want to do it. I have loads of work to do but I can't get started. I got back from counselling 3 hours ago and now I'm in the library going through the ways I could end my life. I know this isn't the right choice but it feels like the only choice now for me. If anyone could, like share some uplifting or lovely stories I would really appreciate it, at least if I did do it I would leave with some happiness.
