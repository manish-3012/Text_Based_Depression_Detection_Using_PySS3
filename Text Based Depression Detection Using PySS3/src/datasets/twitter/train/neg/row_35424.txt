Think about dying but wouldnt consider suicideI dont really know how to explain this but most of the time i feel very isolated, lost and overwhelmed by the world and everything and i feel as if i have very little control of anything and these train of thoughts always lead to thoughts of death. Now ive felt this way for a couple of years now but still would not consider actually committing suicide as the impact on others would be too large to imagine and in all honesty i dont feel i have any reason to feel this way and feel there are others who legitimately have a reason to feel this way and this just leads me to hate myself more and feel more guilty and selfish. Recently these feelings have been getting worse and worse and more prominent and im just wondering if anyone else feels like this and if so what did/do you do about it as i dont want to feel this way anymore and it scares me a little. Please forgive me if this is rambling or unclear but as i said i feel i am very overwhelmed by everything and i have a tendency to over analyse things and this is part of the problem but because of this i find it very hard to explain how i feel easily as there are so many thoughts that can lead to over things and its very hard to collect it all into something that i can explain easily. Apologies
