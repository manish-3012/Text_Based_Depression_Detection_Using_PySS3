i just want to stopthere's no way i know of that i would be able to take my own life, but i wish so much that i could just stop existing. i can't even get out of this chair though. i can't bring myself to go to bed or watch tv or play games. what's the point? i might as well waste my life doing nothing until i die. i used to try to be productive, but no one cares about anything i do. i could only do so much for myself. i want someone to care. just one person. just some company. but i can't get out of this and no one wants anything to do with me like this. i want to not exist. i can't do this anymore.
