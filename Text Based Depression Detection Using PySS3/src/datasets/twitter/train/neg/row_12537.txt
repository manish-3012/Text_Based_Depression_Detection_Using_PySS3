so someone knows..id like their to be a record of myself, i am alone, and i do not know anyone where i live, i have been seeing someone for 2 years nd recently confirmed she is seeing someone else .
i tried some therapeutic * gfy* kinda stuff but to be honest ima 40 year old man that hasn't stopped crying like a child , it is a week today.

 i tried here http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/h9syd/dear_reddit_pls_help/

 but i dont think anyone took me seriously at all.
i am hurting, i am embarrassed but most of all ( and i do not know if this makes any sense) but i am tired, exhausted actually, my mental state has plummeted in the last week.

im not an attn seeker  , i am actually quite the opposite, but she was * the one * and i  got totally blindsided.
i have tried, i ever feel guilty for posting this , i can no longer function under reality, i no long WANT to, i have lost the meaning, and the desire...farewell people i know this int important to you, but for me , its my world that  has crumbled, i miss her so.. i cant live this way...
lotssa hearts people
don't ever let someone get so far into you that you cant live without them, it turned out ugly for me, and its simply not the way human being should be treated


PS it wouldn't even matter anyways because in a couple of days they will have cut my net ( my only lifeline to the outside world), because she has been milking the accounts without my knowledge and i cant even pay that bill let alone have a meal.

thank you for listening, her name is jenni, i miss you jen, and i love you enough to do this so i can leave you to move on without having me in the way, this is my final gesture to show you how much you mean to me.
