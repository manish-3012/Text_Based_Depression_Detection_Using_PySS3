Mothers day is way to hardI have no one else to reach out to, Ive tried my family but they are too dysfunctional, and Ive tried my friends but they simply do not understand. No one has been able to be there for me.... I lost my mom about 10 years ago, due to a heart attack. I have no one to talk to, so I have kept the pain bottled up for years....
    This years mothers day has been really rough as all my friends are out doing something nice for their mums, and being vocal about it. I have kept my head up for 10 years, but it has always haunted me, and I think its coming to a head. I have always been "depressed", diagnosed by shirks ect, but have found outlets in playing music and in drugs and alcohol. However this years Mothers Day had been really hard on me for some reason.
     I miss her so much, she was a lil crazy, but she was my rock, she was the only person in my life who gave a shit. I don't have anyone now who gives a shit....I have no one else to reach out too. I have thought about ending it all, and being done with life, but every time I bring the blade to my skin I chicken out. I dont keep guns in my house because if I had one, Id pull the trigger. The last time I held a pistol in my hand (it was my friends new gun and he was showing it off) I put it to my head and pulled the trigger, luckily it was unloaded, and my buddies wife saw me, and took it away from me...
     I have no one to talk to... Has anyone else lost a parent and does anyone else feel this way? What can I do to get over it and move on? I really need somebody to talk to.... Thank you for reading
