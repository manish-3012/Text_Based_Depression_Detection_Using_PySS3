Everything worth living for is overMy goals this year were to live to Halloween and get through soccer season. My soccer season just ended, Halloween is almost here, I lost all my friends, my family doesn't support me, I'm in the wrong body, I can't cut, everything has gotten worse, school sucks, and I've been hospitalized 3 times just this year, and it isn't even over yet. I'm so sick and tired of losing the people most important to me, getting help that doesn't even work, and hearing people tell me I can't because it'd hurt them. WHAT ABOUT ME?? I'm the one in pain and you know what I don't even wanna die but I haven't felt alive in my entire life and by the time I do my youth will be gone. Fuck it all I don't even wanna be here anymore.
