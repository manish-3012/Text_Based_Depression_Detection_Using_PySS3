I hope I died when I was 2Every time something inconvenient happened to me, I always thought â€œI hope I didnâ€™t survive when I almost die when I was 2.â€ I always tell that to my mom whenever we have an argument and I always feel like my familyâ€™s not supportive enough. Iâ€™ve been a good child ever since, to be honest I would even compare myself with the children of my momâ€™s friends. For the past 3 years, I always tell myself that Iâ€™m ready to die, I just donâ€™t know which method is the best. I even know where my dadâ€™s gun is. I know pills wonâ€™t work, hanging would be too painful and my uncle already did that. If I want a way out, I want to make sure itâ€™s already over and no second chances. I even have thought now that maybe I can die of Covid. Iâ€™m jealous of those who are dead already. My thoughts right now is â€œWhy do people who doesnâ€™t deserve to die, die and those who want to, live?â€
