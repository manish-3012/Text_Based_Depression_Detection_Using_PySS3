I just want to stop hurting myselfI'm constantly hitting my head against things, I always have scars or scabs on my head. I feel so alone everyday. If I see a couple or something that reminds me of relationship I start punching myself in the face. The pain never goes away and feels like it's eating me alive. I don't know how to cope with this, I can't cope with it. It feels like no one cares and I'm coward because I can't bring myself to end it. I'm always going to alone so I dont see a reason to keep on living
