I wish i could say goodbye.Hi, my name's Lucy, i'm a trans girl, i should've started hormones soon, i don't think i'll be here by then. I lost the most important person in my life because of me, i honestly feel like a mistake that's worth erasing. My anxiety has gotten so bad i can't even leave the house anyways, i'm not missing out on anything. I thought that i could not take my life, but as time passes, it feels more and more possible. I hope no one that knows me reads this post, and if by any chance that happens, please ignore this. I don't know when and if i'll do it, but it feels like a real solution right now. Goodnight.
