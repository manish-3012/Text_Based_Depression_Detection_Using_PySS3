I want to end my life so badI see all my friends and family constantly advancing and progressing towards new goals and Iâ€™m still stuck in a pathetic hole. Iâ€™ve dropped out of college after one semester because I was too depressed to continue going on, Iâ€™ve failed to realize my potential after my depression caused me to miss many days of high school. Iâ€™m so lonely and I canâ€™t confide none of my thoughts to anyone because they wouldnâ€™t get it or theyâ€™d tell me I just need to get over it, i donâ€™t blame them for not understanding . I havenâ€™t been in a romantic relationship for around 5 years ever since she cheated on me and I donâ€™t blame her whatsoever it was my fault since I wasnâ€™t good enough
