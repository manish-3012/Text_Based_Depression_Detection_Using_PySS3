Iâ€™ll see you guys next yearMaybe in another life we all will live together. Maybe when we die we can finally find each other. Truly and know each other. Maybe we can make our own world. Maybe we can finally be free from our minds. Our minds that never allow us to live our lives. This is what I pray everyday will happen. So there is a reason, just so there is a reason for all of it. And if this is true. My life will be complete. My life will have meaning. My beliefs will be vindicated. This is the only way I could ever be. This is the only thing in the world I believe to be true.
