I still recall how my ex yelled at me over the phone when I wanted to take my own life. I donâ€™t know how to recover from this...[The Full Story ](https://www.quora.com/What-are-10-things-you-regret-doing-in-your-life/answer/Zaid-Rudy-1?ch=10&amp;share=38a93f2f&amp;srid=hffHZ)

Tldr: I moved countries to be closer to my now ex girlfriend. After only just moving she became increasingly abusive and she broke up with me. 

I was all alone in a foreign country. She left in such a hurry and I was completely shattered. I tried taking my own life and she called me over the phone only to yell at me saying, â€˜why are you telling me thisâ€™? 

Iâ€™ve never heard from her since. She doesnâ€™t know that after I returned home, I faced having PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder. Every day is a struggle.
