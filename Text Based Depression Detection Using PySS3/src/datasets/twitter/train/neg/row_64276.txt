Am i being hypocritical or selfish?even though i am still somewhat suicidal i still find it my duty to help those posting on here and try to not let them end themselves.I don't think about it while posting but then after the fact i get a tiny feeling of "why am i doing this if i'm doing it my self?"you know .And no i would like to actually know why
