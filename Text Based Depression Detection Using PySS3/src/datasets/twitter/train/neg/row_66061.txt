The futureHey guys I'm a 17m and I'm really not looking forward to the future. I recently started my first job (a kitchen assistant) and this has made me realise how bleak the future is. I have anxiety and depression (both of which run in my family) I believe that I'm starting to get arthritis, which also runs in my family, and also have heart disease to look forward to, which surprise also runs in the family (everyone on my fathers side has died from it). Pressures from school and work have left me with little enjoyment of life and am just wondering what's the point of living if the future looks so dark and gloomy. My mum is the only person in my life that I love, I have friends but they all have people they prefer over me. I have no clue what I want to do when I'm older. Any help would me much appreciated, thank you
