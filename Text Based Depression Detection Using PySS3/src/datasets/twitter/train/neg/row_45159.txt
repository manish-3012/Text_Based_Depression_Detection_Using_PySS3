Planned or spontaneous?I have this very thought-out plan of how I'm going to kill myself, perfected over years of wanting to die (And after failing a suicide attempt because I hadn't planned it properly). Like, I've decided more or less who I'm going to tell before I kill myself, who gets a letter, what's gonna happen to my things, etc etc. 

But sometimes, like now, I feel like I just want to say "fuck the plans" and just die. Without telling anyone and without doing all the stuff I've planned. I only really have two people in my life that really cares about me and loves me though, my mom and one friend, and I'm *obviously* gonna write letters to the two of them no matter what. But ex gfs, former friends, people I've met online, it just seems like a chore. I'm all alone and worthless. Nobody would *really* care if I died (other than my mom, of course), so if I don't tell anyone, they won't know and I'll just slowly fade away from their memory, and they'll forget me. I think that's less traumatic than hearing that I'm killing myself. To them, I will just have disappeared. Maybe that's the best solution. Idk. Fuck it.
