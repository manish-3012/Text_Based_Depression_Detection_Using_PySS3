Feeling more and more desperate...I have severe manic depression, the extent of which most people around me never truly realize. People tell me to chill, to deal with it, make my concerns out to be nothing, and that hurts almost as much as the depression itself. Lately, it has been spiraling downward, becoming worse and worse with each passing day. I fall further down, and it takes more and more effort to be okay again, to just get to some vague semblance of neutrality. I've had manic episodes, but they're so very rare, now. I'm miserable every day, crying my eyes out to silence. It feels as though there is an army surrounding me, attacking me, and there isn't an end in sight. With each enemy I take down, a hundred more take its place. I'm growing so very tired. I can't fight much longer, if at all. It has gotten to the point where I just want to stop. In my relationships, it feels as though all the problems are caused by me. I truly feel those around me would be better off without me. I gave my knives to my girlfriend, but I never really thought I'd use them. I'm more likely to take every pill in the house, or lock myself in the garage with the car running. I don't like pain. But I don't want to live anymore. I want to stop fighting, to lay down and give in, let it end. I am so weary of fighting. I need help, and I don't know where else to turn.
