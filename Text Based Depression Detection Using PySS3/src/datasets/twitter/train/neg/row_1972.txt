I need help please 16 yr old maleSo basically I have depression and suicidal thoughts.. What happened is that during P.E someone somehow went through my backpack and stole my phone which made me upset. Than when I told my parents they were upset and I came out of nowhere and yelled so fucking much and sobbed, I threw a offiice chair to the wall and somehow when I threw the chair it hit my mom from behind somehow which made her bleed. This is the most terrifying situation for me since it wasn't that much blood, she was crying and saying to me WHERE DO YOU LEARN THIS ATTITUDE ANGER FROM!, she was sobbing and crying and I told her I said I was very sorry I cried on the table so much...
