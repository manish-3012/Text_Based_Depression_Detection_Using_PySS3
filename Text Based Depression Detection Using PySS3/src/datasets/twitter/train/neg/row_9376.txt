Loneliness is killing meso i want to speak to people and fit in but i cant, everytime i go out my brain reminds me of how different and stupid i look. i cant find other way to express how i feel when im in class other than sort of thinking of myself in 3rd person, like watching yourself from behind. everything i do is calculated and i cant fucking concentrate on other things, i think about every muscle i move and everything i do, from fidgeting to moving my feet. i took xanax the other day and it helped me a lil but not much, i still could feel the anxiety. plus, everyone is the fucking same and does the same, if i dont connect with anyone the next person is the same, so i guess im fucked. im worthless. well i guess im the laughing stock of society, atleast i can do that shit
