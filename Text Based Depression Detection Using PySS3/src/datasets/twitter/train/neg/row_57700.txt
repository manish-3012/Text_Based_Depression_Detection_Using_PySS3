So I'm fucking doneI was in a psych ward for a fucking month getting help for a really bad suicide attempt. My fiancÃ©e was by my side and so supportive. Visited me every day. And when she couldn't she called me. I come back and when I get home I walk into the bedroom and SHE'S FUCKING ANOTHER GUY. I am SO fucking done with this world. She was supposed to be the one supporting me and I Ubered home so I could surprise her with the early discharge. And she's fucking another guy. She looks me dead in the eye and tells me it's not what it looks like. I'm really THAT fucking bad. I'm going to lay on the fucking train tracks in about 30 minutes. I was doing so well and she fucked me over like that. I am sooooo done. I grabbed a fifth of whiskey out of the fridge and chugged it down, flicked her off and walked out. Fucking bitch didn't even try to come after me. I'm so fucking done with this planet. The world is shit guys. I hope you guys never have to deal with this. Lesson learned. If attempting suicide, don't fucking fail. Because it just gets worse and worse. Just when ya think you've had the worst of it, you get hit by a fucking semi truck. Goodbye my friends. I hope you guys find peace and don't have to resort to this. Too late for me, but not for you.
