I've lost everything and don't know where else to turn..3 days ago everything was fine me and my girlfriend of 2 years were just talking as she was getting ready to go pick up our 3 month old son, she left the house to come back with him soon. I laid down and took a bit of a nap, but I woke up suddenly in a panic. I felt so,etching was wrong so I tried to call her, no answer, I tried to text no answer I called her parents house, they told me she wasn't there. I started franking out at this point I didn't know what was going on if they were ok or not. So I was sitting at home still waiting for something, anything, when I hear knocks at my door so I ran upstairs and couldn't see anyone there. I asked who is it and they replied it was the police...and I was coming with them. I opened my door and went with them and they told me I was being charged with assualt and uttering death threats..and that she fears for the baby's safety.. I didn't know what to think so I just didn't say anything other than I understood my rights. They put me in a cell and tell me that she is at the place cleaning out all of her stuff. I didn't really believe it because why would she do this I thought.the night ends finally with me posting a bail and walking back home. I get here and we'll all of her stuff and the babies stuff is gone..this was all out of the blue we were fine and then this all happened. I am not allowed to contact her or go near her families place but I have tried to call multiple times because I just don't understand how she could do this not even to me, but to our little boy. I have a lawyer appointment set for Wednsday, but all I want is to Se the baby and as sad as it is I still want to be with this girl..this girl that just put me through hell and the more to come I'm scared for myself but I am more scared for my child I just don't know what to do, I feel like my only choice is suicide at this point but I really want to Se my baby so bad I just don't know...
