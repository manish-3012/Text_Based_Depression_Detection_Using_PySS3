support a 13 year oldhi guys, you don't have to read this, but I just want to say that lifes just hard, you know? For me, losing a young and VERY close cousin at 12, losing my best friend 1 week ago, 2 days after my birthday, being depressed for what? 5 months? It's hard. I've seen my mom cry because she found out I was self harming, having extreme social anxiety, to the point that I can't even join my friends Ps4 parties. Life just sucks, is what i'm trying to say. My only escape is obviously.. games, but my family doesn't understand. I'm not trying to rant, but can i just have support right now? Please?
