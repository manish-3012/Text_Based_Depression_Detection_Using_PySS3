I want to end itToday I attempted to hang myself. while I was doing it I felt like I was fading about to pass out or something but for some reason something stopped me. Now I have marks around my neck and I want to end it I tried again but I just canâ€™t go through with it. Iâ€™m only 19 and Iâ€™m so tired of life itâ€™s to the point where I just want to kill my self everyday I wake up I sleep with my blades so I cut myself when I feel bad I was clean of self harm for a month then I gave up on it. I just want  to be happy and have friends and a girl to take care of me like Iâ€™m not in a good place right now. I just want to be held so tight and loved. I donâ€™t think many people would miss me even if I died today. I pray that Iâ€™ll get through it but it doesnâ€™t seem to even make a difference. Iâ€™m sorry for ranting but I have no friends or anyone else to tell this to
