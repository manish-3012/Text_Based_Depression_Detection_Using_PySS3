I have no close friendships and itâ€™s driving me insane. I want to scream.I donâ€™t feel like I belong on this planet - I know it sounds cliche but I really mean it. I feel like Iâ€™m here physically but mentally Iâ€™m somewhere else.

Iâ€™ve always found it difficult to connect with other people. Itâ€™s like no matter what I do, Iâ€™m never good enough. Iâ€™m always the last choice. I guess Iâ€™m just socially incapable of having and keeping friends. 

And the thing is, itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t want friends - I just donâ€™t have any deep friendships. I want to have a deep connection with people but it just seems like they donâ€™t want that with me.

I see other people around my age having the time of their lives with their friend groups while Iâ€™m constantly asking myself whatâ€™s wrong with me? Why canâ€™t I have that?

The thing is, whatâ€™s the point of living a life where you canâ€™t have deep connections with people? 

Iâ€™m 19 and should be having the time of my life, but this? This is lonely.

Is a life like this really worth living?
