Lost sight of myself, the people I once cared about and still don't know exactly what I want (or need)Hey all, I can't really recall if I've posted here before, but I certainly feel like a regular visitor. I'm not sure where to start. My manner of explaining my feelings and thoughts is generally disorganized and incoherent at times, but I'll try my best here. I've suffered from depression and anxiety since the age of 11. I believe that a combination of antidepressants and a series of bad experiences have rendered me numb to the world around me. At first, I could hardly bear the mental anguish, but now I've reached something far worse: complacency. I sincerely believe there is little hope for me to improve myself (and I've almost accepted this). I hardly put myself out there, let alone trust people. I've turned to seeking validation, primarily through my academic achievements (graduating top of my university class, working at a great hospital, etc.).. anything to distract myself from my monotonous life. The reality of the matter is that without seeking out this validation, I'm left in a cycle of endless rumination and wondering what life could have been (will I ever achieve these ideals my mind has created?). The thought of not feeling even remotely important in this world is horrifying to me. Without my achievements, I'm a mess of a human being with a limited capacity to truly empathize with or reciprocate gestures of kindness with others. I convinced myself it's alright to fail others because others have failed me. I've burned too many bridges and missed some amazing opportunities because I was afraid to confront my fears and start anew. I feel it's getting too late now... I've lived 26 years (almost 27 now) on this Earth and I've spent the better part of them failing to understand my purpose here. I don't deserve the life I have.
