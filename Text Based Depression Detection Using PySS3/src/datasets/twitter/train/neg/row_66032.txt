I hate school so muchThe thought of taking exams is triggering suicidal thoughts. I seriously hate exams so much. You can do good on everything else but if you do bad on exams, your grades are completely fucked. I get really angry and irritated with myself when I try to study. I just really want to give up and swerve my car into a tree or something. Maybe drive off a bridge. Thereâ€™s absolutely no future for me. Might as well kill myself to prevent any further failures from happening
