I think I'm finally readyHello,


I've just kinda accepted it at this point. Everyone says I'm smart and shit but I'm really just dumb as fuck. I keep forgetting my anti depressants and ran out about 2 days ago. I finally let go of someone I've been hanging on to for for way way too long and I think I'm just really ready to go. No real reason why I need to stay. I slack off, I'm non productive I mean fuck I try and keep myself as secret as possible so no one can truly get close to me and leave again. I work in some shit hole call center that I fuckin hate. I hate talking to people. I hate the lack of challenge..I'm just done. At this point, I don't even care about my health anymore. I'll just let myself die or do triple the speed limit down the highway I don't fucking know anymore. I'm just tired of this life. I'm tired of being in debt. I'm tired of being picked on at home. I'm tired of just having to get up everyday. I'm done. I'm just done.


And if your reading this K and I'm gone or whatever, it's not your fault and I didn't call you because I don't want to bother you anymore than I have to


Thanks for listening, I won't be able to respond because I'm at work. I'm just on my lunch, crying and hoping that pain will just stop.
