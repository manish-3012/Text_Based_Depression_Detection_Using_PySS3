There just isn't any hope leftMy moods are intense and I can't trust them. I'm 3 months late on rent. My relationship is slowly turning to shit because of my brain. I pushed away all my friends. I stopped exercising. Just going to stop eating and waste away in this bed. Life is pointless for people like me. I'm done trying anymore. Just going to go back to cutting and hope that I die.
