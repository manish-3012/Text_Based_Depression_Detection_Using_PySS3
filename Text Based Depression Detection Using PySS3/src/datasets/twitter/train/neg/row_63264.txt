Iâ€™m so lonely and tired with life and I just want help.Iâ€™m only still alive because of stupid shit I promise myself I will do, but I donâ€™t know if I can keep it up anymore. I donâ€™t want to die, but I donâ€™t want to live. I wish I could disappear. Iâ€™m still in high school. I just want a real reason to stay alive because Iâ€™m so scared of dying. I just feel like I have no other choice. Idk. Itâ€™s hard to explain. Iâ€™m going to bed now, please give me some sort of reason to live. Thanks. If I get responses Iâ€™ll read them tomorrow.
