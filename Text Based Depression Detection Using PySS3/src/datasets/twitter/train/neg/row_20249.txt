I'm worse than scum...(On Mobile please forgive formatting)

Recently I have come to realize I'm the problem.
I had an argument with a friend less than a week ago about something honestly stupid. When I brought up the fact the way she came at me about it was hurtful it just didnt matter. I couldn't understand why at the time.
But I realized I'm too sensitive. I always knew I was a highly sensitive person, but I always thought I handled it well, all things considered. But I was wrong.
It was pointed out to me that if I do something wrong, my feelings are a big part of why I did the wrong thing, and that it's even more wrong of me to let my feelings do that.
I work so hard to make everyone around me happy. I put my own feelings aside so I can help others. Until I cant anymore and my feelings unload on the closest person. I can go from helping that person with their problems one second and then unloading my own onto them and completely failing at helping them.
I'm a crappy friend for letting that happen. I work so hard to help them because I dont want to lose them, and then I turn around and have meltdowns. Whether the meltdowns be tears or anger it doesn't matter, it's all burdensome for them. I try to stop. I see myself losing it and I cant stand to even be around myself but as much as I want it to stop I cant make it stop.
I feel like a monster, the way my emotions take hold of me. This entire week I've been hit time and time again with the most intense feelings of self-hatred and loneliness I've felt for years. I haven't felt this way since my time in a crisis unit.
I cant live like this anymore. I just want to be able to have friends who care about me and forgive me when I make mistakes. But I cant have it. I dont think I was ever meant to. 
As much as I want to die, I dont want to kill myself. But it's been in the very front of my mind all week. Please, I just need someone to talk to. Anyone willing to offer a listening ear.
