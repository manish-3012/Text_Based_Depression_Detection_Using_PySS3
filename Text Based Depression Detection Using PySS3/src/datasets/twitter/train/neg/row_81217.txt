need some adviceSo i'll keep things as simple as i can. Basically i've been struggling with suicidal thoughts and severe anxiety bc i decided to go cold turkey on several anti depressants last december. Got me on rehab for a month cause i tried to hang myself due to isolation and my mind going whack but was too much of a puss to follow through. To be honest, i've experienced enough damaging moments in the past year to the point i cant feel a single drop of emotion towards anyone including family and friends. It feels im watching this movie play out in front of me and i'm not a part of it.     i also grew up with undiagnosed adhd that eventually led to low self steem and pushing everyone away . 
My brain conjured up this silly idea to cope  with this,  i told myself  i was this 'badass' movie character that gave zero fucksand  now ive ended up with my sorry ass dropping out of uni twice and an addiction to adrenaline in general( bought me a bike last year and raced till my hearts content, real life weighed down on me when i crashed it, did a lot of drugs)
Long story short, my brain is telling me to pull the plug again. Feel like a fuck up despite all the love i've been givenCurrently unemployed but whatever is left of my spirit and drive tells me ive got a chance at life(loving parents) i think something's snapped up there cause i can barely recognise myself in the mirror. I just realised writing here has lifted some of that weight and maybe i should've posted in r/depression
If anyone relates i'd love to hear some words if wisdom

Ps. Never intended this to sound like a yo i wanna live on the other side kind of letter
