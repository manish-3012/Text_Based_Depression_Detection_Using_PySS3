My life is meaningless.I always lived life to be happy and be a good decent person, but the more I lived life the more I believe that my looks and body are more important than anything else, even if the most in what the world can offer and I have, itâ€™s not enough to gain other eyes and sympathy.

Living life as an ugly person everyone treat you like shit forever, cause itâ€™s how people correlate someone personality, itâ€™s a type of stigma thinking the uglier the face the uglier the personality.

Itâ€™s hard knowing that the only person to blame is me, my body and I canâ€™t do anything about it.

Iâ€™m 20 and I know I will repeat my high school again, even though I canâ€™t do anything the finals are in 1 week and I havenâ€™t studied a word.

Iâ€™m depressed and paranoid of other people, I want to know if their any hope to change my life around and be anything meaningful.
