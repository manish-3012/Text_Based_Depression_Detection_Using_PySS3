Can't function anymore. Depression and anxiety have taken over my life.I'm not okay. I don't have any support. I thought my boyfriend was, but no- he's just another person who leaves the second things get hard and tells me there are people who have been through worse so my pain is invalidated. I'm tired of life and the second I told a suicide hotline that I have a restraining order against my abusive mother, the responder went on a rant about ungrateful entitled children. I told her I was suicidal and she acidly wondered what I had to be suicidal about.

I thought I was trudging through life all right until these past couple months. I am NOT OK. I am sick of people saying "oh, you look perfectly fine" or that I need to reconcile with the mother who tried to kill me since I was a child and nearly succeeded many times. I'm sick of people treating me like trash and avoiding me once they learn what my mother was really like. I'm sick of trying to make things work in life when no one cares or would notice if I disappeared, and justifying the pain I feel. I'm sick of not being able to enjoy anything or the dread of waking up to yet another day.

I'm sorry this is long. I am frustrated, exhausted, and I would be happy to die.
