I may kill my self if there is a technology pretending Iâ€™m still alive to my parentsThe only thing that prevents me from suicide is my parents. They are old, no longer healthy. And I donâ€™t think they can live with the fact that I kill myself. We live in different countries, 10+ hours flight; so every now and often we will message each other or video chat. Unfortunately, I donâ€™t know much about artificial intelligence. Otherwise I might study hard to build such robot to talk with my parents as me; video chat if necessary. Just use all kinds of excuses that I cannot go back home but everything on my side is wonderful. Or if the robot technology is mature enough, it can go back to my home country to help my parents to a better retirement life.


That technology probably wonâ€™t be real in a near future. So I will live on. For my parents. Itâ€™s a burden on me, but donâ€™t worry, I will live for my parents.

It is so hard right now. Sometimes I really want to drop everything and fly back home, but due to this Covid 19 it seems impossible and I certainly donâ€™t want my parents get affected because of me.

Just some rant. I hope my love for my parents last long enough so I wonâ€™t die before them.
