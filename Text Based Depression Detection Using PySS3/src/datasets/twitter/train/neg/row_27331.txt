Considering the Hospital AgainI've stayed in the hospital lots of times for suicidal thoughts and behaviors before. But this time it's so much worse. My boyfriend was with me all weekend and is coming back on wednesday. I dont think I can handle the stress about that right now. The whole time he was here he was mean and hurt me in different ways, he told me to shut up when I cried about it and now I'm texting him and hes saying things that make it sound like hes going to hurt himself (whether it be suicide, self harm or drugs) and im so stressed because he wont tell me anything other than "I'm okay," or "I'm the happiest man alive." 
At this point I'm thinking the hospital isnt even worth it, I just want to die
