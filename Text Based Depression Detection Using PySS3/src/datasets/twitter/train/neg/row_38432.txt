My sister saved my life yesterday.My sister stopped by my house and dropped off an extra pumpkin she bought and some flowers. And we just sat on my patio and hung out. And i felt less lonely. Less like i wanted to cry. To think such a simple interaction... 

I've been in touch with the lifeline. I'm going into impatient care.
