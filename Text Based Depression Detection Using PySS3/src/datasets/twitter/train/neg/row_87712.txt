Not even my mom could helpI'm about to do it. My works hotline
My mom. Nothing helps. Non of my usual coping mechs. I am staring down the barrel and no sane man wouldnt feel fear. But I'm afraid. I'm afraid that there is no lighy on the other side. The only thing I can do is cry every night and grasp at help every day. Grasp should be replaced with claw but I'm trying to bring myself out of this so I'm trying to be possitive. Please help. Please gove me coping mechanisms or something. I dont want today to be my last day.
