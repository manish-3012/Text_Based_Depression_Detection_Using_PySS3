wanting to end it, but not wanting to dieI spend most of my days thinking about wanting to end my existence but can't figure out how I'd do it. I want a way that will let me gamble with my life. I've considered overdosing but I wouldn't want to destroy my organs should I survive, jumping doesn't necessarily sound bad either but I don't think I could convince myself to do it.
