I am SICK of posting on here.Every single time I have posted on here on my other account, nobody has replied. NOT ONCE. All I needed was someone to talk to. Just to talk. And nobody answered. Nobody will probably even read this. I've tried to keep going. But lately, Ive just felt so dead inside. And I have nobody. Not even my last resort has followed through.

I guess this is it.
