I really wanna die.I think I have Gender Dysphoria, some days I'm really confident that I'm trans, and other days I'm not sure. I hate this. I'm worried. What if I transition then change my mind? 

I don't think I'll look good anyways. I care what I look like, I don't wanna look like a man with long hair. I don't wanna look ugly, but I probably will if I transition. 

Sometimes I'm like really confident this is what I want, I wanna be a beautiful girl, I can't stand being a man, I can't live this way. And sometimes I'm ok with being a man, which makes me worry.

I worry, is this just a phase? Will I get over it? Idk I've been feeling this way for over a year.

Going into r/transtimelines hurts me a lot, because I either:

- See a beautiful women, and get really jealous, and think how I'll never be that beautiful.

- See a not as passable women, and get really worried, because I'll probably turn out like them. I'll probably be a really ugly girl.

Also all the hate is getting to me. "Transwomen aren't real woman", "Tranny", etc. I haven't even told anyone IRL yet. I worry they'll judge me too. 

I'm really unsure, and this is really getting to me. I don't know how I'll kill myself, but I'm really thinking about it.
