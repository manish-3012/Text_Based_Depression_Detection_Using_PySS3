Sorry allI have been given enough opportunities in both academics and music and I spat in their face and joined the army, and I knew nothing about myself, so now that the obedience has worn off I hate myself even more for both what I am apart of and how I fell for it. Hanging myself soon, first time so we will see how it goes. Y'all are good people and I've lurked for long enough, cya.
