not sure if i can wait (rape tw)This is my first time posting on here, so i'm not entirely sure what to do...

I was raped last year in October, and I reported it to my university (he was a fellow student).  It has taken over a year for the university to conduct an investigation, decide what the sanction would be, and allow for him to appeal all of it.  He has made his final appeal to the university official in charge of such things, and I have to wait until next week to hear whether he will be expelled, whether he will face a lesser sanction, whether the process will be extended and he gets additional appeals, or whether he will face no sanction at all.  This is really making me nervous; it's really scary being on campus with the student who raped me, and it's been absolutely devastating to have to continue seeing him, being continually reminded of the rape and having flashbacks too.

I know that the right thing to do would be to stay alive at least until this latest decision is released and see where to go from there, but honestly? I'm tired.  I have been dealing with this for so long and I'm exhausted.  I have been let down by the criminal justice system (the prosecutor said there wasn't enough evidence to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt), and now I'm being let down by my school, too.  I worry that because I haven't been able to get justice through these institutions, people won't believe me.  And even if he does get expelled, that doesn't un-rape me.  And that's what makes me feel like I shouldn't keep on living -- life has been unbearable ever since this happened.  I feel like the best option is to leave.
