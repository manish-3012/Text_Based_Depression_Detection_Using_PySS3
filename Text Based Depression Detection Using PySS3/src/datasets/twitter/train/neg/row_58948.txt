I want it to endI wish something would end my life so that i wouldnt have keep on going. I've hit rock bottom after 21 years and now I have no future, and my long term girlfriend passed away two weeks ago. I had everything but my mental health got so bad that I became delusional and ruined so much stuff in my life. I lost everything but I'm too afraid to take my own life. I wish the world would end or something or someone would kill. If I could stop existing, that would be bliss. I just want to be with my soulmate wherever she is now. Life has no meaning anymore.
