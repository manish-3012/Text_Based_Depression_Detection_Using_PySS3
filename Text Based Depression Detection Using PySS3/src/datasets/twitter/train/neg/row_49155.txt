I tried suicide by water intoxicationI really don't know what to do anymore. I'm currently in the library of my University and just tried to commit suicide by drinking gallons of water. I left a note on the desk I was at and left for the bathroom. I'm in a stall, shaking, after only 3,5 liters of water and puked 3 times.I feel ashamed and I don't know what to do now. I can't leave now, but I just can't get anything more down my throat. Fuck
