I wish I was deadI wish I could do it. I wish I had the balls. I wish I had the motivation. But no, itâ€™s just another way to keep me in this perpetual state of dread. Honestly, if I had the balls to kill myself, If I had the motivation, I probably wouldnâ€™t need to. If I could just get my shit together I could go to the gym more often. I could ask someone out, probably. But itâ€™s so much harder than that, and I feel like if I wasnâ€™t so fucked in the brain it wouldnâ€™t be. Iâ€™ve recently got off my zombie medication Iâ€™ve been on for years, and just learned that I have no idea how to cope with stress and anger because Iâ€™ve barely ever felt it. A few days ago I punched a hole in the wall. I would get back on it, but the shit didnâ€™t keep me from being suicidal, and it made it worse at some points. I force myself to work out, doesnâ€™t help. I force myself out of bed, doesnâ€™t help. And it hurts every time I do, though it gets easier at the end of the day. Itâ€™s weird, and canâ€™t really explain it well. Iâ€™ve never been one to bitch and moan, but this is getting out of hand. I donâ€™t know what to do guys.
