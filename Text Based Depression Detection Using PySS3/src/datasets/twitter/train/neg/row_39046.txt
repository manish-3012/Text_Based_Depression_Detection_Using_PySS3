Perhaps I'm looking for the wrong thingI don't come here looking for support or people to tell me everything will be alright. Truthfully I just want to be ridiculed, harassed and for people to tell me to kill myself...but unfortunately because people decide to be "nice" I can't have that can I? 

That's all I want from other people. To be hated by everyone. I don't want help or support. If anything I want the exact opposite of that.

*sigh* I just can't get my way can I?
