I should probably just die and get it over with.I'm an utter failure. I have Autism and ADHD. I can't even do anything nor can I strive to become better. 

I'm tired of being an outcast. People say that's it's my fault I never tried hard at school, and you know what, maybe they're right. 

I mean, I'm 24. I don't see the point in living or continuing my existence. My existence is a punishment enough. 

I keep telling others I want to die, but instead of telling them, maybe I should instead of creating all kinds of drama and tension. 

I should just die and get it over it.
