I realized last night that I canâ€™t trust myself.I went into the city last night to walk around. Nothing more. I was drunk, I found a bridge. I climbed to the top and leaned over. Hundreds of feet below me was cold concrete. The wind was perfect, the temperature outside was perfect. Cars honking in the distance in the city, I could see stars in the sky, the buildings lit up in rainbows for pride week. I climbed over the railing, grabbed it and leaned even further. I couldnâ€™t even see the bridge anymore. I felt like Rose from Titanic. It felt like I was flying. I let one hand go, and I remember the wind blowing my hair in my face. I felt really free. I felt like I was in a movie. A cop passed me and kept driving. I spit and watched it fall so far until it was too small for my eyes to see. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been closer to death.

And I donâ€™t know why I climbed back to safety. I couldâ€™ve died. I donâ€™t know why I chose not to, and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m happy or sad with my choice. I could be feeling nothing right now, I could be free.
