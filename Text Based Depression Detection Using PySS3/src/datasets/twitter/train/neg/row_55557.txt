No way out.I'm not sure why I'm creating this post. Every day is hell internally. It seems impossible to escape the constant torture and knowing my life is relatively good to others only makes the situation more dire and incites guilt for feeling this way. I have nothing to escape externally like so many others that may alleviate their symptoms, only the prison created in my mind. Despite my past not being very good, it doesn't matter. I live so comfortably right now, completely taken care of with no expectations. Some people would be ecstatic to be in my shoes. 

Still, constant panic attacks, anxiety and inescapable depression. The nearly horrifying disassociation with reality. The world is there for me to seize, but I appear so incapable, stupid, and dysfunctional. It's impossible to focus and my memory is completely shot like I wish I was. Despite my awareness, I can't muster up enough strength or drive to do anything at all, even simple things like showering. I have no control. 

I see no purpose in this endless struggle, especially with my view on the absolute futility of life on earth and there's no logical argument against that. I've tried so long to fix myself. Countless therapists, medications, internet suggestions, self-help books, whatever the fuck, there's been virtually no progress in my condition and I'm fucking exhausted. I'm not even going to bother going into my personal life because what the fuck does it matter. 

The only option is to neck myself once my grandparents are gone and I can't be their burden anymore. I provide nothing for this world and it provides nothing for me. I'm too weak, dependent, and uninterested for it to be any other way. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.
