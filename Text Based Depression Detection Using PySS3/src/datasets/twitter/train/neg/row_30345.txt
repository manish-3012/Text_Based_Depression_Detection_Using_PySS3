So its finalI guess I was iffy before. Thinking at first it was just a passing thought. Then slowly it was just me wishing to stop existing. Never actually dying. 

But i have had enough. I have been strong for months but I cannot anymore. I want to die. Please. Just please I want to go now. It's unfair. I never asked to be born or to go through this. I always thought that leaving would be my choice. That is something up to me. But I hate that I have to think of the consequences even then. That I can't just pop some pills and end my suffering.

I spent all of yesterday and today fantasizing about just popping some sleeping aids or nyquil and overdosing on them. Going to bed, sleeping and never waking up. BUt no i cant do that.  No i have to think of what my parents will feel when they try to wake me up in the morning. When they shake me but I dont respond. How my sister would feel when they find out I am dead. 

and I hate that. Dont get me wrong I dont hate their love but I hate that I cant make a choice. I hate that I have to live with this suffering. The amount of pain im feeling. It feels like someone put a knife through my heart is twisting it in, before finally shredding my heart to pieces. Like someone kicked me in my stomach. Like i want to throw up but I cant. Like I cant breathe well. 

So how is it fair that I cannnot die? That I have to live with this pain?
