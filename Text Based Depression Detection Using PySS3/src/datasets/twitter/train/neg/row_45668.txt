Kind of thinking it might be timeLost my job of 17 years today. I hate this time of year. The benzos and antidepressants arenâ€™t helping anymoreðŸ˜ž Iâ€™m sick of the rollercoaster of numbness and pain. I contribute nothing to the world. I canâ€™t figure out why not to do it besides fear of dying period. I guess thatâ€™s a good fear but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to be enough for much longer. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting besides maybe to have someone talk me out of doing something stupid. Guess that means Iâ€™m not legit suicidal, yet.. blah
