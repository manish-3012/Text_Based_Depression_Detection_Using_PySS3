Only a matter of timeIâ€™m 20 and Iâ€™m loosing my mind. Iâ€™ve suffered with severe depression for about 4 years now and in the past month itâ€™s gotten worse and worse at an extremely fast rate. I told myself I would never self harm and now I do it every night. Iâ€™ve had thoughts of ending my life for a while but the thought of my family and friends blaming themselves held me back. Those donâ€™t really apply anymore, I mean they do but I donâ€™t really give a fuck. Itâ€™s not that I want to die, I just donâ€™t want to be me, and I donâ€™t want to be here. Iâ€™m too far gone and the thought of any kind of future is terrifying and seems impossible. At this rate itâ€™s only a matter of time before I attempt to take my own life. I hope it goes without a hitch cause I wouldnâ€™t be able to stand the way everyone looks at me after.
