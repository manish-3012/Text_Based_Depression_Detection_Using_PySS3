Everyone hates me and I want to dieI'm a 16 year old boy from Ontario and I've annoyed everyone I've ever met. I have 'friends' at school, but I'm not all that close to them. I've always been the pity friend. In addition to that, I've had suicide attempts before due to my depression, and I talked to some people online after that, but they have since stopped talking to me. I have 28 contacts on Skype and I only regularly talk to 3 of them, and even then it's not like they think highly. It hurts knowing that there is no one that considers me their best friend, or their favourite person to talk to. I'm tired of and I already have my suicide note prepared. I plan to slit my wrists over the sink, since the other times I tried to kill myself with a noose didn't work.

I don't know what else to say.
