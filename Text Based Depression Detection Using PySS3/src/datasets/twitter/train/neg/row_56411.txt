Honestly dunno if itâ€™s worth it anymoreIâ€™m kinda just giving up tbh. Everything I do is a failure and honestly imm kinda sick of it. 
I failed to reach my parents expectations, my teachers expectations, even my expectations.
I always try to put a goal and reach for it but it always reach to failure.
Things never go my way and I feel like a pos everytime I do anything.
Iâ€™m always unmotivated to do anything cause I know that it wonâ€™t reach the expectations and itâ€™ll result to a failure.
Only reason iâ€™m alive cause I thought I had a chance with this girl I really like, and so I made her a song for Christmas.
She liked it which iâ€™m glad but says she doesnâ€™t like me in that way.
I basically had it right there. I said I was fine and all and I respect her opinion and her feelings.
But in reality my heart just broke. I never felt so inloved with someone and honestly I donâ€™t know what to feel anymore.
I still really love her, and I hope the best for her but Iâ€™d be lying to myself if I wasnâ€™t so depressed because of that.
Iâ€™m at the point of giving up everything man itâ€™s honestly not worth living life.
I cannot accept another failure, so me accepting to kill myself is basically me succeeding in something for the first time.
And for that, iâ€™ll be proud.
