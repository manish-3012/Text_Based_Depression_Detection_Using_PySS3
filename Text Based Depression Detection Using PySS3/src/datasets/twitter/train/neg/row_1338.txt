i bet noone cares i die, so im just waiting on the edgeMy depression seems to get worse and worse. I last posted 3 months ago where i thought i hit rock bottom. Now i know rock bottom doesn't exist. It can always get worse. Im 14, just sitting on the edge of a bridge, noone to talk to because im a lonely fuck who everyone who lays their eyes on thinks is a ugly cunt. I cant take my life anymore. I just.. Cant. Ive been riddled with problems at home since i was six. Drunk knife wielding dad who just doesn't care. I ran from home because my parents continously screamed that they wish i was dead in my ears and my dad decided to get drunk and get a metal rod, so i jumped out of my window not wanting another broken bone.

Past couple days ive just been staying under bridges, haven't slept for days or eaten for days either. Only thing i like anymore is music. How ive held on so long is beyond me. Maybe is because i have a glimmer of hope that If i do my brother will care. But the one whos 17 just screames and tells me that im an idiot. And my 4 year old brother, well. Idk if hell even Remember me.

Im stuck. I cant tell any social services because if im taken from my parents, my mum might kill herself (shes had a past of depression but gt out of it) . And i cant take that risk. She lives for her children. Idk if she loves me but she certainly does my other brothers. Shes only with my dad for them. So i cant tell anyone who can make a change. And things have gotten better between my parents, just not between me and them. And idk imma stop writing i want to just scratch the surface of school problems, but i know noone will care enough to read so imma just leave it out
