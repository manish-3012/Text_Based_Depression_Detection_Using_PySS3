I wish my "friend" just let me die...Everything's back at square one again, I'm lonely and fucking miserable again. I made the mistake of growing close to a woman, why the fuck would I be so foolish? I fucking hate this so much. Friendzoned by another girl I loved. I wish that fucker just fucking let me die, he ruined everything. Now I can't even kill myself anymore, I have to live with this shit. I got so close, now I must suffer indefinitely. Fuck you, man.
