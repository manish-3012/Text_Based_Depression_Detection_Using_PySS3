I don't wanna kill myself anymore, but I feel like I should be deadI just feel like i have been lucky not dieing , but why? I'm a price of shit. Why do good people die by accident but selfish people like me carry on. Again as i'v said in other posts maybe the world's a stage and we all play a part in it. We don't get to choose when the script ends.
