I told my wife I was going to kill myself. She told me to do it outside so the kids won't find the bodyThere's more to the story but I really am having a hard time right now. I spent weeks building up to telling someone, my only person left and that's the response I get. I think she thinks I'm just bluffing but to be told her only concern with my death is not to inconvenience the kids is more crushing than I can express. I feel like my only reason not to die, that it would hurt my family, has been taken away.
