I hate to ask this, but I need help.I am a 20 year old male. I have felt suicidal off and on for the last 5 or so years. I have seen countless therapists and psychiatrists since I finally told my family and friends about my problems, over a year ago. Since then, I have had to drop out of an amazing school and return home - a small hick town full of bigots. Unfortunately, my family has no money or connections, so I'm stuck here until I "get better." 

I have been waiting and waiting and waiting. I eventually reached my breaking point several months ago. Nothing was working. My mind was a torture chamber, and I was trapped inside. I had anxiety attacks, stopped sleeping/eating, and couldn't shake perpetual boredom (boredom is too insignificant a word to describe, but I can't think of better a better alternative). I felt like I was being suffocated. There were two options: kill myself, or smoke pot. I know it sounds irrational (which it probably is), but I literally couldn't live anymore. No medicines affected me positively. And the negative symptoms of anti-depressants kept/keep in bed a lot. Weed helped alleviate everything, unlike any other drug. 

Unfortunately, my depression still isn't manageable. Weed helps, but it's not enough. I constantly yearn for death to relieve me of my pain. I wake up every morning, upset to be conscious and breathing. I don't know what to do. I don't know how much longer I can hold out. I used to have everything going for me - high intelligence, scholarship to a great school, attractive, extremely sociable. At this point, I have none of that going on. I just want to be done. 

What can I do? I refuse to go to a treatment center. It's far too expensive, and I loathe the thought of losing my autonomy upon admittance. I need a switch to flip in my head. Until then, I am constantly on the brink of death. Please help
