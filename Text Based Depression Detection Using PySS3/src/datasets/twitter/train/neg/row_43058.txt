I wish I could hire a hitman to kill me, for me.I usually bother with a throwaway account but I don't really care anymore. I've been hospitalised in a psych ward, I'm on meds, I'm seeing a psychologist regularly, what else can I do? I joined a support group of like-minded people and I even was ignored there when I needed help.  

I had already accepted that the way I'm going to *go* is by hanging myself. I've written many suicide notes. I'm ready. 

Why should I go on? I keep asking myself that and I don't have an answer. What else can I possibly do. I really can't do this anymore. I'm done.
