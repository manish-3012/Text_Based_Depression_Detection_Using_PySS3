Thinking of killing myself all the timeI have been lurking here for awhile now and decided to post.
As the title states, I have been consumed with thoughts of suicide. I currently see a therapist every two weeks and recently started CBT therapy but it doesn't seem to work. The reasons for my depression are no friends, no hobbies, no job and still a virgin. I spend all day doing nothing, bored out of my mind. If any of you have any suggestions to help me then please answer.
