Nothing means anything when you're alone and it really hurts.Nothing means anything when I'm alone.  I'm alone all the time.   It's almost always only me and my thoughts.  I hate myself so much.  I'm never good enough.  All of my friends are in relationships and off building their lives and enjoying themselves.  I'm the only one left alone.  Some even have multiple partners.  I'm nobody's priority, I don't think I ever will be.  Outside of my family, nobody gives a shit about me, if I disappeared it could be weeks before anyone noticed, let alone bothered to check on me, they never do anyways even though they know I have depression.  

I try so hard.  i've tried everything over the last 4 years.  I've lost weight, made friends, started running, swimming, and lifting weights.  I've started eating healthy, I've cut out most sugar and eat lots of protein.  I picked up new hobbies, I joined clubs, I've made new friends, I've even been to my first college party.  I've done therapy and been on zoloft about 7 weeks now.  

And I'm still crushingly alone.  Nothing ever helps.  Self harming doesn't even help anymore.  I have nobody to help me.  I'm almost 21 and all I've never even been hugged.  Nothing means anything.  I feel like I'm doign everything right.  I've tried everything.  I'm attacking this from all angles and I have been for years but I'm still in almost constant mental pain and lonely.  I only have my pillow to comfort me when I can't sleep at night.  

When is it going to stop hurting?  I just want to stop hurting.  What more do I have to do?  Why wont this crushing loneliness die.  I can't live like this much longer.  As soon as I graduate I'm going to San Francisco and jumping off the Golden gate Bridge.  I don't know what else to do.  I feel like I'm finally out of options.  I'm too broken to be fixed.  What can I even do?  This is completely out of my control, it feels like its over.  I just don't think I can fight it anymore.
