Not a throwaway, donâ€™t give a fuck who reads this.I have an extremely vile family consists of both narcissists and self loathers. I have been physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually abused throughout  the course of my lifetime, resulting in horrific consequences to my mental health. Iâ€™m disgusted by humanity, it sickens me what we do to both the planet and one another, it kills my soul to see how we mistreat animals. 

 Got laid off from my job last Friday and my old job is fighting my unemployment,  facing homelessness, car is dead needing a 900 dollar repair,  went through a brutal divorce a few years back, that just left me completely dead inside. 

Fuck paying my last bills, I took my last paycheck and bought a 22.  Iâ€™m done. I donâ€™t wanna live here anymore. I canâ€™t even literally afford to live. Iâ€™d rather be dead and on the other side versus in a shelter with junkies. I donâ€™t use drugs, I donâ€™t drink and I have no criminal record. Iâ€™ve tried for so long to get my mental health issues under control, and they only seem to be spiraling more out of control. I was not built for this planet. Mental health care in America is a fucking joke. So long, Reddit. Date of execution is 5/5/19. 

Everything planned to the T.
