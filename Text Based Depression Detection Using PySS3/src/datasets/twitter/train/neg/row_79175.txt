I need helpI don't really know how to do this but whatever. I'm 15, male, and just about 3 weeks out of the psych hospital. There are some other things affecting my depressuin, but this post is going to focus on one. There's this girl, Gabbi, whose friendship status with me I'm not sure. We became friends last year in 8th grade. She was my only friend and the only person I spoke to in school. After school ended we didn't really talk much until around 4 or 5 months ago in winter, mainly because we don't go to school together anymore. But we started talking again and she helped me through a lot and was the person I could talk to when things became shit. But one day, she just stopped talking to me and I flipped out and a week later tried to kill myself. Fast forward to about a week ago, two weeks out of the hospital, I'm starting to get over her, when she gets in contact with me again. She says it wasn't my fault, she was just stressed. I ask her if she's comfortable with me still talking to her and venting about my shot. She says yes. I let loose. I think she sort of is weirded out by it. Now she seems to be avoiding me or not talking to me. Worse yet, I've always liked her, even more so now, but I haven't ever told her that, I feel like being friends would make me happy enough, but I just found out she likes another dude and she's in a relationship, and as terrible as it is of me, this makes me more depressed and upset. I'm not gonna do it now, don't worry, but I really want to end it.
