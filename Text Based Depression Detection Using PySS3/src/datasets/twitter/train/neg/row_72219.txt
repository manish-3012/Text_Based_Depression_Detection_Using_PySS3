Its hard to imagine ever being happyI grew up with abusive mom/stepdad and an absent dad. My sisters banded together and hated me. Even now, my sisters hate me. They aren't vaccinating their children because they don't want them to be autistic like me. Everyone in school always hated me. My best friend all through high school who became my boyfriend was abusive. My now boyfriend, who is the only person I have, says he wants to be poly one day but is okay with not doing that now. He claims that's just how he experiences love, that it has nothing to do with me... But I can't help but feel that I'm not enough. Every person in my life has told me I would never be enough for anyone or anything. I have no friends, no family, no job and my physical (and mental) health is trash. I have absolutely nothing to live for. I can't imagine ever being happy. I have anxiety nearly every single second that I am awake. Why is life worth it?
