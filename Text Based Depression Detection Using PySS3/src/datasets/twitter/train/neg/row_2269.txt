Are you actually supposed to reach out?A lot of people say that you should tell your friends or family about your suicidal thoughts, but is this actually good advice? In my experience, people just become irritated or sad, which makes me more suicidal. I think I have lost most of my friends due to my openness about my suicidal thoughts, but even they told me to tell them if I was suicidal. Am I just stupid?
