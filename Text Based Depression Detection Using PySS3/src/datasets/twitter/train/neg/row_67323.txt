I'm about to do it.So, I'm 15 years old and I live in Brazil. Although I have great parents, friends, a nice house, food, good education and health, I am not satisfied with life itself. I became an atheist last year and I discovered some things about my sexuality(I'm not gay), after that I've been thinking everything that popped into my mind about human existance and meaning. I found out that everything is subjective, we don't mean anything at the same time we mean everything, there is no one and nothing that can confirm it to us; we just confirm or deny it to ourselves depending on our culture/life and experience. I don't consider myself a handsome guy and I get frustrated with my laziness and irresponsibility/incapability of being the best, and I know how silly it sounds. My parents are divorced and I went through some deceptions in my life, not enough to make me suicide, though. When I think it's just takes a knoose or a jump to end any compromise I have to attend or any suffering I have yet to pass through, It really makes me think why the fuck not. I'm considering to do it and perhaps I'll jump off a building downton when the sun sets, maybe listening to a good music.
