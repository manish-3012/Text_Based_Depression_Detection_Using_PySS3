I don't want to die, I just wish I didn't exist anymore.I'm in my 30s and although I have never been diagnosed, I deal with depression for as long as I can remember... but it's becoming unbearable. I feel exhausted all the time. I'm drinking too much and when I'm super drunk I say the most stupid and hurtful things to my husband - which I honestly don't know how we still together.
The good days are ok. The bad days are terrible. Yesterday we had this huge fight over nothing and I ruined Christmas. I never in my life thought that I would be this kind of person. 

I don't have any friends. I hate everyone mostly because I hate myself so bad I just can't keep any relationship for too long. I always find something to irritate me and find a way for the person to hate me as well, so I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't have contact with my family, so there's that too. I'm too coward to kill myself, although I tried. I just can't seem to find a way out of this situation. I dream about getting in a train or a flight and going somewhere else where I could be a new person, with no past and nothing that could make people go away from me, but I know that here or there, I'll be the same piece of garbage and eventually people will know who I am truly, and they'll move on as well. I just wish I could disappear.
