Hey.Hey guys... 
First of all pls donâ€™t make fun of my English Iâ€™m from german and did not have the best school here.


Im struggling to Weide something here cause I never thought that I am depressed or whatever but I have every damn day that one feeling- the feeling of hate. Itâ€™s the hate to myself and well I think not a single person out there loves or likes me even my parents did not wanted me I lived like 6 years in and childhouse (idk what it reale means so there are some childâ€™s and one or two ppl that are looking for us) 


So I decided to start playing an online game (world of Warcraft) back than I found a rly nice guild on the German server Amahntul(special thanks to my Guild DDP) 

I know my story is not that hard like others here but I rly wanted to tell some ppl may they start playing an online game where you can play with other ppl you will always find some nice ppl even if itâ€™s one anyone in such games are rly nice and will never betray you or anything everyone ist everytime there to talk with you and nobody ever will make fun of you! 


So back to main point my Story is not the hardest here but I just want to tell you guys that I always have this feeling in my stomach of loneliness and this feeling only goes away if I play with some of my online friends (my only friends of course)
