As soon as I can afford it......I'm going to buy a handle of liquor. I'm going to take the rest of my acid, drink as much alcohol as I can, then throw myself off a parking garage. I might douse and light myself on fire before I jump. It might be much more painful, but it would lower the chance of surviving.

If I do survive, I'm going to be severely fucked up physically... That's the biggest thing that scares me... Waking up in a hospital somewhere and realizing that I fucked up bigger than I ever have before...

I'm still afraid to die, but I don't believe I can either contribute or receive any real sort of value from this life. I've given up, and to continue to exist would only represent a burden to my family and my society. I'm a parasite. And I guess I'd rather die than learn to be anything else, even if it scares me and I know how much pain it would cause for the people around me.

I didn't ask to come here. I didn't ask them to be close to me. I never asked for any of this...

Sorry this ended up being a lot longer than I intended...
