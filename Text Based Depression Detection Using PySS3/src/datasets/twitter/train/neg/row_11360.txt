help?I just wish i didn't feel like this. Why can't I be a sheep that's fine with working forever until you die to barley scrape by? My sister is my best friend and I couldn't hurt her for anything. Its getting harder and harder to think of her when I want to die. My boyfriend wants to die more than me. He asks me "can I die?" "No" "why?" And i have 2 answers "I love you " or "im selfish" lately I've been saying "cause you won't take me too" I hate it meds didn't help I dont want to die i just hate this feeling. And ik it won't stop until im dead. Should I just kms and be done with it?
