i just cant stop thinking about suicideeverything i do never seems to be good enough. somewhere out there, there are thousands of other 15 year olds that have the exact same skills that i do and way more. i have come to terms with the fact that no one will ever notice me, and i will never make an impact on anything. my grades are plummeting. people are abandoning me and starting to be assholes to me way more often. i am giving up. whenever i have any sort of small failure, my first thought is that i should just fucking end it already. i would feel very bad if i actually did it, as my gf has also tried before and if i succeeded she probably would try and succeed too. my idea is to slowly push away everyone so that when i finally do end it no one will be that upset.

i just want everyone to be happy.
