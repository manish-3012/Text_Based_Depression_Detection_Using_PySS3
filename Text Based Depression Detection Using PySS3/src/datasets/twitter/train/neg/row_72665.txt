Loaded it and ready to goIf I could go back in the past and change things I would, but I know that the past is done. Now it's time to pay the consequences for my actions. My future is doomed and I have no place in this world. I apologize to my family for having to put up with me and waste resources on me for 19 years. But now it's no more. Good bye.
