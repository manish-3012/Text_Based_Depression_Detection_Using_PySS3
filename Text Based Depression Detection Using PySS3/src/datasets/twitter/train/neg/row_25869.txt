I feel stuckI have dealt with thoughts of suicide and depression since middle school. At points these thoughts are far more manageable than others. However, the past month or so has been incredibly low, it's a new point of exhaustion. I have been seriously planning suicide. The crux of it is that I don't want to hurt my family which is what has been keeping from doing it for so long, and wouldn't want to do it in my home (which is where my parents live, I don't want them to associate my potential death with their house), which is a little difficult to circumvent, as I do not have a location. 

I have toyed around with going to the free counselor on my campus, but I don't want to be forced to go to a psychiatric hospital if I open up about my problem, being that I want to die (I cannot afford to foot that bill). I have also thought about talking to my mother, but I'm not sure how that will turn out and I don't want to place that kind of burden on someone. Plus, that would probably give me less opportunities to do so if I told them.

So I guess I just feel stuck, and I'm not sure what to do or what I should do. Sometimes I feel like it would be so much easier to just have a terminal disease, that way I could get to say goodbye to everyone properly without feeling so damn guilty over not wanting to exist.
