I won't find peace in life or in deathI think I posted here about a week ago...I'm still alive!  But it feels like, barely.  The thing is, I want to feel relief from this pain.  I want to experience happiness again.  I want to feel at peace.  To feel free.  I don't have any beliefs about an afterlife.  I know if I am dead, I won't experience any of these things.  

It's been years since I realized that peace can't be found in external things.  But I don't know how it CAN be found.  I've been meditating for years, and feel like this is my one avenue to finding out, but meditation never gets easier or more enjoyable.  It's hard to imagine being worse off, but without meditation maybe I would have killed myself by now.  It's hard to know.  Life doesn't seem worth living when I have to spend so much time and energy trying to get through the day without being overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts.  I try to plan for my future, but deep down I don't believe I have one.  It's been two years like this.

Can anyone relate?
