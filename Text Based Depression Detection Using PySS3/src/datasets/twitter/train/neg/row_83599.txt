getting betteri don't know where else to post this, but i chose here since i frequent a lot. i recently just finished (i think lol) the hardest period of my life. i survived an overdose and got out of a really, really toxic relationship. i have a job that i do pretty decent in, making a solid amount of money for my age. i think i finally sorted out my gender identity issues, and generally i just feel okay. maybe i only feel better at the moment, maybe i'll feel better for longer who knows. i just feel proud of myself for hanging on for this long. i dont know how i did it but im happy i did. but i have bipolar i so this could also easily be the beginning of a manic episode lol. either way, i just wanted to update anyone whos seen me on here that im doing better. i hope the rest of you do too.
