My story, I do need help. I want suggestions..So please forgive me for probably pouring my heart into this. I have dealt with depression for about 6 years now. Mostly from grade 8-12. I took a gap year to see what i could do. But the truth was, my life is going nowhere. Im not an academical genius. Or even remotely close to being sporty or physical. After these last 2 years my life is going nowhere. Personally nothing has happened. I sat here behind my PC and mask hiding everything. Some nights i go to sleep thinking how i want to change.. how i want to get better and do something. I wake up and it hits me. Other nights i wake up or struggle to sleep. Trying not to pack my bags and run off to die peacefully. 

I honestly dont know what to do anymore. The country im in is limiting me. Im struggling with money, since all i do is live and eat all my parents money. I made a little money, however that stopped now. Its not healthy to question killing myself every night when i go to bed. Yes i have had good moment. However that is nothing to equal the pain i have in my mind. Nothing has triggered this although i have had a few moments where i just broke down and stayed in bed. 

I really need some advice at what to do. The only reason im still around is because i dont want to hurt my family. Spending money on me, loving me and only to have me vanish into darkness.. I would tell you more about myself however i feel as its not needed. Although my life is good and nothing is wrong with it. Its going nowhere and im here again stuck in this. One day (feels like today or soon). Im going to just snap. I feel as if i want to be locked up and just left. Forgotten and nothing bad happens. 

If i had the option to vanish or never exist without hurting anybody. I would choose it.
