I want to but....I want to kill myself, I'm so tired of living. I'm so tired of the pain I feel day in and day out. I've been fighting this for 21 years. there were a few years where I kicked it's butt. But those years weren't super happy, but just didn't feel like the end of the world. Now I don't know what to do or where to go. I'm on meds that just don't seem to be working for me. 

I just want the pain to STOP. 

But I have people who love me and care for me. they would miss me so much. when i can feel i feel guilty i want to leave them all. but not to hurt them but just to make the hurt and pain, and hopelessness stop.

when i'm "better" (for a lack of better word) I do everything possible to stay busy, or around people to prevent me from going to that dark place. but when they leave i'm sitting here left in my personal hell more tired than before.

I am getting "help" but it doesn't feel like help. my dr cares, his heart is in the right place, but it seems more like he's not always in the same conversation as me. I'm waiting for a psych dr which i should be getting next month. i don't have much hope that this is going to be any better. 

life doesn't get better it just goes on....
