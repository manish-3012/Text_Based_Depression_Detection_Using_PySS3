Well.. I donâ€™t know what to do.Hi All,

Second post on reddit. The first was some irrelevant discussion about a laptop. Anyhow, Iâ€™m very very depressed. I have no where or anyone to turn to. My girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me, and doesnâ€™t seem to care at all. She threatened to block me if I continued to text, or call. Iâ€™m devastated. I wanted to marry her. She has two dogs that I call my own as well, but she is keeping them and Iâ€™ll never see them again either. Iâ€™ve never contemplated suicide before, but it feels like a reliable way to end this suffering. I know for a fact I canâ€™t get over her. I put my heart and every emotion I had into her and our relationship. I just canâ€™t handle it. I work way too much so I have very little friends. She was my best fiend and lover, and now I have nothing. People say â€œit will get betterâ€, but how when I loved her with everything I had. Iâ€™m so distraught...
