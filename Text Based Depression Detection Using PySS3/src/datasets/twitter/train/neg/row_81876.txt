I need to talk it outHey guys, I've posted here before but I abandoned the post and account, while reading replies. This time, I figure I'd like to chat. I'm a 20 year old guy. I guess I should explain that, as I post this, I've been contemplating suicide on/off for the past 6 months. Not only is my life in a bad position, I don't see it going anywhere I want it to be. There are currently three things keeping me from killing myself: 1. Pain of suicide method (I'm not brave enough to hurt myself and live through the pain of surviving) 2. Family members who love me (They have been incredibly nice to me, and they don't deserve the grief of my death) and 3. No opportunity. The first two reasons are really the primary reasons. I'm currently in college, all paid for by my parents, but I'm about to go into my 3rd year and I have no idea what my major is, my gpa is awful, and I feel like I wasted tens of thousands of dollars. I have really no motivations in life other than wanting to workout at the gym, masturbate, and play video games. I work 25 hours a week at a local retail store, and I just get incredibly bored. So bored where the only reason that I keep working is that I know I can play video games when I'm done. I also live for the feeling that I get when I win at video games, so a losing streak can be very depressing. I just don't feel like life is worth the effort, why should I try to raise my gpa when I'm just gonna get stuck in a career doing shit for 30 years. So, what do you guys think is wrong with me and what can I do?
