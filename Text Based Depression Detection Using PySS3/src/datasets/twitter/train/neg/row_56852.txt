Homeward BoundI'm tired and exhausted. And I'm fine with it. I've been bouncing around with the idea of "leaving" for a while. And you all know what I mean by that.
But finally I'm calm about it and im....fine with it.


I know I will hurt people with my decision. Family and Friends. But I have been fighting depression for more than a decade now and it's a disease with no cure. Not enough people take it seriously enough to challenge this disease for a cure or solution.


Not enough people care. Just enough people care to feel validated in thinking they've done something to help. It hasn't been enough yet. 
Just like world hunger....polution....not enough has changed. Maybe one day, those who suffer with our disease will find a cure for it. Then no one will feel this empty.


I hope No one will get to this point of being ok with killing themselves. No one will have to lie and say they're fine when they aren't. No one will fake  a smile to hide their pain because others choose not to listen.

One day.

Someone will say they're fine....and it will be true.


But not for me. I am empty. I am tired. I am too far gone. To broken to believe that anything or one can help me. And that's ok. I'm at peace with this.. 
I'm finally at peace with what I am.

If someone reads this. There is hope for you. Fight the good fight. Do not end up like me. And help those who feel as if the light has burned out....help them. Please.






Tonight I'm going to watch one last movie. Cause I love movies. Then I'm going to sleep. And drift off into eternity. Into all the different realities I have created for myself during times of sorrow and pain. When reality got too tough these were the worlds in my mind I would escape too. 
I will escape. One last time.

I'm fine.

I'm fine.

I'm fine.

I'm fine.
