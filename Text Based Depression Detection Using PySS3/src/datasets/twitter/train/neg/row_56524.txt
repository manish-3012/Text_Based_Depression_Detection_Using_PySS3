First suicide attempt a couple weeks ago. Still sort of in numb shockI made a suicide attempt for the first time a couple weeks ago. It hasn't been something I've been comfortable talking about, but I felt ready enough to at least write it out. Even still hasn't quite registered to me that it happened. I figure, screw it, might as well tell someone

Didn't go for something lethal, which is probably why I failed. I tried to strangle myself - doing it with just my bare hands. My reasoning was that even if I found a rope or extension cord or something, I'm not sure I could find something I could strap it to that wouldn't brake while I hang. Decided to just use the "tools" I already had on me

Of course, I stopped, but not because I wanted to. It was the involuntary panic that sets in when drowning or losing air - choking sounds, body thrashing and panicking, and I wasn't able to finish.

I still don't know how to feel about it or what to think. I've just been blank inside since then. I've already been seeing a therapist who is good at calming me down. I've been on antidepressants for a few months, which I'm not sure are working. I just don't know. Not sure why I'm even posting this. Maybe just to get it off my chest
