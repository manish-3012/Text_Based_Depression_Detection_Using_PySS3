I canâ€™t get it off my mind.Iâ€™m 22. Iâ€™m not old, I know that. Iâ€™m probably too young to draw any conclusions about life right now. But Iâ€™m just so tired. Iâ€™m so done.

I work in social services with at-risk kids. Kids that were like me. Kids that have the same traumas I do. Iâ€™ve been doing my job a long time, and Iâ€™m good at it. I love it. It gives me purpose and reason. But itâ€™s exhausting and I constantly feel like Iâ€™m having so little impact. I feel like Iâ€™m drowning and canâ€™t keep up- like nothing I do will ever be enough because the need for my position itself is a reminder that there is so much evil in the world.

I donâ€™t want to live in an evil world.

And thereâ€™s sobriety- which I work my ass off for. 78 days and counting. I havenâ€™t had anything *close* to that in 6 years. Thatâ€™s a victory every second, I know it is. I canâ€™t argue it isnâ€™t.

I have someone who calls me their brother, treats me like it, respects me and understands me. Never had a best friend like that before. Second positive thing. The outside motivation has been a game changer.

Then there was a girlfriend, but I scared her off. Once she knew about the trauma, she couldnâ€™t stay. I understand. She meant no harm. She saw a relapse, she saw the struggle. Sheâ€™s young and thatâ€™s new to her, she had to protect her heart. But I loved her and I still do, and I donâ€™t know where those feelings go when the person you love isnâ€™t there to receive them.

So itâ€™s been on my mind. I mean, it has been. Since an attempt three months ago. And the attempt six months before that. And now it doesnâ€™t go away. It did, for a few days. There were a few days I couldnâ€™t believe I was so happy. I was so motivated. I felt good and ready to take on the world. I was genuinely ok and genuinely happy.

I donâ€™t know what happened. How to bring those feelings back. 

Thereâ€™s AA every Thursday. NA every Sunday. First appointment with the new shrink next Tuesday- and honestly, she seems really great. She wants to get me. She wants in to my head. I think she could help me.

But it doesnâ€™t go away. It claws at my brain every waking moment. I donâ€™t want to be awake. But I canâ€™t sleep. I donâ€™t want to be sober. But Iâ€™d be so ashamed of myself if I wasnâ€™t. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. What do you do when every second is a battle? When youâ€™ve already given up on yourself? I donâ€™t want to leave holes in anyoneâ€™s life where Iâ€™m supposed to be. I just donâ€™t know what to do. Everything hurts so badly and I donâ€™t want to live with it anymore.
