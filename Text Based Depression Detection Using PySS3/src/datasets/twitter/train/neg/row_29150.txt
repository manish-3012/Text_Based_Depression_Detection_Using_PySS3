I want it to be over.I want to kill myself so badly. I want to be done trying to fix things that simply arenâ€™t fixable. My mother never loved me. I donâ€™t have friends who take me seriously. I canâ€™t look at myself in the mirror because I donâ€™t recognize myself. People who I used to get along with are scared of me. My parents are getting a divorce. Everything is so dumb and thereâ€™s no point in still being here, but I canâ€™t bring myself to do it. Iâ€™m so sad, I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. Everything hurts and my heart is heavy. Nothing seems worth it, but I still am too much of a coward to end my stupid fucking life. Iâ€™ve been struggling with these thoughts for nearly 5 years, even though Iâ€™ve been on tons of medication for a bit over a year. I started antidepressants and anxiety medication in February of 2017. I go to therapy. I talk things out with people. Nothing is helping. I want my absence to make people realize what theyâ€™ve been missing out on. Maybe I had potential, but no one wanted to find out. My friends are all fake, my girlfriend doesnâ€™t love me; from what I can tell. I want to write a note and get this over with, but for some reason I canâ€™t find out how. At the same time, I want to call the suicide hotline. I want to get better, but that takes effort. Effort that I donâ€™t feel like I can give. Iâ€™m worn out. Iâ€™m tired of this. Instead of doing anything Iâ€™m just sitting on my fucking bed. I canâ€™t talk to my friends; they have my fatherâ€™s number as well as my address, and theyâ€™d sure as hell call an ambulance, or call my dad. Iâ€™m gonna miss my dogs, and my dad, if I am to go. Who am I kidding though, he was never going to make it to my wedding anyway, if I were to have one. This post is dumb. Iâ€™m sorryâ€”can someone just encourage me to get it over with?
