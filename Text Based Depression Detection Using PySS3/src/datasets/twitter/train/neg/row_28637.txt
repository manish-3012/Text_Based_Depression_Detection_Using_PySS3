10 years of therapies isn't enough?I'm 22. English not native.
2/3 of each year I feel depressed to the point that I'm unable to watch films or read books. Sleeping ~14h a day and then lying or doing nothing. Sometimes it's better but it doesn't matter because sooner or later everything will come back to the shitty state. 

I am very talented and creative but it doesn't matter because when everything is in the shitty state I can't do nothing. 

Seriously tired of trying to feel better after 10 years of therapies, multiple psychiatrist consultations, many medicines. Well, I learned something about myself but it didn't change anything. I was on a 3 month 'everyday' group therapy very recently and it didn't change anything too, despite my effort.

I don't want to live this way anymore and as experience shows, there isn't any other way than suicide. That's what I've learned.
