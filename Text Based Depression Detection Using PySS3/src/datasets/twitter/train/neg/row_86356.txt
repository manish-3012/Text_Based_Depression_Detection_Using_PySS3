Not saying what my plans are -- I value my freedomCheck my previous post if you care to.

I will go joyously. Which they take to mean I'm bluffing. Which reaffirms my commitment. Fuck everyone and everything. This dog is ready.

I am crazy now. Officially. Only after this final push though, thank you very much.

Oh what the hell:  I'm hanging myself next weekend at a motel. With my dad's blessing (he doesn't want me to hang here in the apartment, so he's renting a motel for me).

I love talking about it now, because I'm going to and nobody believes me. It will be fun.

Edit:  My lawyer advises me to inform you this is all a joke. I have no such plans.
