I'm DoneI'm spent. Been living far too long with this depression and anxiety. Today, instead of going to my doctor, I'm going to kiss my wife, leave, and check into a hotel. I will consume a bottle of painkillers, some ativan, wash it down with some vodka and then text my son and my wife my goodbye and that I love them. I simply cannot live in this hell anymore.
