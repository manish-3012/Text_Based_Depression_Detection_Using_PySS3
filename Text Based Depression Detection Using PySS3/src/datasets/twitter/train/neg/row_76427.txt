Thrown out of house.I currently have no idea what I should do and the only thing that come to mind is killing myself. I am 19 years old and was just thrown out of my house for smoking weed. I've been suicidal for well over four years and this time I  really don't have any reason to keep going. I am  sure to lose my job as up have no way of getting to work at 9am. I already went to a hospital two weeks ago and all I got out of it was a $3,000 night stay that I can't pay. I have no where to go as my entire family is refusing to talk to me let alone provide any help. I honestly don't know what to do and I think I am ready to go. I've lost all attachment to this life.  The past 4 months felt like I've been in complete auto pilot. And I don't want to keep living like this.
