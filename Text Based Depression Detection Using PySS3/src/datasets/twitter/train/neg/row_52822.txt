A mother ready to end it.I am a mother of two kiddos. I have had depression since a teenager and itâ€™s gotten progressively worse throughout my life. I am now 27. Got out of abusive relationship a few months ago. I have no job atm. I am a CNA an have been for 10 years. I donâ€™t want to go back into this field. Any of you that work in the medical field no how mental an physical draining this is, I donâ€™t think i could honestly handle that type of work right now. I have applied in different areas of work and nothing has planned out yet. I donâ€™t have much support from family. I have boyfriend that is there for me but he does not know about my depression at all, Iâ€™m honestly afraid if I told him it would change things between us. I am also a heavy drug user/abuser. I literally do anything and everything I can get my hands on to try to dull the pain. I feel so alone. I have debated going to rehab but have never done so before and Iâ€™m scared shitless just thinking about it. I have been to psych before and found no help there either. I feel like Iâ€™m at my wits ends. I wanna hang on for my kids but at this point I feel they would be better off without  there drug addicted jobless mother.
