I'm embarrassed that I told my mom I'm suicidalI've been internally struggling with depression for a while now and hadn't told anybody, but yesterday I finally worked up the courage to tell my mom that recently I've been having suicidal thoughts. She reacted as any parent would and told me how worrying that is and suggested we try and find a therapist who I can talk to. But right after I told her I started to feel really embarrassed and regretted that I said anything at all. I started yelling at my mom even though she did nothing wrong and told her to forget I said anything and to leave me alone. I then locked myself in the basement and spent the entire night playing video games to distract myself.

I've been avoiding my mom all day and ignoring her texts, I feel so embarrassed and ashamed and I don't even want to look at her, and then I feel like a horrible person for doing so because I'm lashing out at her when she doesn't deserve it. All day I've just been crying and playing games and watching YouTube to distract myself.

I don't know what to do, I wish I never said anything at all but it's too late to take it back.
