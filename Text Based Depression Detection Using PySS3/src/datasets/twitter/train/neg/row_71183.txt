I've been sitting with my 9mm in my hand for the last hour and I just can't pull the fucking trigger for some stupid reasonThere's this stupid fucking voice in the back of my mind saying tomorrow will be better. Don't do it. I feel like such a fucking pussy and fuck up. I can't even fucking kill myself properly. I don't know what to do. I'm going outside for a smoke.
