I worry for my life. Every day I feel closer to committing suicide. I wish I had a loving parents and felt the confidence I need to survive. Please help. This is very serious. I am not faking this. I feel at wits end.(Spaces for easier readability)

There is a vast array of issues I am facing that trouble me very. I am 

24 and I am still living with my parents. I know lots of people still live 

with their parents at my age, but my parents will not pay for college 

and they are very mean to me, they insult me shatter my confidence, 

they treat me like I am horribly inferior to them, they scare me to 

death with threats about how my so many horrible things are coming 

my way if I don't"Listen to their wisdom". Something to know is that I 

have a relatively sever form of epilepsy and I cannot survive without 

my pills or else I go into seizure. I am seeing a Neurologist about this
 
but my parents won't take me to a psychologist saying I can deal with 

my depression probables on my own. As a result of all the doctors 

and medical care I need its much harder for me to leave the house. I 

am deeply afraid I will perish. What should I do?
