I am ending my life on my birthday which is this month on the 20th.On the 20th I am going to buy some beer and whiskey get drunk as hell and then end my life. I literally can't take living in this world anymore especially being single and alone and lonely. I have put myself out there for many years and all I get is rejected based on how I look. I can't do it anymore. I am going to end my life on my birthday. I have a weird twisted and creepy personality and morbid sense of humor that I want my death certificate to say born 1/20/1981 and died 1/20/2019. it will be my last good bye to the world and a fuck you on the day I was born. 

I have no friends, no family, no one, I am alone in this world and women won't even go out with me. I literally can't take it anymore, we humans aren't built to spend our life time single and alone and suffering from loneliness. 

People say put yourself out there, have confidence,  volunteer etc. none of that matters when no one finds you attractive physically. All the confidence in the world does nothing if people find you physically ugly. volunteering does nothing if no one finds you physically attractive, putting myself out there does nothing but sets me up for rejections left and right when no one finds you attractive. 

Everyone in this world has become so fixated on looks and it is disgusting and sickening. I am done with this life. I am done trying to survive daily and deal with shit and done with pushing forward. come the 20th I will no longer be here.
