I'm just lonely and bored lately, I hate it so much here, my life has become this empty nothing and I just wish I had something to do or someone to go spend time withEdit: since I always forget that most places don't suck this bad, we have nothing here, no decent bars, no clubs, no gyms, no cafes, nothing.

The past time in town is to ride a 4-wheeler through mud, and I don't own one or have any friends that do (or any friends period)
