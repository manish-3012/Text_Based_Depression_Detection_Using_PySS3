Still DrowningIâ€™ve been depressed on and off for years but when my grandma passed away this year I became lost. Suicide never leaves my mind for more then a few hours a day. I rarely leave my home or speak to anyone and Im tired. She raised me and she was my heart my backbone and we were so close. I have no friends or family now and I feel like Iâ€™m just waiting until I finally have the balls to end it. The fact that Iâ€™m even typing this out make me feels like thereâ€™s an ounce of hope in me which confuses the hell out of me. It sounds insane but now living scares the hell out of me. Yet, when I picture myself taking that last breath for some reason this comforts me and eases my anxiety. Any comments or advice would be appreciated.
