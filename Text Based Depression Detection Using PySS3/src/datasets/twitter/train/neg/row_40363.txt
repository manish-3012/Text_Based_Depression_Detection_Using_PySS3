Iâ€™m finally readyIâ€™m going to do it before my birthday (9/20). I have nothing and no one. This wouldve been yet another year of spending my birthday alone. Iâ€™m so lonely. My heart is broken and I canâ€™t fix anything. I tried to get help, I went to therapy, I tried meds, nothing helps. I donâ€™t know that I want to die- I just know I canâ€™t live how Iâ€™m living and all of my efforts to change things fail. Iâ€™m just a worthless failure and I canâ€™t take it any more.
