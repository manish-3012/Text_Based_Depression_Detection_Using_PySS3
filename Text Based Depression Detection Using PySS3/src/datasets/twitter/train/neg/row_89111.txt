My younger brother uses threats of suicide as leverage to get what he wants. What can I do?My brother who is 16 threatens to commit suicide if heâ€™s ever put into situations he wouldnâ€™t like. He recently came to live with me out of state. There was no bad problems at home that caused him to leave our mom- I just wanted to help give him some guidance and have him stay with us for a school year. Our dad often isnâ€™t in the picture.

Now weâ€™re getting close to the time where he would be returning back home and he keeps saying that if he has to move back heâ€™s going to kill him self and he doesnâ€™t care what anyone says. (He has a girlfriend here now heâ€™s been with for a few months whoâ€™s heâ€™s unhealthily obsessed with)

When my mom tells him she wants him to come back home he tells her â€œno I swear Iâ€™ll kill myself if you make meâ€ and anytime itâ€™s brought up thatâ€™s his go to.

Along with other situations like if his girlfriend were to leave him or if we were to have to move to a new state because of my job etc.. 

Itâ€™s always â€œIâ€™ll kill myself or Iâ€™ll run awayâ€

Itâ€™s very frustrating because the people that would care about him killing himself are people that love him like myself and our mom and heâ€™s just using that love as leverage to get his way through these threats.


Iâ€™m sorry if this is the wrong sub, please advise if thereâ€™s somewhere better I should take this.
