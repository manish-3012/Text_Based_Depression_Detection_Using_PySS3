I cant stand my life and just want to end itI'm 15 and I've tried twice before I've hung myself only to be cut down by police who showed up shortly after I jumped and I've tried to end my life by jumping off my speeding bike into traffic both times I was hospitalized and i just dont see any meaning in life i have a couple friends but they talk shit behind my back I haven't had someone to love me in years my mom gets me up I dont hit her back because of the respect and my dad always told me not to hit women my dad is incarcerated and has been in prison for years doesn't talk to me anymore I haven't had a girlfriend in years my parents and grandparents act like they wish I wasnt around my friends blow me off I never am able to hang out with them and when I do they tease me and joke at me how I should try and kill myself again and I just dont feel like there is anything left for me anymore
