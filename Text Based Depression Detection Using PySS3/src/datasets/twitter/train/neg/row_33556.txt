I think this is it. Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m done now.I just canâ€™t anymore. My marriage is falling apart because I canâ€™t express myself or be understood, no matter how much I try. My wife doesnâ€™t understand me at all. Iâ€™ve been unhappy since as long as I can remember and I donâ€™t want to be alone. I was sticking around because I donâ€™t want to hurt my family but I think thatâ€™s foolish. I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore but I also donâ€™t really want to live either. I certainly donâ€™t want another 40 or 50 years of this misery. I want relief one way or another.
