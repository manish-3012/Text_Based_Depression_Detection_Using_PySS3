If I have to be alone and unlikable for the rest of my life, I would die.I am god damned sick and tired of being alone. It has always been like that in this shit thing that people call life. Do I have friends? Yes, I do. But it's not that kind of alone, just to make sure...

Just as an example of me being a piece of unlikable trash: in 2011, I was walking through school in another ordinary day. Then, this boy says I like a certain girl (I really didn't, but I said "Ok, I do like that girl". Later on, however, I do begin to actually "like" the girl.). Okay, so the girl knows I "like" her. Do you want to know what she said about me? It's hard to translate (At the time I was living in Brazil) but she said something along the lines of "vision of hell" or what the hell is supposed to visually look like, basically. 

Now, answer me. How can I be likable? I won't ever find someone who I can love and who can love me, who I can be intimate with. This is not something that I wish. This is the opposite of what I actually want. 

Yes, I am 17 years old. I am "young". Does it matter? I will still probably die alone. So, I am sorry. This is not the *sole* reason why I want to kill myself, but it is one of the reasons.

I cannot stand this anymore. I will finish everything if it means I won't suffer this shit anymore. Fuck me for being so shitty, unlikable and unworthy of being loved. I hate myself, I should die. I should commit suicide.
