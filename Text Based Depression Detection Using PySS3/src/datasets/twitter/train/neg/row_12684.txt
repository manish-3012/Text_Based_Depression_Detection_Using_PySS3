Trigger warning only read if you are not feeling low..I feel like ending things nothing has been right for this last year for me. I got jailed, I lost my job I am loosing my loved ones.  It's sad that I used to look for happiness elsewhere but it sounds all too late to make changes in life now. I have tried medication. I have tried meditation. I still feel worthless, unwanted. Only happiness I have ever got was through helping others in need of help or someone to listen to. What should I do? Or you would do?
