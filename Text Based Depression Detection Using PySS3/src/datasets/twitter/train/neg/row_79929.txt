Don't know how long I can keep goingIt's just too much .. been crying my eyes out for the past 2 months, like... Non-stop
Had fights with my loved ones, people keep blocking me, the one I love too... Every single bad thing seems to be my fault, at least that's what they keep saying
That I'm at fault, crazy, a liar... I still don't know what I did wrong and even the ones who told me they're with me and they know I didn't do anything are ignoring me now... I don't know why and I don't know if I can keep going
It just hurts so much
Thought about ending it few times the past weeks... Tried it... Still here because tphe knife had a dull blade.. got frustrated and only cried
I can't even do that 
I feel like I can't do anything at all, everything I try to do is wrong or just doesn't work
Can't even accept kindness anymore because I have all the bad things in my mind that people keep telling about me... Maybe that's who I am and maybe I just... Shouldn't be here because I only hurt others and... I just don't know anymore

Always had my 'anchor' who kept me safe from those thoughts but.. not anymore 
It just feels like there's no one there
No one who understands
