Iâ€™m(24M) talking to a someone(22F) from another country and she confided in me that she wants to kill herself and I donâ€™t know what to do.

She has tried having a psychologist and having a psychiatrist.  Neither of them were helpful to her.  She has recently told me that sheâ€™s been thinking of committing suicide this weekend.  Iâ€™m working with borrowed time and I need to stop this from happening as quickly as I can.  Any and all advice would be appreciated.
