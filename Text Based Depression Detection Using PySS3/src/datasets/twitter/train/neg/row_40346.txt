Fucking Christ. I can't deal with it.Is it possible that some people feel emotions stronger than others?

I just finished writing my suicide notes. I wrote them to my friends and family.

I don't want to die. I really do want to live my life. I understand that my life is good. I have a ton going for me. I'm just tired of feeling like crap. I'm not going to do it anymore. I've done 10+ years of counseling, 10+ years of medications, a recent round of ECT. There is only one thing that has ever relieved my depression. Her. It's fucked up. I get it. It won't matter soon.

Is it ironic that I just spent a month in the hospital getting better from pneumonia?

I have bought my shotgun, I'm just waiting till Tuesday so I can drive away from here so my parents don't find me.

I just wanted to talk. I know I should just move on I get that. I'm fucked up though, so I'm just going to blow my head off. She doesn't care. 

WTF is wrong with everything.
