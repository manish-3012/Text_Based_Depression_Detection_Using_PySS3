It's been on my mind for a while now.Not alot of friends; girlfriend lives far away (as in very far away); quit my last job because it gave me blackouts and even more depression; parents forcing me to get a job (trying to); I sit here, day after day and I have no motivation to do anything, even this post was a huge struggle.

   Reading posts about other people don't make me feel anything, I just want to see if having my own post, being an OP would make the words you guys post mean something to me because to be honest this is the last straw, every question I've been given my first thought has been suicide and it frustrates me how people can just do these super crazy difficult things like social interaction and maintaining a job, I just don't think i'm cut out for this world.
