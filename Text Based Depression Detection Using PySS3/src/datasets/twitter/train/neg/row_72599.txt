ive pretty much decided that no one cares anymorethere was one. one left. and now ive decided that they dont care, and i told them i thought that. 48 minutes later i went back to talk to them briefly, but they just asked me if anything had changed in the last 48 minutes. i shrugged and they said "then go to class".
if they really did care, if they really do care. they shouldnt have said that because that just further proves my point. 
and since they were my only reason for staying alive and i made plans today. im gonna go ahead and do what i planned, when i planned it. i hopefully wont be seeing november :)
