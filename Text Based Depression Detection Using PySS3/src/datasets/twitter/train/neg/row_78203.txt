I donâ€™t stop at railroad tracks anymoreI drive along a rural dirt road most days on my daily commute and there is a railroad crossing with no gates or lights, just a stop sign, asking you to stop and look at both sides of the track before you cross. I used to make sure to stop and look but recently Iâ€™ve just been blowing through it. Sure itâ€™s not very likely that a train would be rolling through when I am but I still blow through it. I just really donâ€™t care if a train is coming or not.  Not that I have this strong urge to die, but I just wouldnâ€™t care if I did. Anyone else experience feelings like this before?
