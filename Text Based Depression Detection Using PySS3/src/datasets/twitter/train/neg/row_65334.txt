There's no reason for me to be here.I can't remember the last time I've woken up excited to go back to life. I can't remember the last time I've felt good about something. I'm trying to accept that i will never be happy and I should just get used to it but it's hard. Anytime I feel a little hopeful it's gone in an instant.
