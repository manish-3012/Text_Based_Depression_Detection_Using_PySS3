I canâ€™t keep doing this anymoreI hate myself 
I donâ€™t want to be here at all anymore 
I have an eating disorder that is because of dysphoria and I dropped from 60kg to 43kg
My mother has been making me eat high fanntening foods so I am bloated and have some stomach fat from eating like this for 3-4 weeks and I cannot stand it I have breakdowns and feel very over sensitive about my stomach area so much that I have to wear baggier clothes I canâ€™t stand the feeling of my stomach and I canâ€™t handle counting calories and looking in the mirror and seeing my shit body and I canâ€™t deal with the daily misery of it all anymore I have asked for help and have received none and nothing will ever make this go away I hate being here I had a fucking whiny breakdown because I couldnâ€™t find my box of razors and I have to deal with this and I canâ€™t handle the weight gain I donâ€™t want to recover I want to kill myself because Iâ€™m so sick of this every day
