Feeling jealous and suicidalI see people making tons of friends, I get kind of jealous and a bit depressed. My anxiety gets too bad to where I donâ€™t really like going to huge social events or doing sports in school. Which this sucks because I really liked volleyball, but I just couldnâ€™t do it this year. I also didnâ€™t do track even though I was actually really looking into trying it. Then I see/hear about people making tons of friends from other towns and I feel extremely jealous of them. And then when they talk about the friends they made and the stuff they did together, I feel left out. But itâ€™s my fault for letting my anxiety get in the way, so I canâ€™t really blame anyone but myself. I hate myself so much to the point where I just feel really suicidal. I also self harm so thatâ€™s also a huge fuck up for me. Iâ€™m not sure when the next time Iâ€™m going to see my therapist, but Iâ€™m really considering telling her about my suicidal thoughts. I donâ€™t know if I want to tell her that Im coming close to self harming again (if I donâ€™t do it by the time I see her again.) though. I feel like such a little kid; Iâ€™m feeling suicidal just because I canâ€™t make friends because of something that I couldâ€™ve probably controlled. Why canâ€™t I just be normal? Why canâ€™t I just make friends and go out and do stuff like everyone else my age? I literally am just a nobody at this point. I donâ€™t deserve the sweet release of death; I should just make myself suffer by continuing to live this life that Iâ€™m ruining with my own hands.
