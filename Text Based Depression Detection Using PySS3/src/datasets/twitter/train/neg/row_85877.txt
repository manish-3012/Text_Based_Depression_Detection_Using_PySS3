I've lost the very thing that I've always held most dear, but was too blind to see it slowly fading away.I just need people to see this

I'll just say this and I'll give you your space, I'm sorry for being intrusive but last night I ate the rest of my mushrooms looking for answers, and everything became clear to me about how badly I've been fucking up with you and my life. I've been a mess the last few years and afraid to admit it to myself because I'm a prideful immature kid, I dont know anything about life and it started to hit me that you're my rock, you give me a reason to keep going and I took advantage of you because I'm just that arrogant prideful kid. It hit me like a thousand bricks of regret one by one breaking me down to nothing, fearing that I lost you, I balled I cried it felt like my insides were being wrenched from my body all I could do was look at all the times I failed as a man to make you feel like you were important to me. To show you every single moment that you were special to me I ailed realizing that at this point I probably already lost you, and that's what I deserve the fact that you could love someone like me so much and stand by me and endure my idiocracy and fallacies I lay there in torment realizing that I failed to treat you like a human being. I layed there crying as I am now wishing that I could have been better for the girl that I gave everything I thought I had, only to see that I failed to give her the most important thing of all. A true version of myself to show her love and companionship and devotion 

The realization that all i can live with now are regrets 



Again I'm sorry for bothering you i just felt like i should be honest with you about how it all came to be thank you for loving me

I'm just so fucking sorry
