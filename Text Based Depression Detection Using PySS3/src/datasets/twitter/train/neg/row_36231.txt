My best friend committed suicide a year ago todayI lost my best friend a year ago today and today is tough.. Kieran was a friend that I enjoyed being around as he always brought a smile to my face.. I could go on and on about stories and what made him so fun to be around but I wonâ€™t.. I just want to let you know that itâ€™s okay to be sad and have bad thoughts itâ€™s what makes us human itâ€™s ok to talk to someone and be upset. Although I lost my cousin and best friend to suicide it doesnâ€™t mean that I stop loving and living my life but instead I know have motivation to live since I feel like I have to succeed in life and do things in life that ryan and Kieran canâ€™t.. I am so proud to be apart of this Reddit and see everyoneâ€™s perspective and life story.. stay safe and be kind to one another
