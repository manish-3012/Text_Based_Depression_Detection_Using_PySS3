What's keeps you guys/gals going?I think about suicide almost everyday it seems. I'm not close to my family and I have no real close friends but the only thing that keeps me going are two things. Music and the concept of Power.

 I'm sure universally we all enjoy music but it helps me get away from my own self hating mindset and let's me think clearer. The idea of power and getting stronger physically just feels natural. I was always picked and bullied during school so I've always felt weak throughout most of my life. I workout regularly nowadays and have lost a decent chunk of weight which helps with my low self esteem. 

What about all of yall?
