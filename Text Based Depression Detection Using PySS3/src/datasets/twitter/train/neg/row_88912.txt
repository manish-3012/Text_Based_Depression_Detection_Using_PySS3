I just feel like jumpingIdk man, every time I'm near a ledge or a window I just kinda wanna jump, see what would happen. Im not depressed or anything, if I was I most likely couldn't recognize it since I'm alexythimic. Today I was at the hospital getting a new prescription for my glasses, then I kinda leaned over stairs saw it was a big drop and started lifting my leg. Then I was like, dude wtf. Not sure if this qualifies for this sub but I just want to share this with someone
