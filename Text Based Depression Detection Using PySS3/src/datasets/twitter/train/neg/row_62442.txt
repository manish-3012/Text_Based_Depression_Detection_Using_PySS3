I can't stop thinking about killing myselfAnd I'm too afraid to tell anyone, especially my psychiatrist. I can't tolerate being hospitalized right now. There are too many extenuating circumstances, not the least of which the likelihood that I might be fired for taking off with no notice. I feel like Reddit is the only place I can voice this, where no one knows who I am.
