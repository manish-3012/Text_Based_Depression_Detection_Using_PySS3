No reason to do it, but no reason not to do it. Though some would disagree on either one. I don't feel like writing a long wall of text of the reasons I want to die. I've had suicidal thoughts for over half my life, and have only acted on them a couple times, all unsuccessfully. But here's the breakdown of why, in bulleted form. 

* I molested a girl my age in her sleep a few years ago.
* I'm a pedophile. That is, attracted to underage and prepubescent girls. 
* I have dropped out of college because I can't seem to succeed in it. 
* I lost my job (minimum wage in retail) after having an anxiety attack and leaving the store. 
* That same anxiety keeps me home all the time. I can't handle groups larger than two or three.  
* I've been in treatment for years, but the medication I'm on leaves me feeling emotionally neutered and tired. But without it, I am a danger to myself and others. With it, I'm still unhappy. 

That's not all, of course. I've had a whole lifetime leading up to where I am now, and all of it has contributed, but I don't feel I need to explain more than the above.
