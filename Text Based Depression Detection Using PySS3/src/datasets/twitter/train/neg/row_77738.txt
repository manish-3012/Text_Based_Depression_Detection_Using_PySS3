i just wish i had someone to talk to.ive thought about killing myself for over 4 years now and im just tired. so exhausted. im 14 almost 15. i would like to talk to my mom, but she doesn't believe me. i want to call a hotline, but i dont want the cops to show up and my mom get pissed at me because 'i didnt tell her'. my brothers couldnt give less of a shit and my dad lives across the country and i dont like him anyway.
