Loosing HopeFor months I've been stressed because of my narc mom. I hate being with her I really do. She ruins holidays and makes life very stressful. I lost my pet this year and she wanted to throw away his things right away. Everyone else is far away and I wasn't comfortable talking to friends or family about deep problems, part of it that my family always just told me to turn to religion. I'm not religious. I did make a memorial for him but someone threw it away like trash. I finally tell my friends and only one gives a care. No one else does. I've been making plans to escape my narc mom but it's been really stressful. All this stress gas been building and building and building. Sometimes it's hard to just get up and walk.Today she stressed me out then mocked me because I was having an anxiety attack, or maybe panic. Then she yelled at me. I try, I try so hard every day. I just want to lay down and rot. I don't know if it's worth it anymore.
