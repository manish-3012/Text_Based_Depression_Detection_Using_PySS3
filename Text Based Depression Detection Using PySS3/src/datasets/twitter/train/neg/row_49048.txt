Iâ€™m tiredIâ€™m tired of being only good enough for people when they need something. Iâ€™m tired of being the only one in any of my relationships (friends, family, girls). Iâ€™m tired of being ridiculed by people before they know me. Iâ€™m just tired of trying to be happy when I know I can never be. I tired of this so called â€œrealityâ€. I just want the pain to stop. Everyday is the constant battle of asking myself should I or shouldnâ€™t? And everyday I inch ever closer to do it. Iâ€™m tired and just want to rest.
