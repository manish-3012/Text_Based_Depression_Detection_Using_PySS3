I see three doors. Two of which are locked.20/M 
I am failing university because of chronic depression, and I cannot keep a job due to the same reason. My parents are threatening to evict me next week if I don't shape up. I only see one valid solution, as I have tried everything I could. (Bribery, Begging, Therapy, etc.)  As the deadline approaches, I see no reason to live on homeless, penniless, and hopeless. The thread is about to snap, and I have no choice but to fall. I can only hope that I won't fail this attempt like I failed everything else.
