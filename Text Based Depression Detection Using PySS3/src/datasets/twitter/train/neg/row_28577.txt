Another rantIâ€™m so furious right now. I was driving home with my mother and for some reason she just stared at me. She said â€œDo you believe in Heaven and Hell?â€ I was so confused because it was out of fucking nowhere. I lied and said â€œYes.â€ She then followed with, and I kid you not, â€œYou know that if you commit suicide, you go to Hell?â€ Within 3 seconds, I was filled with so much confusion and anger. I just simply answered â€œYes.â€ She just said alright and turned up the radio(she was playing a christian station. I canâ€™t believe that just fucking happened. Why would she even think to say something like that? Do you know how worse that just made me feel today? She doesnâ€™t because she wouldnâ€™t be able to comprehend my struggle ever since I was disabled child. My family has noticed me being depressed but donâ€™t offer anything but praying at night. Iâ€™m just so fucking broken. Fuck! Why would she say that to me? If Iâ€™m going to Hell for being gay anyway so why shouldnâ€™t I just hang myself, tonight? Iâ€™m so fucking angry. Apart of me just wants to end it all tonight out of spite but if I do, she wins. She loses a son to the Devil but if she knew I was gay, it wouldnâ€™t matter. Being the closet is so exhausting and it makes me feel so inferior. I fucking hate everybody. I am so hurt at the moment. This day just turned so much worse. I just want to bleed and go to sleep. I had/still have so much guilt being that I was a â€œmiracle childâ€(had a trach) and was prayed for so much just to be a faggot. I hated myself so much because I thought the devil was using me. Now, I have left that mindset but here came my mother bringing up the pain for, again, no goddamn reason. I hope she never asks me why I am sad because all I will think about is her telling me what she said today. All these years of hiding who I am and wishing I was never born. Fuck her for that. Shit like this makes me hate so called â€œrighteousâ€ people so much( No disrespect to believers.) My family is so ignorant and today was just another display. They wonder why I isolate myself and stay in my own head.
