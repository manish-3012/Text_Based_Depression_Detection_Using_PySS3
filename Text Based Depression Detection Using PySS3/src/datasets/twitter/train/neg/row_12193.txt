Trying to fight the urgeIâ€™ve just got home after being on a psych hold for a few days. I called for help after I was so close to ending my life and wanted some help. 
But now Iâ€™m back home Iâ€™m struggling again all I want to do is end my life and take a load of pills and put me out of my misery. I donâ€™t know whether Iâ€™m strong enough to fight the urge by myself anymore. They werenâ€™t helpful on the ward just had someone watching me all the time. 
Maybe I will fight the urge maybe not
