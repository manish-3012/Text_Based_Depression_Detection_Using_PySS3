Today is the day I kill myself.Today is the day I kill myself. I just can't take it anymore. I am a terrible and horrible person. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will go to work and wrap everything up, I don't want to burden others. I will then come home and end it all. No one will notice until Wed, if they even do, so there is plenty of time.

Why am I posting this? I have no idea. I hope I succeed. I hope someone looks after and loves my cat. I hope dealing with my stuff is not too much of a problem. I just can't live this lie of my life anymore.

Goodbye world.
