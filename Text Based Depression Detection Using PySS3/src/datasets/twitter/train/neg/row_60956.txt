Unbearable painA relationship I was in (3ish years) recently ended. He's already moved on and it's barely been a week or two. It makes me unbearably depressed that he probably didn't love me for as long as I loved him and was probably happy to be gone from me. I cant help but wonder why he wants so many people but not me in the end.

Normally one should be able to get over this eventually like all painful breakups, but I'm also suffering from major depression and anxiety amongst other disorders, so it feels like this pain is being amplified 10x to the point that I feel like I must kill myself over it. I know that I don't, but with this quarantine forcing me to be isolated and alone, I wonder if this is God's way of saying that this is it for me.
