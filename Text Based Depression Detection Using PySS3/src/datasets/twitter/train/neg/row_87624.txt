I have just called the suicide hotline for the first time.I couldn't help but cry in shame during the entire conversation. I am a 32 yr old Korean American and unfortunately I have no one I could really talk to about what I'm going through. I am too ashamed.

For the past 2 days I have been thinking about committing suicide in a very specific way; death by car exhaust ventilation through a car window with a hose. She told she I would be getting a call back. I gave her my cell number. I still want to go through with it. I can't get this outta my mind.
