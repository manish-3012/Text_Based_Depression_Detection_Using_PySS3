I sincerely want to die.My dreams are falling through around me, and I can't go on. I got accepted to my dream educational program, but I needed to earn money. I tried like hell to find a job to no avail, I had to cut the year to a semester, but it still looks like I won't be able to afford it. I pulled myself out of mental illness for this shit, and to have it yanked away is more than I can bear. And nobody is telling me I can do it, it's just "well, here's what you do if you can't." But that's not an option for me; I would be a failure for the rest of my life. 

So I seriously just want to die.
