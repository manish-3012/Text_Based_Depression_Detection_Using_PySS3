I don't think I can handle much more.I've been on a downward spiral for years. I met my wife six years ago when we were in high school, and everything with her has been great. We went to college together. We've been doing our hobbies together. I love what I do... But I don't. I just quit my job today. I've been so depressed I can't focus on work. I can't enjoy my hobbies. My wife and I moved last December away from all of our friends, and even with her here I feel so alone. I'm horrible at making friends. I've been going to conventions for 5 years and I have only made 2 friends. I made 3 friends in college and now everyone is so far away. I want friends. I want to feel like I'm good at something. I feel so depressed. I've actually been hurting myself lately... It's tearing me and my wife apart and I don't know how to help it. It's even started to make her lose interest in things... I don't even know what I'm saying, I just need help
