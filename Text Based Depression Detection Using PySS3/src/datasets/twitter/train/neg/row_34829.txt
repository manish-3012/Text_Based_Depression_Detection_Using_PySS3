I am suicidal and empty from insideI don't feel any love or any emotion for my family. I don't even feel like going to her funeral. 

My solution to everything is suicide. If my mom dies, I will slit my throat the very day.


I don't know what love is, I just pretended that I was sad. In reality, I was thinking about videogames, what to eat tomorrow and other random thoughts.
I am not even sad. I know, I will miss her!



I feel no love, desire for connection and care for anyone ( including family)

I fake sympathy, caring for family and basic social obligations.


I have emotions, I cry only when things don't go my way.
