Not sad anymore, just dead insideI can't find any answers. I'm hopeless and I feel like I will never find anyone. I'd rather be dead than lonely. Finding it hard to hold on. I'm in catch-22: I have emotional problems because of my loneliness. My emotional problems scare girls away. I am lonely because of this. Thus it is an endless loop which I can't get out. (It's funny because I'm quite good looking, funny, intelligent and quite charismatic but I've never had a gf. But I just can't work out my downfall)
