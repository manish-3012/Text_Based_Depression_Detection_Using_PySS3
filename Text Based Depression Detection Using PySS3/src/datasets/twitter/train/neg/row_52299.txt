I feel hopeless and just need to ventThis post is kind of long sorry, I just feel like explaining everything might help me. 

Over the past weeks I have felt like absolute crap. And I have never told anyone any of this. I have had a really low self confidence since 7th grade (I'm a sophomore in college now) because I got picked on almost everyday through out middle school and a lot of high school. I know college is different and people are supposed to be more understanding but I never got over being picked on so much. So now I have very few friends and trust no one, not even my parents. Most of my friends are going to a different college, so I have two close friends here with me, and they are dating each other. So if one is busy usually both are busy which means I'm left by myself. On top of that, they make me realize how much I want a girl friend and how alone I feel. Every girl I go after I end up in friend zone with. On top of that I feel like I let my family down because I haven't had a girl friend. My little brother told me my Mom thought I was gay. I have been called names and picked on before but having my Mom call me gay was by far the worst. I have nothing against gay people, but for my Mom to question me like that destroyed how I felt about my parents and how I felt about myself. I'm just tired of being alone and I don't see anyway to change it. On top of it my best friend joined the marines and is in basic training, so I haven't been able to talk to him in a couple months.
