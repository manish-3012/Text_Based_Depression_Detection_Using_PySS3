it is the answerI want someone to know. I've been depressed for 10 years and I've lost all my friends, who were the reason I never did it before. I don't have anyone now. I'm thinking about tomorrow, somehow someway just doing it. I want it but I dont. But I want it. The only questions nagging at me is how long till someone finds me and how many people would be sad if they heard. Because there would be no funeral. No one is left for that. Justifying this is what keeps me up at night. It is the answer and I think I will. Strangers on the Internet seemed like a viable option for letting someone know I exist for a little while longer.
