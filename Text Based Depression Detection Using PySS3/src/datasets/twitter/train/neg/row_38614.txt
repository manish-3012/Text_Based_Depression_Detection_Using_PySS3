Do Voices inside my head related to any disorders?My Voices always answers my questions, thoughts, and sometimes reminding me of something that i forgot.

I don't know if i diagnosed with schizophrenia, but i'm pretty sure i have social anxiety/Anti-Social

Edit : i tried to asked my parents to go to Psychological Doctor 
My Dad Agrees, but my Mother were like (with anger response) 

"You're just imagining, i seen you playing games "normally" (yes i'm a gamer that is the only thing that keep my mood on) you will get over it! Keep praying and remember god (She's really religious, but it doesn't help me anyways)

Edit 2 : it could be my Imagination but i wonder if it's related to Anti-Social/Social Anxiety.
