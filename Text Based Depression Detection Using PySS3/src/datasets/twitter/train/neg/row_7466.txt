Just need some advice.So...my mind has been concerning me lately. For the past year or so, I have been having what I think are suicidal thoughts. Every day I think about how/when I would carry out the act. At one point this included self-harm, but I have since managed to stop. The only thing really stopping me is my family. Now that exams are coming up and stress has been mounting, the thoughts are more vivid and frequent. Despite this, I don't think that I'm depressed since I get to class every day and manage to get my work done mostly on time and in a satisfactory manner. I smile and laugh, yet these morbid thoughts persist. Does anyone have any idea what this may mean? What should I do?
