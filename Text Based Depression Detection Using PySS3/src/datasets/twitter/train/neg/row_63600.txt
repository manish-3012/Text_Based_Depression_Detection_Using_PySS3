I'm new to reddit, but I don't know where else to go.For a while now, I've wanted to die. I just hate to let my family and friends down. Do any of you know what I can write in a letter to make them understand it's not their fault? Or have any of you ever been through a loss like this? How long did it take you to move on and did you blame yourself?
I don't want to hurt anyone, but I don't want to live anymore either. Any advice, reddit?

Edit: I know people love me and that I have a fairly good life. To be honest, I don't know why I want to die. I haven't been through any trauma or anything, and I have a good family and good friends and I do well in school. But I guess there's just something wrong in my brain because I can't seem to be happy no matter what I do. I don't need you to tell me how much people love me, because I know. What I need to know, is how to keep them from blaming themselves later.
