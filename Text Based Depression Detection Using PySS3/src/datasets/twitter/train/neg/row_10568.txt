I haven't left the house in 5 years and have accumulated a massive debt.For years I've been signing up to college classes for to get myself loans and haven't attended a single class, I did this to get money so I could eat and survive. These college loans stick with you for life and never disappear even if you file for bankruptcy. I'm 24 years old with no job, education and little experience.

I've been a shut-in for 5 years now and spend most of my day doing nothing and sleeping. I don't indulge in any hobbies or have any additictions which would lead a person to shut themselves in, there's nothing wrong with me and this is just the way I am. Don't worry though, I've come to terms that I won't survive for long and will have to take my own life.

Face it, I'm screwed.
