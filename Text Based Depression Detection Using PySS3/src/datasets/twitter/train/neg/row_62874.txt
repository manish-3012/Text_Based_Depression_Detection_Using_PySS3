Alone. Losing my daughter.I feel like giving up. 

Long story short- I have a 3 year old and Iâ€™m being pressured to give up custody of her from my father and stepmom and my stbx husband and his mother. Everything seems extremely fishy, and although this may be â€œtemporaryâ€ because I can no longer live with my parents. I just lost my job on Friday. I havenâ€™t seen my child in almost two weeks. My father is an alcoholic and I know this will mess up my sweet little girl. I canâ€™t leave her and itâ€™s killing me. 

I just feel so alone. I feel so alienated, by my own family and hopeless. Iâ€™ll lose my car, I have no money. My head and my life is one big fucking mess and the only thing that has kept me from harming myself is my daughter. But if Iâ€™m going to lose her and she will hate me for having to give her up, whatâ€™s the point? 


The only reason I would consider letting them have temporary custody is for a stable home for my daughter. Her dad is military and isnâ€™t around. But every fiber of me screams to not do this, donâ€™t let her go. Fight for her. I feel alone and lost. I want to check myself in and get help but I canâ€™t leave her. My feelings and thoughts are everywhere.
