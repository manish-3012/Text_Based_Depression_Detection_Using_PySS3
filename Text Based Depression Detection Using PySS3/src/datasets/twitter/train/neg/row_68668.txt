Actual suicide watch (Updated daily.)Iâ€™m going to go ahead and make this post so I can keep track of my nights (since thatâ€™s when the feelings hit the strongest.) of when I feel suicidal or not. Sorta like an update post. 

11/11/19: felt suicidal all day and had a few people reach out to me in the morning. Talked to a school friend for half the night before my boyfriend stepped in and decided to talk to me for the rest of the night we fell asleep on a call together and I felt better hearing his sweet soothing voice.
