I just can't deal with this anymore.I feel so alone and like everyone has better things to do than to hang out with me. I haven't made a friend who actually wants to hang out with me in over five years. All of my friends I had in my early 20s are now estranged and leading their own lives. The closest thing I have to a friend now is a few of my colleagues at work, but it has been over a year since I started this job and moved to this new city and I haven't gone on a single outing with any of them. I just go to work, try not to be miserable, and go home. It's at the point where I don't even want to go home because all I have is a computer to occasionally play games on and a TV to re-watch the same shows I have watched a million times.

I would ask my coworkers if they want to hang out, but I am so terrified of being rejected and having my fear that nobody gives a shit about me confirmed. I've given up on trying and question why to even continue. Why go on just to earn money to support a life that I don't enjoy living? Usually when I am alone I just let YouTube shuffle through random videos because I have lost my ability to choose something of interest... because nothing interests me anymore.

These suicidal thoughts are getting worse. I think about veering my car off the road into a tree, or hanging myself. I've thought about buying a gun. I think about overdosing. I am close to doing it and I am scared. I'm afraid to tell anyone how I am feeling because it'll probably scare them off. I don't want to go to a mental hospital because even though I qualify for FMLA at work I'll have no valid excuse for when I come back. I would turn to my family but they're all dealing with their own stresses right now and I don't want to add on top of it. I lost a sibling to suicide already and I don't want to put them through it again... I thought I was stronger than this, but I'm just not.

I really don't want to die... **but I also don't want to live.**
