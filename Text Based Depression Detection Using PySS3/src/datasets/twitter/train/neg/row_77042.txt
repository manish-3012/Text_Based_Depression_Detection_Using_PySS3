Can't imagine living the rest of my lifeI'm 24. I can't imagine living another 60 years. I can hardly imagine making it to the end of my grad school program, which is only a year away. I've been depressed since 13 and suicidal since 14. With almost everything I do, there's an undercurrent of "I would rather be dead than do this thing," and that's on good days. On bad days, the only way to get through is to imagine how I might kill myself soon.

It's hard to believe that most people don't live like this. Most people don't actively want to die 90% of the time. I wish no one gave a shit about me so I could just end it without worrying about my loved ones. I feel trapped in my life. I almost killed myself when I was 17, and survived an attempt at 20. I wish I had died years ago. I can't imagine feeling this way for decades more. I just want it to end.
