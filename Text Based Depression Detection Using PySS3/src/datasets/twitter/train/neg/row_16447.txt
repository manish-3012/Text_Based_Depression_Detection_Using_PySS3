An update on my post from earlier. My wife died today.So all of her friends are spamming me, blaming me, and I'm barred from the funeral. I understand, I did some bad things in the past, but I've been actively working on them.

She directly told me, yesterday, that it's not my fault. Because she forgave me.

I'm still in shock. But I might cry.
