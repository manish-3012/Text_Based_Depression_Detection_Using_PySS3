Voluntary admission to hospital with suicidal thoughtsHi. Ive had suicidal thoughts for some time now and recently they took a turn for the worse. Not tried anything yet but the thoughts have gone from ideation to intention. I want to voluntarily admit myself to hospital. What can I expect when I do this? I'm in the U.K. Will they just talk to me then let me go or will I be sectioned?
