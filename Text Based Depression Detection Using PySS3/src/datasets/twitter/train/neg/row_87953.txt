Having a friend tell you theyâ€™re thinking about suicide is the worst feeling ever.I have helped tons of people with suicidal thoughts without even knowing their names, but having a close friend tell you theyâ€™re seriously considering, or even just having thoughts about it really pushes me to the edge. Theyâ€™re my friends, my family, a part of my life. I couldnâ€™t live without them. It hurts. It made me realize that maybe someone thought the same for me. Maybe someone else wanted me here as much as I did them. Youâ€™re worth it. There are people out there who care for you. Whether you know it or not. I care for you too. I want you here, and you should want yourself here too. You are a beautiful and amazing human being who deserves to live. Stay with me. I love you.
