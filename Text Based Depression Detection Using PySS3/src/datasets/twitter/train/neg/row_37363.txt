Nothing left for me here.I'm too dyspraxic to learn to drive, I don't have a job and have very few skills towards getting one. To me driving is kind of like sex, either you did it in high school &amp; are experienced now &amp; reaping the benefits of that, or you missed out and will never be able to do it. Incidentally I have never been in a relationship either, partially due to insecurities about relationships from my home life growing up (I'm female btw, fwiw). 

So im just gonna spend my life as some adult baby who can't go on the trips everyone else seems to be going on, to the mountains, to exciting new towns, etc. Instead I'm stuck at home as if I'd never matured past middle school. 

Fuck that.  That's fucking it for me. I don't care about making ppl sad or crying for help, though I'm sorry if I do make anyone sad. I just want out.
