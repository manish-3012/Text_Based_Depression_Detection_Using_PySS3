strugglingso iâ€™ve just been struggling with the difficulty that is living life. i feel like i have nothing to live for. itâ€™s like a part of me wants to live but another part of me just wants to slip into the abyss because i know that itâ€™d be so much easier. iâ€™m just wondering, what is the point? i have nothing, i am nothing, so why not?
