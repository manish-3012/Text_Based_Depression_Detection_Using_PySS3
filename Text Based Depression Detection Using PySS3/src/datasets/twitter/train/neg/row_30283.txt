you ever just feel so alone ?you ever just feel so alone ? like sometimes i sit on my bed, in complete darkness and i feel so alone. i know im not alone tho, my parents and siblings are in the other rooms just a couple feet away from me, yet i still feel alone. my mom is always at work and my sisters are always together, sometimes iâ€™ll sit in my room crying cuz i feel so incredibly alone, and i hear my sisters just laughing in the other room while watching a movie together, as my mom sleeps. sometimes i just feel like i have no right to be feeling so sad, thereâ€™s people that have it worse right ? i use to s/h and my mom would tell me to stop and that â€œpeople have it worseâ€ and if i keep on going on like this that she would just put me into foster care, i donâ€™t think she understood what exactly she did, because the one time that i ever reached out to someone she made me feel like i have no right to be feeling the way i feel. ever since the idea of opening up scares me, i just bottle everything up until i explode and cry and cry, even then i just stay silent. i donâ€™t understand why i even feel the way i do, i donâ€™t have it bad, but then again why am i so sad, and why do i feel so alone ? honestly its just come to the point where iâ€™ve been ranting in my notes app, when i read back on them i feel so stupid for feeling this way, but i canâ€™t help it.
