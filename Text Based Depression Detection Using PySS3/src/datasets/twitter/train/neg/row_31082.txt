My problems are not as bad as most peoples here but I still feel like absolute shit. I don't deserve anything.I barely talk to anyone, I am always in my house, which is really good for an 18 year old. I have never had a gf and probably never will because I am just too shy to talk to anyone like a normal person. I know I will never kill myself because I am too scared to do that and I couldn't do that to my family. I am meant to go to collage in a month, it will be just another failure in my life. People never take me seriously, most of the time I get ignored, I only get noticed when they need something from me. Its almost 5am and I am writing this. I just want to talk to someone. So if anyone has time to waste I am here.
