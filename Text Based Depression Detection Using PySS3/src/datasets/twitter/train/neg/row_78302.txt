I will die alone and want it to happen soonIâ€˜ve been suicidal since childhood (often more passively) and depressed and more actively suicidal for about two years now. However, I havenâ€™t done anything yet because I cannot do it when my parents are still alive, I love them. I also have a great family doctor and a psychiatrist who are helping me. To be honest, all I crave for is someone who likes me or hugs me and tells me itâ€˜ll be better one day. I fall in love easily, donâ€™t care about looks or profession too much, a guy just needs to be friendly and  thatâ€™s it. But I have always been too shy to tell a guy I like him because I feel like itâ€™s impossible someone likes me ... I have a good circle of friends but I havenâ€˜t told anyone about my suicide plans because I donâ€˜t want to bother them and I donâ€˜t know what will be their reaction (I am usually the positive and funny one amongst my friends and they are always like â€žwhy are you always the only one amongst is who is single? donâ€˜t you want to become a mother? youâ€˜d do great!â€œ).
I really crave for a relationship - two weeks ago, I met an amazing guy, really kind, intelligent and funny. When he said he wants to see me again, I panicked and told him I want him to find someone else because Iâ€˜m depressed and suicidal. He said he still wants to see me and wants me to get better. He was very supportive until today - but every night I was crying alone in bed because I realised I need someone like him but because he means so much to me, I donâ€˜t want him to be with me but to find someone healthy and sane. I thought maybe Iâ€˜ll get used to it, but whenever we went for a walk or tea I came back home afterwards and started crying because I like him so much but I want him to hate me because I am not worth it. Today, I told him for the third time that I love him but I am not worth it for him. He insisted he wants to help me but I insisted that he should look for someone else ... how come I do this? I am crying now because I fear he thinks I am lying and actually I just donâ€˜t like him. I fear he thinks he did something wrong. And I fear I have just pushed away the only chance for me to get better. Although I love them, I hope my parents will die soon so I can finally leave as well, I donâ€˜t deserve to be here and I donâ€˜t want to waste any more space or resources in this Earth
