Even death is too good for methis is a random rant of anything and everything I need to get off my chest.

everything in this world is too good for me. my girlfriend is eventually going to leave me for someone actually worth her time. my friends can't wait to get rid of me. I'm disgusting, revolting, useless, a failure and I don't deserve anything I have. I don't deserve to live, but I don't deserve the peace of death either. having to live through my life is what I deserve, with the pain of having to be surrounded by people but constantly alone with nothing but myself. it's not like I'm actually in pain anyway, I just overreact, to pretend Im an actual person with actual emotions and struggles. so many people have it worse than me, and I'm just a horrible and selfish pig. death is too good for me and my punishment for being such a fuckup is having to carry on existing.
