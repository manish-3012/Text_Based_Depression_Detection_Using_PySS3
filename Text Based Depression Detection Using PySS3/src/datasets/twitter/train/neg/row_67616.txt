Sometimes I just want out.Sometimes I just want out. I feel like I have nothing to live for. I don't consider myself to be truly close to anybody in this world. I'm almost 25 years old and I feel like I've lived a completely unfulfilling life. Sure, I'm young and I could turn it around, but I've told myself I would a thousand times before and things always end up the same. Will I kill myself? Probably not today, but I think it's an inevitability that some day I will. I'm an introvert and I don't know how to make new friends. I just graduated college, I can't find a job, and I worry that once I do find a job it will only lead me towards a life of disappointment. I'm so unhappy with my life. I haven't been with a girl in years and I'm convinced that my overwhelming insecurities would sabotage any potential relationship anyways. I don't know what to do. I wish I could just end it all but I know it would ruin my family's lives. But some day, when life's disappointments become too much to bare, I might have to disregard their feelings and make that selfish decision. I don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this, I guess I just need to vent. Thanks for reading.
