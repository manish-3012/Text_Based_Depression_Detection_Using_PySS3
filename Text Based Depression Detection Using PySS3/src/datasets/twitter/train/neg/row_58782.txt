Feeling like the worst version of a personLike the title says. Feeling like an absolute worm. I feel like I ruin and hurt everyone I come into contact with. Just remembering in the words of my parents when I was in second grade, "You're a mean person and no one's ever gonna wanna be your friend." Feeling that I ruin and hurt everyone. :( Very sad hours also quite a bit drunk shfjekskfjd
