running away and after a few days, killing myself.made a post about it yesterday , but i made a plan and it makes the whole idea of killing myself even more comforting and iâ€™m even more sure of it now. 

in a couple weeks it will be my 15th birthday. iâ€™m planning on killing myself on my birthday, and running away a few days before. 

i canâ€™t do it anymore, iâ€™m so broken down and i donâ€™t even know if i can feel sad anymore. i know itâ€™s dramatic but i truly just feel hollow. iâ€™m running away to a larger city in my state, which i am pretty close to and just living my life for the next few days before i kill myself. i can imagine it so clearly and the thought of living on the edge then killing myself seems amazing. 

of course, i know the risks and dangers but iâ€™m not planning on staying alive for a long time after i run away, maybe a day or two. i donâ€™t want to just kill myself after being locked up for 8 months. iâ€™m not even joking i havenâ€™t been out of my house in 8 months, except for once a week to take the trash to the curb. itâ€™s killing me, my mental health was so bad and my suicidal thoughts were so bad before this but being locked up like this is hell. i canâ€™t even go to grocery stores. anywhere. 

i canâ€™t force myself to live through the months and possibly years long process of going through court systems, CPS, etc to get away from an abusive household. and all the stress and pressure, tension between me and my mom. i cant take it anymore. 

iâ€™m going to do something fun with my look before i do it, cut and dye my hair a few times and just have fun, for the first time in years. 

suicide hotlines or text hotlines donâ€™t help. talking to my friends doesnâ€™t help. nothing helps anymore. this is my only option. thank you to everyone who has helped me out the last few years that iâ€™ve visited this subreddit. youâ€™ve talked me out of it numerous times , and i appreciate that. just needed to rant.
