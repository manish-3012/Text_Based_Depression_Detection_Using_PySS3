What if Iâ€™m sick of putting on a brave face...You know maybe Iâ€™m just not cut out for this shit. My depressions and anxiety has made me horrible mother. Weâ€™re at the point where my toddler pretends crying when I do. I try to keep it private, I used to have a place I could go punch my legs. I havenâ€™t cut in over a month, but thatâ€™s not even what I want. I do not want to punch, I do not want to scream in to a pillow, and I donâ€™t want to fuckin meditate.  No. I wonâ€™t.  These are temporary. My child deserves a better mom than what sheâ€™s got... the older she gets, the worse I feel... itâ€™s been a really long time since I have felt this bad, a million little bad things happened just one after the other. Please donâ€™t tell me tomorrow will be better, I have been a test rat for drugs for so long, no matter what they give me Iâ€™m still going to wake up wishing that I never have. 


These things are hard to say to family and friends, they keep telling me to change, or try harder for the sake of my child. Iâ€™m trying so hard, I bathe her every other day, we read and cuddle and I teach her things... but sometimes I still feel like she deserves so much better; and it makes me want to die



I tried to OD on Xanax but I guess I have a pretty high tolerance. What is that some sort of fuckin sign? Live one more day? Because Iâ€™m tired.... and I want to be a pussy and I want to be a quitter.
