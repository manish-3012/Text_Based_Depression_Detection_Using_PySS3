The burning end of a midnight cigaretteThe darkest thoughts claw their way through every shred of self respect I ever thought I had. Years of terrible decisions have led family and friends to turn their backs on me. Maybe going through life lonely and forgotten is the punishment for my crimes. Maybe existence isn't mine to have anymore. I truly don't know how to go on anymore.

A life time of fucking things up fixed in one determined flash.
