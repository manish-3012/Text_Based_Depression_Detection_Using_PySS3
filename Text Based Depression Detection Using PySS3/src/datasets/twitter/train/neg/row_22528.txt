Therapy is extremely difficultFar more than I ever thought it would be.

Have to meditate everyday, write things in a diary everyday, remember all the trauma I've endured from the present to the past, write how I feel everyday...

Also... I have to think about the worst possible scenario that could happen to me everyday for thirty minutes...

God, it's very difficult... If I can't do it or get better, my psychologist told me that she could send me to another one who may have a different method to help...

I don't want the money my family's spending on me to be in vain, but the pain is very, very, very strong... 

I CAN'T TAKE THIS LONELINESS ANYMORE, WHY DO I HAVE TO DO ALL THE HARD WORK BY MY OWN, WHY?!

I DIDN'T ASK TO BE HURT, I DIDN'T ASK TO BE TREATED LIKE TRASH!

And now... I HAVE TO FIX BOTH MY MISTAKES, AND THE DAMAGE THAT WAS WILLINGLY INFLICTED ON ME...

It's not fair, it's not freaking fair...
