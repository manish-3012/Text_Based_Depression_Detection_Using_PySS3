psych unitsI haven't taken my pills and I dont want to. I want to die. I want to hang myself like I've always fantasized about. the longer I stay around the harder its gonna be for my girlfriend and my mom. my last therapist recommended I go to a psych ward voluntarily but I'm too scared. I haven't seen her in months because I moved. I haven't gotten a new therapist or psychiatrist yet and my medicine isn't working. I'm too scared I'll run out of money so I always talk myself out of making appointments. I dont have the money for a psych unit. i dont know what to do besides die
