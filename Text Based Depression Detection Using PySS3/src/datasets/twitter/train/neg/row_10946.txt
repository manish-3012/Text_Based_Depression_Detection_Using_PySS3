Itâ€™s not depression. Itâ€™s who I am.I am not depressed. I am Void of emotions. Perhaps a sociopath or another form of soul dis function. 
Too scared to live and too scared to die. 
Interim zombie land. I am faking it to everyone around me. No one really knows what itâ€™s like to be me. Void. Dark. Fake. 
Looking for someone to do a joint suicide with because why not. Better than being alone. 
This is the secret I keep, until now. 

Iâ€™m sick of myself. Utterly disgusted with my being, my soul, my core. Ugly. Although I am not ugly physically.  My insides are bleak, dark, devious.... And I have cultivated a life that I dreamed of because I am so dark inside, I sought out the most enlightened, loving, giving, gorgeous, light, hopeful, creative, humanitarian, loving people in my life- a community that one could only dream of having. And I did. I created this community. And now I cannot keep faking who I am. An outsider. A fake. A liar. Lowlife. 
I want to disappear. 
I canâ€™t be around people because I have nothing to give, because I am empty inside. No love lives in me, and I can only give as much as I have to offer. Empty. And what is life without love, connection and emotions?!?
I am stuck in this place. Between worlds empty and alone even though I have friends and people that love me and a family this is so loving. I am an outsider.... And no one knows. Itâ€™s fucking crazy. 35 now and itâ€™s been this way for so long. I am dumb, empty, and envious of everyone around for their love. Love is everything and I donâ€™t have it in me. Never have.

I want to die and I want a partner to do it with me.....

Any takers?
