Iâ€™ve lost everythingOne of my best friends committed suicide about two weeks ago.

Earlier this week, my girlfriend broke up with me.

To make things even worse, my anxiety and obsessional thoughts are at an all-time high.

I barely eat and just want to sleep all day. Iâ€™m extremely lethargic and so passive during conversations with other people.

It got so bad that my girlfriend kept mentioning how quiet I am lately. That I keep shutting her out. I lack initiative.

I donâ€™t want to keep on living like this. This isnâ€™t me. My life feels like one big curse.

I honestly have nothing left to live for. Everything is tainted with negativity and dark thoughts. I stay inside all day waiting till I have enough courage to end it.
