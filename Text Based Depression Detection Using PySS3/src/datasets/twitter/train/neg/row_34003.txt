I want to end it allI [17M] have been going through depression but I canâ€™t seem to open up to anyone. I pushed my ex-girlfriend away because she tried helping me and my lack of communication just didnâ€™t let me open up to her, I canâ€™t even open up and talk to my parents or a therapist. I feel alone and want to end it all, I pushed almost all the people who mean something to me away. I have trust issues and itâ€™s so hard venting to anyone. I donâ€™t know what to do but lately iâ€™ve just been thinking I have nothing to lose so why not end it all ðŸ˜“
