18 and canâ€™t continue anymore. Need to know what happens if I failIâ€™ve pretty much decided I canâ€™t continue and thereâ€™s only one solution. Iâ€™m not scared of pain or the afterlife. What I am scared of is failure. If I fail to kill myself what happens? Do I get committed to a psych ward or what? Someone please tell me.
