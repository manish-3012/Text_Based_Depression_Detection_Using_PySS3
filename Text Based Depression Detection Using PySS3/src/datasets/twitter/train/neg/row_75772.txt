Is there any reason to live if youre hideously uglymy face is pretty deformed and i look like ive had a stroke.

im 20/male and people clearly go out of their way to avoid looking at me.
ive never had any friends and will obviously never have a boyfriend or any sort of relationship so i dont really see any point in continuing to live
