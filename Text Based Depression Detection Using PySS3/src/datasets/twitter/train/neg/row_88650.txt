People always say theyâ€™re there for you but they arenâ€™tJust donâ€™t say it if youâ€™re going to leave me on read or just not even look at the message, the least you can do is send a crisis hotline number and then just leave me in my misery, itâ€™s not really helpful but itâ€™s the polite thing to do. I implied I was going to kill myself a days ago and two people checked up to see if I was fine and left immediately after. Itâ€™s kind of sad to think that if I was gone that besides my parents two people might possibly feel obligated to care about it. Itâ€™s just so sad, I just kind of wanted people to care and now I know that even when Iâ€™m dead they wonâ€™t care, no one really does care about me besides maybe strangers on the internet telling you not to do it. I just want to cry but it just doesnâ€™t work. Everyone says Iâ€™m funny and they like me and that the conversations are boring without me but they donâ€™t mean it, if I had any value to them theyâ€™d respond, even just saying â€œIâ€™m so sorry that happened to youâ€, not just nothing. I tried just being normal now Iâ€™ve tried histrionic cries for help and not even that could get people to pretend to care. My life clearly had no value and my death will have no impact. I was just a group of atoms on this Earth for a second then gone for the next. Iâ€™ve got one person who talks to me so I donâ€™t have a breakdown but I donâ€™t want to ruin their Christmas with my negativity. Every single night I find myself wanting to cry. Iâ€™ve tried putting trauma and paranoia behind me, having fiends online that I talk to about surface level stuff, I donâ€™t complain, my messages arenâ€™t dry, but itâ€™s just that, surface level. My entire life is a crisis, I donâ€™t need a hotline (although itâ€™s nice to send them anyway so people think you care), I just need a friend. It goes well until I end up just being complaining about how lonely I am. I could never really get close to people because I thought they hated me, and I didnâ€™t want to get close to people because I didnâ€™t want my death or drama to affect them. Iâ€™m so alone.
