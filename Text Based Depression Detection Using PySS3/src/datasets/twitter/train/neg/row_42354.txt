Life is just too hard, I can'tLife is way too complicated for me, having to deal with other people, with my own internal problems, this is just too hard... I don't know what I want, I don't know what to do, all I know is I'm a loser, with no money, no job, no honorable skills, and I'm tired of this, I just can't take it anymore. There's only one thing keeping me alive, which I don't exactly know what it is, but it's just a faint light amidst immense darkness. I just wish I was like those people who can see happiness in the smallest things, who can deal with their problems without overreacting and wanting to puke just by thinking about them... but I'm not, I'm this stupid mess of a living being. God please help me, if you exist in any form, as a deity, as an alien, as whatever, I just need help. I'm tired of having to drink alcohol in order to feel like a normal person. I'm tired of being like this
