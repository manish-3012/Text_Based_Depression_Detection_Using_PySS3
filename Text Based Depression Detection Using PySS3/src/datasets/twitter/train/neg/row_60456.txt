Nothing was beautiful and everything hurtI feel like a dickhole but I need to stop going through this everyday. I need to stop struggling so hard for something I don't even want. This is the only way it can be, I guess. I guess I just feel like saying it somewhere, I don't know. But man, every second of this life shit has been awful.
