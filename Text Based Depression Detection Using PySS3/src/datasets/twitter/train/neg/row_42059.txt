I just don't see the pointI've been depressive and suicidal on and off for the past 15 years or so. 

A lot worse when I was young, but still think about it regularly enough.

A friend keeps telling me I should be happy that I have an education, a career and good position in life, but to me that isn't worth much.

I hate myself. I hate my body. I'm not very social. I have a few good friends and the rest are just acquaintances. I've had a few girlfriends but nothing lasted more than a few years. My current girlfriend keeps "warning" me that she's not into me as much as I am into her. she'll probably move soon too. I'm tired of being alone.

I just don't see the point of living. Life is shit, pretty much.

and I am indeed well off financially. There are so many people out there that are worse. How the hell do they do it?

How do people wake up every day and go through their shit lives?

I'd really like to know because I don't see any reason to continue. The only thing that stops me, really, is that I will hurt my family and maybe the few friends I have (other than the fact that I'm a weak coward and I'm afraid I'll fail and be in pain)
