[21m] Shitty life in middle east.Ok, this is probably the first post you will read for a ex-muslim middle eastern here, who lives under war for less than a dollar a day. I just want to tell you I gave up. I can't get any kind of help. I don't know what to do. Life sucks and I made many mistakes that make it even worse.I'm not committing suicide because I'm depressed but I think it's the rational and only option I've to end my suffering.
