Spouse wants to commit suicideA few weeks ago my spouse came to me saying "things need to change or we should get divorced" then proceeded to explain how unhappy they were with life and that they did not see the point in living anymore and that they have felt this way for a long time, since before we were together and how myself and our child should just move on.
My spouse said that if I told anyone and the police came or I tried to get them to see a doctor they would fight it and makes things hell.

Ive asked them to go talk to a therapist or visit a doctor but they refused. They don't want to be medicated and they don't want to talk about their problems. 

I don't know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
