Hey Reddit, Times have gotten harder these days.It's been 14 months since the love of my life committed suicide. My hands still tremble as I type this. It's hard to keep pretending to the outside world. I've since then had episodes of depression. Some lasting a few hours, others a day or two but none like what I'm going through now. I've tried to kill myself over and over again and failed. Not that failure is something new to me, I've been failing my whole life.
It just hurts looking at other people having a normal life, I just can't do it. I know you're saying it's all in my head, but life is not like driving a car, it's like taking the train. We don't get to direct the train, we just buy the tickets to our destination. and I think I got my one way ticket, 14 months ago. I have no good reason to carry on this useless existence. My logical brain is telling me to carry on and my emotions are telling me that I've had enough. 

I'm at work now and I'm tearing apart from the inside. I can't take this anymore.
