don't know what to do okay, some backstory: 


*18 years old, going to be 19 in july.

*diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome (a syndrome on the autism spectrum) when i was 16. 

*never had friends growing up, always had trouble with speaking and with social skills. 

*dropped out of community college due to anxiety.

*tried applying for jobs, no one is hiring. 

i haven't left my room in months. i can go days without talking to anyone. i just feel useless and i feel as if i have no future. i wasted so many privileges and squandered so many opportunities.
