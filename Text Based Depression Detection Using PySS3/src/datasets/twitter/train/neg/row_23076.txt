Don't know how much longer I can hold it at bayI've been craving non-existence for over a year now. It's excruciating, the desire to end it. But I bottle it up and bury it deep, because although I'm a worthless excuse of a person, I still feel the need to no put my family and (very few) friends through what comes after a person commits suicide. 

Ever since I was young I always thought that suicide was a selfish thing to do. It's something a lot of people think, at least to my knowledge. I'm in college now, and my mother has been guilt-tripping me about how much it costs her me being here. Little does she know she's only contributing arguments to the side of me that wants the jump off a fucking building. The more my life goes down the toilet the more I see suicide as a relief, not only to me, but to every other life I manage to ruin by proxy.

After all, all I've done so far of any significance is weigh people that I love down. Wouldn't it be a kindness to get this obstacle out of their way? Is it really *that* selfish? And if it is, so what? I'm supposed to keep suffering so people don't have to cry about it for some time?

Alright, venting done, I'll last a little bit longer.
