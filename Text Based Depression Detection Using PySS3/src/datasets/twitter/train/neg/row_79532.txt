Lol noOmg I just need to like get this off my chest. I was definitely feeling better within the past few weeks. Long story short, this year has been the worst year of my life. I lost my job, spiraled into depression, couldn't get out of bed for months, couldn't drive bc of a medical condition, was worried sick then finally lost my car. Just lost my car like a week ago. Like literally was repoed. I had some relief bc I had been dreading this and was so sick over it I wasn't eating wasn't sleeping nothing. I even like wrote out a suicide note and planned out what I thought to be a full proof plan and everything but I stopped bc of my sibling. I didn't want to just disappear and then think I abandoned them or didn't care about them. Like so when the thing I dreaded happens I was relieved I didn't even cry bc I felt like it was over. 



But I don't want my family finding out like my car was repoed and I don't have the energy to explain it to them. I barely have the energy to interact with my mom and siblings. So the problem is that my extended family is coming to stay with us for a week and they will notice my car is gone. When I was told today I had no reaction I just like felt really overwhelmed and like really embarrassed and just let the area. I almost attempted again tonight bc I don't know how to explain to people the circumstances of events that happened this year and I don't want to. I just had to get it off my chest.
