I canâ€™t help but think of the people who have family members commit suicide and they act like they had no idea or never thought that could happen. They do, they just have absolutely no clue how to deal with it or avoid the conversation altogether.Iâ€™ve literally told multiple family members Iâ€™m feeling suicidal. Iâ€™ve even told 2 I wrote a goodbye note. Iâ€™ve told a few which methods Iâ€™ve thought of.

Most of them are like, â€œit will get betterâ€ just push through. This will pass or â€œyou got thisâ€

No one seems to even take the time to read an article on what the fuck is actually going on in that personâ€™s mind. Or how a stupid ass â€œpositiveâ€ message just sounds like cookie cutter quote out of instagram.

No one asks ; â€œ why do you feel this way?â€

â€œ why do you think this is the only way out?â€

â€œ how do you feel about yourself and why?â€

â€œ do you think there are any triggers that make these feelings and thoughts worse?â€

You know, actual fucking questions that might lead someone. That show they acknowledge this is something serious and not you being dramatic or exaggerating.

99% of people I talk to make me feel like Iâ€™m talking to a wall. Like I donâ€™t actually feel this way and Iâ€™m just being dramatic.
