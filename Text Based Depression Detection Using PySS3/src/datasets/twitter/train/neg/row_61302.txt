Just the ramblings about love from a suicidal girlI'm suicidal and I have requited love.

I have this fantasy, that after my eventual suicide, my partner will find love again.

I follow this girl who is a few years younger than my partner, who, very sadly, lost her boyfriend in a car crash. They had been together since high school. This girl is gorgeous, educated, well-traveled, adventurous; a "normal" 20-something.

My partner and I have been together since high school as well. We used to travel, go on adventures, try every extreme sport we were capable of doing. We had so much fun before I became a depressed blob. An actual blob, as my physical appearance has changed as well and I am no longer as fit or as pretty as I once was.

He will grieve after my loss, for, I don't know how long. It will be very hard on him. We've been together since we were 16. We've learned how to become adults together. I do sort of wish he would leave me now, because he deserves so much more, but he refuses. I think he has hope that I'll eventually return to the person I was before the trauma. Yeah right.

I fantasize that my partner and this girl will get together after I pass. That perhaps having some common ground will make grief a little bit easier. They are so similar, that I know it'd be a perfect match. 

Thanks for reading. I don't even know if this belongs here. Anyone else have fantasies about what others lives will be like after their passing?
