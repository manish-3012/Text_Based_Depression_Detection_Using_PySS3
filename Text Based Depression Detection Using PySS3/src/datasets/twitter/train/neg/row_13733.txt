I screwed up big timeI am from Europe and have lived in Canada for more than 6 years. No family. Just myself. Iâ€™ve been trying to stay strong through whatever challenges I had to go through. But now I give up. 
Iâ€™ve been depressed for the last year. During this time I went through hard break up, moved a couple times, lost quite a bit of friends (Iâ€™ve never had many of those anyways), got really broke as lost my job and had hard time finding another one. Today... I got home and the lock in my door got changed by the land lord. All my belongings are inside. (Yes, I got evicted. My fault. No explanation needed)
I have no family, almost zero friends as turned out when I asked them if I could crash at their place. The person who I was really close with disappointed me the most - preferring helping just depressed friend, who has a ton of friends and a family as well as a roof over the head, to letting me, who has no options, to stay over tonight. 
Iâ€™m lost in this world and want just go on the streets and get hit by a car. I donâ€™t know what hurts more - the fact of being homeless at the moment or the fact of having absolutely no one in entire world whoâ€™s give the slightest fuck about me.
