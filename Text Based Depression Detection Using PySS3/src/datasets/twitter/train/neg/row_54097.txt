Death is so surealistic yet so desired.I cant imagine myself dying. Even the first time I tried overdosing, death did not feel like a part of my world. It's probably coming off as arrogant from a bitchy teenager, but I can't imagine ever crossing paths with death. Strangest part is- I want death. My life is pointless and I have absolutely nothing to live for. Im honestly sick of people trying to talk me out of suicide because I know they are wrong. Im not like other people. Im probably coming of as an edgy bratt but I dont have life values like others do. If some lame cliche saying like "you have so much to live for" saves you then its good for you. I am a burden. Its a shame I was chosen to exist. I am tired of praying for better life. Now I just wish that a truck would finally hit me one of those times I walk the street with my eyes closed.
