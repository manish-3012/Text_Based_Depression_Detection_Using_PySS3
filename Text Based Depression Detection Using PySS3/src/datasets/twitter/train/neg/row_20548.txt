I'm thinking about ending my sufferingThe last couple of years I've been in a abusive relationship that ended because my girlfriend left me in August and during this relationship I didn't have any chance to take care about myself/fell anything as she turned everything against me and when I suffered from anxiety she turned it around so I had to take care of her. In addition to this she mentally destroyed me for a long period of time. I don't care about her anymore but the damage she made is still present.

I've got a long background of with both alcohol and drug abuse which resulted in a psychosis for me as I was beaten during an LSD trip a couple of years ago. This lead to paranoia and hallucinations which i later got confirmed it probably is  [hppd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen_persisting_perception_disorder). After returning to my psychiatrist recently I've got the diagnsis panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and depression (all of them I knew I suffered from). The way I feel makes me lose my libido which makes my new relationship a living hell, and that doesn't help me in any way.

About a week ago I started taking Cipralex (Escitalopram) and I've just doubled the dosage which makes my anxiety even worse as I'm not used to antidepressants. I've got a benzodiazepine (Clonazepam) as a medicine since a couple of years ago but it doesn't do affect me much anymore.

I'm currently sitting here and drinking while trying to think about something other than killing myself, which has been in my mind the last couple of days (and I've tried once before, two years ago, if thats relevant), and hoping for some thoughts from other people and the chance to get it off my chest.
