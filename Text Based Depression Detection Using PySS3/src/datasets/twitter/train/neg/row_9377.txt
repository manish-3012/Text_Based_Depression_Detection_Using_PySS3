I donâ€™t deserve to live anymoreFor years I felt sorry for myself being depressed. Recently realized that all of this is my fault and mine only. I had it all and ruined it. A family that loved me, friends that cared for me and everything else. High honors through out all of school. College bound. A bright future. I was a popular kid. I was happy. Now I wither away alone and hopeless with a wasted youth and childhood behind me. Only escape is constant drug use. No hope at all. Iâ€™ve felt suicidal before, Iâ€™ve been at a cliff, Iâ€™ve had the pills in my hand but now it feels different. I know I can follow through now because there is no doubt in my mind that I should. For everyoneâ€™s sake.
