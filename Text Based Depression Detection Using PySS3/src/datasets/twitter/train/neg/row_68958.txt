I donâ€™t know what to do anymore...Iâ€™ve been suicidal for years, but Iâ€™ve never done anything about it. I donâ€™t know why... maybe Iâ€™m too much of a pussy? Whatever.

Lately Iâ€™ve been more suicidal than ever. I canâ€™t think of any reason not to end my life...

My relationship is falling apart, me &amp; my dad used to be so close and now he acts like Iâ€™m just a burden, my friends... well theyâ€™re not the best... (thatâ€™s not all my reasons. just naming a few.)


Why do I even bother? Because every time I open up to someone and tell them Iâ€™m suicidal they say theyâ€™d miss me so much and basically guilt trip me into staying alive? Well fuck that.

I should have never been born. 


Itâ€™s just a matter of time before I snap and actually do it...
