I don't know what I'm feelingI want to have someone kill me, to stab myself with a kitchen knife. I can lean down on it, into my chest. I'd bleed out into the kitchen floor, my father would wake up to me screaming. He'd run into the kitchen, slamming on the lights - all the blood on the floor, wide eyes with panic, anger, fear. He would be scarred after seeing that, after I die. It would torture him, he'd probably slip into a worse depression than he is already in - drinking himself to an early grave. I dont want that for him, but i dont think i can live either. 

I feel like a fake. Im getting mental health help and yet nothing is \*helping\*. Maybe I'm lying about it all, maybe it just need to try harder and not be so lazy. I have diagnosed ADD, but maybe its not real, maybe they just gave me the diagnosis because I told them I had it as a kid. 

I feel guilty for lying to my friends, and for being too cowardly to tell them the truth. It eats me from the inside. I feel so lonely, I just try to treasure the people I have in real life. My only friend in life tho is 17 years old, and I'm 20. He is in high school, he has a future ahead of him.... I'm just a useless community college student, barely staying afloat. I don't think I can be a real friend to him, he is with others who share more in his life than I do. He is my best friend, and I am just a... on the side friend. 

And when I don't think about it, when there is nothing to bring the emotions to the fore, I don't feel anything at all. Put up some happy music and it melts away, all that's left is a feeling of unease. I just want someone to kill me. I cant take the stress anymore. fuck. i dont want to do this, im too ugly to even die. fuck me. i think its better to just do it. just stop worrying. fuck it all
