I hope this is itI just took everything i could in the medicine cabinet and freel really sleepy. 
You guys helped very muhc over the past two weeks but sorry this was it and i am really tired of having to go through the same thing againd and again. I think i made the right decision i lived a good life. I am afraid Iâ€™m goong to wake up. But this feeling i let go is a therapy enough for me. This country is going to shit and every where i put my foot into i have to deal with the faxt that i live in here. Me saying this can get my family j. Trouble. We didnâ€™t have internet for a week and no one bats an eye. They killed us and no one cafed. Fuck this is not a political thing Iâ€™m just tired of same love issues and loneliness issues and same shit and shit . I had a passion for writing but  thatâ€™s not a good way to live. Maybe just one last time i tried to express myself and not to be judged.
If i woke up in the morning I will leace a comment maybe. Idk why i did this.
