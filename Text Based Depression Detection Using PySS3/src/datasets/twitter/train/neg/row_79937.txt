Why is it anytime I try to succeed I failI just lost 1,500 dollars. Iâ€™ve been getting financial aid from my school but for some reason I never got the Spring semester money. Iâ€™ve been contacting the school for months trying to get the money and I just got an email that said they no longer can refund me any money from the 2019-2020 semesters. I was going to use that money to help me move out. Iâ€™m literally going crazy living where I am. Now what am I supposed to do!? Anytime something good happens to me something bad has to happen right after. Itâ€™s like the world doesnâ€™t want me to be happy. I just got my COVID test results back and Iâ€™m negative and I was so happy then I got this email. I said if I canâ€™t move out by the end of the year I was going to take what little money I have and go on a mini trip somewhere and kill myself there. Itâ€™s looking like thatâ€™s going to be the only option for me.
