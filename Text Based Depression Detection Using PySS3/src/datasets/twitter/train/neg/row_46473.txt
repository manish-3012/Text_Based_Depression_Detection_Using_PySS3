How some people enjoy inflicting pain on others. How do they sleep at night knowing they have just made someones life miserable.This is going to be a long one. I will not mind if you dont read any further.
...............
I have had a very bad couple of years. About two years back I had made a post here about how badly I wanted to commit suicide and some very great people over here had prevented me from doing it. I will always be thankful to you guys.

Somehow I recovered from those feelings. Worked my ass off and got into a decent university. Worked my ass off  again and got an internship offer. 
Now, here in this university before going for any internship we have to take approval of our faculty advisor.
And my faculty advisor just few weeks before starting of the internship has decided that he would not be giving me his approval. I was devastated after hearing this as recruitment season is almost over here. And this means, I am going to be jobless after graduating.
  
As far as I can see, he gains nothing from this. May be the only thing he will get is the satisfaction that he has made my life miserable.

Now u must be thinking how can somebody treat someone like this without any consequences in an university. I thought that too and tried speaking to all the senior member in the administration and they all tried to convince my faculty advisor but in the end they all told me that they can only suggest him to allow me and not force him. The final decision is in his hands.

Now, here I am again in the same position I was two years back. Thinking what did I do to deserve all this. Why me. Why the fuck me.
Why did I struggled so hard. Why did I tricked my mind in believing that everything will be okay. Why did I tricked myself in believing that not all people are the same.

This is going to be very tough night for me and donâ€™t want to see the daylight anymore. 

help me. please help me.
