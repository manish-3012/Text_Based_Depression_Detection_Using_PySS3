Kill meSomething aches, bad things slither. My floors are burning down and I can't find a window. This is medieval, this is cerebral. Suffocated, melodramatic, driven to the verge of I make you my enemy. The nerves you sever can serve you better in the blink of an eye, in the space of a second. Open my wrists, give me my lessons. Tearing myself apart from the things that make me hurt.
