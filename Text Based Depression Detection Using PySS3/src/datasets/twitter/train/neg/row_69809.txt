So tired...My ex-gf killed herself, I hate my job, I hate where I'm going in life and I can't wait to get out of here. I may have also just done something really illegal and I wonder if the cops will ever show up. I can't sleep because of it. Sometimes I wish I could just go to sleep... wake up as an old man with a wife and watch my grandchildren play in the garden...with no memories of everything that's happened... skip everything between then and now
