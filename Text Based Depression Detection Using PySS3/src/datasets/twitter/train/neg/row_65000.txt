I just wanted to be loved.I just wanted to be fucking loved.  


&amp;#x200B;

I cant say for sure if it would or wouldn't help with the suicidal feelings. 

  


But... why couldn't I be loved?

  


Even after all the trauma, all the bad shit, all the abuse and neglect, I put in my due diligence  and then some. 

&amp;#x200B;

And for what? 

&amp;#x200B;

For everything to only get worse? For everything to feel worse? 

&amp;#x200B;

I worked on my physical self for years and; nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

 I worked on my mental health with professionals, meds, even alternate help and; nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually, less than nothing. It all only kept getting worse.  


I tried to kill myself so many times before, and even that only made things worse instead of letting me out of this hell.

&amp;#x200B;

For everything I've been through, for everything I've done  


Couldnt I just feel loved once?  


Maybe I've always been asking too much of the universe.
