i just donâ€™t know what to do anymoreevery day is a struggle. i canâ€™t find a reason to be alive. i canâ€™t find a reason to stay. i am worthless. i have panic attacks every day. according to my boyfriend i was having them in my sleep last night and he stayed up till 7am cause they wouldnâ€™t stop. i get upset and take my sadness out as anger. i yell at people for no reason. i have flashbacks every day to when i got sexually assaulted. i want to just curl up in a ball fall asleep and never wake up again. i donâ€™t know why iâ€™m alive and no one would care if i died. i have no friends and my family hates me. i just want some peace. i heard someone say one time â€œyou canâ€™t be suicidal for an extended period of timeâ€ and thatâ€™s itâ€™s â€œsituationalâ€ if thatâ€™s the truth then maybe itâ€™s my time. itâ€™s been 6 years since i started self harming and my first suicide attempt. i just need to go.
