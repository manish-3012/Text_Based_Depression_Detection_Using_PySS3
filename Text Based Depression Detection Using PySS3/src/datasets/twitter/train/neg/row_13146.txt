I need help, i don't want to do what I want to doI feel so alone and I don't feel i can talk to anyone. I can't express myself due to past abuse.

I dont want to be alone but i do want to be left alone. 

I just don't want to be on this earth right now. I don't want to hurt those who love me, either by telling them how i feel or by going through with it.

Please help me.
