Iâ€™m inconsolably suicidalIâ€™ve been telling myself I have two weeks left to live.

Iâ€™m completely screwed up. I donâ€™t like where Iâ€™m living but Iâ€™m bound contractually to have to stay there. I just want to be at home with my family and more importantly my cat.

I know this sounds ridiculous, but I have never met a being more sensitive and empathetic and it hurts me so much that when I kill myself he will simply forget I ever existed.

My life can only get worse from now on, my golden child hood years (that werenâ€™t even so golden) are gone now and I only have difficulty to look forward to now. Trying to finish my degree that I donâ€™t particularly care at all for, trying to find a job, trying to stay afloat on my own, trying to find somewhere to live, try to desperately find someone to love and cherish who can symbolically replace the standard of care I get from my parents before they die. 

I canâ€™t cope with it.

Every thing is a mess and I know suicide IS selfish but Iâ€™ve calculated that Iâ€™ll be saving myself and others so much pain by doing this.

I am just not meant to survive. I feel terrible but I have to do it.
