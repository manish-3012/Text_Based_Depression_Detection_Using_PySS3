my subconsciousness is slowly eating me, (17M)I have been alone for a year and a halve now. went past a bad breakup. lately i have been doubting my self im starting to have less and less friends , Im starting to do bad at school since all i do is sleep to escape my reality , I woudnt say im not attractive or ugly but my talking skills are pretty bad , i just freeze up and say something stupid , most of our school breaks im alone just thinking, and slowly my consciousness is eating me, i hate this , i hate my self. i have suicidal thoughts but im just trying to ignore them,
