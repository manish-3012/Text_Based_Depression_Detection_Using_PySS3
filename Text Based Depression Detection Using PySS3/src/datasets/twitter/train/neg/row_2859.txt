Lookin for Some AdviceHey so I've been pretty down for as long as I can remember. Always seem to feel out of place unless I'm sitting around by myself. I have several groups of friends which don't interact with eachother in any way, but still I always feel like a loner. There are the typical depressed feelings like being a burden or that somehow in someway things are just better without me, but my family was usually there to disperse those. At the end of last semester I was dismissed from college and had to move home. School is fairly easy for me but I have grown so apathetic that I simply stopped going to class. For whatever reason upon moving home I decided it was a good idea to tell my family that I smoke weed. I tried to explain that it helps me to just get out of my head and let go of my anxieties but they all still treat me like I'm some big drug addict burn out. They may be right although I really dont feel so. Also my girlfriend broke up with me but still works at my families restaurant. I really didnt want the relationship to end and she seems like she doesnt either, I feel like she is scared of me. I have been good at being alone for most of my 20 years but now I cant seem to stop thinking about it, I cant shake this terrible anxiety that I feel is constantly circling me. I have been to doctors and psychiatrists and am on several different medications to attempt to remedy this but nothing seems to work. I feel like dying would be a great solution for everyone, but I dont really feel like killing myself. It seems like it is too easy of a way out for me and I would just be leaving behind all of my messes for someone else. At the same time I would love to die. I dont know I suppose this was a bit of an unorganized rant more than anything but if anyone has any advice or anything really it would be greatly appreciated.
