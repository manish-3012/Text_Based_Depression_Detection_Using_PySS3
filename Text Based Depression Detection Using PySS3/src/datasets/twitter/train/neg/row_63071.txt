I'm gonna give it 1 more month.On october 9th I decided that if in one month nothing changed for good in my life I'd jump from my building.
Tomorrow marks one month from this promise and I decided to give it more time. I take sleep and anxiety medication and have been on therapy for 2 years on january, yet my mental state doesn't seem to get better.
December 9th is my new date and I'll push through this month with all of my strength, trying to get better every day, I can do this.
