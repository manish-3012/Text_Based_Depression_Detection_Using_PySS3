God, help me.I honestly don't know how much longer I can stand this. There is no such thing as real friendship or companionship, its all fucking fake bullshit. hopefully the first car I can surprise is going fast enough to remove me from this. goodbye, I tried the best i could but this is honestly just pointless. enjoy your search for the cheese, rats. nothing I'm reading is making me feel any better. just gunna keep taking shots until I fall alseep face up or get the courage to go play in the streets. goodnight, and happy halloween. bon soir!
