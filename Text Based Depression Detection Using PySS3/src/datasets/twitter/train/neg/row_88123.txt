It really feels like I've lost it all.in the matter of a few days, I've lost everything.I don't know what to do. My school pulled my Financial Aid due to an error on my paperwork. I currently owe them over 5000$ in now unpaid tuition with a summer class I have to take making it come up to 6500$. I have no one to co-sign more loans so I'm basically fucked, they're threatening me with credit unions in the emails they sent me so there goes any hope of me having good credit ever. Then I get kicked out of my grandma's house where I've been staying because I had to leave for school early to go to the FA office and wasn't able to drive her husband to work so they called me cursing and told me not to come back. So for the past few days, I've been sleeping in the library then I get the phone call that I've never wanted to get. My mother had been diagnosed with cancer. I don't know what to do. I feel as if I've failed and I need to start over and try again.
