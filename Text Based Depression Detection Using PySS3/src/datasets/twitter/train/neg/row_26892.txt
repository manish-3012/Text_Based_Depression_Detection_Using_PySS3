It's all my fault.I'm Asian, so my parents are supposed to be tough on grades, but even they know they can't do anything for me. I GPA is somewhere between 2.0 and 3.0 right now and this with max effort. I can never focus in class and when I get home from school, i forget everything I just learned. Right now it's 3:17AM and I just woke up from a dream where I jumped off a building. I know I don't have a future especially with grades like these and I really just want to end it all. There is only one thing stopping me, and that is that I'm an only child. My parents have raised me for 16 years and I don't want to be a liability, but i don't want them to be crushed by me leaving. On a scale of 1-10, from 1 being depressed and 10 being death, I'm around an 8. On top of that, I have a final exam tomorrow for math (stereotype:all Asians are good at it) where if I get lower than a D, which is very likely, I might just bump it up to a 9-10. 

If it does happen, it might just occur around the next few weeks/months when report cards roll out. Bye guys.
