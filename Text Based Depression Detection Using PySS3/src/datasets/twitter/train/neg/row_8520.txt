becoming a black holeI have been depressed for 15 years (25 in October) i still don't know what: and of course my doctors don't know why either. i am taking prescription antidepressamts, but i feel more and more suicidal every day. "think something happy, do something that's fun" i wonder how many times i will hear that in my life. just pretending to have friends even on the internet.
