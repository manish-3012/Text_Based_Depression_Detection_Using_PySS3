Non UrgentHi everyone, im 14, and not suicidal. However, whenever something daunting comes up in the near future (like a dentist appointment) my brain goes bezerk, and I automatically think of possible solutions. It seems to go a bit like this
"What am I going to do?! Well I can go and try to talk my parents out of it, I can pretend im sick and/or too tired to go, I can kill myslef, Woww waiit what?!! Are you crazy?

This conversation goes into my brain every time something daunting in the future comes up, and im wondering if anyone else has this problem.

I lead a normal and happy life, have loving parents etc. but my brain seems to see "kill myself" as a very normal option on about the same level of seriousness as "Tell my teacher that I left homework at home when I didn't"

Of course, I immediatly regret thinking to myself that that is a solution, but it seems weird that this pops up in my brain as a "default option" 

Sorry for babbling, and I hope you can help me out here.
