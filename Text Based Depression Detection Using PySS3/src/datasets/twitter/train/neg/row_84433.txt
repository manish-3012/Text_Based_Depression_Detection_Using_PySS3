Doing it regardless; just want to minimize suffering. Looking for someone with background in suicide methodsCouldn't shooting downward through the top of your skull cause a more destructive wound?(compared to through the mouth, side of the head, or under the chin?) The brainstem is only slightly further away when shot from above, so why have I never even heard of it being done? Is the top of the skull too thick for a bullet to travel straight, even with lots of power and large bullets?

Or is recoil from larger rounds the problem when firing downward through your skull? I can apply a fair bit of downward pressure but I'm not positive I can keep the gun in place through the recoil at that angle. I've heard aiming toward the back of the head through your chin, with a mouthful of water is more effective than a temple shot or through the mouth. This is because if the bullet itself fails, the bullet travel through water releases a large shockwave as a failsafe (like a shotgun blast) Is this true? (I'm using a very large bullet if this matters).

Hoping to hear from someone who knows what they're talking about. A doctor/EMT or army/military? Hopefully someone with credentials and/or resources. Super sorry for asking such a morbid question.
