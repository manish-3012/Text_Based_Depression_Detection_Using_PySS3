I told my friend that I wouldn't mind WW3 happening and being drafted since I'm suicidal anyway.In fact, it might even make my life easier. I'll have better access to gun in which I can kill myself instantly. 
And people who would be hurt that I died, don't have to blame themselves or feel to bad as they would think I was 'killed in action.'
