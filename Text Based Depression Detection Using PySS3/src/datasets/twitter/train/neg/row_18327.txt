That awkward moment when you lie to yourself for 4 years convincing yourself she loves you when she doesn'tShe tells me I'm great and she loves me but when I need her most she tells me no because I'm not her priority. 

Big woop okay I fuckin get it your obedience to your parents is more important than your loved one's feelings. It's not like we're fucking kids or just met. I break my back to give you everything. I give you a home but you don't even want to live in but tell me you love me okay sure fucker. I give you food, I give you gifts, I make you soup when you're sick, I listen to you when no one else will, I dedicate every day of my life working so you don't have to. 

And at the end of the day all I get is a "I cant stay the night with you. My parents say no"

How fuckin high are you. How fuckin high was I these past few years crying out to you but somehow you convince me every time not to leave I'm done. I need to be done if I can possibly scrape the fragments of my life together. 


I am so sad I have wasted so much time with this girl but I still get so sad because I just wish she loved me as much as I love her. 


If anyone wants to talk I would like to please. I am so sad.
