The scenarios just keep running through my head...Again and again... 

When I close my eyes I imagine myself finally ending it all. What would happen? What would it feel like? What would it sound and look like? 

I just feel sad. I donâ€™t know how to explain. Thereâ€™s no one to talk to because theyâ€™ll just tell me Iâ€™m being stupid. Or theyâ€™d get angry. 

At work theyâ€™re like â€˜haha, yeah there was a girl who was very emo. Thatâ€™s why she left. Youâ€™re not like that right?â€™ What else could I do but said â€˜Yup, Iâ€™m not like that.â€™ They wouldnâ€™t understand. Even people I feel are close to me donâ€™t understand. I wouldnâ€™t be able to explain. Even if they did, there wouldnâ€™t be a way to make things better. 

I wish I dared to kill myself. (Maybe I should put it on my task list.)But I donâ€™t. And so Iâ€™ve just got to sit here and feel every part of my hurt and ache because I feel so sad. So... sad.... I canâ€™t even explain why....
