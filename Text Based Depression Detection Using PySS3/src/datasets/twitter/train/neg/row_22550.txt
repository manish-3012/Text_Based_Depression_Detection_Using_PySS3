Yesterday i had a suicidal crisisHi,  I have been going through really really hard times.  
I have suicidal tendencies, my mom  returned with schizophrenic habits and 'my brother' (i dont consider him as my brother) is a horrible person, who destroys things at our home, mistreat me and my parents and a lot of horrible things, he scares me!!! :(  
Yesterday i felt so full of those bad things, fought with my boyfriend and had a suicidal crisis,  I cut my wrists, my face, I took many medicines and acetone. Now my head hurts so much.  


I try to stay positive and think about good things, but sometimes its so difficult for me. :(
