I feel sickI've been struggling with depression and obsessive compulsive disorder for over ten years now and have been in countless toxic relationships, and I don't see it getting any better, no matter how many prescription drugs I shove down my throat.  It has ruined most of my ambitions at this point and I'm stuck working a dead-end job in my hometown post-college that I'm too exhausted to pull myself out of despite repeated attempts.  I also ruin all of the relationships I have, seemingly, even when I manage to let my guard down for long enough to let someone into my life. I angered a man that I had dared to allow myself to fall for today with a bad joke; he called me a slew of hurtful names almost unthinkingly and went for my weaknesses, hard.  I don't know why this time it is the straw that breaks the camel's back, but it is.  I finally have the courage to do something about all of this.  Rather than reach out to my friends for support as I've done many many times in the past, draining their energy, I think I finally have what it takes to stop bothering them once and for all.  What bothers me most isn't the idea of suicide; it's how fucking cliche this looks - a sad gay man, with all the privilege in the world - and how I don't even have the stamina to write a suicide note.  My thoughts are swirling right now; I used to pride myself on my ability to articulate them but that is long gone, along with the other good things I might have once offered the world.

I've got a number of sleeping pills and a plastic bag.  I don't want to upset my roommates - Lord knows they've had enough already - so maybe I'll just go out in my car, which is almost as old as I am, and fold the seat down and put myself to sleep.  I'm tired of fighting and I'm tired of being a fucking let down.
