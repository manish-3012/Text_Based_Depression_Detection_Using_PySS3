LonelyIn the end of my teens i often felt close to killing myself. But i  always thought that it was just a phase and would be going away. I moved out,  worked out and all that. Didnt help.  I also felt incredibly lonely. I sometimes were close to suicide, but never made an actual attempt. 

Then last semester i have lived my two happiest months in my life. I met an exchange student,  with which for the first time in my life i didnt fell this loneliness, with which i could talk about stuff, no one else understood.
 It felt like we are just the same person,  really.  With her gone - since some months now,  i slided back into this deep dark hole and i just dont have anything that satisfies me anymore. Worse than ever, i now not only feel lonely and depressed,  but i have knowledge of that feeling when i was not, which really makes everything worse. At first i tried to be grateful for the two months,  wasnt i lucky as hell  to even meet her? 
But now i just curse the day we met and wish we wouldnt have as i really feel more close to doing it than ever before. 

I guess  i just wanted to share that. Writing about it feels good.
