I dont know anymoreYah this is a mess.

I want to die, not be here anymore, feel my strength fade away till its all just black. Feel my own warm blood as i slowly lose power. But my brain keeps telling me, why bothere trying to kill yourself, just keep going, dead or alive, where is the diffrence. So i keep pretending i am fine. 

I dont know what i feel anymore. I never felt any "love" or anything. My brain always in a mode i would describe as "emotionally numb". I trust nobody. Feel nothing for anyone. I dont even know if i feel true joy or just fake it too.

I didnt cried in overe 11 month as every time i started, my brain steped in and i stop. Without a problem or any othere thoughts. 

I feel like i have no real me, i always try to be what others want me to be. I dont even know if what i tup here is even the feelings of my real me or if its just anothere stupid mask of mine.

I dont know what i want to get done in my life, i just take why happens. 

I dont care about anything, about me being alive or dead. Me having some fake freinds or no.
Non of thos things metter to me. 

I just want my brain to work normaly, fall hoplesly in love, have friends i care about. But no, nothing. Nothing.

I started drinking, Cider, Vodka, some other stuff. Still, nothing.
No matter what i try i never feel anything.


I just want it to stop.

Sorry if this is a mess, but i cant get anything from my head onto the paper that makes any sens.
