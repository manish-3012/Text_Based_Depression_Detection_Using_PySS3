Need some help cutting, help?Recently I have started cutting my forearms, I don't do insanely deep cuts but the blood defiantly flows put of my arms. I tried googling it so see where I should cut and shouldn't to keep it relatively safe but everyone only posts about wrists. I'm not cutting the wrists, about halfway between my wrist and elbows. Also I know hips and legs are common safer Ares, I'm too much of a bitch to do legs and I cut my hips regularly. I now want to do arms but don't want to cut though a vein or artery. Please help.
