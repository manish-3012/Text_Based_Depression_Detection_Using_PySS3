Need help from the /r/SuicideWatch community.Hey Suicide Watch

I came across a post from /u/theprototype in /r/MorbidReality which worried me.

"is there anyone here that has had a friend commit suicide?... i am seriously considering ending it and i wonder how my friends would feel."

I would help but thought I should alert some people who actually know what they're doing.
