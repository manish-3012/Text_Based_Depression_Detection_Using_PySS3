idk mani donâ€™t think i can kill myself any more.. iâ€™ve seen videos and photos of lifeless bodies in various states and i donâ€™t want anyone to see me like that. i donâ€™t want someone to find me and only be able to identify me with what i have in my wallet or clothes. i donâ€™t want to be bloated and deformed if i drowned myself. i donâ€™t want my body bending every which way if i jumped from a bridge or crashed my car or jumped in front of a train, i donâ€™t want that blood to be seen or my insides thrown around. i donâ€™t want anyone to see my eyes rolled back, i donâ€™t want people to be traumatized. i fucking wanna die but i want my body to be gone with my consciousness.
