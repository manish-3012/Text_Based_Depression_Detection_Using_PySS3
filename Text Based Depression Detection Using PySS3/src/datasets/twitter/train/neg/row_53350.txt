I have no idea what to call thisI mean, I don't even know what I'm going to write. I guess I just need someone to listen... No-one ever does IRL. I don't really have anyone to talk to, which is mainly my own fault, not that I would if I had anyone. 

At the moment, I'm depressed. Very depressed. Just an hour ago I was crying uncontrollably, but then I guess that doesn't tell you much, so, because I for some reason decide to trust you, I'll give you a quick timeline of my life: 
* I always were very awkward, easily embarrassed and introverted. Every memory I have from kindergarten comes with a feeling of embarrassment. 

* Bullied 1-2 grade, almost got killed once. 

* Changed schools, not as much bullying, actually got a friend. 

* Diagnosed with AD/HD in forth grade. Medicines helped for a while. 

* High school/college (Norwegian school system, woo!) was challenging. I fast fell out socially, but I was always on top of my class, academically. Started cutting and had my first real suicidal thoughts. When I look back I see what a horrible, nihilistic person I was. 

* First heartbreak. 

* First year (of what I recon would be University, but I dunno), tries to be a good person to everyone and be more social, started getting interested in philosophy, politics and religion. Then the worst experience I have ever had hits (I won't go into details) and I return to my shell of self-obsessive nihilism. 

* Second heartbreak. 

* I change schools and line of education (?). Over the summer vacation I gather enough willpower to break out of earlier said shell and I decide to do my best to help others and be nice. 

* After almost half a year the second bomb hits: Apparently everyone in my school thinks all my good deeds were just a trick to get into their pants (our school is about 95% girls, I'm a guy). 

* Another fucking shell. 

* Start developing serious OCD. 

* Start developing serious social anxiety. 

* Start developing paranoia and a split personality. 

* Third heartbreak, this was just a few weeks ago, and I still see her almost every day. 
* OCD, social anxiety, paranoia and split personality is getting worse, with an added dose of nihilism and 
depression. 

* A few days ago, starting to have vivid hallucinations: monsters, huge animals, buildings, spaceships, small creatures that look like Furbies, but more agile, faster and intimidating, in their own harmlessly cute way. 



I have no idea if either of that made sense, I guess I just needed to scribble it down somewhere... I probably forgot lots of stuff, as of late I find it hard to both concentrate and remember properly. 


I am currently seeing a psychotherapist or whatever they're called, but it isn't helping much so far. I'll give him one more week, unless he has a solution to all this, I'll donate my body to science.
