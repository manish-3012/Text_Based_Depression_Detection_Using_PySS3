verging on constant panic attackI feel like I'm  verging on a constant panic attach. Everything is scaring me right now. I don't want to do this anymore feel like I'm trapped every which way I turn. I don't know how I'm going to keep going. I just want to drive to the bridge and get this over and done with. the only thing that keeps me from doing it is my wife and family, but it's getting harder each day. My hands are shaking as  I'm typing I am so scared that I am going to do something drastic.
