Is there a way to increase my risk of cancer right now so I can refuse treatment?My parents have smoked for their entire lives basically but fortunately havenâ€™t gotten cancer. However I would love to die soonish, or at least know that Iâ€™m going to die soon, but I donâ€™t want my parents to find my body. So I want to get cancer and refuse treatment, then die.
