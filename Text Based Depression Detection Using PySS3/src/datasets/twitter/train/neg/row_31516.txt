I Ruined my Life (I'm not going to quit)It's 4:20 AM and I can't fall asleep again. I feel completely destroyed, like I'm falling on this black pit and there's nowhere to hang out from.

I know all of you in this subreddit probably know the feeling.

It's been over two years since my last job as an accountant. I left it because I felt it was holding me back from getting my CPA degree. I didn't really left it. I just allowed myself to drift towards being fired and payed a good severance package.

I left my girlfriend at the same time too for more or less the same reason.

I don't honestly know what I've been doing for the past two years. Mostly drinking and trying/failing to study I guess.

I feel utterly alone, guilty and ashamed. I know my whole career is over (not that I ever cared much about it anyway) I feel I wasted all this time and that I have nothing to show for it.

Today I received a present from a friend because my birthday is getting near. I can't believe people still call me out of the blue to hang out with me and everything. It seems is fun to be around me I guess.

I won't do anything stupid. I know a lot of people care about me.

Tomorrow I'm taking one of the 7 tests I still need for my degree and I know I'll most likely fail. 

I'm going to fix my life. I'll start with something small. Doing exercise again (I used to love that). Maybe just taking things day by day I can get through this.

Thank you for bearing with me and sorry for the long and erratic post. I just needed to get this of my chest.

I Wish you good luck and strength to you all!
