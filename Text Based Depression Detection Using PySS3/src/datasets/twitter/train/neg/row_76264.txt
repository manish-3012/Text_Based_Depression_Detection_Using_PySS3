Just looking for advice based on your personal experiencesWithin the last week I've been hearing a voice, which isn't mine, in my head.  It started and he remained subtle, but it's almost like it responds to my own thoughts.  It addresses me as "you".  

I've been depressed for a while and have been actively working to address it, but this is new and I haven't ever heard or felt like this before.  My GP is my doctor who prescribes my anti anxiety meds, however half the time she is googling them. 

I am hoping to find honest advice on where I go from here.  I love my family so much, without them I would have killed myself ages ago.  But now it's not just me, it is something else inside of me encouraging me to take action.  It's new, foreign, and I am unsure of how to deal with it.
