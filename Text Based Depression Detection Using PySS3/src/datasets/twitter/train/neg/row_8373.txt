I feel like I have no purpose in life....Iâ€™m currently in college right now doing speech therapy and I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s something I wanna do (itâ€™s not really interested in it, itâ€™s kinda boring). Idk what else to do or what other career to purpose. 

Tbh this is making me depressed and want to end life.
