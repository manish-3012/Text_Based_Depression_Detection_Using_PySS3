I need help with a friendSo my 16 year old friend has been missing many weeks of school recently, and I just recently found out that he was depressed and having suicidal thoughts. I tried talking to him and telling him that I'm there for him if he ever wanted to talk to somebody about anything but he doesn't want to talk, meaning I can't help him. I've given him the number to kids help phone (a company that you can call to talk to people about depression) and I've linked this subreddit as well. Right now I'm just really scared for him and I don't want anything bad to happen to him. I've been through depression before and I've thankfully gotten over it, thinking that that would help him but he's not responding to most of my messages. I just need to know what to do to make sure he doesn't harm himself and to get him back to his old self again.
