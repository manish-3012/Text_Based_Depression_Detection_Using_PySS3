I'm not sure where to post this.I woke up today with news I didn't expect to hear. The mortgage hasn't been paid in 4 months. We (parents and I) may become homeless. I've been applying to many jobs. Out of the many jobs, I was contacted by one. I need to do a background check and TB test, which I will hopefully tomorrow. 

My grandpa would have to move to another state where his siblings live. 

But what about my two dogs? My two dogs that give me a reason to wake up every day. I don't want to live without them. I've always wondered what would happen if I lost them or be separated from them, and I genuinely believe I would kill myself.

I've attempted suicide a few times before. I have a suicide note written from last year. It's not goodbye right now, but I strongly believe if things don't get better it might be. 

I wanted to go back to school to try and become a teacher. I wanted to work towards becoming an English teacher in Japan. 

I'm lost. I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to find a job, really. I just don't know why I wasn't told this sooner.
