i need help, i was raped by two older men.2 months ago i was raped by two older men. I am 16, im a guy, im straight. I was drunk, and they took advantage of me. When i resisted, they beat me, then they forced me to do what they wanted.

I really dont want to go into detail in a post. It was so humiliating and emasculating. I cant help but feel it must have been my fault in some way.

When they beat me and threatened me, I surrendered quickly, and i feel awful. I have flashbacks every single day. I told one person, and he then just asked if i was gay, and said that men cannot get raped. I cant fucking take this shit. Please, i need someone to talk to.
