Been thinking a lotRecently over the last few months I have been on a downward mental spiral and I think I finally hit rock bottom. I've been giving signs that I need help and the few people that put up with me haven't seen them and so I want to end it. There is no point in going on and now the only question is do I make my suicide look like an accident or just go full on. 

&amp;#x200B;

For making it look like an accident I was thinking of letting my car maintenance slip and wait for the right stormy day and drive fast without my seatbelt on and "accidently" loose control of the car and ram it into a pilon. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other direction is to just attach a rope to a tree and around my neck, get on my motorcycle, and just full on send it until I run out of rope and let the force of the rope snap my neck like an old bolt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way I'm pretty sure that I'm done with life. My anti-depressants aren't working, I feel like I have no friends anymore, and that there is no point going on anymore.

If anyone reads this I'm sorry for wasting your time.
