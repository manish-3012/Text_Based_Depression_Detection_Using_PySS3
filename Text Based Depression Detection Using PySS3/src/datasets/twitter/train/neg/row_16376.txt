Hello, I'm here to help.Lurkers and readers of this subreddit, this is my first visit to this subreddit and I want heartily extend my services.  I personally have a father who suffers from a variety of mental illness...it's nothing that you'd notice when first meeting him, but it also has to be kept under close watch with precise doses of medication. If a dose is off he can become unbalanced (this has caused two unsuccessful suicide attempts).  Again, if anyone needs to talk at all feel free to message me.
