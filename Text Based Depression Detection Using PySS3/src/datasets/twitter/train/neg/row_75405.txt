Iâ€™m doneSo Iâ€™m a 15 year old and Iâ€™m quite done. Iâ€™ve tried 2 times before and it didnâ€™t work. Iâ€™m thinking about trying again. I have no freinds. I have no will to live. Every school I go to the kids just bully me. Iâ€™m home schooled now and only leave the house once every 2 weeks. I think the only thing that has stopped me from trying again is the fact that im afraid of what happens after we die. But the past few days I havenâ€™t really been afraid Iâ€™ve felt sad but also at peace because Iâ€™m not afraid to die anymore. I feel so trapped. I feel like Iâ€™m melting. I just canâ€™t anymore. I donâ€™t want to hurt my family but they donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to be me. I have been hospitalized 22 times and each time it does not work. I come home worse than before doped up on new pills. I donâ€™t want my mom to find me dead but I donâ€™t want to live any more. I canâ€™t do it anymore. If I do it I hope she understands why.(sorry for my rant but Iâ€™m just done)
