I've told nurses and doctors my plans but they're all so calmSo I came in for a suicide attempt.
Told the doctor exactly what I was thinking when they visited. Well only part of what I was thinking.
Then I realised they didn't take my lanyard away when they went through my belongings I had thoughts.
When I went to the toilet I worked out. I tied a knot in my lanyard and hung it from the hook on the door. I thought about it. I was split seconds away from attempting and I instead undid it and went to the loo.
When I came out I called the nurse and said "can you lock this away i was going to hang myself" and maybe she didn't hear me but she was like "you want this put away in there?" Yes yes!
I thought theyd restrain me or have security but nope. They're so chill like they aren't concerned.
