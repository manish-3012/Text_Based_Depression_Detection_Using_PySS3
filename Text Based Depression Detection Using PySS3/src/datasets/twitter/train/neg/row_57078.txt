I'm desperate, therapy didn't help but made everything worse. I'm having suicidal thoughts again for the first time in a decade.I don't even have the energy to write about what has happened. I was looking for help in another subreddit and got downvoted, makes me feel even more rejected and not wanted. I quit therapy today, because it didn't help, it made everything worse. I think my therapist is very incompetent. Now I feel like there's no hope for me to ever become a better person. Nobody can help me and I can't help myself. On my way home I kept staring at the train tracks and had a hard time not go give in and let myself fall down onto them, waiting for the train to just make everything stop and to end my pathetic existence. I didn't have suicidal thoughts before I started therapy, now I do. What the fuck went wrong...
