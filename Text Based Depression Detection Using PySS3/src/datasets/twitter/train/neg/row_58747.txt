Its time to commit suicideIts the time to do it I hate everything about my life. I hate myself, My family, My school, My friends, My life. I have a loneliness nobody (I feel) can replace. All my friends are people I met on Xbox. No one will date me. All I get at school is mostly D's and F's never seen an A this whole school year. No one likes me at home or school. I think its time I should go grab a knife from my kitchen and some pills from my medical cabinet and go into my bathtub take all the pills and slit my wrists.
