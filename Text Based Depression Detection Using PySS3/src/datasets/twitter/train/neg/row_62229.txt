Shit sucks. I suck. Everything sucks.I don't know why i feel this way. Well i dont know maybe i do? Its just shit sucks right now and i need a hug and i can't get it from anyone. Not my friends and certainly not my family. I'm terrified im going to be living at home with my parents forever and im equally as terrified living in this god awful cess pool of a town forever. I know my parents are trying to do what's best for me but holy fuck they're doing a terrible job. They want me to work with kids because "you just don't have enough life experience to work with adults" whatever the fuck that means???? Every time i explain to them that "yeah i might not know what to do with my life but i understand i can get a job teaching anywhere so why don't you let me choose what fucking subject i'll teach and who to teach it to?" They always shut me down. They say "you don't understand" or "yeah and what then? You don't have every single little detail planned out so why do it?" Like are you fucking kidding me? I'm an adult for fucks sake. I know, i know, "why dont you move out??" It's hard to move out when you constantly feel like a child to the people who are meant to help you. If that makes sense? It's so fucking hard to escape this. Then again, i guess i never tried. The way my mind wants to go about it is to jump over the emotional side of it that way i won't feel bad for moving out but deep down i know that's not going to be the case. Sorry for the rant i just don't know who to talk to. I feel like there is so much going on even though I'm probably overwhelming myself. I have a good life here, i know i do. I guess im just unhappy with it. Maybe that's an understatement hahaha. 

If you read the entire vent/rant, thank you. You didn't have to but you did it anyone and i appreciate it.
