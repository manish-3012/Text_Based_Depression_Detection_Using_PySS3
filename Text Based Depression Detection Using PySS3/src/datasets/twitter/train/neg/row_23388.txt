Anyone awake and have time to help?I've been thinking about taking my life for a long time. 

My thoughts are confused between reality and fantasy. I dont know whats real anymore. 

Im married and Im not happy. 

What has kept me going is that I believe that there is a chance that the next life could very well be worse then this life. My awesome husband keeps assuring me that there is no afterlife.

I just want to rest. I want to feel nothing anymore. 

He is talking about getting a divorce. We will be having our one year anny in 5 days.

I just need to talk. I need help
