i imagine a better life to copeapologies if my grammar and spelling is terrible. im just so stressed right now. i found my old list of "how to go" that i wrote about a year ago. it's becoming more and more relevant now that im being crushed down by something i have no control over. im too sensitive and stuff. i can't control the way my family treats me. they keep saying "be yourself" but when i be myself which is quiet and reserved, they come bugging me and insulting me in a way that confuses me. i don't get what's so wrong about focusing and distracting myself with my studies. this is where i imagine a life where no one bothered me. its been years since i graduated elementary. yet even with time, i still want to see my friends' faces and maybe hang out with them. that's impossible to do since we're in a pandemic and i haven't talked to them in a while. we do talk every once in a while but then i know that im being selfish by taking their precious time away. they have better stuff to do than talk to someone they grew up with and studied with. 

 sometimes after watching an anime or movie, i fantasize myself living in their world alongside them. i fantasize myself flying in the air just like how the survey corps members do. but after a while of fantsizing, i cringe at how stupid it is. i could've spent more time doing my schoolwork than fantasize like some kid. i gave up sekf harming earlier this year. i stopped in March just before the city lockdown. you see, i study in another city. my home city is across the region so it takes hours to get home. i stopped myself from cutting cuz i didn't want to bring home fresh marks that would be seen by my relatives. i didn't want them to worry or shame me for my actions.  heck if they saw the scars, they might've taken me to some religious friend who will then pray for me. i wore long sleeves for about 3 weeks until it healed. 
dammit this looks long i might delete it in a while. thank you to the few people who read this.
