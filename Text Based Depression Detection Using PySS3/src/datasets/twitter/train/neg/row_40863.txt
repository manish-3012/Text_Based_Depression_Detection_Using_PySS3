I'm ending my life in 18 days. I've never had a human connection. Before I go, I just want to get to know someone, even slightly.That's all I've really wanted. I've been rejected by everyone in my short life and before I go, I want to talk to someone. I want someone to call my friend before i go on forever. I hope you don't mind getting ghosted on after two weeks.
