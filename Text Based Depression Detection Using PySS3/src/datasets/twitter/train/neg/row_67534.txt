Am I wrong?My now ex boyfriend broke up with me so that he can "figure life out". He was the only reason I liked being alive. He was my flame. I had something to look forward to. I had a reason to improve myself. Without him I have no desire to live, no desire to improve myself, I have nothing. I get that it is unfair to him, but I can't help that I can't find any internal motivations to live. I just don't know what to do, and I don't know what will happen if he doesn't come back.
