Further down the rabbit holeA week ago my entire world shattered apart. 
My boyfriend has done everything he can to try and pick up the pieces and put them back together, bless his heart. He's done a fantastic job, I'll give him credit. But after the millionth disagreement this week I just can't go on like this anymore. I can't keep dragging him through the mud like this. I can't force him to go through this impending court battle over my kid with me. I can't rip my kid away from the other half of her family. At the same time, I can't go on without her. 

Every waking moment I'm either thinking about suicide or relapse. The voices are more invasive than they have been since I've come off the Zyprexa. The Latuda doesnt seem to be helping. My case worker is virtually useless. My therapist is practically unreachable outside of appointment windows. I dont see the doctor again until October and I'm supposed to meet with the lawyer on Wednesday. 

I'm buckling under the weight of everything. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I can't focus. I have no motivation. I just want to end it all. I just want it all to be over. I just want to relieve everyone of my constant cries about the oppressive anxiety and constant fear. I just want to be free of the pain and guilt boiling within myself. 

I just want the courage to finally do it. To either tie the noose or pull the trigger. I cant do this anymore.
