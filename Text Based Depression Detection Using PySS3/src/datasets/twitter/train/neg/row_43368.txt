how to get over a breakup?I can't seem to get over it. My whole life has fallen apart, I feel completely alone. Now I don't even have anyone left to talk to about how I feel.
We had agreed to just be friends, but it just got worse and worse and even though I know I am not entirely at fault on my own, I can't help but feel so guilty and sad. I miss her so much. I miss not feeling so awful. When will any of this get better? 
I can't deal with this, I don't want to deal with this any longer. I want to get over it but I also don't want to. Every waking second is torture.
