Waiting for the sunsetI'm waiting for the sun to down, I don't want any hiking family find my body or something. While sitting on a rock I closed everything I had left over on the phone, you know subscriptions and what not I forgot about after I left home. I planned everything and it's really nothing but waiting for my "golden hour", so I had this idea. I always wondered who and why call suicide hotlines, like you know I don't think it could help, if I would think a phone call would hell I wouldn't be here right? I don't know but curiosity kicks in and I still have hours left waiting so why not ?
Typing "suicide how to" into Google search already brings up the regional hotline info as the first title so let's see... whelp that's one number from a city at the other side of the country, not exactly promising I guess.. whatever let's check out...
Dead line.
