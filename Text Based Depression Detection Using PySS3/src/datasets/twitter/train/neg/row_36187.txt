I'm afraid I don't know where to go from hereI failed my fourth attempt on the first of this month. It was a traumatic experience that left me dealing with an existential crisis. The holidays are always difficult for me and now those suicidal thoughts are back. I suffer from BPD and I'm afraid that I'm only one impulsive thought away from doing something stupid. I don't know how to handle these emotions when it gets this bad.Â 

I can't afford therapy so that's out of the question and don't have a support system that could help me out of these situations. It's gotten so bad that I've had an alcoholic relapse. I'm not sure what to do anymore.
