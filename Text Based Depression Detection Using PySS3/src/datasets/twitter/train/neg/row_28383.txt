why i should end it1) My parents would be able to use my education money to pay off their cars, and house and still have some left over for savings. This doesn't even include what i have in my own savings and checking accounts which i can make sure they have access to. 
I've used all the government money so the rest really is theirs. 

2) I won't have to write my finals. I'll pass if i do, but i won't pass with the grades everyone expects of me. There's nothing worse than letting down everyone who's been supporting you. 

3) My girlfriend won't have to deal with me anymore.  I know she says it's fine and that she loves me and wants me to be happy. But how long can you stay with a drowning person before they take you under too? I don't want her to suffer because of me. And if i do it -- long term -- she'll be better off. 

4) My suicide could be used to push the school for better mental health services. What we have now is pretty much nothing and students are constantly pushing for better. My death could force admin to acknowledge that there is a need for these services. 

5) My "friends" won't notice. If they do it'll be more "Oh shit, that sucks," than an emotional response

6) My parents can still get a partial refund on my tuition for next semester. 

7) old high school pals are in town soon. they can do a memorial or something to feel good about themselves. 

8) I have no skills anyways. I'm not good at anything and i'm headed nowhere. Im blindly stumbling through life and it's pitiful to watch.
