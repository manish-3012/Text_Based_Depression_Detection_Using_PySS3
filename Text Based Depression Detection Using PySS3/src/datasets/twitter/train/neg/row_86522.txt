Don't commit suicide.People say that suicide is an act of selfishness. But I am not gonna say that. Don't commit suicide. Because no one cares even when you are dead. No one will be forever sad for your departure. Everyone whom you think that you are a part of their lives, will eventually replace you with someone else and move on. Don't take your life for these sorryshits.
