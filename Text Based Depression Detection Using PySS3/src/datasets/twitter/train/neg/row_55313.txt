If I were to take my own life, but the people around me knew I was no longer suffering everyday, would it be at all easier to accept?Everyday is a constant nightmare when my brain, the thing that literally IS ME, wants me dead. I wake up wishing that I had died in my sleep and I find myself tempted to do something when no one is around. Everything at this point just feels numb to the point where I was pretty close to grabbing a knife from the kitchen just to feel something. I feel like Iâ€™m living a constant hell and Iâ€™m sick of it. So I lose the question: I know there are people in my life who would be destroyed to see me taking my life, but would it be somewhat better knowing I wouldnâ€™t be going through a living hell every day? I just want this horrible feeling to end. Itâ€™s every day. I just want to be free of it.
