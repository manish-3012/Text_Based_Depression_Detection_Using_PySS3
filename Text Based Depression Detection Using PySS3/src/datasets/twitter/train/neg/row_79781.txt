I'm tiredTired of being lonely, tired of being unlovable, tired of having a fucked up brain that doesn't work properly

I just don't see a reason to keep going. Things will never get better, they *can't* get better because I'll always be stuck with this body and its issues. I can't handle another 5, let alone 50 more years of loneliness and isolation. Might as well call it quits now.
