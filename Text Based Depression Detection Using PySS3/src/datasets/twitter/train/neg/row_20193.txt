Am I the only one who feels this wayI've noticed that, well, at least with me, I tend to handle sadness well when I'm already quite despondent. When I'm doing perfectly okay, these sad thoughts attack me, and my mood immediately takes a turn for the worse. It's almost as if by being happy, I'm letting my guard down and am somehow more susceptible to these sad thoughts. So, I find that I have to be sad all the time to not be as sad.

I know, the irony is strong with this one.

Does anyone else feel this way?
