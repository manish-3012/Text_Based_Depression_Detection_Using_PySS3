People are scum and I've fucked up my life. Please help meI trusted too many people. I trusted too many people (a dozen) with a secret that I wish I can take back. That'll get me kicked out of the house. That'll give me shit. 

I'm scared of people are going to spill. I'm scared if people will turn on me and use it against me. Im scared people are going to fuck me over.

I want to drop all of those people, but I can't because I'm scared that they'll tell others. I'm such a fucking idiot, I should've just kept it to myself. 

I'm so fucking dumb. I'm never ever trusting anyone *ever* again. I learnt my lesson, I wish I could just take it back. I really do. Fuck my life I want to fucking die
