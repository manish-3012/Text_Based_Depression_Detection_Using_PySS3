Why continue the misery?I was married for 15 years when my wife left, and for the last year I have struggled with moving forward.  Intense therapy (group and individual) helped, but only a little.
Ive got no dreams, I've got no goals.  I go to my dead end job from 7 - 4 to pass the time.  I don't really care about it.  I have no passion.  Sure, I fake being happy.  I joke with people in the break room - but its just a show.  Deep inside I know I'm a number, a cog in the machine.  Fuck it, this place wont change when I'm gone.

 I'm already dead inside, my physical body just hasn't caught up yet.  I want the suffering to end.  An existence not asked for but handed to me like prison sentence.  Everyday things weigh heavy on my mind like large iron chains.

There isn't redemption or hope.  Just an existence I suffer through day after day.  I want it to end, but I'm a fucking coward.

The cycle starts again.  "My life isn't so bad", fake being happy, choke back the tears, the feeling of being along creeps back... And I'm back to where I started.  Looking at my sad excuse of a life.

I should die, I want to die, I need to break this cycle...
