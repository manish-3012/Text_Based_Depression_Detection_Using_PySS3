I want to live, just not in this world.I want to live, I want to enjoy life, but not in this fucked up world, it's boring, it's pointless, there's nothing to do, it's not even about the money, even if I were rich there just wouldn't be something to do other than the same usual stuff, you could say I should find a hobby, but believe me, I even have too many, but they're not what I would call life.                                                                                                    I feel trapped, and I think I will just kill myself, i'm not even sad, I just think killing myself would be the only way to get out of this trap, who knows, maybe there's an afterlife that's better than this disgusting world.                                                                                                                                                       Does anybody else feel like this?
