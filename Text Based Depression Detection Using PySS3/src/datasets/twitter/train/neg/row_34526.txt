Wore out my welcomeI just recently realized my life was pointless and had no meaning. I'm not going anywhere in life as school just seems pointless and I end up failing anyway because I just don't care. I would relocate, but I have no money. I have about $9 in the bank. I can't get a girlfriend because I am so socially awkward due to asperger's. While I have a job at 22 cart pushing just doesn't suit my age anymore and it seems everyone else passes me up and I can't move up positions. All my friends are though work and I have little to no motivation to have friends outside of work. They know of my problems with depression, but I think they are getting sick of hearing how bad I feel. 

I don't drive. I am $9000 in debt. My mom won't let me go into the hospital again and I don't really feel like I deserve to get better. I have lost friends due to my depression and the paranoia that comes with it. I accused friends of using me to buy alcohol and lost some good friends. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I should start planning to kill myself and write notes for the people I love to tie up loose ends. I don't think there is any getting better this time.
