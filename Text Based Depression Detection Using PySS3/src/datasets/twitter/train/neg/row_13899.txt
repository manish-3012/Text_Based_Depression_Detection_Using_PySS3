Iâ€™m done with it all.Last week I told my mother I was suicidal, and since the time I attempted to take my life which she knows about, so have tried since.

Her reply was â€™don't try to guilt-trip meâ€™

I wasn't, I just wanted her to know. My depression has been bad recently, COVID isn't helping things. I don't get to be alone any more which I did before so I don't get any chance to rest really.

She takes everything and turns it around saying I'm bullying her or I'm twisting her words or I'm too sensitive when I try to explain. I spend a few days sleeping about 20 hours a day and when I do come downstairs she makes snide comments like â€™look who bothered to show their faceâ€™ or â€™graced us with your presenceâ€™. I spend so much time trying to explain what mental health is like but I have no spoons at the moment to do it.

I'm tired of everything, I can't move out as I don't have a job. In my last job, my manager would humiliate me and once a week physically assault me. No one did anything about it, I put in so many complaints, in the end, I tried to take my life and that's the last time I had a job about 5 years ago now.

I want to work, desperately, but every time I get close I feel anxious and sick at the idea it could happen again.

There is no point for me to be here, all I do is take up resources that so many other people could use and do so much good with. Iâ€™m just a waste of space.

I know how I'm going to kill myself, I just don't know where to do it, I don't want my family to be the ones to find me. 

No one ever mentions the psychical pain there is with depression, how much you hurt. No one tells you how painful it is to keep living when people ask you to carry on. Do you think they would keep asking for you to stay if they knew about the real physical pain you have to stuff through and well as the mental?

I'm a walking failure, in every single aspect, I want to just disappear.
