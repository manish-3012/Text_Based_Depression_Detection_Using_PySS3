[SERIOUS] to the people who tried to overdose on pills, what happened and how did your body react?When I did it I felt really sick and got a major stomach ache, I felt dizzy and eventually threw up and passed out.

But I heard of way worse things happening like people getting seizures and similar stuff..

So how was it for you? What pills did you take and how did your body react ? Or what side/after effects did you receive?
