Seriously thinking about calling it quitsHow do you tell your wife and her children that you donâ€™t want to be on this earth anymore? That the pain of everything youâ€™ve ever done wrong in your life is too great to handle? Do you leave them wondering, blaming themselves for the events that are about to transpire? Or do you leave letter, absolving them of all wrong doings? Point is, Iâ€™m giving serious thought to eating a bullet for dinner tonight. I just canâ€™t deal anymore.
