Told friendsI shouldn't have told anyone but I told a few friends that I've been considering suicide. They responded well and one of them got me in touch with a therapist. They've been nothing but supportive. But I feel so exposed, I'm analyzing everything I say or that they say, I feel like I've overshared, which makes me feel anxious and suffocated at the same time. I've never had "real" friends before so honestly I dont know how this goes. I dont know what the boundaries are, I dont know when sharing how I feel becomes too much. So I don't share. I dont know how long I have until they start expecting me to get better. I'm afraid I won't get better. I dont know if I really can call them whenever I feel low enough to attempt - because I'm feeling that way several times a day. 

They're giving me space which I appreciate, but also I wish one of them would force me to talk about this because sometimes I feel so much like I'm just going to explode but there is no way I can reach out on my own because I fear it'll lead to feeling like I've overshared and feeling anxious and suffocated. 

I'm also afraid that if I start talking about this - I just dont know what will come up. I don't know what's at the root of this and I'm not sure I want to know. I also feel like im never going to recover, so what's the point? I want to succumb to this - whatever it is. Because fighting it is exhausting and I don't have the energy to get up and fight. 

I feel like I just need someone to come snatch me up out of this. But I know that's not how it works. I have to be the one to get up, myself. 

I just regret everything right now. I wish I could start over... or end it.
