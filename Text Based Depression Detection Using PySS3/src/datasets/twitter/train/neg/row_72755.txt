What is wrong with me?There are so many good things in my life, and I appreciate them, but at the same time, I feel like I don't deserve these things. I have a good family, a good life, I'm in school, I'm the citizen of a very privileged country, and I get good grades. Yet I can't stop complaining. I can't stop cutting. I can't stop feeling like I don't deserve good things. And I've tried meditation and I'm taking medication and going to therapy, but I don't feel like I'm sick enough to be treated. I don't feel like I'm deserving of anything. I've tried to strangle myself a few times, and I've slit my wrist and worried the hell out of my parents. I feel like I should kill myself because I can't really cope with anything. And as I'm writing this, I feel like I'm complaining about nothing but shit I do to myself. I've tried taking a bath earlier today but all I could think about was drowning myself. I'm thinking about ending everything right now. I don't want to hurt my mom because she already lost my brother seven years ago to a car accident, and now she might lose her daughter to suicide. I haven't made a plan yet, but I don't know.
