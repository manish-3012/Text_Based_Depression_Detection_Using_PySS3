It's not an option.....but I keep turning to the idea again and again. I've had almost twenty years where I have considered suicide as an option. I've just started to try to take it off the table but the idea persists. I'm thinking about it right now...I'm not depressed...I'm intensely anxious, I'm trying to calm myself, to pull out of it, but one calming thought isn't a thought I should be entertaining - I can quit if things are bad. 

I don't WANT to be thinking this. I know it shouldn't be an option. I know what I have to do if I start going for the optionless option. 

I am calming a little but not really...I'm dissociating.
