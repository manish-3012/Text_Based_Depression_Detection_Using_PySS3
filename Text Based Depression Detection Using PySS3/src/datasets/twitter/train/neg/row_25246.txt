I just want the ptsd to stop shit please I'm going to fucking end it for a moments peaceI'm tired of empty promises about getting help, I'm tired of fortune cookie advice and stigma. Ah god the stigma, the judgement...fuck it I'm going to end it. I can't take this life anymore, my therapist admits they can't help me, my friends think I'm a crazy freak, my family is estranged from me, my gf left me - all because of ptsd. I didn't fucking get asked to be raped and beaten. I didn't ask for any of this awful shit. I tired to get treatment for 10 years but it only gets worse, just empty promise and people refuse to even acknowledge that their treatment doesn't work. Now Icome on reddit to cry my eyes out, the fool I am. I can't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore. Tired of banging my head against a wall literally and metaphorically.

Fuck me I'm gonna end it I can't take this daily agony anymore. Please god end it, please just fucking end it please this isn't a life it's a living hell and all anyone does it label and judgment me for it. fuck the labels why isn't there help?? Why is it that people like me being marginalized and suffering is the status quo?? 

guess this is the end, been a shit run. fuck
