Here I am again... hopefully for the last time.I donâ€™t care whether I live or die. I want to kill myself but thereâ€™s something stopping me. I have a lot of pills saved up now. I could go quietly in the bath. It sounds nice. My mother is dead now so I donâ€™t have to worry about destroying her. Nothing matters anymore. I just want all the pain to stop. If this is goodbye, I want to say thank you to all the people in this subreddit who kept me going this long. I donâ€™t know that this life was worth it but you tried to convince me it was. You tried so hard and I admire you. I just canâ€™t do this anymore.
