I can't find a reasonEvery morning before I get out of bed I need to find a reason not to kill myself
Some days I don't get out of bed

Today is one of those days where I've been lying here staring at the ceiling and my phone for fucking hours and I just don't know what to do - I can't think of any reason worth getting out of bed today other than killing myself
