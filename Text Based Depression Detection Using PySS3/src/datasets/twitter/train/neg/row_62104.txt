I have no motivationI'm at a loss as to what to do. I haven't really been excited or happy about anything about my future for a long time. I get happy on the daily with friends and when I'm gaming but it doesn't last very long. I recently got accepted a very good private school for a pretty great program, and was very excited about the large move and new city/program. I live pretty well below the poverty line as an independent. I am 25. I did not get nearly the amount I needed in order to attend the school.

The next day I wake up and go outside and think my car has been stolen. I call the police and make the proper moves and find out that it was actually in an accident with an unregistered abandoned car while parked. It was towed and impounded. I cannot afford to get it out of impound, even if they would let me pay, which they will not as it is registered to my mom. She has made it clear to me that it is not an issue she wants to concern herself with and is okay with letting my car go. 

I am okay with not having a car. I'm not in horrible shape and I live in a small-medium city so I can bike (no good public transportation). It looks like I will have to take out private loans in order to make it to school, but I don't seem to want it, let alone the fact taht my interest rate for the loans could be as high as 11%. I've lost interest in pretty much everything and I can't seem to find the will to fight anymore. I have no motivation to do any of these previous things I know I should do.
