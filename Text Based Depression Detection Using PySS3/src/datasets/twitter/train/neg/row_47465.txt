I considered suicide tonight for the first time in a whileProbably a mix of things. I binge eat, and am now at my most overweight I've ever been. I was doing well until around this time last year. I have serious body image issues. My girlfriend also essentially broke up with me because she told me she plans on moving (while I remain, going to grad school) therefore implying we would break up.

It's stupid, I just wish I didn't hate myself so much. 


Its certainly my fault for being like this. I am too insecure to admit my faults to myself so I don't lose weight or dump my manipulative girlfriend; but then I feel ashamed for my weakness so I have to be self-loathing so the whole world knows I hate myself just as much as they do because I don't want to look arrogant.


Man I just wish I could smile for once in my life
