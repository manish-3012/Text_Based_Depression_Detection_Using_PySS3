Iâ€™m constantly wishing I was deadHave had depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. On medication. Now Iâ€™m (32F) going through a divorce with my husband (33M) of 10 years. Heâ€™s really screwed up and has lots of issues from toxic parents, which is all coming up now. Iâ€™m so depressed and alone in a new city, which I moved to for him.  I feel like Iâ€™m losing everything and I have no future. I donâ€™t want a future. I donâ€™t care about anything. I go through my day, running errands, volunteering at an animal shelter, etc. but I just wish I was dead and the pain would stop.
