Curious about a Facebook support chatHi all. 

My partner recently set up a 'Drop outs anonymous' group chat on Facebook. It's just a small group. Some who want to drop out of college, others who feel college is beyond shitty but are still powering through. I hear it ding constantly as they chat to each other, share fun and shitty stuff and supply fun memes when needed. 

I wonder if anyone would be interested in something like that? But obviously for our life drop outs, not college? 
Just a 4:30am thought I had that I wanted to ask about on here.
