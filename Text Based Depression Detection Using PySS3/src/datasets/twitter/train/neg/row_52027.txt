I told my parents about my depression and they were madThey don't understand depression at all. Their logic is so twisted I can't think how to argue with any of their points. 

Then I told them about the suicide. They got even more pissed.

Saying things like

"Huh? then tell me a reason why you're depressed. You should be grateful"
 
"Son, you want to kill yourself just because something doesn't go your way? "Wahh I wanna die," is that how you feel?"

"If you commit suicide you'll go to hell. You're being really selfish"

Dad, you just don't know depression, even the slightest bit. You've never got it. I've had it for more than 4 years already and you don't even know until a few days ago. You called me the very thing I try to avoid becoming my whole life. I don't know what to feel anymore.

At this point my friends is all I have left. Funny that they understand me better than my parents.

Never confessing again. Never opening up again. If only I died the last time, this mess wouldn't have happened. The next time I do it, I'll have nothing to say to my parents. Though I'm thankful for them for supporting me all the way financially, all I ever want is for the pain to simply go away.

But I guess that's still too much to ask for.

Sorry, just venting out.
