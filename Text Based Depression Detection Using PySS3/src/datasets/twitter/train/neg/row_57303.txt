HelpI've always struggled with depression since I was little. Ever since my brother was born my mother has told me how I'm the biggest mistake of her life (her and my dad married because of me). My parents got a divorce over the summer and my mom thinks my dad cheated on her and is blaming it on me. She's tormenting my brother with it too but stopped about 2 weeks ago and is trying to get him to go to her side with it Allan's he comes home crying after spending time with her saying I betrayed her. My grandfather (a second father to me basically) lost his battle to cancer after 5 years, my best friend was in an accident and went into a coma and passed. I ended it with my girlfriend because she knew I was planning something and I didn't want her to see or worry about it. I loved her to death and wanted to marry her but I snapped. I tried killing myself twice afterwards and both failed. I'm probably about to try again. I need help
