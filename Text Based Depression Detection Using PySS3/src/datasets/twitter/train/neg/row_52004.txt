So tired of fighting itHi, I am 25 and have struggled with major depression and anxiety for the past 10 years.  I have been on multiple antidepressants which don't seem to do anything but make it worse as I am very sensitive to meds.  I recently went to a psychiatric ward for 4 days and they offered no real help.  I have a girlfriend who is also my ex wife and she doesn't understand and offers no help.  I'm going to therapy three times a week in a group setting it also hasn't helped.  I am currently withdrawaling from Zoloft and I'm in so much anguish and pain I just want it all to stop I need some peace.  I feel this will just keep getting worse and I don't know where to turn or what to do at this point.  I like being alive but I hate the suffering and struggle please someone help me.
