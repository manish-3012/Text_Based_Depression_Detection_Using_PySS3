Starvation : A plan that you can always take backThese are exceptional times. The current situation has changed all of our lives worldwide, and mine is particularly affected. 

I have become stuck away from my home country. I found a job here. I know no one here. I am all alone....

At least this is what I thought. I found someone. They made me feel complete, heard, and cared about. Now, tonight, they have told me that they do not and will never love me. 

I have been in this country for six months, and I must continue to work. 

I have elected to start a starvation regimen. 

As the world slowly eats itself away, so too will I and my relentless recurring act of loving people who cannot love me. 

The beauty of this is that I can always take action. I can change my path. I am in control. Right now, though, I plan for the ultimate self control and determination to give myself some dignity in these last moments.

I sense that many of you are loving people, and I am so proud to know that you exist.
