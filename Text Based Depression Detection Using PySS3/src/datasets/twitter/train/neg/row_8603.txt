Just don't know why I should live anymoreI'm too depressed I'm unhappy . My family doesn't except me because I'm gay . I've been played by a guy who doesn't even care about me anymore and I'm depressed . Saw him again today which made me even sadder . After watching 13 reasons why I've learnt that after killing yourself it's not such a bad thing u can always get revenge.  I'm tired of living honestly I literally never leave my bed
