Having trouble finding a reason to live.Hi everyone. The past few years I've really been struggling to convince myself to stay alive, and I'm at a low point tonight. I can't find anything in particular that's wrong with my life. I'm a graduate student at the school of my dreams. I have great friends, a supportive family. I feel like this should be enough for me, but I still want to die every day. I've tried nine different antidepressants and nothing works. I'm kind of at a loss of what to do.
