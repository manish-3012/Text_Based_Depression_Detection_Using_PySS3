I want to sufferThis is a sentiment I've run into multiple times throughout my experiences with depression, especially recently. Whenever I'm feeling depressed, I don't want to get better, I want to feel as much pain and anguish as I can - be it physical or mental. I want to feel despair so deep I have nothing to live for anymore.

I can't really explain it, but even though people want me to get better, all I want to do is wallow in my pain. I don't want to get better. I want to suffer. Nobody around me gets it when I try to explain it to them. Imagine you're in physical pain, you have a knife in your leg or something. When a doctor comes to help you take it out you refuse help and just lay there on the floor, absorbing every second of pain you can. That's what it's like.
