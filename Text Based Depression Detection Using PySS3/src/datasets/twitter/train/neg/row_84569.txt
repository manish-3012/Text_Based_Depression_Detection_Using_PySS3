Anyone care to talk with me?My life ultimately feels like it has no meaning. I go to school simply because they are giving me money to do it and I bullshit all of my classes. My job sucks and I dread it every single day. I have extreme difficulty forming relationships and maintaining them due to my current mental health. I once had a passion for music that has now died down and feels like an impossible goal with how little my music is progressing. I just donâ€™t feel like itâ€™ll ever get better. Life without meaning just feels pointless.
