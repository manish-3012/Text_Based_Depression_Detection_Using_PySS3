Guess I'm just destined to die alone.I have a job I enjoy, my own place to live and no debt. I should be happy with that because there are plenty of people that can't say the same. But I'm not happy, not at all. I don't have a problem talking to people or making friends, it's a relationship I can't find. 

I'm pretty sure of the reason too. It's because I'm ugly. That's it. The number of times I've heard "You're really great, but not my type" is starting to get to me. I'm so lonely all the time I can't take it anymore. I'm getting a razor.
