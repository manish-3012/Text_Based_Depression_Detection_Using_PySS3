i'm worthlessI hate myself because of people who treated me like shit. I struggle with depression for a long time, i have hurt myself and because of my mental state i don't get on well with my girlfriend even though we love ourseleves very much. I'm waiting for my appointment with a psychotherapist and every day i feel like I want to end it and die. I need help, I don't know what's going on. I'm lost. Need help.
