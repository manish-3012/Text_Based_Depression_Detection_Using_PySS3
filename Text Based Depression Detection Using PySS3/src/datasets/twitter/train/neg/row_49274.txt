Tonight.This is not worth fighting for. None of it is. I never will do anything good in my life. And when I have I failed. My mother is threatening to throw me out the house I shouldn't even still be living in at 18. My families dysfunctional ways are why I'm feeling this way anyways. They don't care about me save for one of my brothers. Fuck them all. I just feel like cutting my wrists open as wide as possible and bleeding out on the floor.
