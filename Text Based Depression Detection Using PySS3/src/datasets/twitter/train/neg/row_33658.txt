Iâ€™ve been told that the bullying I get for being a furry is a dumb reason to be suicidal. Is it?One of the main causes of my depression and light, but present suicidal thoughts is because Iâ€™ve frequently been getting bullied for being a furry. Itâ€™s online for the most part now, but it used to pop up in real life back when I was in school. Whenever I try to vent to someone, Iâ€™m usually told thatâ€™s a ridiculous reason to feel so depressed, and then I just feel like Iâ€™m being over dramatic. Is that the case?
