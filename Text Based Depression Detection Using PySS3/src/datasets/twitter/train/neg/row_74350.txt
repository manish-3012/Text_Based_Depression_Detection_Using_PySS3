The 31st is the dayThe last two years have been shit for me. And I've been depressed for years. Everyone hates me where I live. I haven't had friends in years. I have no one to talk to about my problems that understands. Everyday is a disappointment. Life has become so dull to me I have no pleasure in anything anymore. Last year I hoped 2019 would be better. And in 2017 I hoped 2018 would be better. I've tried everything and nothing has worked. The 31st of this month is the day. It's funny really. In my teen years I often thought I'd do it but never had the guts and life wasn't as bad. Now everything is completely shit. I'll finally be gone from this world. Hopefully what comes next is better. Maybe I'll be happier in the next run.
