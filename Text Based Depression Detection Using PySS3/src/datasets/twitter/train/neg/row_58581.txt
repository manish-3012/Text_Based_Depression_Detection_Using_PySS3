I work in a hospitalI have to say, working through a global pandemic, and having to go through all the infection control precautions that come with working in a hospital while feeling almost constantly suicidal, is actually quite funny when you think about it. 

Of course, PPE is there to prevent spread to innocent people as well as to protect me, but I still think it's quite funny.
