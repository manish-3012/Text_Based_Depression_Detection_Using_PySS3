Sensorimotor OCD and suicideSince August of last year, I've been obsessed with the physical sensation of breathing. This initially came from an immense cannabis-triggered anxiety attack, which then latched onto how short of breath I felt in those days.

Like any other affliction, it seems to fluctuate from being tolerable most days, to being something that makes me have multiple panic attacks on a daily basis. Hyperventilation and this naturally go hand in hand, since because I'm unwillingly focused on every breath I take, I end up getting more oxygen in than my body really needs.

My life doesn't have a lot going for it right now, even though compared to last year, I'm probably over the moon. I have a job after being unemployed for more than a year (even though I hate work with a passion, regardless of whatever job it is), and am in the first romantic relationship I've ever been in in my life.

Regardless of all of these positives, this breathing obsession ebbs and flows to the point where the past three quarters of a year have felt like a long-winded dark night of the soul. If things get worse again, I feel as though I want to fade to black, for good.

I'll miss my partner, I love him to pieces. I'll miss the few friends that call once in a blue moon, but I just don't know if I can live with this anymore. I've tried half a dozen antidepressants, I've tried eating better, I've tried exercising, I've gone to therapy and practiced CBT, and nothing's worked.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to hurt my partner, but I don't know how much longer I can go on living like this. It's alienating, it's hard as hell to talk to anyone at all about this, because I know nobody who's ever dealt with this. It's maddening. I feel my sanity on the verge of snapping. I can't deal with it anymore.
