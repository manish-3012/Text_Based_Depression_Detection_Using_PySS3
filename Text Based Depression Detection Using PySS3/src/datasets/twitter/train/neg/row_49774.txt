I could use some advice.Hi. Sorry, I'm not really sure if this goes here. Sorry if it doesn't. But anyway, I think about killing myself frequently. But I know I don't want to. I know things will look up and that I'm just having a tough day/moment/week. I don't have family to ask for help because they are all too busy acting like children [which is especially hard for me because I'm only 16]. I have a serious wonderful boyfriend [two years whoo] who is my only support system but I don't want to tell him about this stuff because I'm scared I will hurt him or make him angry. I don't want him to think any of this is his fault. Itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s just the way I get. I am on antidepressants [which aren't really working right now, me and a doctor are still trying tweak out the dosages]. I see a therapist once every two weeks. She's great but I don't feel like whining about this stuff when I'm not feeling bad. I hate bring down my mood when itâ€™s up [and it almost always is because she's so sweet]. I feel hopeless when I'm alone and I'm alone a lot. My boyfriend is off at college and I see him every weekend. But itâ€™s not enough. I don't have any close friends because I don't really feel like I fit in with a lot of people. And I don't trust a lot of people... _x000D_

So I guess I'm just looking for ways to bring up my moods. Not to think of suicide. And most of all I need to talk to someone when these mood swings happen [itâ€™s so hard to deal with them when I'm alone]. Should I talk to the boyfriend about this? Should I turn to him when I'm feeling awful? How can I do all of this without making him feel like his efforts to make happy are worthless? Because they are not..._x000D_

tl;dr: Feel hopeless and suicidal but with no real risk of suicide. Not many people to ask for help. Should I turn to my boyfriend or will I only hurt him?_x000D_
