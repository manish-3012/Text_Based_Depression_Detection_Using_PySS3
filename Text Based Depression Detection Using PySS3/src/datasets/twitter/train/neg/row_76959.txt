Iâ€™m sorry, I really TriedI need you to know this is not your fault. I need you to believe that this is not your fault.  Please promise me that you will not blame yourself for this. I know this is hurting you, more than you have ever hurt before, but please just forgive me and move on. Live the lives you deserve. Live each day feeling happy, and loved. Know that you are some of the most special people on this planet. Know that everyday, I tried to live my life as an example for you. I worked so hard so you could see what success was. I wanted you to know that you could make it too. No matter what anyone says, you are going to make it. You are going to make it and you are going to be the best goddamn people who have ever lived. I love you guys so much. I really tried, I did. 

I put so much love into this world and all I ever wanted was to get a fraction of it back. Just one person to say that they loved me and appreciated me. I thought maybe if I waited long enough, put myself out there, that it would come to me too. I see all these people and I think: â€œif they could find their person, maybe I could too.â€ I know my time for waiting has come to a close. Iâ€™ve been waiting on a new tomorrow for so long that I have to close my eyes and give myself a break. 

I have to go now, before I mess things even more. I need to make sure I donâ€™t cause any more of a mess than I am already making. Just please believe me when I say that it is not your fault. I know it will be hard but there is nothing you can do to stop me. Thank you so much for everything you have done for me. You gave me a purpose and now I know you guys are ready to go on without me. Never stop putting love into the world. There are people out there that really need it. Goodbye friends. I love you with fiber of my being. Iâ€™m sorry, I really tried.
