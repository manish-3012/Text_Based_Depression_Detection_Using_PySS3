Why canâ€™t I just be happy?First time here, no idea whether Iâ€™m on the right sub. I just feel so confused and would like some help.

I have struggled with my mental health for some time now. A year ago I started having suicidal thoughts but I fought them off pretty quickly. Within the last 6 months Iâ€™ve really gotten better, Iâ€™m feeling so much more like myself before all this.
But the last couple of weeks I have been struggling. I havenâ€™t been able to come to work and when I do, I fuck up regular stuff that I normally do with ease. Itâ€™s been so fucking scary.

This past weekend I was a part of something. I volunteered at a political event that I agree with so wholeheartedly and I felt like I was a part of something good. I canâ€™t really describe it. I just never been REALLY a part of something like that. The few friends I have refer to me as the person who is only sometimes there. I donâ€™t get as many invites as the others in the group. Iâ€™m always last choice.

Anyway at the event I met this group of insanely funny people and they invited me over to their party. It was probably the best night in my life. It was a big group and EVERYONE welcomed me. We talked all night, it was so intense and intimate. I felt so welcomed and preferred (does that even make sense?) that I canâ€™t even begin to describe it.

On my way home I couldnâ€™t stop shaking the feeling that given my earlier experiences, this would probably be the only time in my life that I would feel this good. I cried so much and my suicidal thoughts began again. Will I ever be happy? Why can I only have this once? And why couldnâ€™t I just have enjoyed it and thought back to it with bliss? Now I canâ€™t think about it, because it just reminds me of what little of that I have in my life.

I just donâ€™t want to feel anymore. And even though I donâ€™t want to die, I canâ€™t think of any other way to make these feelings go away. Theyâ€™re just too much to bear.
