I feel everything I do I fail itI know trying and learning is the key I watch others do it and I can never grasp it and it makes me feel worthless embarrassment and stress starts to set in as it quickly and painfully pushes from head to toe I have this feeling all the time as everything i pretty much do i fail it I'm just another human nothing special jeez i dont even like watching sports and that on tv because i know i can never be worth or valued when i die its I know I will never amount to something and that worries and stresses me.
