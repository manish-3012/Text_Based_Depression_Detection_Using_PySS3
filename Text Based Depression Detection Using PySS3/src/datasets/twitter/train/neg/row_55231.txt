I feel trapped in my lifeI hate every aspect of my life I have no friends, I have never had a relationship and I hate my daily life. after high school I started going to college because I thought thats what I was supposed to do and now I am in the middle of collage my grades suck because I don't care about my education at all I am just trying to ride it out. so now I am stuck in a collage I hate, with grades so bad I am stuck. when I am not studying I just sleep and hope I have a dream that is somewhat present, I have started having dreams where I am reunited friends I have lost because of my awful people skills and when I wake up I just start crying hysterically. I know something is wrong with me, I fuck up every social interaction I have but I can't afford to get tested for autism or anything like that and my parent would never " indulge my delusions " as they call it. I can't stand the fact I am 21 today and my life is so hollow and empty. no loved ones, no hope or dreams I can reach and no friends. The only reason I am still alive is because I am afraid to die and I don't know who long that fear will hold.
