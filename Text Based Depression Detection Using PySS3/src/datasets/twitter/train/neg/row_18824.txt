i wanna die but i always stop myself bc it's selfish for mei have an okay life and great, supportive friends, a supportive-ish boyfriend even tho its lowkey going downhill lmao, and i'm not poor. my mom buys shit for me and my dad cooks great food. my sister is rly cool. her cats love me. i shouldn't want to kill myself but i still do bc i shouldn't have been born this way. my mom literally said she "did all she could from listening to classical music to being rly healthy and i still ended up like this." idk why tf i'm so goddamn annoying w my huge emotional breakdowns and panic attacks and depressive episodes. and just when i started counseling at school and i saw hope lockdown happened and i had nothing again. apparently i cant get an appointment to get referred to a therapist atm, i gotta wait two months. sucks but i gotta deal w it bc more ppl need it than me, i cant kill myself.

and i know there must be some way i can fix myself. like i dont need to be so fucking negative all the time. but i dont know how to NOT be negative??? like how do people do it lol, everytime i think of how great life is i just get even more sad bc it's not logical how terrible i feel. then i try being positive for once and faking it, then i eventually have a huge ass suicidal breakdown instead of the tiny breakdowns i have throughout the months. 

anyway i fucking hate myself so much haha i just wish i can start therapy to fix myself so i can stop hurting other people and so i don't end up killing myself.
