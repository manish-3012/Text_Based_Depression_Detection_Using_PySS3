It feels like these thoughts are the only thing I have nowI'm unable to focus on other things. Shows, games, work, talking to friends. I always get distracted by sick thoughts. My family thinks I'm just a junkie. When I talk to them I always feel guilty because in the back of my head I constantly feel like I don't have much time left. I just relapsed on xanax after being released from the hospital for a detox 3 weeks ago. I haven't felt like myself or been able to sleep without drugs for so long. I used to be normal and happy. Now I'm scared for my life because I know my attempt wont fail and I don't know how much longer I can realistically hang in there for. All I do is feel miserable so that other people don't have to.
