Too much of a pussy to pull the triggerI turned 20 a few weeks ago. For the entirety of my short life I have struggled with anxiety and depression, lack of friends, and most recently I have lost enthusiasm and passion to even get out of bed. All of my relationships with women have ended with them telling me I am a manipulative liar and then they go fuck my "friends". I thought I had friends but everyone in this world is a snake, apparently even me. A couple days ago I went to the pawn shop and had a friend pick me up a nice Taurus PT111 9mm handgun. I have been practicing with it and enjoying my new toy but recently it's purpose has taken a darker turn. I have had non stop thoughts about loading the magazine, racking one in, and blowing my brains out. 9mm is a pretty small round and even with full metal jacket I'm afraid of a botched attempt that could leave me braindead and paralyzed in this world of torment. I don't want to die but I don't want to live. I just fucking don't know what to do anymore but I don't want to continue. I haven't slept in over 40 hours and I just signed a lease on an apartment today with my best friend. I know he is a snake like the rest of them and that everyone is trying to fuck me over. I am filled with nothing but regret and sadness and I want it all to end.
