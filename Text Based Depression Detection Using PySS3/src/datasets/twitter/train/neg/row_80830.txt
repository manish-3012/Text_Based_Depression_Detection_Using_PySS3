I donâ€™t even know anymoreI have never been a person. Iâ€™ve had depression since I was four, suicidal since I was eleven. Iâ€™ve never really made any connections with people. I was a nobody growing up. I remember the other kids didnâ€™t want to be around me. I just felt different from them. I remember the last time I tried to make friends one of them told me,â€ No one likes or cares about youâ€. It remained that way through the years. During my middle school years, I was getting bullied. Everyone watched but didnâ€™t say anything. Through all of this my home life wasnâ€™t good. My family was drug addicts whoâ€™d abuse me. Eventually by the time I started middle school my parents were arrested for drug related charges and I went to live with my grandparents. It wasnâ€™t a good place either. They abused me as well. I remember one day I came home from school and I was getting yelled at for not being good enough and that I should kill myself. I graduated high school and three months later I was thrown out. I was homeless for six months until the kindness of random people got me a job and a apartment. I have been â€œstableâ€ for the past two years. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I donâ€™t have anyone. I rather be dead. I attempted last year but I lived. I just hate myself too much. I hate every aspect of me. I cry myself to sleep every night constantly reminded of how worthless I am. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m sorry this is a jumble that means fucking nothing in the end. Thereâ€™s a lot of other trauma I didnâ€™t put in here, but it doesnâ€™t matter anyways because I donâ€™t matter.
