If it happened soon. It took too long still.I'm 19 years old. I didnt go to college and I dont want to go or do anything. None of my friends seem to care I keep posting I'm upset or sad and it seems nobody cares. I'm just gonna get rid of my life. It's not like I'm doing anything. I feel like a burden and I'm overall tired. I'll leave my savings to my burial so nobody has to struggle for that. I'm honestly contemplating laying on the train tracks by my house tonight.
