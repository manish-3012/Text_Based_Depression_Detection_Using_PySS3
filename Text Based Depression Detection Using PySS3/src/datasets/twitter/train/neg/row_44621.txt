Covid lockdown is the perfect time to disappear.I promised myself not to entertain suicidal thoughts for the first year after I was severely injured in a car crash.  I focused 100% on rehab and getting back my life as much as possible.

Year 2 was going ok but then Covid hit.  No more physical therapy and access to equipment I need.  Iâ€™ve been deteriorating and all my progress is slipping away.  

All those suppressed feeling are now surfacing and I can dwell all day on the reality that my entire future life is going to be a crippled mess.  I canâ€™t survive being bedridden until a vaccine emerges.  I donâ€™t want that quality of life and I have exercised hours every day to prevent that and it was all a waste.

Now that Iâ€™m cut off from everyone it is so tempting to just end all this suffering. Nobody would even notice I died which is perfect.  When things open back up people will probably assume I moved away and didnâ€™t tell anyone since I donâ€™t have FB.  Iâ€™m completely cut off from the world right now and it is comforting to know that nothing would change if I never went back.  

Even my doctors and physical therapists have given up on me when I said I wanted my life back and to walk, kayak, hike.  I wanted to prove them wrong but it turns out they were right...life isnâ€™t fair and hope is futile.
