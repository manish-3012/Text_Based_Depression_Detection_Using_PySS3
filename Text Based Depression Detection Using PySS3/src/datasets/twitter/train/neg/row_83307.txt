Thank you for your time. I have a really shitty life.  I don't have any real friends, I am a 20 year old virgin and I have a nonexistent relationship with my parents.  I tried to be a normal, functional person who has a good life, and I haven't succeeded.  Why should I continue to try and stuggle and fail and get hurt for a future that I truely believe will not happen?  I want to be like everyone else, I want to be happy and normal.  But based on my track record, I'm going to continue to be a freak.   So when should I say that the experiment was a failure and I am never going to live a life that will make me happy?
