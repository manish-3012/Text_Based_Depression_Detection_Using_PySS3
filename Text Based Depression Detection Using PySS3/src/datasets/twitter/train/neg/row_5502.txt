I'm most suicidal on my birthdaySo, it's my 23rd birthday today. Yeah me. I have now lived seven years passed my "no shit your last day on earth" day and that somehow makes everything worse. I was lonely and sad the summer before freshman year. then depressed. then I made a secret pact with myself that I would die before my 16th birthday. I came close but couldn't do it. So I pushed it to 17 then 18. Then I just sort of stopped caring about everything and it became this thing in the back of my mind that I was just numb to. But every now and then I feel to much or think to long and I want to die again. This is most true on my birthday. The simple truth is I'm a failure. I fail at everything. So, instead of having lived a full 23 years of life I have just been failing to die for seven. And what sort of life is that. Pathetic. Failure. Empty.
