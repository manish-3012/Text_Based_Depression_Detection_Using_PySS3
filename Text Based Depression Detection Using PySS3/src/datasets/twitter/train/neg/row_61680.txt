Almost 18 from Argentina. I want to reach out for help but it doesnâ€™t feel rightI donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ll give some backstory if asked. Iâ€™m having panic attacks again. I feel my end/the end of everything is near. I donâ€™t like what we do as humans. I want to get rid of all my possessions, have no house, leave (I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™d go) talk to the people I love and then swallow a lot of alprazolam pills my mom has (itâ€™s my medication but she keeps them, Iâ€™m on a low dose).

I want to go, and wait peacefully for death. 
BUT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE PEOPLE I LOVE SUFFER. I donâ€™t want my cats to see me â€œasleepâ€ and then never see me again. 

Keeping it short, I need help to get help. I need a guide, someone to help me make my decisions because I donâ€™t feel ok to make them.
Iâ€™m only asking for help to tell the professionals what they need to know so they can help me. 

Iâ€™m afraid to tell the people close to me Iâ€™m planning on committing. 

A part of me wants to end it all. But my other half is desperately looking for help. 

Thanks for reading.
