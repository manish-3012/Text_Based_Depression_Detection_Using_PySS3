I wish she understoodI just lost the person i have loved for three years. i finally found out, a few weeks ago that she liked me. we had something, for three days, and then she told me she wasnt ready. its killed me. she was the last thing keeping me from ending it all. there is nothing left for me. i dont have a relationship with my family at all and i have lost most friends. i feel ill constantly, i feel sad, withdrew, i have no energy. i feel a constant anger towards myself. and now this girl, she doesnt "like" me. not anymore. i ruined it. i caused arguments with her over pathetic things just to make myself feel less worthless when she told me she cared. im done, tomorrow, tomorrow will be the day. two days before her birthday. happy birthday. i wish you all the best. 

i cant do this anymore.
