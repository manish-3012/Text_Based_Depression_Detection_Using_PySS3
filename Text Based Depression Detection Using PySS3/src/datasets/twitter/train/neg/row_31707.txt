Girlfriend is in a bad depression and I don't know how to help.Hello everyone. 

My girlfriend's depressed. To the point that I wonder if she may be getting suicidal thoughts. That's why I'm here. I don't know if I'm strong enough to keep her up. I'm trying my best, but I realized I need help. Frankly, I'm willing to do anything to try and get her happy. To help her. Well, let's just set up some background to our relationship.

We're a long distance couple. Hell, I'm a teen in high school, as is she. I don't care if you have a problem with it, not why I'm here. Anyways, we met through my cousin, and got along pretty well. I liked her a bit, we spoke for a month or so, before deciding on a time to meet in our future. I was glad. I kept the pace slow, kept our relationship steady. But an unexpected error came up during one of happiest two months of my life. I found out more about her family. Up to this point, I thought she was in a happy family. A good one. A teasing but friendly mother, a sister who was annoying, and a father who shared similar interests and was kind and loving. But then I dug deeper. I learned more.

Her mother emotionally abuses her. The slightest failure by her causes her mother to go on a massive tangent of her supposed uselessness. I hear of how, simply because she has minor bad features, she's unlovable and ugly. My girlfriend pretends that her mom's okay, occasionally. After all, she's nice sometimes. Except the times when she publicly hits her.  There's more, obviously, but it's too much for me to truly explain. But, she's showed symptoms from emotional abuse. Extremely low self-esteem, bad social skills, little to no motivation, etc.

I don't know how to help. I've tried telling her to get help, because she's complained about these issues day and night, and will go on occasional rants. However, this doesn't help her, as she ends to up apologizing for talking about her issues and bottling it all up again. Since her complaints are the same, she doesn't really get any deep issues out. She dodges the subject often by trying to act cheerful when I know she's not at all happy. My attempts of getting her to talk to a teacher or a therapist has been met with "I'm fine"'s, "I'm overreacting" and such.  I don't know what I could possibly do to help her. Personally, as much as this makes me seem like a terrible human with no sympathy or emotions but hatred, I feel trapped by her. I feel that if I take a step away from her, she'll break and fall so deep into despair she may cause herself harm. I've talked to a lot of people I know about this and I don't know how to help. Please, someone give me ideas.
