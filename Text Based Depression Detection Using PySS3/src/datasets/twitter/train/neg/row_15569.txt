I'm so closeI think I'm going to kill myself. I've been able to look past how it will affect all of my friends and family, and I think I could do it. I am the least-likes in my group of friends, and that's how I feel almost all the time. 
Even my family doesn't seem to like me. Like I'm only around because I have to be. I try and stay out of the house to distract myself, but I just feel like a burden to everyone I'm around. I want to everyone a favor by removing myself from their lives. 
They would be so much better off without me.
All of them. I can tell.
