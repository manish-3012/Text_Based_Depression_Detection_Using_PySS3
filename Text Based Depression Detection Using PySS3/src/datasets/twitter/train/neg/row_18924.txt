i don't think there's anything left for mei'm going through a lot right now and my feelings are starting to get too stressful to deal with, i barely sleep anymore and i'm actually contemplating suicide right now

i don't think anyone would really care, and i don't want to deal with trying to fight anymore
it's just too stressful
