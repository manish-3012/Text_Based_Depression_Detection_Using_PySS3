Rather die with dignityI cannot handle setbacks in life. I went from having my own apartment and a good job in China to being currently unemployed and living with parents (whom are very different from me) in America. It is so hard to find a job now and you have to beg a like a dog to even get an interview. Then they expect you to be a wage slave and just maybe you can afford your own place to live. Life in America is a scam. I had a smart plan for my life and coronavirus ruined everything. I am highly educated with no job. It is very difficult to go back overseas during the current crisis. I hate being so dependent and reduced to such a low position in life. Oh yeah, my brothers are successful and doing well during the pandemic. I hate comparing myself with them. I still have dignity and not one person should judge you for killing yourself in the middle of a terrible pandemic.
