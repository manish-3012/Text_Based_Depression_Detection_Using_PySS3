If you are looking for a sign not to kill yourself, this is itI am not suicidal myself but over the years I have lost many friends to suicide.

I had my first experience with suicide when my friend decided to take his own life at the young age of 13. 

I almost 13 years later and it still feels like yesterday we were running about like normal kids enjoying life.

I hate the idea that anyone else is thinking of ending something that you only get one chance at. Time may seem hard but they can always get better.

Suicide doesnâ€™t end the chances of life getting worse, it eliminates the possibility of it ever getting any better.

I am a shoulder hear to lean on and ear to listen to whatever needs to be said. No problem is to big or too small to overcome, moving mountains can be as simple as off loading some of your emotions.

Feel free to open up.
