Three plans, each worse than the lastI graduated from college recently and I'm living with my parents. I can't stand being a worthless parasite much longer, so I've got 3 plans for the immediate future:

* **Sneakin' Out -** I'll bite the bullet and find a job - any job - away from here and sneak out from my parent's house. I'll only take what I can carry (I can't drive, so I'll bike to a train station). I'll probably die from a bad case of Not Knowing How Real Life Works, and it would also involve putting myself out there (Big Scary) and actually finding someone who would hire a guy with no experience during a pandemic.

* **The Military. Why Not? -** I'll apply for the Air Force, or maybe the Navy or something. With my degree, I should be able to get something. I know I'm perfect prey for the military (just out of college, shitloads of debt, no plans for the future), but at least it would get me out of the house and give me honors... or... something?

* **Into The Woods -** I basically live in a forest in the middle of nowhere, so I'll just take some beef jerky, a water filter, maybe a lightweight tarp, and just keep walking until I die from starvation, dehydration, extreme temperatures, exhaustion, or getting fuckin' eaten by a bear. At least it'll be a pretty place to die.

Of course, what I'm probably going to do is sit on my ass while my situation becomes worse and worse, but a man can dream (or at least fantasize until he goes fucking bonkers and shoots himself), right?
