NothingI'm a 20 year old girl, I've suffered from cancer in the past 7 years. Every one  was amazed of the way I copped even when I lost my left leg I seemed happy cheerful, I continued going to school even when the doctors didn't approve! And I was as social as I have always been even if a lot of people rejected me; it started with my best friend who didn't show up when I had my first surgery even when the whole class did and she kept it that way until my last year of treatment when she came to me in school and asked for a "textbook"!! And so many others who didn't want to be seen with a bald handicap girl. Still I brushed off everything and kept going. Until this year when I lost my hair again and this time not because of cancer but because I pull it out not only that by I also cut my arm  and pick on my skin and I don't feel a thing AT ALL. I'm depressed and I feel so alone and guilty.. I don't know if I should be greatful to my parents who were always there for me money wise and supported me or I should hate them for everything else; since I can't do anything I want at all with all the boundaries they've put along with this vague memory that I have of the child of my mom's friend raping me when I was so little! What makes it worse is I see my mom's friend and her child every other day and I've never said anything to anyone. I can't help but blame my mom for letting that happen especially that now I know that everyone knew he was caught several times with younger girls.. I want to scream and cry but there is nothing all I think of 24/7 is how I'm going to die, I've made 100.. scenarios in my head but I just can't do it.. I don't know what to fell or how to feel.. and it seems like nothing will change.
