is this the end!?fuck it i'm losing hope. NYC has a lot of people and i can't seem to click with any. my one friend who live in another state barely talks to me and sometimes avoid my messages. if i send her how i felt right now that i'm thinking abour doing something she would get mad at me. I also want to tell my ex girlfriend who treats me like i'm invisible but oh wait she says we still best friends ahhhh fucking bitch is a liar. I should tell her i'm doing it and make her suffer they way she do me but the goodness in me is holding everything in. What girl or people want to talk to a broken guy!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fuck this world i'm tired OF DOING THE RIGHT THING AND STILL GETTING PLAYED!!!!
