I think my mom is trying to kill herself [long] [xposted]* Apologetically **cross-posted** to a few subs.
* I will provide additional details if asked and apologize for the length. Brevity is not my writing strong point.
* **Tl;dr**: The title. There haven't been any "active" threats or attempts -- just vague statements, and actions somewhat akin to attempt.
* **Outside help**: we're talking to a lawyer, but he's is more invested in defending the criminal charges. I emailed my mom's therapist, but he hasn't replied yet. Tomorrow, we're calling the family doctor.
* As the real life resources we have are stretched/unresponsive/a long shot (respectively), I was hoping to see a small miracle in the form of internet advice. **Thanks in advance** for anything you can provide.

**Backstory**

* My mom has depression and bipolar disorder. 
* Addiction also surfaced the last decade -- first with alcohol, which she's quit for two years now.
* After a back surgery late last year, she struggled with recovery. She was also diagnosed with a chronic pain disorder.
* For a few months early in 2012, she was doing very well.
* Despite her sobriety, the addiction reemerged in the form of prescription drugs. She's fallen into the "they're prescribed, so they're okay" trap.
* The addiction came out about three months ago following a hospitalization -- while away, she began exhibiting severe symptoms of intoxication to the point the authorities were involved. It was discovered she was under the influence of various intoxicants in very hefty doses.
* An intervention with the family and therapist led to her prescriptions being taken and monitored by the family. She refused professional treatment; the legal result of this was a possession arrest with subsequent probation and drug testing.
* There was a brief lull in use and seeming improvement in her.
* She's since been skipping and missing court-appointed drug tests as well as therapy appointments and doesn't seem to care. 
* She's just now gotten into a car accident resulting in prolonged hospitalization. Even in her present situation she denies the prescription drug addiction. She has also just made the issue exponentially worse by acquiring another hefty prescription and being on hospital drugs. She's in a serious way with a physical injury and seems to have altogether given up.
* We (my dad, sister, and I -- the family) are waiting on her to come home -- if she even can. We're not really sure if she's going into custody straight from the hospital, even, and the offenses/record makes incarceration is likely. We want to figure out what will happen and what we can do if she does come home and refuse to go into treatment voluntarily, though.

**Specific questions/areas of advice**:

* Is there anyone we haven't contacted that we should contact? Lawyer, therapist, GP doctor, arresting officer -- anyone else we may have missed, however glaringly obvious?
* We were told we can call 911 if she's in immediate danger. But -- does that mean if she's actively trying, or I believe she just might try? 
* If it's a "she just might try" situation -- should we bring her back to the hospital ourselves instead?
* Is there anything the courts can do? I'm in the US. She will certainly face legal consequences for intoxicated driving. If this means she goes before a court, can the judge intervene if necessary? Can we/should we attempt to contact this judge?
* What else can we do? Well, I guess that's not at all a specific question, sorry. :(
* Specific advice as to the tentative current plans below would be beyond wonderful. Ideally, I feel she should be in a treatment facility and we're open to methods of coercively getting there at this point. But we need a backup plan if she does come home and stay home. Thus far, we were trying to discuss it amongst ourselves, excluding mom for the moment because she's absent and incoherent when present on the phone.

**Tentative Current Plans** (however pathetic they are)

* My dad says he can't totally abandon her; if she has no other relative or friend to provide constant care, he says he'll stay with her -- of course, she'll still be left alone for long hours; he's but one person. This ties into my strong feeling (I think I'm the most vehement of my family, honestly) that she needs professional in-patient care and monitoring. It's my opinion that my dad will never live down the guilt if he comes home from work one day to find her dying or dead; I don't think anyone could. But he's also such a person that leaving would also be impossible.
* My sister and I are choosing to withdraw ourselves from the house, at least temporarily, when she gets out of the hospital. We have various options as to where to stay and are in no danger of homelessness, so we're in a lucky way. My sister's a legal adult, though a lot younger than me; thankfully, there aren't minor children involved. As for feelings -- I can't speak for my sister's other than anger and distance. Mine are essentially that I can't make progress in my own life if I have to take care of her. I think we run the same risk as my dad; we'll both probably never live down the guilt.

Don't know how to end this so I'll just stop just offer another thanks. :( Thanks. &lt;3
