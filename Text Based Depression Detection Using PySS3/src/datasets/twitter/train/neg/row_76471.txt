I feel completely disconnectedI don't know if I am paranoid or delusional or both. Everyone I talk to looks at me like I'm a freak. In school they always called me a freak. There's something wrong with me. I can barely hold a conversation with people for more than 5 minutes without them walking away.

I don't know how much longer I can go on when I feel so disconnected from society :(
