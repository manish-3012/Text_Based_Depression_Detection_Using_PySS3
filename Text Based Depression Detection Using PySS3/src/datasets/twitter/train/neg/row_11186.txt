DoubtI have an invisible illness, or at least that's what I've been told. Chronic Lyme disease. It's been diagnosed and I've been undergoing treatment on it for the last two to three years. But there's always this doubt in the back of my mind. I can't help but wonder, what if it's all in my head? What if I made this all up and it spiraled out of control until I truly started to believe it? 

As a child I felt guilty seeing all these doctors, I worried that I was making a big deal out of nothing, that it was normal to feel this lethargic every second of every day. It took me so long to get a diagnosis, and even then, half of the medical community vehemently deny the existence of the disease in general. 

 I don't know. I can't figure it out and this guilty feeling of hopelessness is eating away at me. I feel like nothing will ever improve and I should just get this pain over with and end my freaking life already. I'm not going to accomplish anything, I'll always be a burden to my family, there's no hope left for me. My life has been wasted and it might as well be my own fault.
