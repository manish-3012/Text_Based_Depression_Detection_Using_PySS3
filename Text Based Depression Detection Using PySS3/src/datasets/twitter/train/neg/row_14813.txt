The voice in my head isn't mine anymoreI think I used to know him, but I don't know who is talking to me now.

Sometimes he speaks through my mouth. It just comes out. 

I black out a fair bit, find myself driving somewhere and I dont know how I got there, I just sort of wake up. 

He's telling me to do bad things. Bad things. But I don't want to. I don't think I want to. I honestly don't know. 

I don't know the person I see in the mirror, I mean I recognise him but he's different, not me. 

The things he's telling me to do is going to hurt people and I don't know how much longer I can control him. 

I dont know whos in control anymore. 

He needs to shut up. I need to shut him up.
