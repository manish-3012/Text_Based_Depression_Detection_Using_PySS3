What do I do? Where do I turn?I haven't got much time to write this out so I'll throw down a list that I've spout out about 30 times in the last week.

I recently was broken up with, the consensus of the relationship was that for her, it was a joke the entire time and that I was never really loved, most of what she told me was a lie and that our 7 months meant nothing.

My parents are literally the bane of my existence. Borderline abusive status but every time I've tried to tell someone, nothing comes of it. When I said I didn't want to watch a movie as a family because I had schoolwork to be done, I was told to eat shit and die. I can't move out, I don't have the money.

I am nearly reliant on medicine for clinical depression, ADHD, and insomnia. I can't sleep at night - it's been this way for years. But every time I actually take my medicine I feel numb. I hate it. It's like the opposite of a fucking claritin commercial. I'm in a fog and I can't get out until they wear off, and when I do stop taking them I'm considered less of a person it seems. More annoying, less fun to be around, irritable, everything. It frustrates me beyond understanding.

I can't land a job, but that's more economic status than anything.

For the past 6 months I've been debating suicide, wondering why go on? Why shouldn't I just do it? People won't miss me. I'm not well liked by many, and the few that do actually seem to *like* me don't even really know me. I'm more bottled up than anything, and I can't let it out. If I try it just gets worse.

What do I do?
