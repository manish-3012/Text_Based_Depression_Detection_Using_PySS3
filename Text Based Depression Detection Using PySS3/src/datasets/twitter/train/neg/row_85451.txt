I don't know what keeps me goingI've had one semi successful suicide attempt this year, that resulted in an overdose and coma, along with at least 3 or 4 other attempts where I have backed out last minute. My last attempt for example I put a hose from the exhaust of my car into the window and taped it sealed and ran the car for long enough that I started feeling it but before I passed out I got out of the car. I don't know why but I know that if I was drunk I would've gone through with it. One of these times I will and I'm just posting this because if I die at least someone read something I wanted to say.
