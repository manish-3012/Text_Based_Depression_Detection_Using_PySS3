Hoping 2019 is betterI met a wonderful girl last fall who Iâ€™ve been dating since then.  Weâ€™ve been through a lot together including me leaving a job working out of state and moving back home with my mom for a couple months.  I finally got a new job working with her dad and it couldnâ€™t be worse.  The works much faster pace then Iâ€™m used to and itâ€™s so stressful.  Thereâ€™s a lot of people and itâ€™s just not at all what Iâ€™m used to.  Well this coupled with the fact that I was told I wouldnâ€™t have her dads blessing has led me to some severe depression and anxiety.  If it wasnâ€™t for her and our 3 dogs back at my moms I really donâ€™t know that Iâ€™d be alive.. I hate waking up every morning and going to a shit hole job I canâ€™t stand then having a panic attack thinking that I might get fired and her dad and her family is gonna disown her because I canâ€™t keep a job.  Theyâ€™ve already told her before they donâ€™t want us together if I canâ€™t keep this job and itâ€™s so stressful.  Sheâ€™s said before that sheâ€™ll stay with me if I do lose the job I just donâ€™t want to pull her from her family and I hate it
