Planning your suicide years in advance?Have you guys thought of this before?

I'm planning to buy my parents a house after I pay off all of my debt and theirs too. They have no retirement savings, nothing to their name. My younger brother is almost as depressed as I am, but he smokes weed and has good friends to take his mind off of things, although I doubt he can help take care of my parents in the future. It'll take a few years to obtain the sum of money but I don't care about what I need anymore. 

I don't fit in this cruel world. It's run by greedy people, sex exploitation, and some untold form of inherent racism and sexism. I can't handle anything negative even though I'm cynical as hell. I should be tough after all the help I've received from mental health professionals. Even though I am over my trauma that I've experienced in the past, I don't want to continue to struggle for another 20 years catering to my genetic depression. People have to walk on eggshells around me because I constantly give the impression that I'm both on the verge of shattering because I'm so fragile, but also have an intimidating streak of anger in me ready to pounce out. My eyes are either glossy with sadness or glossy from sudden madness. Does anyone else here have anger trapped inside?

All I think about is me, me me me me. I am sick of me. I haven't cared about my passions or creativity in such a long time that it's made it easier to contemplate using myself as a vessel to help my folks out. I just want to rest in peace.
