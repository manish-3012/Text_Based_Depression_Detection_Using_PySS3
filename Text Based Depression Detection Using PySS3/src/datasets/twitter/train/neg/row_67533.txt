I hope you liked your stay. It's time to stop.My work is done here.

Frontal lobe's completely ruptured because some scientaintigy member got antsy and only then do I realize why I've never been 'myself': i'm tired of being forced into this script by 'Xenu' and his retard guard squad.

 I've thrown away and built more masks than I can count. There are men dead because I existed at the wrong place at the wrong time, and I feel nothing for it. I don't have feelings for anyone. Any activity I'm involved in ends in anger or someone bereaving from a distance.

I'm obligated to live by a contract I neither have a say in nor care to follow through.

I hate all of you.

See you in hell.
Don't go to wkg01kfs!fk0aio2fiaeoma!opfao! tomorrow.
