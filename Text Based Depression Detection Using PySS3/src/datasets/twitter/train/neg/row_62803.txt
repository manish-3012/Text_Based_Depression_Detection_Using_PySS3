Suicidal thoughtsIâ€™ve been suffering from depression for a good time now but recently Iâ€™ve had the idea of suicide creeping in the back of my mind.  Iâ€™m not one to be suicidal; I have friends, a family who loves and cares for me, and try to go o t and have fun every weekend. But even with all of those I still feel shitty and think to myself that life was so much better a year ago. Iâ€™ve been popping pills to try and ease the pain I feel but to no effect. Iâ€™m honestly lost and have no clue what to do.
