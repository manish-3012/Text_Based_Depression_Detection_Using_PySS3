No reason to live if you arenâ€™t normalThis will be my last post I donâ€™t plan on using reddit because tomorrow Iâ€™m actually going to be going through with my plan to just kill myself and get it over with. I already have my stuff planned out no talking me out of this one I have my letters written and am going to send out my last text to loved ones which is just family in an hour or two and finish the day playing PokÃ©mon and from there wake up and drive out look for a cliff and just jump off. I hate the fact that I donâ€™t look normal Iâ€™m smaller than the average guy and always envied tall and average height guys because they have the luxury of being normal. All Iâ€™m ever seen as is just some loser who overcompensates for his height. I never even liked my life that much either college sucks and was a complete lie people told me when they said college gets better. â€œIt gets betterâ€ what a bunch of bullshit. Iâ€™m thinking of taking out someone else but murder will just land me in jail not death well at least not immediately but I do plan on doing something stupid since it wonâ€™t matter so hopefully Iâ€™ll do something fun/illegal but in the end just leads to my death anyway.
