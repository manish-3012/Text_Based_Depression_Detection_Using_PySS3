I'm Posting Here As A Promise To MyselfWhenever I'm in an extremely vulnerable and depressed state I find myself struggling to reach out. This was the case a couple of days ago and I swore that if I survived, I would reach out. 

I've never considered suicide as seriously as I have in the past few months. It's beginning to occupy the same space in my mind where my dreams and ambitions would reside and it's slowly replacing them. 

I'm proud of having survived my depression this time, but I dread living with it. It's not something I'm used to. I've always been smiling, energetic and laughing. I have been sad and upset before but I recognize that what I'm feeling now is distinct from sadness. 

While I work at myself, I will do what I can to help others here. This sub can be a bit exhausting to deal with sometimes so thanks for taking the time to read this.
