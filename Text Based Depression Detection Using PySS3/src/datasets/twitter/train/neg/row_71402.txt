I'm so, so tiredI don't know what to do anymore. I feel like such a useless person. I'm clumsy, ditzy, and not super smart. I'm not very attractive, thin, or even a nice "thick" body type. I'm just a waste of space, a waste of effort. Every day I think of how much better it would be if I just ended it. I don't care if it's selfish. I've spent most of my life being selfless, taking care of others, making sure they're happy, even if it means putting myself down. So why can't I do this one thing for myself? 

My husband would be fine without me, he'd have our dog, his friends. My best friend would be fine, she's got a boyfriend to take care of her. My family doesn't even care. Nobody at college would notice I'm gone. I don't have any other friends who would care. 

Being a full time student, working two jobs trying to make ends meet, dealing with depression, anxiety, and PTSD for over 9 years, trying to be the perfect wife, daughter, friend, sister, etc., it's all getting to be too much.

I'm just so tired of trying. So tired of failing. So tired of being a waste of effort and air.

I'm just so. Tired.
