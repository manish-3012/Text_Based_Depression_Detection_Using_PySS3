I feel so bored and aloneI just donâ€™t really feel like making this a formal post with background info but Iâ€™ll try my best to have this post make sense. I just want to say I fucking hate life. Iâ€™m so ready to die. I hate everyone, except my dad and my sister, I feel like they are the only reason I am still going. I still donâ€™t get why they care for me. I just hate everything, especially what my life has become. I have always been an artist my whole life, huge passion of mine, went to college for art, loved it, now Iâ€™m doing what I â€œloveâ€ and I hate it all, I hate the people around me, everything is so annoying and nothing gets me excited anymore. Even my own best friends moved away like it was hot cakes and now Iâ€™m starting to realize how one sided my friendship was with them. Seems like I never got respect from them and all of my opinions or serious comments are laughed at or no one cares. Now I just feel alone, living by myself. I donâ€™t even feel like making new friends because I feel like the effort is not worth the reward. I get home from work everyday and either I sleep or get on the computer and play games or watch YouTube videos. Usually always thinking about a way to end it all or how Iâ€™m so bored and canâ€™t understand why my happiness is dead. Why life has no passion for me. Iâ€™ve done therapy and it seemed to work... sorta... I donâ€™t know, but man it just seemed like a lot of effort. I take lexipro, been on it for like 5 years now. Eh anyways kinda giving up on this post because in my head I think no one will get it, and that I probably wonâ€™t even get a response. Life is such a shit hole, I just wanna cry. 


Now that I read this back again just makes me wonder if I should even post it, like does my post even matter, does it have any value being posted or are people just going to think Iâ€™m annoying. 

I guess fuck it, kinda at a real low point today so whatever.
