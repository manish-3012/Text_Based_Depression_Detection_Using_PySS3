I've given up on my dreamsI got diagnosed with bipolar type two a little while back, the medication is supposed to take the edge off but it hasn't. I'm still anxiety filled and a nervous wreck around people. I'm still as suicidal as I was before.

I have a retail job that gives me no pleasure due to how critical I am of myself. Every little mistake I make is loud in my head.

I wanted to be a Youtuber since I was 12, since this damn depression hit me like a train and I found comfort there. I still do. I'm 19 now. 

I'm hurts knowing I could never be that. That I could never shake hands or be friends with people I consider role models, that I can not make people happy. 

I decided to lower myself and try and become a biographer, and I couldn't even get through a semester of college without a complete melt down and an abusive relationship.

And now I'm on the path of becoming a truck driver, because of my love of traveling. 

But I keep thinking that it isn't what I want to become. Yes I love to travel but this huge part of me wants to make videos, but I cannot because I am scum.

I have no humor and I'm ugly as balls and I am just human waste. I have no friends become I alienated everyone around me because I haven't been happy in years. 

Typically when I feel like this it passes for after a few hours but this has been stuck with me for awhile. I know how to die. I know what notes to leave behind. I have nothing to fucking lose other than my cat.

I just want to die.

EDIT: The feeling is getting worse. I am in planning stages. I can't stop crying and freaking out.
