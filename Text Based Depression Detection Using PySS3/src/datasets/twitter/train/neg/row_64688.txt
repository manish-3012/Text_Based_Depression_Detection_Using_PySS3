I thought things were getting betterbut here I am, wondering if I could kill myself with my baseball bat. Because that's how desperate I've gotten. and Im so alone that instead of talking to someone Im typing this post into reddit.
life is a cruel mistress. Death has become palpable. its like hes sitting across from me. its all I can think about. I just didnt know what else to do. Im so alone
