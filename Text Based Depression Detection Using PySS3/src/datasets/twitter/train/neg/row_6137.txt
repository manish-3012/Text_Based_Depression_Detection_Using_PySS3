I canâ€™t do it anymoreI sat here for an hour trying to type what I was going through, but I canâ€™t do it, I just feel empty. 

I have things going for me in life but I think about killing myself everyday and my mental health sometimes makes me physically sick. I hate myself and beat myself up over everything. 

I feel weak and I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
