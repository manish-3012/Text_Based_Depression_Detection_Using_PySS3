I'm probably gonna end it in a few hoursHey everyone, I'm really only posting to here because I don't have anyone I care about or trust in my life.
Not anymore that is.

Over the past few months, I let a girl into my heart, I broke down some walls and got over most of my trust issues.

Now she's gone and I feel betrayed.

This along with so many other things is just too much, I usually find a way past all this, but I just can't anymore, I can't keep being optimistic.

There's nothing out there for me, no one would ever love someone like me legitimately.

I'm human garbage.

I screw everything up.

So this is finally goodbye.
