Iâ€™m tired of being aloneEverybody keeps throwing out and rejecting me and I canâ€™t handle it anymore. Itâ€™s like the whole universe is just rejecting my existence, acting through other people to just make it known how much it doesnâ€™t want me to be here. I try my best to be the best person I can be and people still just donâ€™t ever want me.

I put all I could into trying to have a good relationship, just for my boyfriend to tell me that he doesnâ€™t have interest in me anymore. Iâ€™m just constantly being thrown out even when I try my hardest. When is this going to stop. I just want it to stop.

I keep contemplating suicide and I donâ€™t even have any good options to do it. I just want to go. I donâ€™t want to have to feel this anymore. This shit is killing me I donâ€™t want it.

I donâ€™t understand why the universe wouldnâ€™t put me out of my misery and just get rid of me.
