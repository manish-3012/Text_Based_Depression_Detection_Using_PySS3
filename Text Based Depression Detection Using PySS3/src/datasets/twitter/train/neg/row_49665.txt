I don't think I can changeFirst of all please do excuse my bad english since this isnt my first leanguage. A quick back story first , I'm 16 years old , very quiet and don't like any kind of confrontation,always was in the top 5 in my class and all my teachers tgink im smart but lazy (not true) , for as long as i could  remember people picked on me for this and still do . My dad had to leave the country in order to find a well paying job , my mothe rhad to stay home and take care of me and my brother (she is very strict) . My mother had very high standards for us and always beat me and my brother up . She always told me that im not good ebough , that im a waste of space  and that i'll end up being homeless or a criminal . I am very afraid of talking to ither people so i dont have many friends , and each day i feel more and more like my mother might be right and that  im gonna end up being homeless , i feel like i'm just a bother to everyone around me and that the only time people talk to me is when they need something .I'm just a noone that is slowly failing at everything and that has no future, i thought about ending it all , i even attenpted it once but one of my friends called me after seeing my syicide message (ye im that dumb). I know  i'm doing this for attention , and sorry for the long read but i just feel like i cant do it anymore , i started to slowly distance myself from everyine around me , im gonna end up all sad and alone .Can i change anymore is there still hope ?
