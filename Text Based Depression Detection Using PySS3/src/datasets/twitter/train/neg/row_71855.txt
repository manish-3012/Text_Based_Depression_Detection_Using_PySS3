I think tonight's gonna be my last nightI can't take this shit anymore. Bipolar's won.

I'm sick of being treated like shit all my life, being ignored and abandoned and being just a filler in people's lives. I'm sick of relying on meds which have done nothing but deteriorate my existence, I've tried every family of antidepressants and nothings working, and nothing will. 

Life is not worth living for, I'm constantly depressed and tired and nothing is working and changing.

I'm heading out in a few minutes. I've picked a building I know I can jump off and will. Then all my problems will be gone
