I donâ€™t see the point anymore.I quit a very stressful job 7 months ago that had made me hate my life even more than I already did. I quit that job and was very happy with that decision. I got a new job, and I hate it even more. So Iâ€™m going back to my old job and Iâ€™m so stressed out about it. Iâ€™m so stressed that Iâ€™m not making the right decision and that Iâ€™m fucking myself over. Iâ€™m also trying to move from Tennessee to California and itâ€™s expensive and I donâ€™t know how to apply for a place to live, I have no credit. If I donâ€™t leave this state I will end up killing myself regardless. I donâ€™t know how to do basic adult tasks despite the fact I just turned 21. I legitimately donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t fucking know. I donâ€™t see the point for anything right now. I just want to sleep. I just want to end it all.
