I'm afraid to keep living.My 6-year relationship ended 2 weeks ago, I forced myself to believe I was doing fine but clearly I am not. Through manipulative attempts, I tried to get her back such as stating I would move on if she did not find out what she was feeling for me. She broke up with me because she said she needed time to figure out her emotions and that she had lost some emotions, but honestly, I had hope and lost hope after she said she did not know how long that would take, "a  month, a week, a year...." I feel so alone and so much pain that cutting myself won't help anymore. I yearn for peace and for a feeling of nothing! I don't want to continue living because if this happened to my 6-year relationship this could happen again with the next person I find! I don't know what else to do other than find peace in death.
