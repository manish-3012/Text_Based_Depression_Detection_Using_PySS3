nothing works anymore.i used to be able to get lost in a good song, but now it seems that even that doesn't work anymore. and it's shitty. i've given up on everything else. i used to play guitar and bass. i used to love talking to my mom about things. i used to enjoy art, but now that class is just a chore more than anything. i also used to use writing as a huge outlet but now i find myself asking "what's the fucking point of doing anything?" all i am is a self-loathing mess who wants to die. i dont know what to do to fix this. hell, i'm not even sure i want to fix this.
