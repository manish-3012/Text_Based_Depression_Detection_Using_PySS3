Attempt failed. Will try to live with this given chance.When the first time I try this drug (it has a high dosage), I was pretty shock it has side-effect and trigger my cardiac because my heart was beating very fast. I just tried once, it's a long time ago and I'm afraid.

Couple hours ago I just did by multiply the dosage (8x). I was hoping this attempt would trigger my cardiac and die with a heart attack, but it isn't. Hoping just hoping, and I don't know why it's doesn't work, even I tried not too eat more 12+ hours. 

This drug has 3 chemical composition but I would not mention it. and the dosages I'd takes (1. 800 Mg; 2. 800 Mg; 40.000 Mcg).

Still didn't succeeded. fuck.
