I don't know how to deal with anything.I'm 27, alcoholic, just separated from my babies mother, I have no legal right to him, but I feel like I've hit rock bottom. I don't see my son for days at a time.. The happiness I get from seeing him is far outweighed by the sadness I feel when he's gone. Everyday is consumed by hopelessness and research into suicide. I've had one failed attempt, but I feel like I'm ready for the real thing. I'm sorry if I'm all over the place but I'm kind of desperate in my anxiety.
