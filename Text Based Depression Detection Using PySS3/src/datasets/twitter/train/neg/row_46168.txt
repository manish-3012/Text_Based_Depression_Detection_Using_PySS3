How long should I work with no fucking reward.I'm a law student in my final year. I graduate in two fucking months. I've been in therapy for months. My therapist thinks I'm doing way better than I am. I suffered a major loss over a year back and I feel like my life has never rebounded. I have moments where I feel happy. Where I land an interview or go on a great date. But I never get the Job and the girl always rejects me, and I feel like I'm back where I started. I'm 140 thousand in debt. Literally all of my friends are out of town or too busy for me. I spend every night and weekend sitting by myself. The weekends I try not to drink are unbearable. I feel like I've driven everyone away. 

I own a shotgun. I know I could saw it down to make it easier to hold against my head. I'm thinking I'll drive out to the country and call 911 to pick up my body. I figured I would buy the biggest slugs I could find which still fit my shotgun. It's a single shot so I figured I could try to shoot into my mouth, avoid the skull, and let the slug tear through the soft tissue and hopefully disconnect my spine from my brain.

I'm just tired of busting my ass (through law school, with my family, and putting on the show for everyone around me). I'm getting nowhere in my career. I'm fucking tired of getting hopeful for nothing. Tired of spending every fucking weekend alone. Tired of studying my ass off for something I have no hope for. 

I'm going to leave my twenties without ever having had a social life.

To anyone who reads this, sorry for my annoying post. Just my shout into the nothing I guess.

I just don't see the value in sticking around.
