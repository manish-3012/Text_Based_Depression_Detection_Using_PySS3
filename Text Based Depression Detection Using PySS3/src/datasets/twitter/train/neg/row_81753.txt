What if there was an alternative to suicide?What if we could all have our own private island together, with no worries, fears or obligations? All we would do all day is create beautiful art and tell one another how much they matter. When one of us gets down and feels like ending it, another one of us will be there to pick us back up.

But it's a foolish dream. I know deep down there is only one way out from this perpetual pain. I simply need to find the courage to put an end to it. I'm such a coward.
