Add an interesting titleSorry about the title, I was trying to be cheeky because I couldn't help myself, but hit enter accidentally.. Now it's just kindof odd, but so it goes.

I feel like every time I wake up everyone I remember wasn't me. Every perspective, might be a better way to say it. Every memory. It's like it's all been this strange fabrication, like I'm building a life because I'm supposed to, not because I'm doing it for myself. It's all for this other guy that i don't even know, but somehow remember.

Christ, I feel insane writing this.

I forgot my antidepressants somewhere yesterday and couldn't take them today. Probably can't 'till Saturday. I've felt like I'm on the verge of crying all day, I've been alternating between being lonely and horny (SSRI has been subduing sex drive so that's spiking too), I cut off the girl I was 'with' on Christmas day because she didn't want to be in a 'real' relationship, and the girl that was here earlier just left. I feel empty, just utterly empty. I keep rubbing this damned scar on my chest and I can't help but think about reopening it. I just want to be able to stop thinking, that's all I want. The only time when I can quiet my mind is when I'm having sex or cutting myself, and they're hardly permanent. 

I don't even know what I want to hear or why I would actually want to be able to talk when all I want to do is forget everything, but I just need somebody to fucking hear me. I'm tired of nothing mattering and I'm tired of life feeling so devoid of purpose and I don't want to keep trudging along pointlessly- it's just fucking miserable.

It all just feels like such a damn farce.
