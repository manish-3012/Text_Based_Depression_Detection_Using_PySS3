Do you ever just think someone is sooo freaking amazing?So Iâ€™ve been friends with this person Iâ€™ve been talking to everyday for months and heâ€™s pretty freaking amazing but I keep crying myself to sleep over it. I mean he has so many friends, I doubt he actually gives a shit/cares about me, and I doubt the friendship will last, does anyone even care about me, whatâ€™s the point with everything if itâ€™s just going to end?
