i cant function anymore. i dont know what to doi need to vent, will delete this dumb post xDXd

im failing all my classes and havent used my brain to solve anything in the past months so i feel like i cant function anymore, i cant think rationally, my attention span is destroyed, my adhd is coming in full force and idk how to tell my family that i have lied to them about my schoolwork. im 16 and i dissociate all the time, i cant remember what i did yesterday, life just doesnt feel real. I had too many expections and standards for sophomore year that i just didnt fulfil. i cant recognize myself anytime i look in the mirror, and i also get filled with so much regret.  i dont know how to reach out. i havent had a single friend since elementry school and have slowely been rotting away from loneliness i cant take it anymore.

im not rlly suicidal i just overthink. 

id just get ptsd if i called a suicide hotline to chat becuz the last time i did two cops came and wanted to take me away, right in front of my parents and judgemental sister.
