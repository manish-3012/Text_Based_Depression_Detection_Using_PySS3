i just wanna curl up in a ball and die alreadyoh my fucking god. my fucking lord. i fucking hate myself. i couldnt stop the things that happened to me. its my fault. i should have said no, i should have FUCKING DONE ANYTHING. I SHOULD HAVE TOLD SOMEONE. im a pitiful excuse for a human. i tried to be happy recently, seeing that others around me had happy relationships, i think i put my standards up too high. now im stuck in this place. childhood and teenhood were ripped away from me. this is tiring. when am i just gonna die. i just wanna hang myself sometimes. why do i try to hard to be liked, so hard to be loved, so hard jutst to feel okay. it's never okay in the end is it, huh. things really dont get better. fuck.
