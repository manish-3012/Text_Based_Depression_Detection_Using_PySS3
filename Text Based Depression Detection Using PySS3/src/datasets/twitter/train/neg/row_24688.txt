I think Iâ€™ve reached the enddramatic headline but i genuinely think iâ€™m done. thereâ€™s nothing that i can do/ offer. i donâ€™t even feel guilty abt leaving people behind anymore. at this point , i feel relief when i think abt it. iâ€™m just tired and i donâ€™t see a future for myself. i just wanna be done
