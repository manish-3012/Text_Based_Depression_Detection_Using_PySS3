Lowkey Ready to DieThe abuse my family puts me through is too much. I can't wait a few more months to move, but I can't move now when I'm not financially ready to. I'm a burden to my friends. I will never find love. I have no motivation to do anything anymore and all I get is shit for even existing. I am just stupid and insignificant. I want out. I want to overdose soon, I just don't know when. I need to let him know that this isn't his fault first, but I don't know if I'll see him until the 11th, and that's too long of a wait. I need out. I can't do this anymore. I can't keep thinking things will get better when I know for a fact they never will. I am hopeless. I'll follow up once I finally am about to do it...
