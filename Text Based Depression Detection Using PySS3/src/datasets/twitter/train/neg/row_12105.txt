I feel Obligated to liveI feel obligated to live. Obligated to my parents, namely my mother. I don't really want to live anymore. Don't get me wrong I'm not really depressed like everyone else here, I just don't understand the point of living. My whole life I haven't exactly been sad or ever that happy. I gain no joy from my friends, or any hobbies or anything else. Life is just a lot of work honestly. I don't want to go to college. I don't want to get a job. I don't want to do this and that in my life because I have to. Its all tedious, constant work. Where is the enjoyment?

Shouldn't we be alive to enjoy our short time here not spend it doing things we hate that won't matter in 60~ years from now. I don't see death as a depressing thing that you SHOULDN'T do. Some will say "Oh no you have so much to experience still." First off bullshit. Second, who cares, once I'm dead I won't care that I didn't experience any of it.

All though I feel I might as well stay alive so as to get a girlfriend at some point. That may be interesting for a short time. Although I've never had any cravings for social interaction. And like I said earlier once I'm dead it won't matter what I have and haven't done. 

I just want to be in a state of none living, but that would make my family, especially my mother, sad so I don't want to do that to her. BUT If I do do it. I'd want to do something funny or cool on my way out, Any ideas?

So what? Shall I end it or not? 

Inb4 You'll say don't do it.
