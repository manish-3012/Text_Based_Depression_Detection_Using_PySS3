the stepsit's weird. my boyfriend found out by mistake (saw my search history when he was looking up song lyrics). he really wants to help me, but i'm just trying to pretend it never happened and hope he forgets. it seems like it's working so far. i'm really good at making people forget about me, which will be an asset for later i suppose. he talked about putting me into a program or therapy, but i don't want any of that. i've already done plenty of therapy, i don't need more. i've tried medicine and it wasn't for me. i'm comfortable with the emptiness and sadness. i'm comfortable being forgotten and alone. the most comforting of all is knowing that in a few years, when i've finished serving my purpose, it will all be over. i haven't decided on where, but there's a beautiful bridge and a giant forest near where i live that's famous for suicides. although, i'll probably end up staying in my room and doing it there, hopefully with helium. need to do more research first. i need to save money to leave for my dad and sister too.   


it's funny, i always wondered why i hated being near home so much, but i realize i wanted distance. i want to be alone. i want to be forgotten. then when the time comes it'll be easier to forget me. and i know i'll be forgotten, i'm the throw away friend/person. people use me when they need me for what they need, then throw me away. it's human nature.
