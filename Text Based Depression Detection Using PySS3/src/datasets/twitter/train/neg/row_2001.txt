How to find the will to live againRight now after losing my 2nd tech job, I have little will to live and always think of how do I kill myself. I did manage to get a fast food job with full time hours, but that job gives me little satisfaction, and I have to work nights so I can't go to social activities. I'm still able to have a social life because I already have friends where I live. But, I have a lot of debt, and my job doesn't have good pay. I have the option to move back home, but I don't really have any friends there anymore because they all moved away. And likely I will have to work another fast food job there because it will take forever to get another day job. So therefore I won't be able to attend social activities to make new friends. And living with my parents is going to destroy the little self esteem I have left. So now I wonder how do I find some will to live again?
