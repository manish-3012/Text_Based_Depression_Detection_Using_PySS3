I want to dieI can't take it. I'm always uncomfortable. The people I care most about have given up on me. I feel alone. I'm afraid of the world. I'm lazy. I hate myself. I'm a burden to everyone around me. I have a rope but in not brave enough to use it. I'm probably going to end up suffering this shitty life in my mother's house watching myself ruin every good thing I come in contact with until I die pathetically of an easily preventable medical condition. Mean pms are welcome.
