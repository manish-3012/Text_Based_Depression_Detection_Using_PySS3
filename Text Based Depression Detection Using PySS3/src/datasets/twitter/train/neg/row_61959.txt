I will always be a miserable loserThatâ€™s what Iâ€™m destined for. Why would anyone believe in me if I canâ€™t believe in myself. I ducking suck. I have no money. Iâ€™m already in debt. I have nothing and noone. As soon as I get the chance I want to kill myself because no one fucking cares, no one understands and ever will, and I will never havefucking money ever in my life.
