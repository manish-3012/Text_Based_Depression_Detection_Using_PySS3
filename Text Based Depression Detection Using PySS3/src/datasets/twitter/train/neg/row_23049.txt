Is it selfish if I just leave. I feel like he is signaling me to do so/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jkf5bw/why_my_boyfriend_would_suggest_this_if_he_loves_me/

On top of this he is barely active talking to me. Yesterday he talked about marriage plans and then he said he was busy and bam I haven't heard him from yesterday Should I leave? I think he doesn't love me for real
Not to mention I always wonder if he cheats or no when he disappears randomly like that
