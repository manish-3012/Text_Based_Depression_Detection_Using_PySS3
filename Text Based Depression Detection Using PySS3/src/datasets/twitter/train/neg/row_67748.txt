Losing my closest friendsI'm so sad my best friend is ghosting me out of nowhere and I had a fight with my other best friend because she was emotional hurting a friend of her's that recently went to the ER because of mental health reasons. I feel so alone I want to talk to them but I can't. My other FaceTime me and that makes me feel better but I can't open up to them and still feel so depressed. I'm touch starved due to isolation and with a mom who throws things when she gets angry in addition not talking to two of the most important people in my life. I just want to talk to someone who understands me.
