I need support/help......please?So Iâ€™m a teen who has always been seen as that goodie two shoes,always happy, â€œgirlâ€ (if you canâ€™t tell by my user Iâ€™m trans) I have always made depressing jokes but because Iâ€™m â€œso happyâ€ no one takes them seriously..... except for me. I know I have my whole life ahead of me and Iâ€™m hanging on to that sliver of hope in which after quarantine I will be better and I will be able to see my therapist again, but Iâ€™m not medicated and I never have been but with the stress of online school and missing assignments I have seemed to found focusing habits I never knew I had. My parents donâ€™t want to bring me to a doctor because of the virus. At first it was fine but now I cannot focus on one thing for more than 5 (if Iâ€™m lucky maybe 8) minutes without getting distracted. Iâ€™m just feeling really stressed right now. This has made many thoughts of just ending it all since Iâ€™ve been cutting for months and have a special knife in my room for said thoughts and visions of the easy way out. Even though I have these thoughts I instantly think of how disappointed all my family members and friends would be because Iâ€™ve â€œthrown away my lifeâ€. Im just not feeling like dealing with this anymore, and Iâ€™m not begging for attention or love or a replacement in confidence, no I just want to feel valid and okay. Any support or advice on what to do is greatly appreciated. Thanks I guess.....
