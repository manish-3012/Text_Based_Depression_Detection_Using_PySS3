It feels like my brain is eating itself alive.I feel like I just can't live with myself because of how low an opinion I have of myself. Even though no one can objectively evaluate themselves, that's just too easy to say. The one doing the evaluation has visibility into how every moment of every day is spent in ways no one else does.

At work I can only perceive myself as a lazy slob. I'm a washed-up has-been who for three years worked hard and won awards but in mid 2019 began a long deterioration into a puddle of mediocrity. I'm too afraid to quit my job because I have a lot of debt and not enough saved up to cover expenses while giving myself enough time to find something else. I'm afraid that during the interval of unemployment my condition will only worsen. So I go from day to day, often failing at my duties and punishing myself for that. 

In short, I've turned into a parasite. I'm a waste of resources on this planet and in society because I'm not contributing enough.

The only reason I'm still breathing is that I love the people who love me and it would be really cruel to them if I took my life. It would be a huge mess especially because I recently bought a house and have been too fucking lazy to put together a living will despite being in my mid-30s and this pandemic. And yet, every time I see a weapon, the first thought in my mind is of that weapon ending my life, so as long as I stay fastidious and maintain control over my impulses I'll have to settle with the hell of living with my own worst enemy every waking moment of my life.
