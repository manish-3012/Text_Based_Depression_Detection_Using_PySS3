The underlying thing... Is that in context, things are okay. 
I'm going to school, I have a decent internship.. I have a wonderful relationship.

My parents are helpful in monetary ways but emotionally abusive in many more. 
The thought that everything is "okay" but I still can't find relief is exhausting. 

I just want to throw this out into the internet and see what people think
Who has been here?
Where did you go from there?
