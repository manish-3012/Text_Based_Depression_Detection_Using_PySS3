I'm having a hard time fighting.I've had a pretty rough life so far. I grew up in an abusive home and I've developed a few different mental problems from it. Just recently though, I've lost most of my friends due to a past that I deeply regret and am not proud of. My mother passed away and so has my grandmother recently. I've been trying to be a better person for the past three years and it just feels like nothing I do is ever going to make up for it. I've been fantasizing about getting a gun and ending it myself or jumping in front of a train. I just want to make all the pain stop, but I'm worried about how it would affect the few people I have left. Therapy and drugs just aren't doing as much as I need them to do.
