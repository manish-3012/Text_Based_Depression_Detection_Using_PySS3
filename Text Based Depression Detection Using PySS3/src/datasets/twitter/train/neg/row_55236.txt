Don't know what to do. Candle is burning out.I'm at my wits end. My life has been a complete cluster fuck up until this very moment. I have no reason to believe it will improve. I'm almost 30, and almost every single moment of my life has been a struggle. I have nobody.

I don't even know how to ask for help. But I can't do it alone anymore. I will end it one day. And it feels like it's getting closer and closer. It's not scary anymore. I'm not afraid of it. I'm just so sad and disappointed by it. Like this is what I became. 

I'm a wreck. And to get friends, family and other important things in your life you need to not be a wreck. It's too bad that this becomes a problem that compounds upon itself. I can't keep being the only person in my life. The only person who wants me to succeed. The only person who loves me. I can't love myself alone and want to continue.

Not sure what I expect to get out of this post. I just know I can't keep going. It's going to happen eventually.
