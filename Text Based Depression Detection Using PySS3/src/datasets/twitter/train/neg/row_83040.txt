mr. cellophaneuh... hi, guys...
uh...

been a while since I was here...

You've changed the curtains...

uh... anyway... last night I tried to strangle myself to death using a necktie. uh... yeah...

I... have spent the past week or so being... wonderfully used. I try to organise rehearsals for my theatre-group, and when everyone agrees, I'm the only one who shows up. I try to meet up with friends, and they've already left and ditched me. I try to help SO many people down from the suicide-state, and I'm left alone when its my turn...

...
Anyway...

I hope I haven't taken up too much of your time.
