I'm TiredI'm just....so tired. I'm tired of having everyone else's back but when I turn around,no one has mine. I'm tired of having to be the strong,badass,and tough one when in reality I'm human just like everyone else. I keep saying my purpose is to protect the ones I love, but who is protecting me? I help those who come to me,but who's there to help me? The one person I can rely on I don't even get to talk to often and even she hurt me deep. I keep running from my past and trying to do better but it keeps catching up. I'm tired of being the only one out for me. I'm tired of bring do damn alone,confused,and hurt.
I'm just so tired.
