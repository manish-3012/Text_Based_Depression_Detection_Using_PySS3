Feel like I'm dyingI'm not living. Zero friends, zero family. No job. Nothing. No reasons to live. I just get up and walk around day after day. Body &amp; mind are going to waste and are just starting to shut down. 

Feel like I need to end it all soon, as the despair of watching this happen to myself is pretty unbearable. Anybody out there? 

What the fuck happened to my life? It truly feels like it's over. I can't imagine a future anymore.
