I feel so defeated.Finally, after almost a full year of searching and being passed around like a bag of crisps, I found a therapist that *didn't* want to refer me to someone else. The first person I would see face to face.

I cycled a few miles. I felt so light and relieved when I sat down in the waiting room. But then a guy came out who told me my therapist is *literally dying of cancer* and they forgot to inform me.

Now first and foremost it's horrible for that therapist. I feel so horrible for her. That's the most important.

But I'm just so exhausted now. I've only been able to cry all day. I'm tired. I worked so hard, I got turned away everywhere. I'm getting worse and I've been crying for help since last October and no one has answered.

I don't want to die. But living is just so hard right now. I don't know what to do.
