my wishi am sending this message out into the universe... i wish all of us felt better and didnt have mental illness. i wish i could hug each and every one of you and just like that, you felt you are worthy of love and respect, and you didnt feel so alone. i wish... i wish so much. i wish we all had healthy families, financial security, and a safe place to live. i wish we werent afraid. i wish we could all take a deep breath, step back and say, you know what.. itâ€™ll be okay. 


stay safe x
