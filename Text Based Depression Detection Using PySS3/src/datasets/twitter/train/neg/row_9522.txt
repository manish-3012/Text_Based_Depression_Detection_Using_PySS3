Honestly just thinking about making this my last 30 daysI know I don't have it as bad as some (homeless)but my house has already no heat, about to loose water and hot water, so finding a job will be 100x harder smelling like shit. but I'm seriously tired of all this. I fight at my house 24/7. I've applyed to every job for miles, multiple times without ever getting response. I do not own a single piece of good clothing, it's all raggity and all with rather large holes. &amp; I can't even talk to girls on a personal level, somehow just scares me to much, I can easily cuss out a cop knowing full well I'm going to jail. And that is still Easter for me than talking 1 sentence I've to a girl.

I think ima call all the places ive put in applications for Monday, if none of it pans out ask my mother for the $270 she owes me so I can just walk east. Maybe find a job there. But if it gets too bad I can easily see myself offing myself soon.
