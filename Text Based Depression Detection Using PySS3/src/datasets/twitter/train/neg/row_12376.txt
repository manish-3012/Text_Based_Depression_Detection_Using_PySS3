I think i am done hereI think i am done here, here in this world its so meaningless here. Getting beat up at school and home. Its hard to take it all in  when youâ€™re a 14 y/o boy. The world is fun, not for me. Life is so hard to live these days. Getting bullied because i am short in school. And getting beaten because my mom dump all her hate to me. While taking needles every night for hormonal therapy. It hurts. If you try to change my mind list youâ€™re name because then i could list youre name and said you tried. Thank you for trying to help, but i made up my mind.
