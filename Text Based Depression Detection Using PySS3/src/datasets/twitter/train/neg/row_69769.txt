Why does no one want me?My friends and family donâ€™t really care and I know it. Iâ€™d love nothing more than to talk about how i feel with someone else but no one wants to listen. Im not important.

I hate to admit it but I want to be loved. I want to know what it feels like, but no one wants me. Iâ€™m undesirable. It doesnâ€™t matter how much I try to fix my appearance or personality. No one will love me or settle for me. Why is that? Even the most undesirable people end up finding someone, but what about me? Am I that ugly? Am I that annoying? Is it really so hard for me to be loved? I will kill myself Iâ€™m too tired. I cant do it anymore. No one cares so why should I?
