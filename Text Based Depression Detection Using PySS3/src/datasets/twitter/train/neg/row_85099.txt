I am planning to kill myselfHello Everyone, 

I am a 21 year old girl, who has been depressed since the last 4\-5 years. Since the last two days I have been thinking of killing myself. I have low self confidence and barely any friends. I fell in love with someone but they left me too.Despite me being very kind and nice to him. I live far away from my parents in a different country as the situation in my house is hell. My parents fight and physically abuse each other almost everyday and support from them both financially and physically is impossible. Aside from that , I have alopecia areata which means I have lost a lot of my hair. I am a girl and its very unsual for me to have it . Again, having bald spots prohibits me from going out from my home and ever make friends. As I am writing this , I think I have finally given up. I dont think there is any hope for me anymore. I used to be such a happy girl but I cant believe where I have ended up now. This is my first reddit or post in any forum and I want to know what would you do if you were me. I have tried to start up lots of business and worked jobs , but thats just not coming through for me. I just wanted everyone to know, i tried.....
