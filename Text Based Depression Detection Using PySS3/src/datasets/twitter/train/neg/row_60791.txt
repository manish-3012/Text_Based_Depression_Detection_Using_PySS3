I have opposite of the Midas touchEverything I touch turns to shit. I am tired of ruining things for the people I truly care about. This has been going on so long that friends and family are tired of hearing about it so I canâ€™t turn to them anymore. I donâ€™t want to bother them anymore so I have stopped trying. Alligator tears and what not. Iâ€™m 30+ and just so tired of trying to explain how bad it really is. Itâ€™s no ones problem but my own so I will not burden anyone else with it. Iâ€™m just done. I love you all and Iâ€™m so so sorry.
