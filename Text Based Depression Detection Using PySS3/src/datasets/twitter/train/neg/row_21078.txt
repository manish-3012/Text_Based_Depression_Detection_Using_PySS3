Unable to do anythingIt's been an awful year. Huge dramatic falling out with some friends, a lay off, many belongings stolen, suicide attempt, then another layoff.

I'm usually a very workaholic type person. But after the last layoff I just laid down in bed and haven't moved in 2 full months. I get up to get groceries and that's about it. I've got so many projects I could be working on while job hunting but I just can't.

I can't stop thinking about the falling out I had in the summer.

I'm evicted and must leave at the end of November. I'll be living in homeless shelters. I keep thinking I'll just jump off the bridge downtown and I think I mean it.

How do I get my shit together in like 24 hours? I mean I think it's too late as I already have to live on the street.
