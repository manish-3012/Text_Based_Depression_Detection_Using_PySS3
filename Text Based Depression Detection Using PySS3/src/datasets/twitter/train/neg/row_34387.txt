I don't want a future. I'm just tiredI don't want to live for long, my brain has adapted to my suicide plan so I can't envision my future past a certain point. I can't imagine myself at 25 or 35 because I just hope to God I'm dead by then. Because really what the fuck is so good about living anyway? You work, you sleep, you die. That's all. Everything inbetween is a complete variable and even then is not worth it. Life has nothing that would keep me here and I want to keep myself from ever finding some bullshit reason to stick around. 

If I let myself fall for some stupid reason then I'm no better than all the other fools who were dead set on killing themselves then chickened out and clinged onto some phony reason to live. I want to do it while I still have a drive to.

I'm just tired. And I want to rest. For good.
