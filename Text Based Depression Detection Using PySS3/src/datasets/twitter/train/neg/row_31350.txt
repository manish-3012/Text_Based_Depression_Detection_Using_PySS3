I really want to do it soon. Hopefully todayI donâ€™t know how but Iâ€™m just so exhausted. I donâ€™t see a future for myself and I really would be better off not being here anymore. I just hurt every day and mourning the baby I aborted back in September. I was forced into getting the procedure by my ex and that day haunts me and will forever live with that regret and I canâ€™t handle it anymore. I really want to just vanish
