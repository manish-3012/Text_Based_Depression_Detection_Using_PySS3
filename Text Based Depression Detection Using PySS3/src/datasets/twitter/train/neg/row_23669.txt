No one to talk to even hereI can not share any details of why my life feels futile because I know my SO will know it is me. I have no friends any more because the same reason I can't talk. Even if I could afford therapy I can't tell them how I feel or I'll be locked up. I want to die and it feels so lonely. I'm still trying to fix my shit but getting outed or locked up would ruin those chances. Just grinding through every day trying to fix an overwhelming situation by myself silently.  Too many people rely on me for me to give up but I'm hurting so bad.
