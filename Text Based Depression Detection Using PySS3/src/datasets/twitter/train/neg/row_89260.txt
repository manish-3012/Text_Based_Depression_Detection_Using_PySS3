I become worse person every day I live. Can't take it any longer, I'm so tired...I should end it while I still got some sanity left. I'm tired of this black, materialistic world. I'm tired of faking happiness, living under a mask. I'm tired of giving hope, but getting only disappointment. 

I'm 19 and I know it's too early to say, but suicide is my only salvation. I don't know if I'll do it tomorrow or in 20 years, but it will happen for sure. Just one more big disappointment and that's it.

I've never been loved. My family despises me and puts me down. Romance isn't for me, I'm a weirdo. I'm good looking and funny, but I'll never find someone to deal with me. I wish that I could be like everyone else, but I can't. I know there's people like me out there, my best friend is. I sometimes wish he was a girl because he's the only person I could imagine my life with. 

I have good grades on my college, but I know depression will take them away. Same like in high school. I live in a never ending cycle of being depressed - suicidal - giving one more chance - depressed. I don't think I'm capable of studying, working nor living anymore.


Wish I could have somebody to love. Someone to tell me everything is gonna be alright...
