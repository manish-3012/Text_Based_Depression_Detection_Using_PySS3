HIV positive and gay and very suicidal tonight. Life is horribleI cannot think of a worse life or time to be born. I was brought into this world with a plague in a place where this disease destroys the lives of mostly young gay men like me while sparing young heteros. It is a horrible awful nightmare and I want suicide to be my solace, my comfort that sometime this pain will be over.
