Honestly the check on a friend thing is bullshit.you know the check on the strong people? The silent people? The happy people? The worst part is I sit in silence and no one has ever asked how I am. But I see people reaching out with the obvious memes. And they don't respond. It's all for show. That makes me more sad.
