I'm ready.I have the means to do it quietly and without a mess. I don't want to go into specifics bc I'm fairly new to Reddit and I don't know how "safe" it is.

I have been married for 10 years and have 2 kids.  I love my wife more than anything but she constantly berates me and makes me feel worthless. I love my children but they disrespect me and constantly argue with me and my wife does nothing to back me up. 

People will say what I'm going through is normal but it doesn't feel normal to me. I am in a constant state of depression. I cry hysterically when no one is around. I have already planned the act, just haven't figured out what to write. Do I need to leave a note? What about my kids? I feel they will better off without me. 

Just waiting for the right time...
