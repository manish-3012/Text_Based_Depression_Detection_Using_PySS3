Birthday blues I guessMy 22nd birthday is tomorrow. At family dinner we talked about baby pigs and my sisters birthday at the end of august, no mention of tomorrow. I've texted over 15 people, whether they're in my life or not, to see if they wanted to chill or grab a beer tonight or tomorrow, the few that didn't leave me hanging had excuses to not see me. I didn't want to mention my birthday being the reason I want to hang but now I wish I did because I now I have the dreaded "first of many birthdays spent alone" at only 22. What really hurts is that I have changed a lot about myself in the past few years and my life has gotten worse. It's like everything worked out better when I was a fat lonely slob. Hahaha I've still never even had MY FIRST FUCKING HUG from a girl not in my family (only handshakes hahaha), I'm absolutely pathetic. I don't think I fit into this world and I'd bet that people would definitely agree with me. I'm scared to kill myself, all I truly want is for someone that cares to just hug me for a long time and let me cry this pain away, but I don't see another option. I know I'll be gone soon, best for everyone.
