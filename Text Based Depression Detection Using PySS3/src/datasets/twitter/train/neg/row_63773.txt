I'm such a piece of shit and it's finally coming to get meidk how long I expected to get away with being a cunt. god, there is nobody on earth now who cares about me. I have friends but I don't feel like they serious want to help me or believe I deserve it. I'm too afraid to ask. the person who was my best friend wants nothing to do with me now. the one person I thought I could count on to always care about me, I destroyed it some how. never forget how much easier it is to destroy than it is to build. I can never rebuild this. 

I'm such a piece of shit and now that I'm falling, the net below has completely rotten away. I always kinda knew I'd kill myself but I didn't think it'd be so soon. I don't know if I'll see new years. I was going to kill myself over the holidays but at this point I can hardly finish this week. I don't even want to see the sun rise tomorrow, but I lack the proper means right now. I cannot stand to exist anymore. there is no salvation for a person like me. even if I found a helping hand, I'd inebitbely bite it. I am truly the most wicked and repulsive human. and there is nothing I can do to escape my own evil influence.
