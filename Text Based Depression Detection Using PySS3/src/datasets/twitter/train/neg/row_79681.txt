I need help...It feels like I have nothing in my life. I'm surrounded by games, movies, and music, but all of that is just stuff. I have few friends, only one that I actually see. I have no social life, I go to work and I come home to sit in front of my monitor for hours on end while all my online friends are off busy enjoying their lives. I barely speak to anyone on a daily basis.

I'm also gay and single in the bible belt. I'm scared in a way of coming out, knowing that I could lose my job or any of my friends just because of my sexuality. I still live at home, I don't drive, and I feel like my life amounts to nothing. I need to get out of this fucking city, but I can't do what I need to do to move because I have no motivation. I want to die, and I know that if I can't make something of my life soon I'll more than likely kill myself. I just can't live like this, I can't carry this feeling of worthlessness. 

I don't know what help I can get... I'm calling my doctor tomorrow, but I'm at my lowest now, I need help...
