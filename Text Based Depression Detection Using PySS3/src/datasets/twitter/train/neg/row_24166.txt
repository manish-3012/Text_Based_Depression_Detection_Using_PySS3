What would happen if I jumped from a 6 floor parking deck?I'm tired of this life and people who pretends to care. Ended up in-patient over a miscommunication from someone calling the authorities on me because I didn't answer their text while I was sleeping. I'm just ready to jump. I'm tired of being called a man. Going inpatient caused a lot of people to sir me. I hate being a trans woman. Wish I was cis.
