Ready to go ahead and end myself tonightSeriously, Iâ€™m so fucking lonely Iâ€™d rather die than live this way. I have nobody to live for. I try my hardest to make some friends and it doesnâ€™t work. Nobody wants me (I mean, I donâ€™t blame them). I want to cry but I canâ€™t do it. I just want to drink until I donâ€™t give a shit then fucking end myself. Why does being lonely hurt so much?
