What a nightMy ex came over unexpected to pick up some leftover stuff, he found me suicide note and wanted to talk, I was having a major panic attack and just wanted him to leave. He eventually did and I decided to go out to get myself some weed to calm down. 
On my way out I get a call from an unknown number, apparently he called the cops on me they broke into my house and went looking for me. 

Eventually while on the phone with my mom I gave them my location. 

I'm at my dad's now cus they didn't like the idea of me being alone in my own house (had a noose hanging there) 

Just sad I didn't get to smoke my weed
