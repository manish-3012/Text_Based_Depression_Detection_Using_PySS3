Birthday's... ðŸ’”I see those kind of posts on this sub often. But yesterday i saw a lot of them, today also. And i decided to write some words about this. I also have a post written on my bday on this sub couple of months ago. Deep inside me if i am still alive i know that my next birthday will be the same. I'll have the same sadness, loneliness x10 and disappointed. Hope my 26th birthday will be different from the previous ones. (yes i still rely on that fucking HOPE! ). 

It hurts when you realising that you are getting 1 year older, and you accomplished nothing. And surprise, surprise that realisation happens on the day you've been born.

I hate the day i was born. And i mean it! That day is the saddest day of my life. Most of them I spend crying, especially when my ex didn't wish me a happy birthday (it happened couple of times). 

I also hate attention from people (luckily i don't have a lot of people, only my closest family). 

Honestly, i don't even know how it looks like to receive a gifts from friends on that day. Because i don't have them. 
Or have a birthday party... With music, cake, blah, blah, blah. Luckily i am kinda "big" for that now.  

I wasn't planning to write long post with words that maybe don't make sense. But you get the point my fellow suicidal friends. ðŸ’•

Love ya. ðŸ–¤ðŸŽ‚
