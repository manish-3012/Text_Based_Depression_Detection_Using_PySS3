Last ditch effort I guess (but Iâ€™m ready to kick it yâ€™all feel me ðŸ‘Œ)Short form is I live with a very mentally ill mother, started dating my best friend of eight years, fell super in love, wanted to move in with him, he apparently was getting tired of my relationship with my mom and didnâ€™t sit me down and tell me explicitly. He broke up with me after we celebrated our one year anniversary, he wonâ€™t really talk to me, and now I have no hope. Donâ€™t really have too many friends so I wonâ€™t be missed. Working on getting rid of all my art supplies and everything so they have good homes. Throwing this up here as a last flag I guess. Sorry for being a bother.
