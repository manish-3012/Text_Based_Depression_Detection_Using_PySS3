I want to dieDoctor's keep prescribing me useless meds.

There is one I want to try that might not fix me but at least make me a productive member of society.

But no, it's "off-label" use of a drug with almost no abuse-ability or side-effects.

Fuck I just want to try it. I swear in my next appointment I'm going to straight up tell the doctor I need to try it or I'm going to break down and overdose on hard drugs, although I probably will be hospitalized again if I say that...

Man what's the point of living in a country with relatively low-cost healthcare if all they do is say they know best, don't even try and give me any real freedom in choice, and end up having me waste 6 months on drugs I knew wouldn't work anyways.
