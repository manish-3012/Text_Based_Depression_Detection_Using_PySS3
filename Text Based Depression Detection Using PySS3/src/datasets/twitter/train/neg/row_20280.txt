I really triedI tried everything. I tried to remain positive. I tried meditation. I tried eating healthy and exercising and telling the ones I care about I love them..

Yet here I am. I know I am only  18 but i'm feeling helpless. My home situation isn't helping much either. I'm struggling to get into the one school I really wanted to, and even though part of me knows it's barely begun, my life feels over. I am a disgrace, I am a failure, I'm disgusting. im embarrassed. i don't want to die because there's so much to look forward to, yet i feel like if i keep living it'll just be a big disappointment. 

I want to end it.
