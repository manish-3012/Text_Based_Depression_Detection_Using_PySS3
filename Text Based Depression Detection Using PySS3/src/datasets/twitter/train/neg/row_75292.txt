Not existing in the world.I think of suicide everyday.
I think that itâ€™s a valid option. I genuinely feel like I do not belong. Living makes me uncomfortable, I feel uncomfortable breathing, living,...being. I stare at myself in my mirror and I donâ€™t recognize anything. I donâ€™t know whoâ€™s body this is. I donâ€™t want another body, I just want to stop existing. Iâ€™ve had these thoughts since I was around 13 and each year they get progressively louder. These thought have always been with me, no matter what Iâ€™m doing. 
Iâ€™ll be sitting in lecture and I find myself smiling over the thought of ending my existence, finally being free from everything. I get excited to think about suicide, because Iâ€™m so tired. 
I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™m going to kill myself, it could be days, weeks or years from now. I donâ€™t know. I feel like Iâ€™ll get a sign when the time is right but until then I will plan my funeral over and over in my head. Soon it will all be over.
Does anyone else think like this or is it just me?
