Feeling off about everything...I don't even know where to begin.  I am not going to lie, I am a little drunk right now.  I'm also not positive on the rules of this sub, so if I'm out of line at all please let me know. 

For whatever reason, I was thinking about what it would be like to kill myself tonight.  It's weird because I have a girlfriend who loves me, friends who would do anything for me, and family who would do the same.  Sometimes I just feel like it's not even worth it to continue.  I don't know If I would ever have the balls to actually do it, but it's something that crosses my mind from time to time. 

If anyone has advice it would be awesome.  Life is just so fucking weird right now.   Thanks everyone.
