Yesterday I tried to take my own life and the police officer made me regret callingYesterday I attempted to kill myself but ended up calling the police in order to prevent my death because I realized its not what I want.

The police arrive at my house and one says "So... If you had the intent of harming yourself, why even bother us with a phonecall?!"

That just made me want to go hurt myself all over again. I felt as if I'm wasting everyone's time and I'm merely a burden (which I felt prior to my attempt).

Wasn't a good feeling.
