Half assed suicide attempt number 5 maybe? I dont even remember anymoreI dont think hanging is going to work. I dont wanna try long drop, if i dont do it properly ill probably end up paralysed. Thinking of that makes me sick.

The only reason i havent jumped in front of a train yet is because i dont want to wait for it to arrive. I tried to fall asleep on the train tracks once, but it wasnt that comfortable, so i got bored and went home. 

I wish i had a gun.
