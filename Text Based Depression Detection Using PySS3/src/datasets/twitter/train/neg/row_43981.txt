Long time lurker.. never thought I'd be making my own post here, though. I've given up.I've never been the kind of person to compulsively want to kill themselves.. I've had suicidal thoughts for a very long time now, but there hasn't been a real desire to actually do it until.. a bit recently. I've been 1.) too afraid to and 2.) I believed my life had hope and meaning.

I moved across the country away from my abusive mother and older sister about 9 months ago. I moved in with my beautiful girlfriend who I've always been so in love with. I don't ever regret it. In fact if I killed myself right now, the day I was at the airport with her for the first time would be the happiest day I've ever lived. I escaped a life of abuse and harassment to a home of beautiful people that seem to care about me. But we fight a lot.. and that stems from the fact that I'm mostly unstable. Our fights always end up making her think she's a monster but in reality it's always me. I hate myself for ever hurting the person I love and making her feel the way she does.. 24/7 now.

I have no reason to live anymore. There isn't a single person I can make happy. As idiotic as it sounds, I love my pets right now and l don't know where I'd be if I had absolutely no one to hold or cry to. I never thought I would sink this deep.. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder when I was 14 (I'm 20 now) but I've always been.. stable. I've always been confident in using that word to describe myself.. but not now.

I've planned my suicide ahead a few weeks. This isn't some rash decision that I'm making right after something horrible has happened to me. I just can't seem to fight anymore. I feel like I'm in pieces.

I need help. I can be fixed. I can be talked out of this.. I think. Who knows if I'm even going to do it..
