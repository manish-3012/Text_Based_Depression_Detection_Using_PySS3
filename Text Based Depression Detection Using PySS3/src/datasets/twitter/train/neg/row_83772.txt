Wish I did it.So last night, I had to talk myself off a bridge, not in a "things will get better, dont do it" sort of way, more like "you'll fuck this up too". 

I have been to the doctor today, stated being hospitalised would only make things worse. So I've been given sertraline instead. Very reluctant to take that first one, knowing that it is going to make me feel even worse for the next month. Which, will kill me. 

Just don't know what to do. Only person I feel safe around, is the same person who has broken my heart and pissed all over the pieces. My friends are going through very tough times, so I don't want to intensify their current stress. And the one family member I have left, is my narcissistic mother, who uses my mental health against me, or uses my pain as a vehicle to brag about herself. 

I have never felt this strongly about going through with it. Just wish I had a guaranteed way of dying. Not looking for advice or words of positivity.
