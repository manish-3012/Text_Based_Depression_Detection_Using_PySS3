Help me help her.My girlfriend always tells me how she wants to just flip a light switch and be gone. We always drink a little here and there and then she will sometimes recede into this hole where she only talks about how much she just doesn't want to be alive and it hurts me because I can't help her. She will talk about how everything in the word is a distraction from what she truly wants and that is to just be gone. She has gone to therapy and she has been in antidepressants but everytime it's still the same, she will collapse on the floor and cry about how she just wishes she was never born and can't wait until she is gone.
