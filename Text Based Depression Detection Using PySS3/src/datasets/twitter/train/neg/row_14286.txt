What is wrong with me?The worst part of my life is that I am a recent grad and cannot find a job. Sounds like everyone else, right? I have a loving family. I have a girlfriend of three months after finally getting over losing a four year relationship with the love of my life. Besides not being employed, I honestly have nothing to complain about. Yet, here I am. I hate my major (computer science) and feel completely lost. Here I am with a degree to something I think is interesting yet I don't give a shit about. So I m cornered. My family will not accept me going anywhere other than CS. So do I just despise work forever assuming I get a job or do I just run from my family? Or, do I just take the easy way out? Do I want to do this. Hello, no. But I'm lost. I just need someone to help me
