n gkrd;mdgjgmdm;After a year of playing musical therapists and my medication making my depression worse there is no motivation for me to get better, I am just waiting for the day I am no onger scared of death. I am too far gone to be happy or lead a fufilling life, the ony future I see for myself is as a kermit or as a corpse. I have too many problems to count; severe depression, crippling anxiety a complete lack of social skills, no human interaction outside of my family, weight problems, no motivation to take care of myself, a terribly overactive sex drive, no way to verbally comunicate my problems, and confusion about my gender. I was never meant to live this long, nobody was able to help. All three of my therapists cared very little about my actual progress, I know how hard it is to care about every single patient, and it's not like I was of much use not being able to talk about anything. I don't want help anymore, or rather I don't expect help anymore. I assume that some people are beyond saving.
