I'm in the hospital now.3 days ago I attempted to kill myself. I went to my favourite place, down by the lake in the city I used to live in. I took a 12h overnight bus ride to kill myself. I bought a bottle of pills and took the whole thing. And then I waited. I walked around down by the lake, and if I wasn't waiting for the meds to kick it, it would have been quite a nice walk. Then I had to pee. Of course, because it's winter time all the washrooms by the lake are closed. So I walked up the road to a gas station and used the bathroom, then walked across the street to a coffee shop and used a payphone out front to call an ambulance. First time I had ever ridden in an ambulance. I was still coherent and perfectly lucid and remember everything. I had to drink charcoal, still as gross as I remember it. They pulled blood for testing every 2 hours the first night, then slightly less frequently. Poison control were the ones who ordered that. My arm is covered in bruises. And I have a 24h guard to keep me from leaving or hurting myself. Not that I will, its stupid to try and hurt yourself in a hospital. I'm pretty sure the R.N. that dealt with me in emergency resented me. It makes me feel worse that I wasted all their time. I know it won't be long after I leave here before I'll try it again. I got them to hold me till Monday, but I don't know what to do after that...
