I tried to kill myself todayMostly just posting this because I feel like I have to talk about it.

I tried hanging myself today. It actually almost worked; I passed out, but the belt broke and I woke up with my arms and legs tingling from oxygen loss. When I got up I couldn't remember who I was at first. But when I came to I just kinda sat there. I didn't feel sad, I didn't feel ashamed, I didn't really feel anything. I just sat there and held my belt for a little bit.

I don't really know what to do. Recently I've become so numb that I can barely feel anything. I keep thinking I should go to therapy, but I hate the idea that I need help to overcome my own problems. I know it's a stupid mentality, and that therapy will probably help, but I just hate having other people try to help. I can't help but feel like this is something I should be able to beat myself.

I kinda just wrote this because I felt like I had to talk about it. Thanks for reading, this subreddit seems really helpful.
