Want to kill myself tonightI truly have no reason to keep living. The job I got a month ago is already looking like they want to replace me as they are training new people to do the things I was hired to do. I have no family that wants to talk to me. The few friends I do have are all skipping the state. I have never had someone tell me that they loved me or even that they liked me. In fact I've been bullied since I was 10. I've been told that I should remain alone and that I'm hated all my adult life. Very, VERY few people want to spend time with me anymore. I just know that nobody will miss me.
