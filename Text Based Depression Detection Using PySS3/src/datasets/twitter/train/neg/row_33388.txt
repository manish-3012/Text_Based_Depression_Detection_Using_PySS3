Nothing SpecialI'm trans, can't go on hormones due to a fairly rare medical complication. I have no genital sensation due to a botched circumcision which likely cannot be corrected through surgery. I've had plenty of girlfriends but it never worked out out (gender issues mostly) now that I'm out its so much worse. Any strong emotions I've ever had for anyone have been unrequited. No one wants to be near me, I get laughed out of queer bars and I am in a large supposedly LGBT friendly city. I'm a "girl" until the pants come of then whoever I happen to be with realize I'm not really female despite their liberal sensibilities. I've heard plenty of talk about how lesbians are okay with trans chicks but honestly my best guess is thats just talk. I don't blame them. I've been beaten more then once in public by strangers because of how I look. I've been raped and wrestling with the PTSD is exhausting me. Nothing is intellectually stimulating. I'm at the end of a one year promise (to not do anything permanent) from my last suicidal period and I promised I would at least reach out one more time if things were still this way. I'm involved in an early intervention program but nothing they've done has really helped me. Nothings got better, worse actually. I feel alone I feel empty and the more time that passes the more I want to end it all.
