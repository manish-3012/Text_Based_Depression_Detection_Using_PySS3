My attempt and the responseI tried to OD on pills a couple of days ago. My semi-estranged husband found me and stopped it.
He has been such a rock and â€œhisâ€ friends/family have been checking in daily.

My mother thinks it was a blip and Iâ€™ll be fine after some rest.
My best friend/boss hasnâ€™t spoken to me - I assume that heâ€™s pissed that I called out from work.

Itâ€™s an eye opener, for sure.

Iâ€™m not ready to go into the specifics. I just wanted to share.
