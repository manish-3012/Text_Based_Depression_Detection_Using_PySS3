Iâ€™m still angry with you ...Itâ€™s been five fucking years. Several times before you called me and I knew from the tone of the call what was happening. Each time before I had called 
For help for you and it had saved you. Now I canâ€™t forget the day you called and I could not see through the storm to what you where really saying. Iâ€™m still mad at you. I canâ€™t get over both my missing the signs and your readiness to leave me alone in this shitty world. Iâ€™m lost and ready to join you if it was not for the few anchors have here ... fuck you dear, yours eternally in pain
