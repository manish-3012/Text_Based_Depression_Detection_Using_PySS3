My third post and I am sorryI am sorry but I feel like commiting a redemption posting here because its anonymous and I do feel better at receiving anonymous love and care from the internet.

I am sorry that I disappoint. I go everywhere and I disappoint. I say sorry and I mean it because I hate myself for disappointing and for disappointing you. I talk too much and I am sorry. I keep to myself too much and I am sorry. I am still figuring it all out. I go to sleep so I don't have to live and disappoint. I wake up and its an another day that I disappoint myself and the people around me. I say "I love you" like I mean it but you say I am too easy. I cry because I disappointed you. I hate myself for thinking too much about not thinking enough. I am sorry, and I love you all ~
