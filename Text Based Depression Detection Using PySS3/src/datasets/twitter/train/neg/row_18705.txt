I want to die so badlyMy depression is overwhelming me.

I can't eat anymore and I can't stand food at the best of times.

From the minute I wake up I feel like I'm having a heart attack because there's so much pain in my chest.

I have no motivation. I'm miserable all the time. I cry daily. I despise myself so much.

I've started meds and therapy but I don't know how much more I can take. How can every walking, living, breathing moment of your life feel like hell?

I'm going to be 18 soon. I thought life would be different; I would be happier. Nope. I'm still the same old, disgusting me. 

I feel like I'm stuck. 

I'm supposed to be starting school tomorrow but I feel like I'm going mad. I feel like I need to be admitted to hospital. I can't cope with life. I'm a broken person. I'm just a waste.

I hate myself so much. I envy others. I'd rather be ANYONE but me, *anyone*. I can't stand the way I look. I know what I need to do to change but I just can't do it. I can't do anything. 

I put my family under so much stress because I'm constantly suicidal. I just don't think I'm meant to enjoy life.

The urge to kill myself gets stronger everyday I continue to be a failure.

There is no future for me.
