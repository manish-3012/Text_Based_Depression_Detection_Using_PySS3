i bought pressed pills recentlyit feels weird. every other method feels so difficult. i think about the lethality of guns, but wonder about the logistics of aiming a shotgun. slitting wrists is unlikely to work. i think about jumping off a building and worry about the passerbyâ€™s, but mostly i could never work up the nerve to make the jump, even after researching and visiting the tallest buildings in my area. i failed at hanging once when i was like 15 (yep, even failed at suicide!) &amp; now it feels even more daunting.

i just realized that i donâ€™t have the balls to kill myself in a way that feels like itâ€™s on purpose. itâ€™s easy for me to hurt myself though. itâ€™s easy for me to put poison in my body or self harm or be unsafe places. i decided to turn my life into russian roulette. i could say so many things about my life or why iâ€™m doing this but ultimately itâ€™s just because iâ€™m weak, which ironically enough is a big reason i want to die. i donâ€™t think i should be alive. i think my family would be better off without me, same with my friends. i think i could change this in theory, but i never do. i am never good enough or better enough, even when i try, and i never try hard enough. i donâ€™t really know why completely. i just resigned myself a long time ago? like i just realized that i shouldnâ€™t be here and from then on i knew i was going to kill myself, and that it was probably the best option, and there have been several rock bottom moments but itâ€™s mostly a gradual worsening. i hate hope. i hate that iâ€™ve been alive this long. iâ€™ve wanted to die for over a decade, but iâ€™m still here. that fucking embarrasses me. i will not survive this year. i will not survive this month. i used to want to want to be alive. i donâ€™t anymore. i donâ€™t want to go to the hospital or reach out to a friend. i guess a small part of me does, because iâ€™m posting hereâ€”but iâ€™m smothering that part of me.

i have a few pills. iâ€™m just going to take them like theyâ€™re regular oxy, idk how strong the fent is, but iâ€™m pretty opiate naive. iâ€™m not going to call a friend or a hotline, or post here, or text anyone. iâ€™m just going to take a pill. if it doesnâ€™t work i guess iâ€™ll wake up like itâ€™s any other day. but i think it will. i hope it will. and if it doesnâ€™t, iâ€™ll do it again. i like drugs anyways. iâ€™m going to reevaluate my method if all the pills donâ€™t work, but iâ€™m trying to be optimistic for once in my life. 

itâ€™s weird. the main feeling i have? i should have done this a long fucking time ago.
