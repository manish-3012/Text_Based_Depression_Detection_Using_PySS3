TiredI'm tired of going to bed hungry. I'm tired of not being able to pay bills. I'm tired of being berated for not going into debt with college. I'm tired of working 2 fulltime jobs. I'm tired of getting 2 hours of sleep every night. I'm tired of not being able to buy basic fcking things like shampoo, toothpaste, food, toilet paper. I'm tired of being tired. I'm tired of living. I'm so fcking tired. I want nothing more than to die and honestly I dont know what's stopping me.
