I'm tiredOf

my parents gaslighting me and making me feel insane

having to be there for everyone but the other way around is non existant

my parents lying just to make me do things their way

my dad

not being able to decide what I want to with my own life

forced to follow everything that my dad asks me to do

my avpd making things difficult

having to take responsibility for my parents mistakes

being used like a tool

random panic attacks
