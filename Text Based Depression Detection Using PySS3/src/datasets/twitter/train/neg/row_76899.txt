Iâ€™m just going to die alone anyways. Whatâ€™s the point in trying anymore.Iâ€™ve written my letter but I donâ€™t know anymore. I just want to be happy and life just feels dull right now. Iâ€™m slowly going insane over these kinds of things and it just feels so meaningless. Iâ€™m laying about 5-6 feet away from a girl I really really like and I just wish circumstances were different. I wish this would end up in my favor and Iâ€™ve been patient and Iâ€™ve been trying to stay hopeful and Iâ€™ve been bouncing off of different girls and different friends just trying to find someone, ANYONE, who gives a shit who I am and what I do and itâ€™s just fucking worthless. Iâ€™m so alone and Iâ€™m so scared and I just want to be fucking happy man. I just want to be happy more than anything and itâ€™s not happening. I know my problems seem kinda stupid but this shit keeps me up at night. So yeah. Iâ€™m sitting on a huge bridge as we speak and Iâ€™m just crying to myself and I think Iâ€™m going to do it. This is my last Hail Mary for help. I just want to be happy. I donâ€™t want to be alone anymore. Iâ€™m sorry
