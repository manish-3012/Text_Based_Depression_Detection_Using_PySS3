I would like to stop existing.I've felt like this for years now. I'm now in my early 20's. Even after I've accomplished the main things I've wanted in this life. I recently started a youtube channel (something I've always wanted to do) and it's been a huge success. I got the job I wanted. the car I wanted. I am still consumed by an overwhelming want to die. I am tired of feeling like this. I wish I just had the courage to end it all. In the end, we all die. so what's the point of it all now?
