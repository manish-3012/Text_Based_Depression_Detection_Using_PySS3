I'm tired of being a worthless person, living a meaningless lifei have never felt loved or wanted in this world not even by my family and i'm so tired of being alone. I battle suicidal thoughts and depression alone, i go through everything alone and i'm really done with this. I'm worthless to everyone i know, fuck this i wish i was something worthy but i'm not 

everyone says every life is precious, every life matter and no one should feel alone when they are struggling but that isn't true at all, being depressed and suicidal is all i know in this life, going through everything alone is all i know in life, being worthless is my fate in this life and it is so cruel

what did i do to deserve this fate? what kind of an evil super power has put this fate for me? 

a fucking life like this isn't worth it
