I'm concerned for a friend.... what do I do??Hi friends

I'm an American army man living in daegu, South Korea.

I'm dating a wonderful South Korean woman in Seoul South Korea... (about four hours north by car)

Her cat passed away this morning (fell off her balcony) after working all night.. and she is exceptionally sad about it... and this afternoon she started making passive SI remarks about also falling down to end her life

I'm really concerned.. we haven't been dating long but she told me briefly about another suicide attempt she had appx 1-2 years ago...

I can't get to her home tonight to make sure she's ok... and now she's not answering text messages or answering her phone... I don't really know any of her friends to check on her...

I don't really know what to do here...  

Do I call the Korean police? A Suicide line in korea? I'm freaking out and I'm scared
