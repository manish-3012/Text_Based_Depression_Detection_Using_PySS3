Alone, in pain.I don't have anybody, and I haven't for a long time. My parents love me and often mean well, but they have also traumatized me and will always make me uncomfortable. People on IRC are somewhat acquainted with me and gleefully exchange wit and anecdote but are not there for me on the bad days.

I've made two attempts at my life in the past year, the first time I wandered the dorms with a bleeding head injury long enough to make up a plausible story before someone noticed and drove me to medical attention, the second time I went un missed for days in a state of unconsciousness and then delirium in the privacy of my room in a shared apartment.

I have been putting up walls for so long I cannot honestly remember what is behind them. I alternate between longing for human contact and being absolutely terrified of it.

I have tried therapy, and then I tried it again. Both times I was never hopeful and trusting enough to reach out even slightly and no progress was made. 

I am out of hope. Hell, I ran out of hope a year ago. Maybe even longer ago. I am spiraling even lower today and I have reached out to coworkers, online friends, and have found nothing to brace my fall.

Someone please hold me close and pet me softly until I fall to sleep and never wake again.
