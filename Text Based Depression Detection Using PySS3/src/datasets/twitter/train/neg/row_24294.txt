If anyone truly knew me they would hate me.I'm lucky, I've got people that love me. But they only love me for the face I have put on.

I'm a monster. I'm a creep. I know what's right and wrong, sometimes my brain doesn't though.

I just need a break from my fucking boring town. I need a break from everything. This is getting too much.

I know I'm going to die young, suicide or not. I know it's going to happen. 

I don't want to die, I want to be fixed. But the only cure is death so that's my only option.
