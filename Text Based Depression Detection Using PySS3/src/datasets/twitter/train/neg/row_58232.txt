What's the pointMy friends have all left me again when I needed them most, my mom is completely unstable and abusive to me and my grandparents who I love and live with do all they can for me, but I feel like such a waste of resources and feel like I'd be better off dead for their sake and so I wouldn't have to feel this pain anymore.
