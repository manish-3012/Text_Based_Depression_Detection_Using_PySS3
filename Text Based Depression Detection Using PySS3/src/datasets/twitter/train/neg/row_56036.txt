I found a gun, these are my last worthless words.I'm positive that no one cares any more. I am done, I have no future. Nothing. I can't fix all of this shit wrong with me, everyone thinks I can, but I can't. They all get their hopes up for me to fail again and again. This is for the best, I just need to fuck off and die all ready.
