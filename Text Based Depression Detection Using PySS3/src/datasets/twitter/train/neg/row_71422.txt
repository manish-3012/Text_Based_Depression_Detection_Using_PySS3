LostI constantly wake up feeling like I've had enough, I can't focus on anything I feel like I have nothing left to lie for. My boyfriend hates me cause I'm to much drama. I've lost my friends because I wanted to persue my relationship. There is not one moment in the day where I don't think about killing myself. All me and my boyfriend do is fight sometimes a little bit more physical most of the time not. I love him so much but he deserves better. He deserves to be happy. I'm not making him happy
