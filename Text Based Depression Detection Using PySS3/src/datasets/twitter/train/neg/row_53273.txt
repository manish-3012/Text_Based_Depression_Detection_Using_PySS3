I pretty much have 2 options left, and nobody to talk to.So I've gotten to the point where I've given myself 2 options. I honestly have no idea what to do at this point, and I have nobody I can talk to either, so I'll just post it here. 

My first, and the more likely, option is to just finally finish it, and leave this world. I've long known that I'd most likely end up dying this way, but I never really had the motivation to even get up and do it, because it would make no difference anyway. But lately it's gotten to the point of where I'm just too tired of even living, and with the last of my strength I'll just end it. I know the rules say not to discuss the methods or something like that, so I won't say anything regarding that, but it'll work if I so choose. I've already prepared most things and the last few stuff and goodbyes will be later. 

My other option, that somebody mentioned to me, was going to the hospital, and basically being kept alive against my will. I honestly wouldn't mind going there, if it actually helped, but all I've heard is bad stuff. Thus my stand on not wanting to go there. So what is it really like when you end up in a hospital, forcibly being kept alive? As I said, I don't really mind going there too much, but I don't want to suffer even more now, when I could finally get out. Is there too much of a point? 

Also, I'm an open book, you can ask me pretty much anything, because I don't care about people knowing about me online, only used a throwaway because my main account could be traced to me way too fast and I'd rather not be stopped.
