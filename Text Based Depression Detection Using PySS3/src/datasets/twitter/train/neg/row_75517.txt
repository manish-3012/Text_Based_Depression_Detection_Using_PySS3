I'm over it.I fuck up everything I do or attempt to do, I can't even fucking eat without something going wrong. I am sick of mind splitting migraines and a psychologist telling me that prayer is the key, because if it was I wouldn't be in this situation. 
I keep trying to make things work but no matter how hard I try no one is ever happy with what I do. It's not like I'm not trying to get help, I see a therapist, take my medicine and do all the things that are supposed to make me be ok with myself. I have no friends and my parents are done with me, my family forgot about my birthday and my dad told me to stop calling him. I suck at everything, I'm a dropout and a waste of space. I can't even handle a fucking fast food job, but it's my fault that I'm a failure and no matter how hard I try it's all I'll ever be. I don't have people to rely on and I don't have anyone to express myself to. I'm a fucking loser and everyone I ever cared about already left me. So I'm over it, I want nothing to do with this piece of shit planet.
