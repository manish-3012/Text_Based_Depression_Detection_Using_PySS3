Girlfriend attempted suicide this morningI am posting here because I don't know what to do. I need help. My girlfriend and I have generally been good. We have discussed marriage and a future together. However, two months ago, she cheated on me. We have been rocky since then. Both of us expressed interest in staying in this relationship, but that means working through all of the negative emotions and having some rough days.

This brings us to today. She has recently moved to Washington and me to Colorado (Army). She has been "overwhelmed" (her word) with her work and moving situation. She visited this past weekend for Valentine's Day. Things were generally good (much less fighting than had been, some negative emotions, but all in all a good weekend). Then, when she went to leave yesterday, she told me how she hated her job and absolutely did not want to return (obviously had to since Army). I know she had been depressed recently and had expressed vaguely about suicide. I have expressed my concern and support, prompting her to visit a chaplain. She did but felt uncomfortable taking the counseling further. Then, last night, I asked for some space to digest my negative emotions in a healthy manner. She agreed, knowing it would help us. This morning, I got a text from her telling me about an intimate dream with another man she had last night. I lost my cool and angrily called her. That prompted her to decide not to go to work, go back home, and commit the act, so I told her mom. Her mom was able to call the police, who went to her house and found her alive. Another 20 minutes, they said, and she would have been gone...

I am posting here to ask, what now? How can i support her properly. Traveling is not out of the question. Any and all advice is appreciated.
