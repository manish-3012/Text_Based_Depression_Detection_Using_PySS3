random ranting. wanna diei canâ€™t live like this anymore, but i donâ€™t know how to change it. i miss being happy, i miss not caring about how i looked so much. i miss being able to focus in school and get good grades. i miss not crying myself to sleep all the time. i miss not getting the sudden urge to swallow a bunch of pills. i miss being able to get out of bed in the morning. i miss being able to talk to people and form relationships. i miss being able to eat and not feel guilty. i want to go back, but i know iâ€™ve dug myself into a hole so deep, thereâ€™s no way i can make it back. i turned 18 this week... did absolutely nothing for my birthday. couldnâ€™t even get out of bed and get ready. i i didnâ€™t post it, most of my friends would have forgot. my parents didnâ€™t really seem to care. iâ€™ve put on such a happy and normal persona, but i donâ€™t know how much longer i can take. if this is my last post, i want anyone who read this to know, you only will have yourself in the end,  so live how you want to and how you please. accept yourself. cherish yourself. do it for YOU
