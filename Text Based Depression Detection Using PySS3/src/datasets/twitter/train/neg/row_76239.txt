Fuck all of thisBit of backstory. After a month of being in a new town living in my aunts house( Iâ€™ve realized that sheâ€™s not all there mentally) I finally got a job. One would think thatâ€™s great and it is but my mom decided to buy a place in the same town because Iâ€™m here. She also wanted me to live in the same house as her and she said sheâ€™d give me my own space and basement apartment etc( I knew that was a lie) she has no concept of personal space and just because we are in the same town does not mean we have to be together all day everyday. Then she tells me gotta sell everything why havenâ€™t you sold everything all in not so nice ways. So I decide time to leave her shithole because fuck this. She says what are you going to cry that wonâ€™t solve anything then also are you mad? That wonâ€™t solve anything either. Cool thanks mom Iâ€™m fucking out! I wanted to drive my car into lake simcoe so fucking badly or cut again. 
Yes I fucked myself finically, yes I avoid talking back to my parents but Iâ€™m just so fucking tired of all of this. Sorry for the rant. If I do fucking die just listen to motley CrÃ¼e for me or some guns and roses or Manson 
See you all in hell! Peace and love
