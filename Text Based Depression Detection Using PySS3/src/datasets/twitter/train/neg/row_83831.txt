Honestly, Iâ€™m thinking about doing it right nowI no longer care. I canâ€™t reach for help anymore and I donâ€™t know if I can make it to when I originally planned. I donâ€™t know what else to say. I have my method, suicide note ready &amp; what really is the point of making it easier for others? Theyâ€™ll be fine eventually. How nice it would feel for the pain to just end. To not feel anything.
