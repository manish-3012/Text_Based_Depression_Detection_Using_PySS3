My life has all the right circumstances for suicideI live pointless and unhappy life, i cant attract females so i never had girlfriend, i have no passion, no skills and no money if my parents would throw me out of house i would be homeless or dead very soon. Im useless and spend my time doing nothing productive not because i dont want to work hard but because i dont know what is missing and what to do to improve. I want to die and i think in these circumstances i have right to do this, i just dont want to leave my family and friends miserable after this mine move.
