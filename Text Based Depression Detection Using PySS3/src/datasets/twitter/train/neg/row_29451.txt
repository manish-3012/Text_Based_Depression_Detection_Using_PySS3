I am so tired of living and I'm sure I'll always be aloneIt's been almost two years and I'm still hung up on my ex even though he cheated and lied to me. I don't have anything to live for. My friends don't understand and aren't supportive. I've tried so many medications but nothing works.

My doctor has no idea what will help and ignores me when I tell him how bad I am. I lie and say I don't have a plan, but I do. I don't have the materials, but they wouldn't be hard to get.

I haven't really dated since my ex. I don't believe in sex until after marriage, so I'm not okay with hook-ups or anything like that. My ex pretended he felt the same but he lied, of course. I think he probably proposed to me to get into my pants. I don't have any contact with him and I don't look him up, but I still think about him all the time. I am in therapy, but my therapist just says healing is different for everybody and that u heal at different rates.

I don't think I'll find someone who genuinely cares about me. I don't want to live life alone though. I don't want to give up my morals just to have a boyfriend either. 

I'm tired of being sad and scared all the time. I'm afraid to leave the house. Anti-anxiety pills only work a little. 

I can't work, and I live in a farming area, so there's not even places to meet people except Church and bars. Obviously I already know people from Church, and you can't really chat during Mass. I hardly go anymore anyway. 

I'm not even sure I believe in God anymore. I pray He will understand if I do kill myself, if there even is life after death.

I don't know any reason I should live anymore.
