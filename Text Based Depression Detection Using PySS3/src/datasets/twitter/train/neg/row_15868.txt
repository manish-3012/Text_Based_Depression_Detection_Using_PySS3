Please just help me find a wayIm done im just fucking done. There seems no way to happiness and alcohol is all I have. I feel like one day ill eventually do it. I just lose everyone and all hope. Im only 22 but I feel much older. My boyfriend is laying beside me asleep but here I am wanting to end it. I feel broken inside. I often fantasize about my suicide but I wouldnt want to hurt my family. God dammit if it wasnt for my family. If it wasnt for that guilt Id have done it a few years ago. I hate this fucking world. Please help.
