Had a phone appt w/ psychiatrist, finally admitted to having suicidal thoughts...And no, my parents don't know and I don't them to know. Why? I don't want to scare them, or hurt them emotionally. I feel like if I told them they would be scared and they might think about where they went wrong.  My psychiatrist urged to get counseling on campus, but I am kinda scared to tbh. But I will try to force myself to go asap. Wanted to share this w/ someone aside from parents as aforementioned (Yes, I am over 18 so the dr does not tell them anyways.)
