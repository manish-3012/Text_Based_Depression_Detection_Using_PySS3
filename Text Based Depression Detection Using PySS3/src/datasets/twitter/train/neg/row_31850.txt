Perspective NeededToday I lost my job after a one year battle with an abusive supervisor. The reason given was insubordination. I refused to work on call on the nights that I have my middle school aged daughter. Despite my reasoning, unemployment insurance will be a real uphill battle. My health insurance will end on Friday. I have enough to pay next month's rent but not much else. All of this happened a couple of hours ago and I still haven't told anybody. 

I'm feeling extremely suicidal. I've battled depression for most of my life and today I'm contemplating how to best use the next two days when my daughter will be with her mother, my girlfriend is sick so won't be coming over, and I've got zero accountability and enough time to do just about anything I want to do.

I love my child. I also love my girlfriend and my friends. But I'm a middle aged man with about one month of resources to my name. Even my meds will run out the first week of December when I will no longer have insurance. I'm embarrassed, discouraged, terrified, and at a complete loss as to what steps to take to be able to provide even the most basic needs for myself and my daughter. 

I don't want to leave her without a father, but I also don't want to face the pain and humiliation of what might lie ahead. And I'm tired of failing. 

Perspective and advice on a way forward would be greatly appreciated.
