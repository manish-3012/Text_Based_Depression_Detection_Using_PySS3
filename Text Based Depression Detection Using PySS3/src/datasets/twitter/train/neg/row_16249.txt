I had it all and lost it within a few months.I had my dream woman, 4 beautiful kids, my own successful business, a big house, all the electronics and games I ever wanted as a kid and more...

When my wife and I first started dating I begged her to always be faithful to me. That was the ONE thing I wanted from her. She would look me in my eyes and cry and tell me how much she loved me and that she would never hurt me like that. Every person I ever dated longer than a month cheated on me(4). My ex wife cheated on me regularly.

4 months ago, my wife cheated on me. Iâ€™m so beyond destroyed I can not explain it. Many tell me Iâ€™m being dramatic but this pain is worse than anything Iâ€™ve ever felt and I lost my 19 y/o brother when I was 21 and then my mother 2-3 years later. Those pains pale in comparison for some reason.

She is the most beautiful woman Iâ€™ve ever seen in a weird way. When I used to look at her it was like all I could see was beauty and love. Now I see her deceit and destruction every time I look at her.

We are trying to reconcile and work through this, but then a month ago my house burned down and I lost every material possession I cared about.

I feel worthless after being on top of the world for the first time in my life. The fall being from so high is what makes it hurt so bad I believe.

I canâ€™t sleep with out drinking and even then it only keeps me asleep for about 3-4 hours tops. Iâ€™m awake at 2am almost every night and I have to drink 5-6 more beers to try to sleep another hour or two.

Iâ€™ve never had anxiety in my life but now if Iâ€™m not drinking it feels like an elephant is sitting on my chest and itâ€™s hard to breath. I have constant intrusive thoughts and triggers from the stupidest things. 

I canâ€™t enjoy anything about life anymore.

I pray to just not wake up every night. I do not want to be here anymore. My kids are the only thing that keeps me here and I wonder how long that will be enough of a reason.
