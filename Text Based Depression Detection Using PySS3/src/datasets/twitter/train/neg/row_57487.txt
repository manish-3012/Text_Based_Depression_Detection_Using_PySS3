i love being worthless trash that fails at everything! love it!literally what is the fucking point of ANYTHING anymore? i'm a massive waste of resources and space and money and i'm so sick of it. i don't want to take up space in this world. i don't want to eat or drink or even breathe. i'm so tired and i'm out of energy to go on and every day is a massive struggle. i don't think life is supposed to be this way, and this world would certainly be a brighter place without trash like me. ugh.
