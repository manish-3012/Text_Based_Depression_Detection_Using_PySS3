I donâ€™t get itIâ€™ve lost it all.  My happiness, my identity. Covid stripped me of the bootstraps Iâ€™ve pulled myself up in over the last 10 years and Iâ€™m back as square one.  Whatâ€™s the fucking point? No friends, no goals, no career, nothing but debt.   I canâ€™t get treatment from the doctor who treated me like a liberal drug seeker.  Like bro, Iâ€™m crying in your office. The antidepressants donâ€™t help, I need more. I have no motivation to do anything but sleep, drink and vape (just had to relocate to a state where marijuana is not legal, after living in CA.) so no anxiety medicine. So just doing what America wants! Become an alcoholic!   Am currently quarantined by the state (what a fucked up unorganized mess btw) because within 3 weeks of my new job I was exposed to not one, but TWO covid positive people, who guess what, didnâ€™t wear masks.  I hate working from home, there is no motivation. I was just fine going to the office each day and completing my duties.  Fucking bullshit.  I see no reason to continue. Iâ€™ve written here before, Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll write here again. I push my husband away (the one person who loves me) with my mental illness.  I live somewhere now that is never sunny, is about to be gray for 4 months and I just donâ€™t see the fucking point.  I want to work out, I want to learn to build things but again I canâ€™t even get started.  I can only do the bare minimum, my husband and Iâ€™s laundry, clean the house, and breathe.  Iâ€™m a fucking failure. I didnâ€™t ask to be brought into this world, why canâ€™t I just leave it??!!!!!! I hate America, I hate capitalism, I hate Trump and all he stands for, I hate racial profiling, I hate racism in general, I hate stupid people. I love animals. And bright colors, and sunshine, and the ocean. (Of which now the closest to me is 12 hours) what is the fucking point!?!?!!!!!
