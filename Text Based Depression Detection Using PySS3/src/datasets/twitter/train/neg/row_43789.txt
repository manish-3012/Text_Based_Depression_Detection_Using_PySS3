I triedI'm sorry, I'm done. I don't want to hurt anyone by ending it but I've tried everything, literally everything to get better and nothing worked. It's been way too long, I've fought it as much as I could but I can't do it anymore, I won't survive another year like this. I don't even know why I'm writing this, maybe I just had to tell someone that I really did my best but it wasn't enough. Goodbye everyone, take care of yourselves, I hope you'll find the strength to keep going, find something that will make you happy.
