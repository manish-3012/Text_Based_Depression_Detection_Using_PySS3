Nothing helps. I just can't keep doing this.Every day is the same as the last. Or at least a little worse. I've tried coping but I just can't keep doing it any more. I'm completely spent. I want out of the pain immediately. The only thing that will do that is dying. Between no more hurting and more endless pain, I think the choice is obvious.
