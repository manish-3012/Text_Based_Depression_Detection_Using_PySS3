Feeling guilty for my terrible supportMy SO is at very high risk for suicide right now. I moved a long way from my family and friends to be closer for support. Now I'm feeling like I have screwed up that role horribly because they seem to be ready to go through with it. Feeling alone in supporting them and unable to share it with anyone. I've failed my best friend.
