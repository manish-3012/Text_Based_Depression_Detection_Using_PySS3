I think its timeI have had a long 22 years of lifetime, I think its time to end it. I was an alcoholic for awhile and I relapsed, now my skin feels like it's crawling and my heart is like a racecar. I should call my doctor to get help but I don't want to, I have done it before and it helps but the thing is I drink because I find life pointless so eventually it happens again. Rather than embarrassing myself again by admitting I relapsed again I think I should just end it all. The sweat silence of death seems so enticing.
