How much longer do I have to hold on and keep failing until something good happens?For the past year and a half I've only made bad career decisions, one after the other, and went through a company going bankrupt. I didn't manage to do anything I wanted in my personal life (trips to see family at least) because the work issues killed all my plans.  

I have good years of experience and they don't seem to matter. I've gone through extremely shitty recruiters, some who have put me through miserable interviews because they misinterpreted what the company wanted (say they wanted an accountant and they sent me, an account manager). My self esteem is nonexistent. Nothing I've done is good enough. I can't see how I could change things. I finally found a job below what my experience would say and I dread it going south, like everything so far. I settled for it out of desperation, whatever, it's fine if that was all I could do, I haven't yet started but I have no hope for it. I've stopped having any hope or positive thoughts because every time I'm disappointed. Every damn time. 

Whoever says that your job is not your identity and you have to focus on everything else good in life hasn't had a bad run with jobs and unemployment. I have an SO, friends and a (far away) family, but they don't help when you're a fucking failure who can barely find a job to survive, despite years of experience.

I'm only not killing myself because it would hurt my SO and my parents. I wish I could. I'm so tired. I'm starting to fantasize about how I would do it and how it would work and they're all that's stopping me. But I so want to stop existing.
