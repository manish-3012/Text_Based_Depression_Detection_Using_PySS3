Im so tired.I feel like I'm on the top of a mountain. The thin air makes it so hard to breathe, the winds of the world try and shove me off and if I lose my footing for even a seconds, everything I've built will crumble. I've been working at jobs I hate for over 10 years but I don't qualify for anything better and nobody ever wants to promote me no matter how skilled or amazingly I do my job. I don't get vacations just 50 hour weeks. I have a wife but don't get to see her much and when I do she needs me to help her handle her week of stress. There's no time for me and I'm so tired. I currently work as security and I don't go a day without being mocked or looked down on. I have so many dreams I never chase, so many hopes that have burned. So much chaos and evil in my head and heart. I don't deserve to be alive. My wife would honestly be better without me. I only tie her down and I see how it drains her. I feel like when I get home I should just tell her I love her and end myself. No more worries, no my judgements, no more presumptions, no more pain.
