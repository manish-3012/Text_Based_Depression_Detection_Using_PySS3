Am I even real?I feel so numb to everything. Every positive emotion I have goes flat in a matter of minutes and every negative emotion lingers for the rest of the day. I feel like Iâ€™m never really happy, and if I am, itâ€™s for such a short amount of time that it feels as if it never happened. I feel like my emotions are broken. Maybe itâ€™s the medication Iâ€™m on, idk. 

I think my boyfriend and I are drifting apart. Iâ€™m just not interesting anymore and I have too many problems. Iâ€™m too much to deal with and he even admitted it. I hurt so badly all of the time and I try so hard to manage on my own but I guess I rely on him a lot. I donâ€™t want to rely on anyone anymore. I just donâ€™t want to exist.

I donâ€™t even want to violently hurt myself, I just want to passively fade away. Stop eating and drinking and just shrivel up and die. 

I donâ€™t have anything in my life going right and it hurts so badly. Everything always hurts. I donâ€™t see a way out of this, for once. I donâ€™t think there is one. Iâ€™m always going to end up feeling numb again. I always do, through every relationship, every job, every school, every job, every therapist, every single change. Iâ€™m just always going to be numb.
