I feel fine......but that doesn't mean I need to be here. I have fucked up every part of my life. I can keep living with the pain, the agitation, the paranoia, the regret, shame and disgust, but what I can't live with is knowing I am a burden on everyone, family, friends, acquaintances, co workers, even random people. It's selfish to keep on hurting people by being alive. I have tried to get better, but it is really a lost cause. I plan on going out next week, I already made the plans. I don't want you to tell me not to do it. I am giving it a week so I can make the appropriate arrangements. What can I do?
