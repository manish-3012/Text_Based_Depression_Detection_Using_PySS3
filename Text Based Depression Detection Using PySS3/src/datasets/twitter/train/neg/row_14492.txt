Lets face it, its overHello, my name is DÃ¡niel , and i had enough.

Since 4th grade i struggle with depression, anxiety, all that shit, i want to explain my life to you guys, it will may be a long read.

I borned in 1997 at Budapest, Hungary, my childhood was normal, untill i was in 4th grade, from 4th grade my grades were horrible, and i quit school at 16..now if you quit school at that age here, you're already dead.

Let me tell you more about my life.

5th grade: it was the beginning, it started with random throwups, then had problems at other parts of my body, what i cant even write down..its too embarassing..Also my teachers were assholes to me, except my history and english teacher, and a few others, im not blaming them, but it was clear that they hated me.
6th grade:
The worst..i started to feel depressed, my family didnt supported me, teachers and classmates was both pain in the ass, my classmates were hated me, and its not just the regular hate, they didnt wanted me between them, they teased me cuz i was fat and awkward, i always just wanted to get home, every day i woke up i woke up with the feeling of emptyness, anger, hate, and sadness.
7th grade: well, the same shit, going deeper and deeper.
8th grade: for me school was over, but i wasnt able to be happy or sad..i was empty..completely. Now im here at the age of 17 and thinking about ending my shitty life. There was one thing what made me happy..and it was gaming. I met so many great people over the internet, and i finaly found somebody who was the same as me, we liked the same things, everything, except i dont want to do things that he wants to do.But now its seems to fade away too, my friends are barely talking to me, and since my english suck dick i cant play with foreigners.

So lets see where i am right now

- Left school at 16, means there will be no jobs for me.
- I cant do anything right
-im stupid
-im lazy
-Im bad at everything
-Im depressed
- i still dont have a girlfriend
-im a pussy to do anything for get better

I know it, you know it, it IS over
