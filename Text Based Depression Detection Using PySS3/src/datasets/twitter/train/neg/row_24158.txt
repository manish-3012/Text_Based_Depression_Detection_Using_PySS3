So a couple questions for the wide world of people, would love feedbackHey there, thanks for dropping by. Apologies this is a long one. I'm interested to see how other people feel on these things because hey, the more you know etc etc etc.

1- In the UK (no idea if this is the same for the rest of the world) there is a samaritans add saying it's okay to not feel okay. What do you think about this statement? I'm not the healthiest of minds but feel that if it was okay to not be okay why have the add (always bugged me but would really like to hear others opinions)

2- I'm a music lover at heart and the stereo typically "downer" portrayed in media seems to usually be a metal listener or such (not always, just most of the time from what I've seen) What do you think of that? I would arfue no personal as a metal fan but also of edm, pop, classical

3- This one is more personalised to me but for those who have felt about self harm and such, have you ever had the urge to bite your wrists to the point of ripping veins out instead of cutting?

4- lets end on a lighter note, sod it we deserve to be happy, each and every one of us. Whats something that makes you smile, giggle like an idiot, makes your eyes tear with joys. I want it all

Sorry for the long post. For those who don't answer or don't even click i hope your even, morning or afternoon brings you smiles, laughter and joy. We all deserve it and need it, hugs to the lot of you and a beer glass raised
