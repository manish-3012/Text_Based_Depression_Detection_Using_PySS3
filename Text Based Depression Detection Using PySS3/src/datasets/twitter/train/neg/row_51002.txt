What happened after my suicide attemptSo. I just got back from a psychiatric ward a few hours ago and everything's hitting me now so I thought I'd post about it. Just a bit of background this is my experience after attempting suicide with opioids.  I am a 20yr old female.

I posted a few days ago that I was waiting for pills to kick in. Well about an hour after that post I texted my friend. I'm conflicted now as to whether I should have done this because if I hadn't I would surely be dead now. She came over a little bit after I texted her and she took me to the hospital. My mom came along with us. I was put into a wheelchair and was rolled into a private room where they asked me questions and hooked me up to a monitor. They gave me fluids and monitored my acetaminophen levels to make sure they wouldn't reach dangerous levels due to the amount of hydrocodone I took.

This whole process took a few hours. After this I said bye to my mom (she was the only person allowed in my room) and they took me back to their behavioral unit. I was told at this point that sometime while I was there I would be evaluated by a psychiatrist. However, the next day around lunchtime I was told to put on scrub pants (the thin, paper kind) and two cops put me in handcuffs and in to the back of a sheriff's van. Mind you, at this point the only information I was given was that I was being transported, I had no idea where I was going. I rode in the sheriff's van for three hours until I arrived at the psych ward I was admitted to. My vitals and blood were taken and I was strip searched.

They, unbeknownst to me, had placed me in the drug unit instead of the depression/anxiety unit. So I was naturally scared and upset and just wanted to  go home. I spent most of the day in my room. There was a day room that allowed television time and the only other activities were group therapy (which main focus was drugs) and yoga. Needless to say, I uselessly spent three days in a foreign place right after I tried to kill myself alone and afraid with no individualized therapy or anything.

Thankfully, I was released today. Looking back on everything, I'm still conflicted as to whether or not I wish the pills would have killed me but I can at least say I'm very glad that I'm home and comfortable.
