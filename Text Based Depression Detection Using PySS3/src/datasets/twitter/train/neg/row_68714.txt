Don't know how longer I can bear thisThrowaway for obvious reasons.

 For the past two years I've been trying to find something to cheer me up, but everything is just so temporary. Money really can't buy you happiness. I try to give others what I can't have.  When I look at my peers how they are enjoying their lives, relationships, it just makes me feel so empty.

This year i will try to cross the last few thing of my bucket list, and if nothing catches my interest, who knows, this might be my last year.
