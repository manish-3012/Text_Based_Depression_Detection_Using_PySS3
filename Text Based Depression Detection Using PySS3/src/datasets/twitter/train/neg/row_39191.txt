Really generic suicidal thoughtsI feel awful for wasting anyone's time. There are so any posts here. Tons of people have been through worse things than I have, and they're okay. Here I am, giving up. I've barely tried to get better, but things have been bad for so many years, and they just seem to get worse. I am just tired. I want to be done. I don't want to hurt myself. I just want to stop existing. Someone recently told me that I'm just lazy, that I never do anything right. They're right. I don't care about anything little, and thinking big exhausts me. I only worry about leaving a friend who seesaws suicidal himself. I know I annoy people worrying about them, but I just don't want anyone else to hurt or be sad. They can have good lives. I just want to be done.
