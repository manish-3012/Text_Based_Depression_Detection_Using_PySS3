I'm sorryI keep having arguments and issues with the people I love. I try to make them see my point of view, but I keep getting told my point isn't correct. That I'm in the wrong. I've realized that every negative thing has one common denominator. Me. 

I'm in a very unique... Rare... Situation. I have a husband. We have a bf. Yes I'm a man too.  I've put everything I can into loving both. I thought this would be the same to how we all feel. But I'm just being walked on over and over. I've bent over backwards for my husband of 17 years. I've done every I can to please our bf. I've changed my views. I've adapted to new situations and new ways of thinking to be as accepting as possible. But it I have an issue or if I have feelings that aren't in line with theirs, I'm the unreasonable one. I'm dramatic. I'm an asshole. 

I just can't do it anymore. Nobody for the last 2 decades it seems has ever actually considered me. I'm irrelevant. I'm a paycheck.  I'm expected to bow to everyone else's point of view. If I raise my own point of view, it's wrong.

I'm sorry. I'm on mobile and fat fingering everything. I'm sorry if it isn't coherent. 

I don't think I'm on here because I want anything. I just want to say something, just this one time, and not be told it's my fault. But I, as usual, don't want to burden anyone. I just don't want to be here anymore. I just don't want to be. 

Hey, I made it to 40. That's pretty good right? 

Thanks for letting me rant. A little piece of me left behind. Wish it could have been a better piece. But what can ya do?
