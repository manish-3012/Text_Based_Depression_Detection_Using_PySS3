Wish I'd just do itFor every day that passes, my wish to die gets more intense. If I had a magic insta kill pill on me now, I'm not sure I'd say no.

I don't have the guts to do it. I'm too afraid of regret if I do anything drastic. That's why I constantly wish I'll die suddenly and unexpected, out of my control. I'd be so contempt with that. Every time I go to sleep I hope I don't wake up. Passing away while dreaming is a dream.

Life would be so great if I could make all my problems go away, but, as everyone knows, life is not that simple. So I want to die. I don't want to face my problems. 

My life is going nowhere. I'm a bad person. Every waking moment when I'm not distracting myself with Reddit or video games, I am wishing I was dead. I hate myself so much. I wish I never existed. I don't want to live my life anymore because it's fucking terrible.

I'm sorry, family. I don't know how much longer I'll keep putting this off, but eventually I hope I'll do it. When I absolutely have had enough and I can't distract myself any longer. I want to do it so bad.
