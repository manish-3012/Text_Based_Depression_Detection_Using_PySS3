I'm a terrible person. The world would be better off without me.I just got a speeding ticket for going 75 in a 45. This isn't my first ticket either, meaning I'm going to have my traffic history follow me for the rest of my life. So why continue to live? Also, it was in my mom's car. Meaning that I'm a terrible son. As I know it would hurt my mom if I did die, in the long run, my death would be better off for her. Seeing she wouldn't have to worry about me killing someone in a car accident or getting her car totaled. 

Speaking of which. I love driving fast. I'm a terrible person for being addicted to actions that could put others lives at risk. But when the road is empty, I just love flying down large roads. It makes me feel free and gets me feeling happy. I'm usually depressed but speeding makes me happy for some reason. So wouldn't the world be better with me dead? I need a reason to live, but keep drawing blanks.
