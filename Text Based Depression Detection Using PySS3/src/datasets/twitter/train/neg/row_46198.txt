Parents tell me to not compare myself to othersBut then compare me to people that have less than me and say â€œyou have so much to be grateful for!â€  Pretty ironic.

This is true, but I have an overwhelming amount of things to be stressed about, worried about, and regretful about.  

Itâ€™s not about what I have now, itâ€™s about the piece of shit I was to get myself into this position.

Im done being resilient. Iâ€™m just done with everything.
