I just want to dieI donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be happy. Iâ€™m so pissed off and angry all the time. I feel like I canâ€™t escape my own mind. I just want this pain to end. I want to die and be forgotten. I hate myself. Nothing brings me joy. I try to get more hours at work because thatâ€™s the only thing that keeps me from thinking about anything else. Iâ€™m sorry for ranting but I donâ€™t know where to turn. Iâ€™m not in crisis where Iâ€™m for sure going to kill myself, but I just canâ€™t stop thinking about it. I just want the pain to end
