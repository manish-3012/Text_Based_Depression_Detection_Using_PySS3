There's no point, literally.Life is the most pointless thing for me. I work 14 hours a day, 7 days a week and I'm only 18 years old. I have no mom, dad, or family to yalk or fall back on. The city I'm in is full of people who only care for themselves leaving me with no friends. I have no passions and whenever I'd like to develop some interest.... I get home from working 14 hours and just pass out from exhaustion. And all this is taught me is life is fucking pointless. I get to work my whole life to get to work. I have no family to even share this life with and don't want to bring children in this disgusting world of us vs them. This life is nothing but stress after stress, payment after payment. No one loves me. Everyone is gone and every one else is too busy to want to care about me. I don't even care about me. I never eat and am constantly high because all i do is work so, fuck it might as well get high any chance i can get. Whats shitter is I'm to scared of pain to do anything, so i just cry and beg to die.
