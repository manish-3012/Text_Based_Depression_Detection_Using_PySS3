fun stuffThis is my last message. To my mom, I know you did everything you could, and I'm not going to say it wasn't enough, but rather too much. To my dad, thank you for at least trying to help. To my brother, I'm sorry that I turned out this way. Don't do what I did. And to myself: You're a dumb piece of shit. You were told you were never going to be anything, and that's how you ended up. You didn't take their advice, and dug yourself into a hole. Now, you can't handle the guilt so you're going to end it all. Don't regret it, you disappointment.
