I wish I had committed suicide in the moment. I wish it was easier. I donâ€™t want to live.Another monumental fight in the house and this time it was my brother and mother against me and they both hit me so much. At that moment I had so much pain and sadness and rage that doing the act seemed like nothing. But now itâ€™s been a few hours because my dad wouldnâ€™t leave me alone and now I donâ€™t have that feeling in me so much. But I so donâ€™t want to live either. I just wish committing suicide was easier.
