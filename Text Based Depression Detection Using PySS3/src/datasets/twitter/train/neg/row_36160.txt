Looking for my way outA while ago when I was first dealing with depression I always wondered how it would actually feel to be suicidal. I thought that there would be this dramatic change in me and then I would just try to kill myself in any way. But now I realize that itâ€™s not like that.

You just decide that enough is enough and then start planning. At least thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve done. Iâ€™m still researching but I think Iâ€™m going one of two routes.

Iâ€™m either going to mix in a whole container of rubbing alcohol with orange juice or soda.
Or Iâ€™m going to stop eating and die a slower death. This will take the course of months most likely maybe even a year. I wonâ€™t stop eating completely but just enough to become skin and bones and then eventually start taking strong medicine until my heart canâ€™t take anymore and it just stops beating. So I could die if a heart attack in this scenario. I think this is the one I prefer too. This allows for all the people in my life to watch me waste away and see just how much they failed me. And this is the less painful way to go out. Either way Iâ€™ll most likely be dead next year and I can say that there are no words to explain how disappointed I am that his is how my life turned out.
