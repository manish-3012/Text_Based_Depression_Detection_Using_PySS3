If You Love Me, Let Me Go.I see a lot of people say "Oh what about the people who love you? They'll be devastated!"

I guess they will be. They'll get over it. And if they don't, I'll be dead anyway. What difference would it make to me? 

But moving past the edgy shit, I was watching some TV and someone said "If you love me, let me go." and despite hearing this cliche hundreds of times, I only just thought about it like this. My life is full of suffering and existential dread. The mere act of waking up in the morning is too much for me to cope with sometimes. I've been to my doctor, I've tried everything under the sun, the only thing that works is getting high and even that is short-lived. 

So why can't the people who love me accept that life just isn't for me? I'm quite open about my mental health and anyone who asks me about it gets exactly what I feel, unfiltered. Even my parents. They know I self harm, they know I abuse drugs to try and get some kind of gratification out of life, and they know that I want to kill myself and probably will one day. But they still preach the same shit as everyone else. Oh, people love you. You couldn't do that.

Basically, what I'm being told to do is to continue suffering because people care about me. If they really cared about me, they'd understand that this is my only solution. I know this is dumbing it down to an incredible level and that people can't just "get over it" but I want to know if anyone else has thought about it this way. If life is truly unbearable for someone, why shouldn't they be allowed to end it? It's their life they're suffering through.

I've got a bucket list. And when everything on that list is done, I'm done.
