I donâ€™t know if I should continue going to school.Iâ€™m only going for a degree so that I could get a good job but I have no idea what that would even be because even the best job still sounds like a waste of a life to me. In the meantime school is still making me feel suicidal and that makes me think I should stop but at the same time I do think that I need a certain amount of money to be happy because living in the U.S. is way more difficult and expensive than it should be.
