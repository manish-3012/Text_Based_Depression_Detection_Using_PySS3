It's On.First thing tomorrow, I will ask a local gangster at my local high school to lend me a firearm. I will fabricate a lie that I will pay him sometime next week but I won't be around for that to happen. I will sneak the firearm back to my parent's house and write a series of notes in my notebook describing why I did what I did. I will even include descriptive pictures expressing my wish for death. Once my mom leaves for work, and my dad leaves to go to his regular Yoga workouts, I will aim the firearm inside my mouth. 

I chose the mouth because if I tried to go for the Cerebrum then I would most likely miss due to the angle and deflection of the bullet. There's a chance that the bullet can deflect off of my cranium and instead put me in a very painful and dying position. Also, if I miss my Cerebrum by a centimeter then I mess up the whole suicide and I can be found which will result in me being hospitalized and turning into a vegetable.

If I shoot myself in the mouth then the angle is more precise and I would damage more arteries if it were to penetrate through my Esophagus. The gunshot severity and speed can possibly rip through my brain stem which would stop all functions within my body. Death would be nearly instantaneous. 

I show no remorse or sympathy for doing this. I don't care if other people get sad (whoever those individuals are). I am doing this for my own benefit. Ultimately, this is how life goes for us unfortunate people and that's how it has to go. Also, this cannot be prevented, it will be finished. After years of Clinical Depression, Seasonal Affective Disorder, Hypersomnia, Insomina, self doubts, personal negative incidences, and low excess of food consumption; I'm happy to say it's all over. 

Finally.
