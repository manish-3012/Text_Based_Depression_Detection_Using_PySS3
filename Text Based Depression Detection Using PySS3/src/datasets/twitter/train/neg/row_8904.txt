PainI just want my pain to stop. Iâ€™m sick and tired of being so fucking useless. Iâ€™m gay and worthless. I hate being a faggot and I hate being a black one at that. Why was I cursed at birth. No one would ever accept. My family is ultra religious and hates my existence. I would never come out to them. I was raised to hate myself and Iâ€™ll never stop. I longed for the days of being normal but now, Iâ€™m just too tired of that prayer bullshit. My type is suppose to be in Hell so whatâ€™s the point of waiting for it? i hate my body and I hate my desires. I want to be happy but I donâ€™t deserve to be. I am miserable and need something or someone in my life to want me. I am useless to the advancement of the world and my race is inferior. Goodbye cruel and fucked up world.
