I want to got to sleep and never wake up. I want to die but Iâ€˜m afraid my mind lied.Hey, if youâ€˜re gonna read this, thank you. I appreciate it. 
I cut myself yesterday night. A lot, and I never had such an intense feeling of wanting to just cut as deep as I can, so I can go to sleep forever. It felt like I could finally escape in that moment. 
I am actually not suicidal, because Iâ€˜m too afraid of death and still have things that I think are worth living, so thatâ€˜s that. I havenâ€˜t been to a therapist yet, regarding my mental health. 
I feel like my own mind is lying to me. (Not sure if that makes any sense) Thatâ€˜s why I want to get better. I want to see how it is to be happy again instead of living like this. I know life can be better and I can be happy again. I just donâ€˜t know how, yet.
