Tired of livingI have a method and have tried it several times.  Finally got it down.  Nearly killed myself last time, but suddenly shot up from bed and pulled off the exit mask, realizing I was about to pass out from the nitrogen gas.  Head was spinning from lack of oxygen.  Felt like suddenly "popping back" into consciousness from some kind of strong drug trip.  So, I know it will work if I put a little more effort into it.
Just tired of all this shit.  Finding out more and more terrible shit about the world, making it really not worth it to live in.  On top of all the bullshit I've gone through in my own life.
