It gets to a point where you know some people care about you deeply, but it just doesnâ€™t make a difference anymore.. I turned 19 yesterday, and my mood is at what often feels like an all time low. Iâ€™m relapsing a lot more, Iâ€™m jobless and too anxious to do anything else, Iâ€™m planning to kill myself before September, and itâ€™s only getting worse.

Iâ€™ve stayed alive this long mostly because of my only friend. She means more than anything else to me and I love her so much, but her support and friendship just doesnâ€™t help like it used to. I feel awful for saying that because Iâ€™ve feared that for a long time, that eventually Iâ€™d get worse and worse and she couldnâ€™t help me. It makes me feel like such a shitty best friend.. After all, sheâ€™s stayed alive for me, I owe it to her to keep trying so we can take on this pain together. But I canâ€™t deny that nothingâ€™s stopping this decline. That shit kills me.. 

Of course I want to live for her, sheâ€™s the best thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me. Suicide just feels inevitable, unstoppable, itâ€™s been like that for almost 4 years now. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can take all the stress and sadness. I guess this means Iâ€™m totally fucked, right??
