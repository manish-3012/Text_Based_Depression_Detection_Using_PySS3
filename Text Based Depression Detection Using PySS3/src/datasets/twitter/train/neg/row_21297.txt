I'll kill myself soon. I hope you won't follow my path.I am a lesbian, I have health and mental health issues and I'm so suicidal. I know that my problem can't be solved because they are either incurable or far too severe. I wish it wasn't that way but it is and I think I'll just risk going to hell for eternity because I don't want to live for another 50 years. I'm 18.
