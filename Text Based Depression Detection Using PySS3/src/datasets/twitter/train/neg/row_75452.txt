Why am I hereWhy is everything falling apart right now. I am fucking hitting rock bottom at this very moment. I canâ€™t breath. I canâ€™t think. I thought I was doing so well. I am so alone and scared. What is happening. Everything seems to be falling apart. And all in one instance. Is it me? Or is it just in my head? Or am I really just failing at everything. Am I giving up self conciously?! And i sabotaging myself without even knowing it??? Why am I still here? What is the point of me being alive. I canâ€™t do anything right. My family hates me and have 0 friends. Some people I generally care about only want to sleep with me.  I am worthless. Iâ€™ve been crying for an hour now. I am pathetic. I donâ€™t want to exist anymore. Iâ€™m too scared to kill myself though. Im too pussy and Im scared of what comes afterwards. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I try and better myself but it always seem like a step forward and 3 fucking steps back. No one is proud of me. No one wants to be around me. Sorry Iâ€™m having a panic attack in my car at 1 am and I sound stupid and crazy. Iâ€™m sorry
