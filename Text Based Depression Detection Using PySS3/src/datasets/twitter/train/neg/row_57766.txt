Constant thoughts of suicide, all day every day.I'm 30 years old, and not sure why I'm posting here. I guess for some help. I've had depression for a long time, as long as I remember, and recently have been getting much worse. I think about suicide all the time, from the time I wake up until I sleep. Earlier this year I took myself to the hospital because the urge to do it was so strong. I feel as though it's now inevitable.
Some pretty ugly stuff happened in my childhood and it's messed up my whole life. I find it almost impossible to get close to anyone, so I'm constantly alone. I've been with a couple girls, but not many. What's more, when I was about 20 I suddenly got something called PDOD, which means when I cum I don't feel anything. It isn't treatable, so I'm stuck with it for life. It's incredibly frustrating. I feel always like there's something wrong with me, that I'm worthless and a failure, or that I'm disgusting somehow. I hate my personality. The thought of growing old feeling like this terrifies me. I find it difficult to believe that things can improve now. Every day is torture.
Two nights ago I made a noose with my robe girdle and tested it round my neck using the rail in my closet. Passing out was quite painless. I was holding the other end with my hand, so I didn't actually hang myself. But I can't stand living like this, and know that if it's that easy, when I feel really bad I will be considering doing it properly.
I don't know what else to say.
