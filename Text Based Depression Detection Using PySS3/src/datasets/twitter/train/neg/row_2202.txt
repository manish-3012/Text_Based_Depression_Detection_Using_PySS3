Why go on?Fat as fuck, 2 real friends, alcoholic, anxiety pills render my dick useless, shitty job, haven't had a gf in over 5 years. How would a lady even like me? Do you know how depressing it is to see a gorgeous woman and know that if by some miracle she wanted me right then and there that I couldn't do anything???? Just a shitty little medicated noodle. Of course I only have the courage to acknowledge these thoughts when ik hammered so I dont even know how to confront myself properly. Fuck this . Life sucks
