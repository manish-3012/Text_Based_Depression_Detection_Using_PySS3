I think about suicide every dayI just feel so numb, and can't feel happy, for past 1.5 years I have been depressed, I always feel like I simply suffer more than anyone else that I can see, I have been bullied HEAVILY and victim blamed in my childhood because it was "my fault for getting bullied every time" 

I feel like I am wasting this summer no matter what I do and I also worry a lot about where me and my family are going when this summer ends, last summer was bad but nowhere near as bad as now
