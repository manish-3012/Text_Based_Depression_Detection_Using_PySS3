Is it possible to overcome the serious feeling of unremitting hopelessness?It's only been getting worse. Everyday I just feel like more and more of a failure. I know I have friends and family that cares about me. But it's starting to become hard to justify my existence even when I think about them. I don't even know what I'm really doing posting here. I guess I'm just curious to see what people have to say. Just seems like nothing ever goes right for me. I don't know if anybody reads this I'm sorry if you feel like you wasted your time.
