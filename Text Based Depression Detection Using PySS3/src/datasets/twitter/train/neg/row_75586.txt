Every time I.....Every time I drive, I want to drive off a cliff, crash into a barrier at high speed, just crash into something without physically harming anyone else.

Every time I'm in the kitchen, I want want to stab myself, I want to drink bleach.

Every time I'm out shopping, I want to buy a plastic bag and gas, I want to buy a strong sturdy rope. 

Every time I think about all the terrible things I've done in the past, the people I've hurt, I want to end it.
