The end of my fightI'm going to say it simple, I really don't want to live anymore, I know I'm going to be criticized by many, but after trying everything to heal myself, I finally got tired, so at least I can say that I gave myself the opportunity to live, but  I'm tired, I can't anymore, I know that for many this is nonsense and they won't understand it.  Anyway, I would like to know if someone has some simple method to commit suicide, I study medicine or well I studied and I remember a class where the teacher gave us the necessary amounts of each pill to kill you, someone knows for sure how many pills I would have to take of paracetamol  for you to kill me, I wait for serious responses, thank you.  I mention it here because I feel that it is the most serious community there is.
