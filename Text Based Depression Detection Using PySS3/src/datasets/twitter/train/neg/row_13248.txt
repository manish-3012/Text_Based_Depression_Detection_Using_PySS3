If I don't kms im going to be locked upMy ex said she's going to call the police to take me to the mental hospital since I've been talking about killing myself. I think being locked up is worse than death. She said she's going to call either tonight or in the morning. I'm planning on running away from home tonight to go kill myself or hide.

Even worse today is my birthday and my family is taking me today go eat in an hour.
I've always thought about suicide and ive always felt like I don't belong and I'm going nowhere in life.

Recently I just lost my job, I'm not in school, I have over 5k in credit card debt. I sacrificed a lot to fight for this girl and prove her that ihnm worth it. She is the most beautiful perfect perfect girl ever. She's an angel. She broke up with me and i've been chasing her for months. Even though we aren't together we still hang out and had sex andd had fun togethrr. Until now for the last month that stuff kind of stopped. She said she still loves me and cares for me but only as a friend.

I recently took her on one trip to cali so we could have fun and I planned it for a month but she's dating another guy for only 2 days and she wouldn't kiss me or do anything with me and I had a terrible time.

I cried for 5 hours driving home while she was asleep in the back seat. She didn't even say anything to me when in dropped her off at home. She had a great time but I didnt. I just want to die. Maybe I will wake up and she will love me a be laying next to me in the next life.
