Is work/career anxiety/pressures a cause of your suicidal?for me, this is the major cause.  I could never cope with having to get a job it causes me crazy amounts of stress.  My perfect existence would be sitting in my room gaming, talking to people online, and smoking pot for the rest of my life.  I know its not normal but thats me.
