What to i do?So my life hasnt been great. A mother who tried to murder me, a father who drank and smoked himself to death, a twin that used me for everything. I was raped as a child, bullied and abused. I grew up very angry and very strong and i put a lot of people in hospital and i tried worse.

I became a machine and then i met people that put me back, made me whole again. I met a women i loved, but her mother died and she changed massivly. I tried to help but she kept knocking me down and down and down and now im not sure wether to kill myself. Because my anger is so high right now i couldnt face going back to the way i was.

Today she wanted to call the police, over whatsapp i asked her for my belongings i know for a fact she has, she kept denying it and her proof was only videos of her throwing things around. I didnt threaten her i was only nice and told her how much it hurt me.

The one thing that triggers me more then anything is being called a liar, im more then sure she has it and even have proof. I dont lie and shes done this to me with small things like keys and wallet before and ive never ever been wrong. But all i can think about now is to just kill myself or go there and deal with problem with things no one wants to see. I am scary when im angry, and there is a good reason and i dont want to be that guy anymore.
