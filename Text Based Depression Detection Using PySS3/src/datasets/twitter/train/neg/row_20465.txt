Just a few more days dude, just wait a few more days...I keep fucking telling myself to wait a few days before but I always find myself being a bitch and never doing it. But I think this time, I am pretty serious. I give myself 2 days, and unless everything in my life changes, I'm gone. Game over.

A shitty part about the world. Nobody cares about how you feel in the end. They may say they care, but really all someone cares about is themselves. It's nobody's fault but it is the way humans are and nothing can change that. No matter, how much I try to help others it doesn't get reciprocated. The one time I needed someone, nobody was there. I can't believe this is the world we live in.

Two days.
