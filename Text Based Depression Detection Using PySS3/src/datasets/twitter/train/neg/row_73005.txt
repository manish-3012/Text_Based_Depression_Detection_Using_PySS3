Why do i have to be autisticI can't stop defining myself. That's all I can do. Everyone around me takes one good look at me and they know I have autism. They won't give me a chance. They're nice to me because they're afraid to see through me. I'm not rainman, and I'm not some hidden sociopath waiting for mass destruction. I just want to be treated equally, and I've tried my damned best, but it only gets worse. I lose chances to make friends, my self esteem drops, and every day I keep thinking all the possible ways I'm going to die. Alone. A virgin. Let's face it. Society expects nothing from me. I'm like Chris Chan to everyone I meet. It doesn't matter if I've graduated high school and im doing well in community college. I just want it all to end. It's so hard to get up in the mornings knowing that I'm not worthy of love, money, or even a healthy, happy life. No sane girl would want to date of love me. I might be skinny and handsome to some on the outside, but on the inside, I'm suffering. I'm misreble. I almost killed myself in high school because I couldn't take harder courses and everyone was making fun of me thinking I was going to be a failure because my disability gets in the way of learning. My life is over. I'm not going to go to community college, be a virgin and work at a McDonald's, especially after the hell I've been through enough in my life. I don't even know how I lived through so much, taking care of a disabled father, doing homework without anyone's help, and yet, here I am. Still breathing. Alive. I think will power keeps me alive. I'm done. I just can't do it. I just want it all done and over with
