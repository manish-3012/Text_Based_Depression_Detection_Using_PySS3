I'm a spectacular loser and see no hope for a better future.37 years old, never accomplished anything in my life. Suffer from anxiety and depression daily. I work a dead-end job I hate, have minimal schooling past high school. No friends, no girlfriend. Every day I feel like I fall further into an abyss I can't see a way out of. I want to change and I need to change but can't seem to find the steps. I feel too old and worthless to make any real effort at change. Suicide seems like the easiest way out of this pain. I can't believe how quickly life passed and how pathetic I am. Thanks for reading, drinking heavily tonight, had to rant.
