This year keeps getting worstThis has been the worst year of my life. I just lost my job. I was let go because our company hasn't had much work lately due to losing accounts and customers. I've been looking for a different job since April (it's now November) because I was getting tired of working their feeling under appreciated and having to see my ex there (I avoided her as much as I could). A few months ago an ex of mine aborted my child so they could be with their ex again and I paid for it because she told me we could do it the right way and in the future when we were ready. I begged for some time apart but she constantly made me feel bad and selfish for needing some space (this was when she told me she wanted to be with him but he wasn't sure). I eventually tried to recontact her and once he took her back she turned into the worst person I've ever met. She started to belittle me and call me all sorts of names. The one time I needed someone the most she laughed at me when I asked her to talk because I had no one else to talk to while my close relative had a heart attack, a friend of mine died and a mountain of other family stuff was going on. I tried to kill myself that night but was unsuccessful and I didn't talk to her for over a month. When I did she played victim and said that I was a terrible person for being upset after she laughed at me and called me a child. I wish I was successful that night but I just fuck up everything and I don't know how much longer I can put up with all of this
