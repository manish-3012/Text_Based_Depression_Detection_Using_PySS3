I have ocd and this one thought is so small but literally pushing me to think about suicide constantly.with OCD i get thoughts just like everyone else but then I latch on to one and can't stop believing it. It's so upsetting that I can barely function. This thought is about my acne. I hate it when I get one zit and it's a whitehead. Idk why I just hate it so much. I also hate it when I get zits but it's not evenly matched with another one. I just hate acne so much. I argue with this thought and it sends me into panic attacks that last 2 to 3 hours. Or sometimes even more. It's not just the thought about zits. It's also a million other ocd thoughts that send me into a panic.

I told my little brother that I wouldn't kill myself from now until 25 years old, but after that I don't know. Currently im 19. 

I am going to pray to God and try to strike a deal. I will tell him that if I read scriptures everyday from now until 25 that He will end my life if it is still unbearable at that point. If it's not then I will probably be ok to keep going.

I don't know if God makes these kind of deals but I don't care anymore. I'm just going to pretend that he will agree to the deal.

I really want to hear your thoughts about this.
