Yâ€™all Iâ€™m not okayOver a month ago a friend in my friend group committed suicide. Itâ€™s hit everyone hard. But Iâ€™m on the outside. Iâ€™m very close to people that were close to him but he and I only had a handful of interactions. Interactions that are important to me and that Iâ€™m grateful to have had but in a strange way I donâ€™t feel valid to grieve for him. Yet his departure still hurts immensely. 

This however is not the first suicide to rock my social circle. 

Itâ€™s hit hard every times but itâ€™s hit different every time. It has been so far removed that the empathy is there but the pain isnâ€™t. Itâ€™s hit so close that Iâ€™ve cried for months and felt pain that I was sure I would never recover from. 

Iâ€™ve seen and experienced suicide first hand. I see how it wrecks and rips and breaks friends and families and lovers. 

So here I am. 

I can not possibly inflict the pain of suicide onto the people who know me and have befriended me on the crazy ride we call life. I love them and care for them too much to do that to them. 

But it is painful to live. It is painful to feel my heart break and to feel so fucked up and broken and worthless. 

Yâ€™all Iâ€™m not okay.
