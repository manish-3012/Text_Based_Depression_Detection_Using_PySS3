I feel like committing suicide, but I have so many big plans for my life..Title is self explanatory -
   
  I feel like ending it all. I quit my job to focus on my education, but iâ€™ve been so tired lately. It seems like I canâ€™t do anything now. I have a hard time hanging out with my friends and my girlfriend, doing my online classes, or really doing anything. I havenâ€™t been able to think straight because of it. Which is what honestly prevents me from focusing on my education. I know if I really focus and work hard I can become the next Elon Musk. I just.. feel it in my gut. Iâ€™ve always thrived and been really interested in S.T.E.M. since childhood. I have a really solid plan to get there too. To become the next Elon Musk.

I feel like killing myself though, thereâ€™s a shotgun in the other room. That Iâ€™ve even picked up twice, sitting on my desk, fantasizing about blowing my brains and spraying the wall with my blood. But every time I do actually pick it up I get scared. And what about my family and friends? I really donâ€™t want to hurt them. Would they be shocked? That the friend they thought would never even think about committing suicide, actually decides to blow his brains out. I wish I could just die in bed.

Please, I could really use some encouragement

Sorry if this post isnâ€™t perfect grammatically. Iâ€™m sobbing while writing this and Iâ€™m in lot of pain emotionally right now to even correct it.

Thanks
