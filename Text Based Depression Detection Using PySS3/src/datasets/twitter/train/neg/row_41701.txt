Life doesn't feel worth living anymoreI have fucked up every relationship I have ever been in and I have no friends. I'm completely alone and it's all my fault. I'm abusive and manipulative and I don't have the motivation to do much of anything anymore. I go to work and put on a smile in front of family but I just feel numb and empty. I'm tired of hurting people, I'm tired of hurting myself. I'm just fucking tired. I just want to give up. I've lost everyone important to me and I hate myself for it. I'm better off dead, this world would be a better place without me.
