What are my options? Because I don't see any.- 30 y/o M, Europe
- After getting graphic Design degree, started "working" (super casually) from home in a niche field. Was getting pennies (fraction of a minimum wage) but I liked it because it's comfy. Even though I have a bit of portfolio, my CV is completely empty.
- Not even paying any taxes (so no pension), just minimal health insurance.
- Started to feel depressed (obviously), spent few years doing therapy and trying different meds â€“ no effect (positive or negative) or improvement.
- Somehow managed to get a job at a general graphic design studio. Still was depressed except now also tired and stressed. Quit after half a year because death seemed more attractive.
- In total have spent 9 years basically being a NEET and still feel like 16. Still live at home in the same room I have always lived.
- Don't want to kms but really don't want to live either. Have Nembutal ready to go.

I know the answer is probably obvious:

- "Get a job, any job. So that you get a routine."
- "Start going to a gym, meet people."
- "Move out of home, start living adult life."

But the problem (the way I see it) is:

- It's all generic advice while I'm honestly still a teenager in a 30 y/o body. I really don't know how "career", "relationship" or "networking" works. I need a lot of handholding. I need a dad I never had.
- Even if knew how to get a job, my CV is empty. Even if I did get a 9-5 job somehow, I hate the idea of it and have no energy.
- Wageslaving for minimum still wouldn't be enough to move out (so why bother?).
- Even if I did, I'd be all alone in some shitty cell far away instead of a house where there's family, quiet and a yard.
- And I didn't even get to my looks, especially fucked up teeth which put me in lose-lose situation: if I smile, I look retarded. If I don't, I look creepy. This means I can't fit in anywhere. To fix that I would need an expensive jaw surgery which is a catch-22.

Complete paralysis.
