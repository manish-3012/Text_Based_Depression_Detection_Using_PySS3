Attempted just to try...Hung myself a little bit just to see what it was like. Didn't have any second thoughts or emotions.

I think it's something I could do and be fine with. I don't have anything that can support my fat ass so I might find a tree or something.

If not now then soon at least. I refuse to live homeless. And I refuse to live a life where people just tell me what I want to hear, only for no results. Life gave up on someone like me, so I'm giving up on life. I'll be thinking of what to tell everyone and what to do with my stuff in the meantime.
