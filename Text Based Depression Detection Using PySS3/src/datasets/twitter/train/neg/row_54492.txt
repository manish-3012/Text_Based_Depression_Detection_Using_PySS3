Why is everyone OK with being unremarkable and useless?Like... you have all these names that you hear throughout your life of people that did... something. And they're remembered hundreds even thousands of years after they die. And then all of the regular people are here just soaking up resources and making someone else richer or more famous. Why? Why is everyone ok with this? What makes them deserve to have an easier life than me? What made it so they got to be born with the motivation to well in school? What made it so they could get born with parents that aren't drug addicted scumbags who only cared about themselves? Why did they deserve to not be depressed for no reason? What makes them so special that they can just fucking take life without wanting to die every second?
