I probably shouldn't be posting here, but I'm afraid to be alone right now.I've had suicidal thoughts since puberty. I've tried to change my view of myself, but that little voice always comes back and tells me to kill myself. I wrote a note to myself in my phone that read:

"Help me

I'm damaged
I'm damaged 
I'm damaged
I'm damaged
I'm damaged
I'm damaged
I'm damaged
I want to kill myself
Nothing matters
I'm damaged
Just kill me already
I'm damaged and I can't be fixed. I've spent so long trying to dig myself out of this pit but I can't. It's worthless. I hate myself and I wish i was never born. Just fucking kill me. I'm a waste of oxygen. My parents didn't want to have me. Nina would be happier if I was dead. Papaw doesn't need me. Mom doesn't need me. Dad doesn't need me. Why do I live like this? I'm fake and I'm useless. Who the hell would want me, I'm a new kind of useless. I'm lying to Orion, I want to help her but i can't even do that. Nobody would miss me if I'm dead."

I don't think of suicide as much as I used to, but god this might be the most tangible one. I'm forcing myself to stay seated in this chair because all I can think about is getting a knife and locking myself in the bathroom. It scares me because it would be so easy. I don't want to feel this way. I'm only 17. I want to grow up. I don't want to die. Please someone help me.
