I realized I truly am a pedophileIm a 16 male.It's currently 2AM where I live, i went checking and I legit got hard to an 11 year old dancing on TikTok. I sexualized the little girl in my mind.
I guess it was just a matter of time for this to happen.
I remember that when this started I told my parents "If I ever get hard to an 11 year old girl or younger I will kill myself".
Today this happened, im not feeling anxiety, im not feeling anything. I was almost sure that I was a pedo, and now I have 0 doubts.
Maybe POCD just made me realize who my true self was. Heck, maybe it wasn't even POCD all the time, i was probably just using it as a form of denial.
I'll try to get some sleep and I dont know what I will do when I wake up, but I imagine it wont be good.
I dont want to kill myself, but at the same time I do.
I dont want to make my family suffer because of me, but I also dont have any desire to live knowing that I am a pedophile.
Maybe I will commit suicide, maybe I won't. I just dont think I can make a decision right now. Im numb, I feel like im already dead.
I was supposed to go to a psychiatrist next week for an evaluation session, but now I dont know if I want to.
Check my post history, there's a post I made about all this before this happened.

And thank you all for believing in me and for the support in that previous post, but I guess life had other plans for me...
