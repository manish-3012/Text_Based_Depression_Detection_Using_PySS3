Help! My GF has considered suicide and self-harm in the past.Hey reddit, I have a problem with my girlfriend and for some context, we're both in high school.

 Last night, my girlfriend asked me if I have ever been suicidal. I have never, but I immediately felt concerned because I knew where the conversation was heading. She revealed to me that she has been suicidal before. I asked if she ever self-harmed and she told me she has considered it. She said that 3 years ago, she felt alone, she had a pair of scissors, and was thinking about stabbing herself in the stomach at the moment. When she told me this I just gave her a big hug and told her that she can always talk somebody and she could talk to me if she ever needed to. I honestly didn't know what else to say because we were out on a date and I didn't want to upset her by saying something she might not like. Even now as I write this, I recall her telling me that when she was in elementary, she threatened her schoolmates that were bullying her that she would kill herself. At the time when she told me this, I was shocked, but rationalized in my mind that she was probably lying so her bullies would back off. She said it in a kind of laughing tone and I assumed (stupidly) that she was all right. She exhibits some signs of depression. She asked me if my parents hated her after they met her and she has a pretty low image of her body.

This is where I need some advice. I really want to help her out because I really, really like her and would never leave her because of something like this. I've been reading some of the stuff on /r/SWResources but I'm not sure when/how to approach the subject. Do I just wait for her to bring this up again or should I offer her a chance to talk to me more about this before something serious ever happens? Thanks in advance.
