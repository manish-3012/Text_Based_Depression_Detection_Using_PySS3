I want my loved ones to feel guilty.This is a thought that I only have sometimes but when I do it feels so dark and I feel so alone. I think about times like now where if I died, my loved ones would look back and regret our last memory together. I want them to feel guilty about what they said or did to me. I feel bad but sometimes I think to myself that i'm not gonna care who thinks it was their fault when I finally kill myself. I know it's selfish but my pain just makes me not care.
