I have no idea what to do... so here I am, turning to strangers on the internetThis year has been rough on a lot of people. I'm well aware. But... This time last year, me and my partner packed everything up and moved 12 hours from all the friends and family I had to the area where she is from and where her family is. Her dad had a project that he needed more hands with, so we were going to be able to get out of professions neither of us really enjoyed and do something new and different and exciting. Well.. 2020 happened. Ended up working at a well-paying but VERY shitty job out of my interest and skillset. I finally left that job a few weeks ago and went back to a fairly cushy office job similar to what I was working before the move...  
I'm a veteran with ADD, PTSD, anxiety, depression and everything along with it. I try to not be resentful toward my partner and her father because it isn't their fault, but I can't help it. I hate being here because I don't feel at home or 'safe' (not in a literal sense, i just dont know a better word). I'm 33. Have no goals or anything I want to do or be. I'm in an area where I still havent explored much and made home or met friends or anything because of covid. I don't want to move back home. There is nothing there for me more than there is here. I just dont WANT anything. I've removed the handguns from the house as a preemptive measure. My partner would be broken if anything happened to me, but I feel like my depression and miserable-ness is just as bad. I hate the person that I have turned into, but my brain has gotten totally rewired it feels like. I feel like I've wasted a year, but there is nothing else I want to do. I'm tired of feeling like I'm just floating and existing.  
I just want to stop existing. I want to be forgotten about and for the world to move on like nothing happened.
