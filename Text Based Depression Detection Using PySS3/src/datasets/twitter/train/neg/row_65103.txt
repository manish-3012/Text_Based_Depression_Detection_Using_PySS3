So frustrated with myself16 m  getting so frustrated with myself. I missed three days of school and i have a shit ton to makeup. I cant do it. I cant do the work. Doing workbooks and stuff is just too hard, i blank out. And its going to kill my future, if i had one at all. I have a pretty wealthy family, its not like i don't have the money for college, but i don't have the work capability. I just cant focus on it and i hate myself for it. I went through elementary school with everyone telling me how smart i am. I was changed schools to go into a magnet program. But after that it all went to shit. 

Middle school my grade dive-bombed to Fs and I'm barely keeping Bs in high school now with less homework. Everything is just going to get harder. I just want to die. I have no future in anything as i have no attention span for work. People care about me but its not for any reason, i give them nothing. All i do is take from the world and cant stand to give. 

There isn't any material items i want. Nothing to look forward to. I want to love and to have a family and to do things. But those can only be earned by hard work. Everyone else seems to have their plans in order for how their life will go. And life is so short, i don't even see why i should waste my time on it anyways. 

There has to be something else, after life, that will be better. Something that isn't so painful and horrid. Im not happy and don't think i can be. Ending it will just stop the feeling, that would be nice.
