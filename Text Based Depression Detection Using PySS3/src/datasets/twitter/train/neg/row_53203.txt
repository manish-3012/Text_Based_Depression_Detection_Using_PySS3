I know the only way to make it better for everyone is to kill myself, but I'm too scared to do it.My mom lives in an abusive relationship.  Today I learnt that the money I'm getting is coming from her. I am the reason she never got a divorce, I am the reason she probably can't leave now. 

I know I could give back if I would get a job (and I'm looking for a job), but my mental illness often prevents me from doing so. I feel like of things haven't gotten better now, why should they in the future.

I try to live as modest as possible, but that means I'm missing out on a lot a teen or a twenty something would do. (this has been going on for 10 years) Which in turn makes me feel worse, due to social anxiety and a general existential crisis. 

Killing myself is faster than wasting more years of her life providing for me until I'm finally settled. Years she'll never get back and years she'll be trapped with that monster.

I know it will be hard on a few friends who have lost respectively a friend to suicide and a brother in an accident. But I haven't been a good friend either so I think I'll be soon forgotten. I missed out on more with them than I experienced, so it's not like we have a ton of memories anyway. 

I try to put everything in order over the next few days, there's not much to do. But I'm scared. I know it hurts. I'm afraid to fail. I would make everything worse if I fail. 

I just want my mom to be happy and my friends to be happy. But I let them down everyday I give into my anxiety or depression or whatever it is. Maybe it's pure laziness.

Even killing myself just means that I took the easy way out. Instead of getting better and making things better for them, I disappeared and caused them pain along the way. But I don't see it getting better. So isn't suicide the only option after all?
