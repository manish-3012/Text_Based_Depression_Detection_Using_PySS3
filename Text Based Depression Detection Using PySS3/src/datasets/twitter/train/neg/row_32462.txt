I'm at the point of daily suicidal thoughts, but i don't want to die. I want things to to improve instead of dying to end the pain.. Help pleaseDaily suicidal thoughts have been discussed with my psychologist. I'm on the strongest anti-depressants out and it persists. I could tell you my story but that's not the point. The point is I've come too close to going through with it. I've sat naked in the tub spinning an exact-o knife on my arm trying to talk my way out of slashing. recently i was going to take all of my pills before realizing i didnt have enough to kill myself.

I want to find a way out of this without dying. Growing up I was a prodigy in every way. I'm a genius and was the star athlete at my very large school. The total prodigal child and i had looks to go with it. Now i'm 31 and have fallen far far far from grace.... any advice to getting out is appreciated. I'm asking before it gets worse.

Anyone who has been close to suicide and recovered, how did you do it? thank you :/
