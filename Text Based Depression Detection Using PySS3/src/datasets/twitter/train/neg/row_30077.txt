Iâ€™m just so fucking exhaustedI donâ€™t wanna do this anymore

Iâ€™m not gonna continue doing this much longer

I always fuck up everything

And everybody

I canâ€™t even cut myself (which is the only thing that helps me) because the last time I did it I almost got sent to a fucking mental ward

Iâ€™m not diagnosed, and Iâ€™m not gonna get diagnosed because then everybody would find out and itâ€™s easier to just pretend everythings okay

When itâ€™s crearly fucking not but nobody cares anyway

I fucking hate myself

I donâ€™t wanna do this anymore
