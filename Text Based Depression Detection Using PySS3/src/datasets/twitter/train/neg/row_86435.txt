HelpIdk what else to say other than I donâ€™t want to live. Have tried to get help, reached out numerous times and nobody listens. Thereâ€™s is nothing overly bad in my life except my mental state. I donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore, I get brushed off by everybody for it, I have no job, no idea of what I want to do later on. Iâ€™m completely lost and this is my last call for help. Please.
