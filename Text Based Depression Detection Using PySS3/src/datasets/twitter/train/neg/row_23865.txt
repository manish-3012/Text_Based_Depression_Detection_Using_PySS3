I don't have anyone I don't want anyoneMy life seems alright. I have money I have the things I want and have my life as it seems organised.
I don't have anyone in my life and I do not have any friends or groups or communities that I belong to. I feel like I do not fit in and that nobody actually would ever care about me.
I feel truly alone in this world. 
I never speak to my family especially my dad who says mental problems aren't real. I have never spoken to my girlfriend about how I actually feel I always tell her it's "anxiety".

I have made preparations to end it all a few times in the past and on one occasion attempted to go through with it. This time I'm sure I will.
