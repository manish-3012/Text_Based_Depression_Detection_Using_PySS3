Thinking about ending itI'm 13 and gay, and I'm so miserable inside. 

I grew up very unwanted, and my mother would lock me up for days at a time when she didn't want to deal with me.

I live with my uncle now, and he's given me a better life. But I feel no connection to him or anyone else. He doesn't know that I am gay and constantly makes jokes to his friends about how he catches me jerking to pictures of celebrities. It's all completely made up. I know what that means, and I don't do that. He just tells me to take a joke if I seem upset over it.

I had one friend who was openly bi who I was in love with. We used to hold hands all the time and have sleepovers where we would cuddle together. He turned into a raging homophobe overnight though so he could date this girl who is a Christian. Even after they broke up, he doesn't talk to me anymore except to insult me.

I have no friends, and I want to die. I look up methods every day.
