I know I need help but I donâ€™t know how to ask for itI got off medication early this year and discharged by my psychiatrist a few weeks ago. But I donâ€™t feel better. 

I have a job and I still live at home. Iâ€™m going through some financial hardship but what really brings me down is how lonely i always feel. I canâ€™t alter my family otherwise they will smother me with the kind of affection I donâ€™t like and doesnâ€™t help.

I donâ€™t like to talk, Iâ€™ve talked about everything countless times, I keep repeating myself because nothing changes, and nothing I try works. I tried going back to school but I canâ€™t combine my job schedule with anything else. Iâ€™ve tried going to the gym but canâ€™t find the motivation to keep going. I canâ€™t find new friends, or ways to meet new people. 

Iâ€™ve given up on therapy and on saying I donâ€™t feel well because i feel like Iâ€™m expected to have news or have changed something on the next appointment, but nothing ever changes. 

I just stopped talking about what is wrong and as a result I got weaned off the medication and told Iâ€™m better. Iâ€™m not better, I just donâ€™t know how else to complain without feeling like a burden, or like Iâ€™m not doing anything to change. 

I know I should go talk to a doctor, but what do I say?
