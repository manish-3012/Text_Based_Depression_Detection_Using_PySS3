might be my last weekshit is just so bad. situations i cant take, and i have no one to talk to. my best friend killed himself years ago, and being so much older now everyone has moved on in their lives and i have no one i can really talk to or is in the same situation as me. im doing well in school and have a good job ahead, but what was the best thing that has ever happened to me is now so ruined and tainted. im missing out on what should be the best time of my life, and all i want to do is die. i have no one who understands or who i can talk to. this is probably my last effort.
