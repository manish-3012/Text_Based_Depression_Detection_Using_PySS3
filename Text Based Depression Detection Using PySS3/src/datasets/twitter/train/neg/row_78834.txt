I just wanna be selfish for once and just end it allLife's just too unfair and difficult and I can't handle it anymore. My husband is having difficulty dealing with my troubles. I can't hold a job so I'll run out of money and won't be able to do anything for myself anyways. My depression is too strong, I don't feel genuinely happy anymore. My mother wanted to kill me anyways and she should've just done it. Trying to get help is so exhausting, everybody seems too bothered by me even asking for help or sharing my feelings. I'm just so done with everything. The only reason I don't do anything is because my husband is still with me, for now. Almost want to break up with him to save him some hurt later.
