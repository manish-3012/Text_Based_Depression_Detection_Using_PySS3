I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll go home tonightI packed what little I could carry after being berated by my brother being called fat. I have a midterm coming up and have been trying to study all the while I told him twice to keep it down while heâ€™s playing video games. So I got fed up and started blaring music through his wall.

Then yelled at my mom for a stupid reason then he came downstairs and said something snarky to me. Then called me fat while heâ€™s fatter than me. So I blew up at him. Now Iâ€™m in my car trying to calm down but I donâ€™t think my life will get better. Iâ€™m tired of this trying and getting no where.

Iâ€™m tired of this hateful little shit whose never supported me. Iâ€™m tired of the world and people being mean to me, I have no love to give and no love to receive. I feel Iâ€™m just trying to avoid my life falling apart rather than feeling happy and that thereâ€™s no hope for me.

I wish they never adopted me so they wouldnâ€™t have to deal with me. I wish I was never born. I wish the sailor who impregnated my birth mom never met her. I just donâ€™t want to be me anymore.
