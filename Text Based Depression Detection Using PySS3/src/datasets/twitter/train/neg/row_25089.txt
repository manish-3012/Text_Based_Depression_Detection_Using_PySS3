Where is this sub?A few years ago there was a sub Reddit like this. It was for those planning on killing themselves and the time when they was gonna do it. I found that sub at the end of 2016, I think. People was saying they was gonna kill themselves for the new year. It wasn't really meant to stop the death, but a place where people can go to just say goodbye. 

Where the fuck is that sub at? I forgot the name. I like trying to talk people out of it, try to understand why they wanna do it. An if they do do it, know I tried to stop them, but at the same time.. see the end of their story. Knowing that will be me at some point. I can have a place online I can really go to say good bye. This is more of a sub to vent, and for people thinking about doing it. But where is that sub of people who are going to do it, do it?

I'm gonna do it at some point in like 15 years. There's no way out of this for me. If you know me, you would know the world isn't losing much. I think of them like me. I wanna be there with them, as I hope someone there is their for me in the end.

I'm gonna call 911 from a spoof number so they can't track my call before I do it. This way I have someone to talk to me as I fall asleep forever. I'll tell them my life story and not be able to finish it, because I'll pass out from the car fumes. Idk if I can't get a car, I'm gonna have to get a gun, but I don't really wanna shoot myself in the head, so I might have to do the heart. I don't know, I'll have to feel it out. I am black, so I can just go to Texas and reach for my waste super fast. I'll be dead in a flash. The cop will be white, so they'll be happy, get their power trip, and get away with it. That seems like a win win. I don't know. There are so much ways to do this. But anyway, whats the name of that sub?
