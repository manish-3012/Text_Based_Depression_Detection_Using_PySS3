I don't think I'm actively looking to take me life but the "fear" of death isn't there anymore. Ahould I ne worried?I preface this by saying I'm not actively suicidal at this point.

But to younger me the thought of aneurism or not waking up was terrifying.

I've been up all night. Can't sleep.

And the thought of just not waking up is "calming." I dont know how to put it.  "Peaceful," maybe?


Is this something I need to be worried about?
