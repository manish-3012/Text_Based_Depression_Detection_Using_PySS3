No longer feeling enjoyment or joyWhat should someone do when they no longer fee enjoyment or joy in general for any activity. Iâ€™m on medication and I practice gratefulness in this state. I stopped therapy since July 2019 bc itâ€™s no longer available for me. So far I canâ€™t feel enjoyment or joy anymore, even with the simplest things that used to bring me joy like hearing the birds singing in the morning or the smell of coffee. Idk what to do next. Any tips?
