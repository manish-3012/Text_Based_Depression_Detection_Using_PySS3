Inescapable NumbnessHey this is the first time Iâ€™ve done something like this. Iâ€™ve always kept to myself about how I really feel in day to day life, but after reading through some of these posts I decided to share my own thoughts.

Iâ€™m having a tough time really understanding what to do with myself. Everyday seems to morph into the next. I have tried everything from therapy to those dumb online tips and tricks that are supposed to make you feel better about life. The problem I face is that I canâ€™t escape the feeling of being numb.

It isnâ€™t sad, however since I feel nothing towards life, I have lost my will to live. I think about ending it nearly every night now. The only thing standing between life and death to me is the thought of my mom finding my lifeless corpse and how it would impact her. This whole bout of numbness has been going on for years and it sucks not being able to experience the same emotions everyone else seems to be enjoying.

Anybody I talk to about it says the same thing and they have a strong point. Iâ€™m leading a great life. I am leaving for college soon and have opportunities that so many others donâ€™t. I have given so much to this world and the community and people around me with things like charity work and just doing my best to be a good person. None of it has satisfied me, and I canâ€™t see anything in the future satisfying me either.

I think the reason Iâ€™m posting this is to see if anybody else is in a similar position. When I get to college, iâ€™m not sure iâ€™ll have a reason to hold back from ending it. If you read all of this, thank you.
