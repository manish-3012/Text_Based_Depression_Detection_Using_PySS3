Wanting to be dead has evolved to just accepting Iâ€™ll never be happyIâ€™ve (27M) attempted suicide twice, the last time was within the last year. I think the main reasons for my last attempt were feeling like I wronged someone I deeply cared about, feeling like a terrible person, and feeling Iâ€™ll never be happy. 

A few months have passed, and now Iâ€™ve just kind of accepted that nothing is going to change for me. I can try to be a better person, treat my friends better, try to find a partner who shares educational, personal, and sexual interests... but I donâ€™t believe itâ€™s ever going to change. I donâ€™t want to kill myself anymore but I just donâ€™t think life works out great for someone like me. 

With every passing day, I think my personal struggles eat at me more and more. I donâ€™t have any passions anymore. I think I have maybe 2 or 3 real friends but sometimes I feel like everyone just puts up with me. I have anxiety about situations that I used to be okay in. I have anxiety about pretty much everything actually. 

I kinda just want to press pause or reset on my life, but itâ€™s impossible. Having someone to just be with, vent to, and make happy would go a long way but with how much of a freak I seem to be, I think Iâ€™m going to alone forever. The messed up thing on top of this is that I think Iâ€™m lot happiest when I am doing things for others, making them happy, etc. But I can even really find someone who wants to let me do that for them, and it makes me feel like Iâ€™m not good enough for even friendships, let alone romantic relationships.
