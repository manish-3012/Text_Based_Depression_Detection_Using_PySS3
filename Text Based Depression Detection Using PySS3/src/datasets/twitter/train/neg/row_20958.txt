Losing my grip on realityI woke up earlier than usual. I have the feeling that everything is a dream. I can't really differentiate reality from a dream. I haven't been feeling like being for two months and it's getting worse. I see the girl I love with all my heart everyday at school and she just gives me this look of absolute disgust. She is struggling with anorexia . And I guess she doesn't trust people. I talked to her a couple of times. Even got her phone number. We talked about books once that I saw her outside of school and she told me about her problem. We said something about meeting up some day and when I messaged her it all went to shit. She said that she has been feeling stalked those past 2 weeks and that she didn't have a problem with me. We haven't talked since and it's been 1 month and a half. My Spanish teacher helps me a lot with my feelings cause she's the only one that truly understands me and she knows that girl well. We are her favourite students although we are in a different class. I have started thinking that I'm the villain in my story. Disappointing my parents with my grades, can't help this girl and I love her so much. I'm the villain. And I should be dead. I see her around school, smiling to people, talking to them, I'm just this disgusting piece of shit that she sometimes sees around. Today was our first day back from Easter holidays and I was scared of seeing her. I had anxiety over going to school for the first time in my life. I feared her gaze. I couldn't talk to my teacher today but I plan to tell her about my suicidal thoughts before finals which start next week. Hope it won't get worse. Hope someone sees this.
