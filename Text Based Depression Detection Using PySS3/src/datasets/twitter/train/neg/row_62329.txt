I dont know what to do anymore.I feel completely down, my family are going through troubles right now so they take it out on me; not physically abusing me but mentally abusing me. Apparently thats not abuse, but it scars me more mentally.. I always get anxiety when people get mad or annoyed at me because I am a wreck.. Honestly I've gotten to the point where I'm ready to end my life because I am never good enough anymore.. My friends hate me, i'm always ignored and i just hate it.
