I've attempted a few times but it was always impulsive or driven by alcohol. This time I've got it planned out to the last detail. I don't currently have the urge, but the idea of a plan is comforting to me. I thought I'd share my goodbye letter. (Trigger warning)Tired

I'm tired of this disease and the way it's slowly killing me
Like I'm stuck in a burning building
With no hope of escape
I'm tired of my mind telling me 
I'm worthless
And useless
And hopeless
And helpless
And a burden
I'm tired of this disease stealing my joy
And energy
Motivation
Ability to enjoy my loved ones
And will to live. 
I'm tired of hating my body
My entire being
I'm tired of thinking you're all better off
That you'll be sad, but then you'll move on
I'm tired of the depression
Mood swings
Anxiety
Pain
Apathy
Numbness
Inability to focus or concentrate
Inability to enjoy anything at all
And the near constant suicidal thoughts
I'm tired of the medications
Side effects
Therapies
Hospitals
I'm so tired that no amount of sleep
Could ever begin to relieve it
I tried so hard
But I'm just so tired
And I can't stay awake any longer
So I hope you'll understand
If I go to sleep now
(Please forgive me)
(I love you forever)
