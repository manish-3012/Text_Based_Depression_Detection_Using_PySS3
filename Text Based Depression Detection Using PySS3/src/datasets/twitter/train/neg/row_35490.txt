FuckMy girlfriend and I broke up and I have to deal with seeing her every single day and her not being even remotely phased by it. In some cases she seems way happier without me and it makes me so angry and sad at the same time. In the classes we have together I feel like every 30 seconds she makes sure to laugh really loud at every joke somebody tells her so that I can hear her being much happier without me. Meanwhile, I've been depressed since the breakup and isolated myself from all my friends and family.

Tonight I got rejected from my 6th college and I'm 100% expecting a 7th tomorrow from another school. I worked really hard in school and I was in the highest leadership position in my band. I worked hard for absolutely fucking nothing. I feel worthless. I don't see the purpose of life and I'm not really sure why I exist. I'm a fat and disgusting person who doesn't give a shit about the closest people in my life, I really have no purpose whatsoever to be living.

Tonight I think I'm going to sneak out of my home in the middle of the night and visit the Pennybacker bridge. I want to hang off the edge look down and see if I actually feel anything... if I end up giving myself any actual indication that I want to be alive. Nobody actually gives a shit about me in reality, if I did jump and die people would be sad but nobody would ever think about me or how I'm feeling when I'm alive.
