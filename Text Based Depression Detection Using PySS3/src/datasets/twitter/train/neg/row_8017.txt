Whiny teenager doesn't know where to start.Uuuuuuh. Okay, I should probably begin this by stating that I'm only 16 and I know that I haven't experienced any significant hardship. We live comfortably, I haven't lost anyone close to me (where 'lost' is a euphemism for death), I haven't experienced abuse or anything like that, I have a loving family. I don't really have a legitimate reason to feel this way and I can't explain it. You're more than welcome to tell me that these feelings are just a result of normal teenage mood changes - I would like to believe that they are. I'm sorry if this is a pain to read. 

I've decided that the best way to do this is to put everything in bullet points and then I guess you can ask me about things you want to know more about. That way, I'm (hopefully) not just ranting on and on.

* 16.

* Diagnosed with anxiety.

* Bullied when I was 14.

* Finding it difficult to talk to anyone.

* Lonely and very unhappy.

* Self-harming (cutting) for the last two years.

* Frequent thoughts of suicide.

* No real reason for any of this.

I don't really know what I'm hoping to achieve from typing this out but here you go. I would like to talk to someone, Reddit. I feel all alone.
