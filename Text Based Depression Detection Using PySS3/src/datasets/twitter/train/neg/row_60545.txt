"Do you have a plan?""Do you have a plan?"

I get tired of hearing this question. I have chronic thoughts of suicide. I self-harm to try and make them go away, as well as to bring myself close to the edge, to get comfortable with the idea of eventually incising my radial arteries. But have I ever had a plan? Yeah, once. I didn't even go through with that attempt, because someone found out about my plan. The four attempts I did make, though, flew under the radar, and they were all impulsive.

Granted, I lied about the fourth one. I said it was just self-harm, those two long, deep, gaping wounds in my right forearm, in the correct location for my radial and ulnar arteries. I'm a good liar.

I guess I get tired of hearing the "do you have a plan" question because I know damn well that chances are good I may just wake up one day and do it. I've envisioned how I would do it. I'm mentally and physically preparing myself for it. I have the means available to me at all times. But I don't have a concrete plan. So why do I bother admitting to my GP and counselor that I even have suicidal thoughts?

I just think it's strange that professionals only seem to take thoughts seriously when people have a plan, yet many suicides and attempts are done on impulse.
