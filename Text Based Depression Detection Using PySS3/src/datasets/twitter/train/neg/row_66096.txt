Thank you for letting me have at least this blip to call mine:)I am 22 year old female that just recently moved to LA to escape home. I will not bore you with the details of my story, other than that I used to be a person who thought I actually mattered. I used to think that because I did well in school and got into UC Berkeley, despite the fact that I was getting the shit beat out of me everyday from an abusive home, that I thought I could have a future. But unfortunately having super wealthy parents who don't give a shit is worse than being all around poor. I received no aid for being white and "privileged" and after working 45 hours a week and going to school full time, I had to drop out because I couldn't afford it anymore. Life has pretty much been a constant struggle since then. No one will hire me, started selling weed on the side so I could hopefully eat every couple days. Drowning in debt that is created by this shit government because they told me college is necessary to survive. I have an apartment, but I no longer can afford the rent and I've sold everything so I'm SOL there. I live in a bad neighborhood and have been mugged so many times that I just wish these gang members would kill me but they never do. My kidneys are always in pain, and I can't afford in time or money to get help. I'm not really looking for responses or pity because I know I have no one, I just thought I'd at least be a blip on the internet before I kill myself and remove my pointless existence from this earth. I guess the only thing I ever really wonder is why the universe would waste its time producing a piece of shit like me, but I guess I'll never know. Thank you for those who read this post. I appreciate you giving me some effort and it will forever be cherished by me.
