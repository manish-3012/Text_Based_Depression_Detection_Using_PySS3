Iâ€™m ready to leaveIâ€™m not sleepy anymore, yet feel so tired.

I donâ€™t want to hold on to this life any longer. I canâ€™t deal with these thoughts any longer, utterly unbearable. These figures, they wonâ€™t leave me. They haunt me, inherently sinister, and evil. Their existence, to wreck havoc on my life, to spew evil into my mind and make me one of them.

It would be the best for me to leave as soon as possible. I want to void to engulf my consciousness, no longer feeling anything. Free from these evil and filthy manifestations.
