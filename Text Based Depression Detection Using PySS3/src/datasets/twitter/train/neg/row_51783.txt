Wish I had the courage to do itIâ€™ve wanted to die for a while, but Iâ€™m afraid. Thatâ€™s what stops me. Nobody in my family knows Iâ€™m suicidal due to another relative having a mental illness. Iâ€™m expected to be strong and I couldnâ€™t imagine burdening my family with ANOTHER â€œmadâ€ person in the family. All I want to do is curl up and die, but I canâ€™t.
