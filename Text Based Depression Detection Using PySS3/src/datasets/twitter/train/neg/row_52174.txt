I can't handle this pain anymore. I can't handle life after losing my best friend.My best friend didn't die, but they chose to left my life. I wake up one morning and see that they blocked and deleted me everywhere, without any chance for me to respond or explain myself. They said that "I donâ€™t need you to tell me how bad your life is to make me feel like I need to help you get through it" and my constant venting was bringing him down when he has his own issues.  
I miss him so much. I don't know what I did wrong. Just a few days ago he said he loved me more than some of his own family, he said I was one of the best people he's ever met, and that I was his best friend. 3 days later he removes me from his life. I really miss him, and I can't stop thinking about all our good but painful memories together. I finally had somebody in my life who loved me and considered me their best friend, but they're gone. I fucked up another friendship. Why do I even try making relationships if they're all going to end one day anyways? I just want to fucking kill myself.
