People are hypocriteWhen you are sick with cancer, they go crazy caring about how you feel and being sensitive about every word you say to a cancer patient.

But when you are sick with depression and suicidal thoughts, they still say shitty things about you.

Why?

Because it doesn't show.

I wish I had cancer instead.
