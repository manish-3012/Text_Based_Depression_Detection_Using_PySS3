I bought a ropeIn 1877, in Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, Levin contemplates suicide keeping a rope in his office. I find this inherently beautiful, when one is coming to terms with their existence, knowing it's there, available, to make a decision that determines the end of all and nothing but all, is rather elegant in my belief.

As such, I went out the other day, and bought a rope, and I kept it in the trunk, perhaps as a reminder that even in the worst state of time and mind, when overwhelmed by sadness and dread, solitude and despair, I perhaps can indulge in a fantasy that expresses myself as perhaps once brave, humble, and rather graceful.
