Where do people like me go?I have gotten to the point where I don't want to do anything. I literally just want to eat, sleep, go to the bathroom and watch television. If it was possible I would just sign myself into a hospital for the rest of my life. I don't want to just go to a mental ward because they would probably release me after like a week and I'll be back into the real world where I cannot function. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't have the mental or physical energy for anything.
