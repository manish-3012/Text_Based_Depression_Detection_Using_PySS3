My Only Happy PlaceAll summer long I've been stuck at home. Either because I've been too sad to get out of bed, or because my sister just doesn't want to go out and sleeps all day. So I've been trying to entertain myself. Binge watching Stranger Things, drawing, watching television, and painting. I finally am volunteering at a daycare and am loving it. I've become happier when I'm there, because the kids always want to play with me and sit on my lap. 
However, when I'm home, I become a completely different person. I'm not occupied, and think of things that nobody should think of. And my family has really just been making it a bit worse. Another huge thing that has been making it worse is the rape that happened to me a year ago. I'm still writing victim impact statements (some that will never be read outloud), and it sometimes makes me feel better. But I've just been feeling worthless and dirty. Because I'm no longer a virgin, and I lost my virginity in an "unpure" way.
