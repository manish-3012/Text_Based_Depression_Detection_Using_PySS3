I don't know how to make it better.Today I got called in to work to fix something, and as soon as I got the texts the intrusive thoughts hit me like they always do. Wishing to get hit by a car on my way to work so I don't have to go, so the responsibilities go away for a while. After I fixed the problem I went to the nearby parking garage and went to the top floor. I'm sitting there now. I did this type of work for 5 years in the navy, and hated every second of it. Why did I choose to do it again. Why do I wake up before work every day and the first thoughts that hit me are "I wish I was dead."
