The circle of lifeIâ€™m curious... according to Hinduism. If reincarnation is real than if someone were to kill themselves. Would they be reborn and forced to live and learn the same lessons over? Would they be faced with same hardship? Alan Watts says, can you remember a time when you went sleep having never woken up? The answer would be no.. then he says, can you remember a time when you woke up having never gone to sleep? And that is when we are born. So.. something Iâ€™m thinking about. Wondering what the collectivist consciousness (you all) have to say...
