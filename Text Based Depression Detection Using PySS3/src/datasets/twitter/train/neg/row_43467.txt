I'm tired of being a failureI graduated nearly two years ago and I'm still unemployed. My GPA wasn't that good and I choke on what few phone interviews I have had because of anxiety, which has only gotten worse as time has gone by without me getting a job. My anxiety has stopped me from getting even retail jobs. I've used up nearly all my savings at this point and for the first time I can't make rent. The shame I feel about it is crushing me at this point. I stopped talking to my few friends, who weren't even close to me, over a year ago because I couldn't even look them in the eye and I was terrified they'd ask me about the job hunt and I couldn't take that. I'm not sure how I'm going to be capable of going on when I can't even get a damn minimum wage job. I don't know how to fix my anxiety and even if I fix it I don't know how I'm going to explain why no one would hire me for two years. I'm in tears because I don't know how to fix this and I'm tired of trying to and failing.
