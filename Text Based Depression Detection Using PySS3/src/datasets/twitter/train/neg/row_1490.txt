Is there any chance for a brighter future for me?I'm a 29 year old male who lives and works in the UK. My Mother passed away due to cancer when I was about 6. Dad was abusive due to his depression but I forgive him and I still love him to this day. Stepmom is a real bitch, nobody likes her really. Moving to the UK alone in 2015 for a better life. 

2016: friend kills herself by committing suicide. Can't believe it. The whole year is a blur for me.

Something has snapped in me while I was isolated from my family and friends. Don't know or might never know what but I became numb. Nothing gets me anymore.

2019: knock on the door. Police.
They believe I have downloaded indecent images of children. They're are right. I did.
They took all my electronic equipment and they are looking into my computer for more illegal files. Lawyer said it will be a suspended sentence but expect to be on the Sex Offenders Register list for 2-7 years.

This is where I finally died inside. All the struggle in the past decades and all the challenges I faced - this will be the one that kills me. A stupid mistake like this will be my downfall. As soon as I'm on that list: it's over. And the worst thing is... it's all my fault.

No work. No place to live. Nothing.
Hopeless. Thinking about suicide every hour of a day. Called up several help lines but they didn't convince me. Can anyone help me? Please?
