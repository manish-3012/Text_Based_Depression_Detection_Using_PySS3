I don't know how much more I can takeI've been crying on and off for the past 48 hours, I've clearly been withdrawing from friends over the last week and no one has bothered to check how I'm doing despite them all knowing I tried to kill myself 6 months ago. My Mum is the only one that seems to openly give a shit about me and I keep pushing her away because I'm just constantly angry all the time. I can't hold down a job, I lost my ex-girlfriend to someone else because of it, I'm constantly fucking miserable and all I want to do is die, but I don't even feel like I can do that because it'd ruin my Mum. I'm so sick of all of this, I wish I'd never been born.
