I'm not sure what to do anymoreI'm not sure how much more of this I can take. Im an 18 year old guy and for the past 4 years I have been struggling with crippling depression and severe anxiety daily. During these last 4 years, I have been hospitalized 3 times for about a week at a time each visit. My will to get up everyday diminishes and even performing the most basic of daily tasks such as cleaning up my room or showering. I'm at the point where I don't care about the outcome of anything anymore. I've never felt more bitter and felt hatred for everything so intensely. I can't find a single thing that will make everything worth it. My family has always been very supportive up until recent years when everything started to go downhill. My mum always just tells me to snap out of it and doesn't help  very much. She tells me all the time now that she can't take it anymore and my dad and sisters cant deal with it either. I can't stand being around them I feel like they don't get me at all and look at me like I'm so fucked up. I'm feeling very desperate right now. I am at my breaking point and I'm not sure how much more of this I can take. I don't know what to do. Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated.
