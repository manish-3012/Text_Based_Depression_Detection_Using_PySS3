If one person could save my life.....Okay.

You know when you're making positive progress, like growth, happiness .... moving TOWARDS a goal you set? That keeps you out of bed and alive and thriving.

Lately, I can't stop thinking about aging. When I'm not thinking about it, I'm being delusional or denying it, right? But I wake up in the mirror and watch my body falling apart - sings of aging, starting to become ugly oh God, right? I want to stay young. Full of energy. Alive. I want to stay strong and attractive. I'm a male, my hair line is less, wrinkles not fading with sleep, weaker body overall. I just see nothing in my future but suffering, and the inevitable hospice bed where I can barely move breathe do anything but fucking die. And we get so ugly, right? 

So if that's all I'm, we, all of us are moving towards, then why not put a gun to my head and pull the trigger right now? 

"Be tough. Never give up. Keep fighting on. Stay positive. Move forward." All of this is meaningless when talking about our slowly inching towards THE GRAVE.

So I ask you, why continue? Why? Should I just distract myself and pretend distract myself watch movies laugh maybe use faith and power of positive energy and believe I'm some divine powerful being who can attain immortality or use my mind to grow younger and be more positive or something else? Or do I just...... God. I just feel so ashamed and humiliated every time I look in the mirror. When I see an older person on the street, I can hardly look at them for more than 5 seconds. How do you think I treat myself when I look in the mirror?
