"Successful life"... yet still want to end it allI have an excellent and stable job making 6 figures, I have a very beautiful and supportive girlfriend, I own a house and two vehicles, yet I still think about suicide on a daily basis.

I'm an american, and it's depressing that our government is filled with a bunch of twits. I don't care for most people because all they do is complain about problems that seem too easy to fix, yet they do not listen nor care to fix them. I'm an atheist because religious seems ridiculous to me. 

I honestly see no place for me in this world. Why the fuck do I need to still be here? The only thing keeping me here is that my parents would be devastated if I were to go. That's not enough of a reason to make it through each day.
