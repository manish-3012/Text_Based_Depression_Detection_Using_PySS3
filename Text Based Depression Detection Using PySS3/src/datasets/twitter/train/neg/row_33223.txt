LMFAO When The Judge Acts Like He Knows Whats Best For Depressed PeopleSo I went to juvie last month for doing some stupid internet crime, they left me there for 52 days, and i had to speak to psychologist about my depressed and anxiety and why i cope with my computer and how i made a bad mistake. So i talk and they put me on meds, i kept telling them about my social anxiety and how i want to end it all a lot of the time. And i behaved there and never did anything bad. They let me go home but what really got to me was the judge read my report, and saw about my panic attacks i had there and me almost killing myself there. But he put me on probation forcing me to be social and talk to people when he doesn't understand how hard it is and how scared i am, its a disorder not something i can just do because he wanted me to. Now i will go back to jail if i dont "fce my fears" this really makes me upset. And i cant say anything about it. The judge kept talking about how. "Im a failure and my computer is whats making me more depressed" i even said in my report i try and try everyday but its unmotivating and hard and scary. What makes the judge an expert and what makes him  so smart that he can know whats best for me, yes i get it he doesn't want me to break the law again and hurt people but. Its not that easy. And i knew he knows that but wants me to suffer. And go to jail if i dont face it. This makes me so stressed out and makes me want to die even more this doesn't help someone like me. This is really annoying.
