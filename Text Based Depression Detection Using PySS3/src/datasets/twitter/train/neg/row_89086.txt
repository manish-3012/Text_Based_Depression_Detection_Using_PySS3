Very ConfusedLike a lot of other people here, IDK if I want to die tbh. But I keep trying and I either wuss out or the attempt doesnâ€™t work...and after each try I go thereâ€™s a reason I must be here, and I try again. 

Idk what to do anymore. 

Iâ€™m too tired and broke to keep trying at this life, but Idk how to not live if that makes sense.
