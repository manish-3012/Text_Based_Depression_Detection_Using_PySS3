Would anyone truly care?Hello, my name is Jacob and im 14 years old. Ive dealt with suicidal thoughts/actions since 8 and each attempt i couldnt muster enough courage. Most thoughts are via the golden gate bridge being a quick death. I dont want to die but i feel like i have to just so i dont have to feel the shitty pain i feel every day from my depression and anxiety.

I want to let people know i need help but the voice depression throws at you says not to talk and the internet is the only way i know how to. Not only would the GGB be an easy way to die but maybe a caring bystander or officer would help me through what im dealing with.

But do they actually care? Are they genuinely feeling for someone life and want to help them or are they just playing a sick game to make them seem like a better human being? 

I want to know i want to get help, talk to someone in person, i want someone to listen to what i have to say, i want to break free of whatever has its grasp on me and the thing is if i feel the right way and someone asks whats going on ill spill it, tell them the whole damn story but no one does. Even people at my school wont pay attention unless its my best friends or my chromebook getting flagged for going to the suicide hotline.
