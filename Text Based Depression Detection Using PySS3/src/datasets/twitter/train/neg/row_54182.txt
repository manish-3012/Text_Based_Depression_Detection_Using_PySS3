I almost killed my self yesterday and my friends think it's a joke or mad at meI almost died yesterday, I tried to have a good weekend, and I'm fucking mad, I fucking hate it how friends think negatively thinking is bad for me, I fucking hate it when I think negatively that I feel dopamine, I fucking hate my life. I know that I'm a disappointment a failure and fucking a nobody, so why can't they stop trying to say keep trying, keep fighting, and it will get better, because I fucking know it fucking wont get better.
