BipolarIâ€™m so sick of the ups and downs.im back having my manic swings and my depressed lows. I havenâ€™t slept through the night in 2 days. I got 2hrs of sleep last night, Iâ€™m so sick of the craziness in my head. Itâ€™s too loud in there. I want it to stop. I want to be normal. There is so much for me to live for. Like hiking and adventuring and friends. But I canâ€™t take these ups and downs they are tearing me apart. Itâ€™s only a matter of time before it starts affecting everyone around me. The girl I was seeing will see how crazy I am and quit talking to me. My friends will see me dropping down and get sick of the swings and leave. Itâ€™s only a matter of time. The part that sucks the most is Iâ€™ve done everything I can to be healthy. Iâ€™m sober, in recovery, trauma counseling and medication compliant. But Iâ€™m still fucked up. Iâ€™m never going to be ok. I had a airsoft gun that looks realistic enough to get a cop to end things for me. Every time I try I fail. I want to live and see the beauty of the world- but I want to get away from this pain, and fear. I donâ€™t have control of my own head.
