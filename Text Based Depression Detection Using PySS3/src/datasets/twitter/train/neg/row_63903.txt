I want to hang myself over a bridgeBut don't fucking worry "friends" I only WANT to. I haven't bought a rope, so don't fucking care, it's ok, I only WANT to. There's no fucking problem there is there. Im a fucking coward isn't that right? There's no fucking problem I've fantasized about since I was a child, right? Yea, don't fucking worry, you don't have to make up another story to "steal my thunder." It was really nice getting told someone killed themselves on my birthday. No, I just WANT to. Im clearly never going to do it. As if any of you "friends" care.
