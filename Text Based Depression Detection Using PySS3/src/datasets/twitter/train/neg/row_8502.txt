How I want To DieMy name's Daniel, I'm a junior in high school.

I've wanted to die my whole life, but I've always been scared of dying alone and the pain that comes along with suicide. Last night I walked to some woods near my house with a knife and had planned on slitting my wrist/neck, but I couldn't do it. Now I know exactly how I want to die. I plan on using Nembutal or a similar substance to fall asleep and die at school, because I know I won't be as afraid of death if there are others around me. I want to do this during second period, where I'm an aid for an AP Psych class. The way I imagine it going down is as follows:

I consume my cocktail of Nembutal and alcohol in class, and then announce to the class what I've done and why I did it there and not at home, apologize for burdening them and then ask someone to hold my hand as I die, which hopefully someone will. If all goes as planned, I'll be unconscious before paramedics arrive, and they won't have time to save me, and even if they try I'll be asleep so I won't feel whatever they do, so my final waking moments will be holding someone's hand before I fall asleep.

It'd be a lot less scary for me that way, and if my classmates decide to show concern for me in my last moments, I'll even feel cared for, so I'll die happy.

Lastly, I'm sorry for posting this. I know so many people post here who are probably more in need than I, and nobody likes reading these things anyhow, so sorry you had to read all that.
