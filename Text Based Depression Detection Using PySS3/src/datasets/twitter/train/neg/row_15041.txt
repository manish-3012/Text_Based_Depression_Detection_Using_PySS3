Been few monthsIt's been awhile since I posted, probably few months since i tried to OD on a certain drug, but didn't have the courage to.

Looking back to that stage of my life, i might have overloaded myself with worry about work.. Maybe all i had to do was to say No, but i didn't.

Nevertheless, i still get these ideas every now and then, especially before hopping into the ER to work, or before going to bed most nights... IDK, it just seems like an easy way out that i eager for, maybe i will find peace of mind.

I will keep going on strong, fighting these ideas, trying to make my father proud and hiding the truth about my illness hoping he won't notice.. I stopped discussing it with him cuz mostly he'd tell me there's no other jobs out there for me because that's how the country we live in works.

I just hope whoever reads this, stay strong
It's not easy, but stay strong.
