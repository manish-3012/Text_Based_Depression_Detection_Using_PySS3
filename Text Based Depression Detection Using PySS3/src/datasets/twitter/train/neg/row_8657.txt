No happiness, no sadness just endless monotony.Recently I have stopped being sad... I would guess that sounds like a good thing but somehow it left a hole thatâ€™s starting to fill up with boredom and selfhatred. The meds donâ€™t help either. My thoughts stay the same. â€žJust off yourself. Death canâ€™t be worse than your current life.â€œ I even started selfharming again. Just to see that I am not totally numb towards my life and the things that come with it. Even if itâ€™s through a razors edge.

I just donâ€™t know how I can continue this long enough, that I donâ€™t have to hurt my mother with my actions.
