My last hope has fallen apart.I [20M] have been going downhill my whole life, but for the past two years or so I've spiraled out of control. For the past year I have wanted to die, and things got so unbearable I failed out of college and had to come back home. I've mentioned this in other posts, but my home is where all of this started and I absolutely hate this place because of it. I cannot handle being here and I would rather die than be stuck here any longer, but I had no money or job to leave. My family kept saying they'd help but they weren't doing anything, meanwhile I was panicking and deteriorating every day. Now I've been here 6 months and I feel ready to die, so a week and a half ago I just bought a ticket to Chicago and decided I'd go. My family was afraid of me being homeless or in a shelter so they decided to try and help me, but nobody would rent a place to me. I got my hopes up thinking that things would finally start to get better for me for the first time and now they've just fallen apart. I got my hopes up, nobody would rent a place to me, and I don't know anybody there.

I'd rather kill myself than be here any longer, but I have no job, work history, credit, or anything else I'd need to have a life in the world. I think my time is just up. I can't stay here and I can't move. I won't stay here longer, no matter what that means for me.
