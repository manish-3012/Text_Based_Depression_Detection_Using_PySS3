nothing is working outI wanna die. I stopped going to school because of my depression and I couldn't complete homework. I'm 22 years old. I used to have a 4.0 when I was a freshman in college but now I just suck at school. 

My parents are not supportive of me working full time and discontinuing school. I would go back to school at a later date but right now it's just not meant for me. I don't know what to do. I don't have health insurance so I can't get therapy yet. 

My boyfriend didn't take showers so it ruined our sex life. I suggested an open relationship to meet our needs elsewhere, and he immediately began getting girls but without talking to me about it and it permanently broke our relationship. we were going to get married and have a good life but I made a dumb fucking decision and now our relationship to each other is gone. I broke up with him this week. 

The girl my boyfriend slept with (same party I was at btw) has now fucked all my male friends (who are also my coworkers) so now I feel just completely alone and without anyone to talk to, because they're all much better friends with her. 

I live with my sister in my parents' extra house (jeez right) and she is emotionally and physically abusive. I thought about trying to leave but I have a cat and I'm worried about how I can find a place to rent with her, because I live in a college town.
