These Silent Thoughts.In my mind I can hear them, clear as day. A cacophony of echoes from my past. I do my best to drown them out with other thoughts, and yet they will always linger... Reminding me that despite the silence around me; the noise inside my head is deafening.

Everyone stops talking to me eventually. Hell, one person even asked how I could be on here for five years and still be making r4r posts - she finished by posing the question: "what's wrong with you?" Whether she meant that as a joke or was serious about it, she's definitely got a point.

What the fuck is wrong with me?

I'm just... tired. So fucken tired. Of trying to put myself out there, whether online or in real life. I was raised by folks from the silent generation, so my way of thinking is a bit antiquated. Yet I do carry myself with that old world swagger. But that's just it.

My way of thinking doesn't make sense anymore. 

Got to thinking I should try my luck in a NSFW dating sub - see if I can go out with one last hurrah before I punch my own ticket.

I'm single, living on my own, and my family are in another country. There's only me here.

Only me.
