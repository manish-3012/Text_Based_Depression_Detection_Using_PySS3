I can't be happyI finally have the opportunity to end my life, I've been wanting to do this for a while. I don't have a particularly sad story or any reason why I want to do this. I feel empty, I have no use, I have no friends, I'm always alone, and it breaks me. I can't be here any longer, I don't even know why I'm typing this out here, I guess as a final plea, maybe as a sort of note, I'm not sure
