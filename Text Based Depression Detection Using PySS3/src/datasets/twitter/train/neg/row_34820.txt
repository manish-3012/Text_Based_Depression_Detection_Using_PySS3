I am tired of people who try to "help" Implying that my pain is wrong, that things *will* get better, you accuse me of not being able to see the future clearly because I state it won't get better, but then you turn around and tell me things will get better and that my pain is only temporary. As if happiness is a certainty, and pain is only a fleeting thing and the chance to feel happiness again trumps emotional pain.

I am tired of you implying that these feelings inside of me that I express, are those of seeking attention (what the hell does attention seeking behavior look like anyway), that suicide is selfish because it hurts others. All death hurts others. Its only natural for people to mourn those they love no matter the fashion in which they die. 

why is it that people should do what they think is best for them unless they believe that suicide is what is best for them? 

Why is it that people don't know how to talk to those thinking of suicide, immediately going to the logic that "omg suicide is wrong!" what about the pain the person is going through, isn't that wrong? 

One of the most horrible things I've ever heard is a crisis interventionist saying to a patient "if you really wanted to kill yourself you would just tell me that you felt fine, i'd let you go and you'd go home and do it."

Like, really? For some reason that sounds awful to me, discrediting how the patient felt, almost encouraging them to commit suicide. At least that's how it sounded to me.
