What's the point?Right now I'm only alive because I know it would hurt my fiance. He probably wouldn't survive my suicide.

But if it weren't for him I'd be gone in a moment. I'm just having trouble seeing the point to life. I'm not looking for the meaning of life or anything. Just, why is it so much better to live than to die? Because right now I'm seeing a lot more cons than pros to living. And if I died, well, all the trouble would just be over.

So, could we maybe get a discussion going on why living is better than dieing? Maybe something will stick.

P.S. I've been in the hospital twice since February and I've been suicidal since August. Also, I have bipolar and borderline personality disorder. I am medicated. Just to get all that info out there.
