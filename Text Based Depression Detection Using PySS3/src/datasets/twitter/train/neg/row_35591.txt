Long term suicide plan (T-minus 2 years)I feel so responsible right now cause i just got a part time job. My goal is to get enough money to buy a gun :P

Living in the US has its perks but nobody informed me that i had to be 21 to buy a fucking gun so now i gotta play the long game. I don't even know if I'll last that long.

I wish i could drop out of college. That would save me so much money and i could even leave some savings money to my family when i die. But college is normal and i don't want a bad background check because i was impatient and attempted suicide early or bye bye gun

I don't know why I'm telling you guys this. I guess it's maybe like a public promise? So i don't extend the deadline? Because it is kind of tempting to just live a little longer just long enough to finish my degree, get a good job and leave money to my family. As an apology. 

I would still kill myself in that scenario of course.  But it's just a fantasy because i don't want to live that long and i feel guilty about not wanting to. I also feel a bit guilty about leaving without helping my family. I owe them so much, but i just want to die man
