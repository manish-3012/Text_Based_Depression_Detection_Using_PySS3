Iâ€™m going to kill myself tomorrowIâ€™ve been thinking about when Iâ€™ll go through with it since last week. Itâ€™s been the only thing I look forward to. Iâ€™ve finished writing my suicide notes and letters today. Iâ€™m afraid of tomorrow. But I canâ€™t take it anymore and while I know I have so much life to live, Iâ€™m afraid of the pain that would come if I keep going. The loneliness gets to me. Sometimes it feels like Iâ€™m already dead, like I donâ€™t even care anymore, and thatâ€™s too much.

So after school, Iâ€™m going to get a Big Tasty combo or something, and try to enjoy myself for the final time. Then...thereâ€™s a swimming pool at the park no one seems to go to, my parentâ€™s blood pressure pills, and many other options to go.
