Thinking of killing myself tonightI'm really thinking of killing myself tonight. Usually these thoughts go by and sometimes they're really bad when I'm in a really depressive state (like right now), but I remembered that I have a pill bottle full of antidepressants from years ago and bottles of alcohol in the fridge. And I can't help but think how easy it would be to down all of it and just let go.

Even if I don't do it tonight, there's always tomorrow. Or the day after that. Or next week. Or next month. The option is always here and that's strangely comforting. I know my friends would be sad and my bf would probably be devastated. I know that should make me feel guilty, but I'm a monster and right now I'm just too numb. I'm so sick and tired of everything. I'm just... so fucking tired....
