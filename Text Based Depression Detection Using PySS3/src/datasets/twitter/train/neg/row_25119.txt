HelpI hate my life I want to die, but not really die. It sounds confusing but honestly I love life but I hate the person I am, the people around me and pretty much just everything. I see the world as a pretty place, but I just donâ€™t want to be me. Like I want to be somone else anyone else, like does anyone believe in reincarnation? Like if I killed my self is it possible I can be reborn as something else another kid?
