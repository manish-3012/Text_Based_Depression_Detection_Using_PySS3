Too stubborn to dieLast night I almost did it, I was in the tub of me and my roommates bathroom. I had my favorite music and I had the note written. Me and my roommate always joked that he would get everything when if I died. I was close but then I feel this sudden realization of what my family would think of me. The anti-social son that has no friends and alone in a new town by himself. His mother warned him to not go because he is going to grow up to nothing. I was so fueled at spite at this point I stood up and went to my room to play league of legends.
