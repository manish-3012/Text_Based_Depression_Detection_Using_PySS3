I keep thinking tonight will be the night I end itYet I continue to wake up in the morning

Everything seems to get worse the older I get

I've lost almost all my friends, almost everyone that was dear to me at some point

And I can't help but think...why am I here? Why? 

There's something majorly wrong with me and I wish I had the courage to finally end it once and for all
