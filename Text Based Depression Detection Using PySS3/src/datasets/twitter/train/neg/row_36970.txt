It'll happen one day.Not sure when, but suicide is going to be the way I go. Unless I die from something completely unexpected like a car crash or stroke.

Just thought I'd post this and maybe in a few years I'll be dead and this will be part of my digital grave. Or I'll look back on this post and wonder why I felt like this.
