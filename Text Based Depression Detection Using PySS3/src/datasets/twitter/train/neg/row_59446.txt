Broken heart.I donâ€™t know where to start... Iâ€™ve been in a relationship with a girl for almost 3 years with plans to be married (we were engaged). Iâ€™ve always loved her more than myself and always tried my best to be the best I could for her. Sheâ€™s so gorgeous and perfect in my eyes and yet, since the beginning she was always clawing away at me. Iâ€™ve always been super popular and I put away everything, even my opportunity for the naval academy to be with her because I was scared to lose her. However, the red flags were massive and she could never communicate due to childhood trauma. My emotions were always ignored and I never got reassurance. Every time I would ask for sex (that makes me feel terrible... consent is important yeah, but I was so deprived of affection I had to ASK), she would go â€œmmm, I dunno.â€ And leave it at that. Iâ€™ve been constantly dealing with ignored emotions, and recently instead of working on things like we promised, sheâ€™s been at some other guys house without checking her phone. I moved back into my mothers and Iâ€™ve been so fucking sad. I have been dealing with PTSD (from being raped as a child), BPD, major depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. I donâ€™t understand how she could tell me she loved me and let me sit here at night drowning in my feelings... my god I just want to overdose, or crash my car, or stab myself. I recently started cutting and Iâ€™m destroying myself. I canâ€™t sleep, I canâ€™t eat, Iâ€™m constantly being left alone. I felt like the world was trying to leave me hints that sheâ€™ll come back and things will get better, but she wonâ€™t even answer my phone calls.... do I have no worth???? Iâ€™ve always been told that Iâ€™m amazing and smart and attractive, but the woman I LOVE, abuses me mentally. Itâ€™s so hard to have to deal with alone and I just want to end it. So. Badly. I have no one.. I just want someone, to hold me, and give me warmth, love and lust... but even now I canâ€™t fathom it. Iâ€™m cold, and wet, and Iâ€™m ready to end my life. Iâ€™m sorry mom. Iâ€™m sorry I only made it to 20 and fucked up everything... Iâ€™m sorry mom that Iâ€™m leaving you with my debt from the hospital for trying to kill myself. No one deserves to feel like this. So if youâ€™re reading this, donâ€™t do what I do. Please get help. 
Thank you.
