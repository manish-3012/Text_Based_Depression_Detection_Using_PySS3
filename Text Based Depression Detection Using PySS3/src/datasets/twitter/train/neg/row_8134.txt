Not even sleep is an escape anymoreMy ex is always in my dreams. And they aren't happy dreams. They're dreams of me watching her, trying to talk to her, but I never get a response exactly like how it is in reality.

I don't know if this makes sense, but I'm suicidal in my dreams too. I don't quite try to kill myself in my dreams, but some of my dreams are about me contemplating suicide.

Being awake and being sleep is essentially the same reality for me.
