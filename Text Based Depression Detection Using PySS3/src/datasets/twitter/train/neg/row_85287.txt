Anyone else use a facade?{Reposted due to a lack of responses}

So, if you read another of my posts, you'd know that I am a 15 year old in Highschool, just to clear things up.

I am tired of using a ghetto facade all the time. I always have to act ghetto to everyone in school, just to hide the weak, shy and quiet pussy hiding inside.

Hell, the only reason I have as many friends as I do is because of the way I act around people. But of course, my facade has flaws. Whenever, like, a teacher or other adult comes near me, or when my parents are around, it's back to the real, piece of shit version of me.

I use the act as a defence mechanism basically, and I am tired of using it. It's just so much energy to have to socialize with so many annoying people, just so I can have short moments of genuine happiness and enjoyment, and laughter.

Anyone else feel the same?
