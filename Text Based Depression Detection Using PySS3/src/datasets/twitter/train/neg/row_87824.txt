Badly need help, too scared to get itThrowaway because fear.

I am losing my mind. For the past two-ish years I have been in an abyss. I need help. Badly. In the past two weeks, I have become suicidal. I haven't worked up the courage to off myself yet, but I'm sure I'll manage to before I can work up the courage to tell somebody.

I'm currently routing through TOR because I'm so terrified of someone finding out who I am. Rational thought has fallen apart. I have no idea how I can overcome my fear of reaching out for help. It needs to get done soon, or I won't be here much longer.

One thing I really need to stress is how scared I am of actually getting help. I can see no way to overcome this fear. I couldn't say anything to my parents, school counselors, friends, siblings; I am comfortable reaching out to no one, especially not medical professionals. Even hotline people terrify me.

Please help me help myself.
