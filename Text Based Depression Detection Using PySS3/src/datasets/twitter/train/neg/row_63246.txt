Do you think it's like a dream?Recently I've been having the strangest dreams. Every night I dream that theres... someone with me. Someone who loves me and who I love. Through my unconscious mind I have come to know a warmth and fulfillment I could never have imagined before. When I wake up I feel as though there's a void within me; one that has always been there but is now made known with a vengeance. Imagine having a wound heal only to have the stitches ripped out over and over, every day a slap in the face.


I tried once before. It didn't work and I felt a little better for a while. I know now that this is the right choice. Not everyone can have a good life, ya know? Goodnight.


Think death is like a dream? I hope so. It's my best shot right now.
