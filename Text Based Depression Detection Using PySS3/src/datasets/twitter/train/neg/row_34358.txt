Addicted to sadnessI wanted to kill myself this morning. Things go better. I'm happy now. I'm happy right now, but I want the sadness with me. It comforts me, in a weird way. I'm starting to understand how to be happy again, but the depression is trying to pull me back. If I cry anymore throughout the day, they'll all be more disappointed. I'll get more detentions. I'm taking a baby steps. I've never been so relieved when one of my doctors said there may come a time when homeschool would be necessary. 

I'm supposed to be happy. I've got a roof over my head, I have no family problems. Just problems with myself. I feel so sad for the people who have worse problems than me. Good luck to everyone, though.

I'm hanging on. Not for me, but for my family. 

People are disappointed in me. I haven't told them I'm depressed again. All I do is cry. If I do that again, I'll get in trouble. School is not a place to cry. 

My grades are raising. I turned in some work. 

I need to be happy, but I'm not.

There's a demon inside me. I never want to go out anymore. All I do is sit in my room thinking how easy it would be to take all the pills. Jump in front of a truck. Hurt myself. I'm hoping this will all be over after high school. I'm having my doubts, but I won't know till then.


The sadness is addicting. Please tell me if anyone else feels the same.
