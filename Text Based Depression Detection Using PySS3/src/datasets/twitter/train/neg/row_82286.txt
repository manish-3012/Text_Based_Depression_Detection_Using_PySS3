Solving modern problems with modern solutionsSomething I had not noticed about this Reddit for a long time is that it's usually suicidal people giving advice or trying to help out another suicidal person, and in my opinion, I think this is the way things should be in real life. In many cases, you go to a therapist that most likely has not felt anything close to what you have felt, but talking to people that truly understand your standpoint is probably what has kept a whole lot of people on this Reddit alive today. There is something about relating to someone that makes me feel better about myself in a way. I'm sure people have said this entire speech quite a lot but idk, just a thought.
