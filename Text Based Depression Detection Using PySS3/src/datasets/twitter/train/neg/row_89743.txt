Feeling it pretty bad today.Just wanted to pop in again and see how everyone's doing. I sat in my car in the Taco Bell parking lot today, and I couldn't shake the absolute hopelessness. I couldn't even bring myself to turn on music, or roll the windows down, I just sat there, and thought about killing myself with my car exhaust. How's everybody else's day going? I need some conversation to keep my mind off it.
