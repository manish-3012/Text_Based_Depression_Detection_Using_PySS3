Im pregant and i hate my life.Nobody cares about me except for my mother and father and my sweet little brother,  i feel so alone..  I feel like i cant control my emotions..  I have been arguing with my bf a lot and it makes me feel soo suicidal.  I hate being alive.. I wish i can just give birth so i could just die and stop feeling like this!!  Is it normal to be happy and then get into an argument and it switch completely.  I hate feeling like this..  I feel like my head is going to explode and like i want to scream my lungs out and scream and just never stop!!!!  Why couldnt i just never been born..
