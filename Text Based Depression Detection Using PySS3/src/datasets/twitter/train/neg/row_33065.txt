Just thoughts"Life is a slope. As long as you're going up you're always looking towards the top and you feel happy, but when you reach it, suddenly you can see the road going downhill and death at the end of it all. It's slow going up and quick going down. "

Guy de Maupassant, Bel-Ami

I think i've reached my goal.
Can't think anything about future and want to do nothing.
I just want to die with happy moments i've ever had.

World is beautiful, but i don't belong there.

Sorry for the messed up post.
