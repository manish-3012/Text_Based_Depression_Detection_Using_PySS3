Never thought I would be posting here.Over the last few days I've steadily started to feel worse and worse which has got me to this point of wanting to say fuck it because I can't handle it anymore. I know deep down I don't want to do this but I don't see things getting better. I don't want to talk to my girlfriend about this because I'm feeling really shut out by her. I've never felt this low in my life. I'm making this post on my phone so I apologize for any bad grammar or typos.
