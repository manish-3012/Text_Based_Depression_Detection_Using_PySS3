I can't switch my thoughts offI got ill over Christmas and at the same time I broke up with someone who I hadn't been seeing very long. 

She seemed like the perfect person and I asked what her thoughts were on taking it a step forward (we were only seeing each other). At this question she says that she can't do this and that's it, over. Nothing up until this point had gone wrong, she had sent me really nice messages and voice mail literally telling me that she really really liked me. I've had break ups before but I can't shake this one even though it was such a short romance. I feel like I will never meet anyone quite like her again ever. 

I can't get her out my head. Due to illness (norovirus) I lost almost 2 stone in weight and had trouble sleeping for about 10 days. I had thoughts on ending it all. At the point I started thinking about how I would do it and the best way to do it I went to the doctor for help. I'm on antidepressants at the moment (begins with c but can't remember the name). I've been on them for about 12 days now. I was having trouble sleeping and I was given sleeping tablets. I still keep waking up. Went back to the doctor and they took them away and refused to give me anything as it would make the problem worse. 

I've been feeling better (just that I want it to end, not how I will end it) but recently I massively can't sleep, less than two hours. 

2 days ago I found out I would more than likely be made redundant at the end of February and since then I can't sleep and the thoughts are driving me crazy, I just want them to stop. I have no appetite, no drive, no will to carry on anymore. 

I don't really know why I'm posting this, I guess I just want to vent and cry and throw up and it all to go away. I wish the antidepressants actually made me feel happy again
