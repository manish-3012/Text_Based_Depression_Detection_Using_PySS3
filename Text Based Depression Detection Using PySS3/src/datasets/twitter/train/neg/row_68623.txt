I don't wanna die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at allI feel so connected with this life form Bohemian Rhapsody. I don't wanna die because I know that it would just take the pain from me and give it to the people around me. At the same time I don't want to live, the days where I'm sad and stressed are so much more than the days where I'm happy. So the only solution it would have been to not be born at all. (ironically, I'm a accident, my parents didn't really expect a baby when I was born, so I really should be born)
