QuestionDoes it ever get better? I tried to off myself tonight idk it's like 4 or 5 am as I'm typing this ( I'm sobbing so sorry if there's any typo.)) I feel like such a coward. 

Life or my life at least, seem so pointless, or I'm just numb. I've been dealing with depression for years, I've tried and tried way too many times to "fix myself" for the ones I care about. But man is it worth it? When nobody really cares about anyone else. Been dealing for years silently,  Just to not make people around me go through the ordeal of dealing with losing someone to suicide. I know that sucks a ton and it F you upp. 

I don't know what to do anymore, got no one to talk to really, I just. .feel so lost. I did everything that I was supposed to and more, at home, been a straight A's student throughout school and college, being the funny one with "friends" and for what?
 
Now things that used to bring me joy, well, they don't. I just feel so miserable. That honestly I just haven't gone through with it cause of my mum and my dog. (F23). So is it worth it? Does it ever gets better? Or I gotta try and muster the courage off of somewhere and be done with it?
