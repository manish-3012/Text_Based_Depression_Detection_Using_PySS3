i'm tryinghi, i'm sorry if my writing is bad, i have a headache and i feel dizzy. today i tried to hang myself.
the reason i didn't succeed was because of the method that i used. when i did a research, i read a lot that i was going to feel some discomfort but i would also black out in about 10 seconds. i didn't have anywhere to do it the traditional way, so i had to get creative and that's why i was able to get out of the rope. the problem is that i didn't black out, i'm not sure how many seconds i was on the rope but it felt like forever, i couldn't breathe and i was trying everything to get air, i was feeling a lot of pressure in my face. it was so painful that i somehow had the strength to brake free. i don't understand why i ended up backing out of it, when i was sure i was ready. i know that if i chose this i shouldn't be complaining about pain. i've been with depression and anxiety since i was a teen, it's now been ten years since it started and i only just keep making everything worse. i finally had a job, i moved out from my parents, but now i don't have a job anymore, i have a lot of things that i need to pay, my depression and anxiety got worse and it's difficult for me to go outside. i don't know what i'm supposed to do. i don't have anyone to talk about what else i'm supposed to do, the reason i moved out is because my parent wanted to live on their own, said it's too difficult to live with someone else. i stopped talking with everyone that i knew. i'm lazy, irresponsible, liar in some cases, i would go on but the bottom of it is that i'm probably the thing that i hate the most. when i try to do the right thing i only end up making everything worse. i don't know what to do.
