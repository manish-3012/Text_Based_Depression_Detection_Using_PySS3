I don't know, just ventingSo, yeah, not sure what to write here really. I'm 23. I have 0 friends (literally 0), I've never kissed anyone or been on a date and am obviously a virgin too. I just live with my mother, have no other family. I work a shit no-skilled job that I hate, but I try and work as many hours as possible because I hate having spare time. I have no hobbies, I just waste time on the internet and watch TV. I'm probably not going to do anything in fairness, I've looked up suicide methods but have talked myself out of all of them in case they hurt or I fail and get brain damage. I'm too much of a coward to even do that. So yeah.
