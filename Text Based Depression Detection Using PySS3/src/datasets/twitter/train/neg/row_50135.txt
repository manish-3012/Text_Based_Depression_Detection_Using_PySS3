17yoM... Hoping it gets better.I don't want to go into too much detail about my lonely life. There's so much pain, and hurt, it would take too long.
I keep praying that it gets better, and that's the only reason I haven't tried to commit suicide yet. Or maybe it's because I'm a coward.
The problem that I'm having right now is worrying about my future. I became aware of my families money problems at twelve. I remember being happy in grade nine, but after that us just became too much. I got a job in Grade Ten, and have been working since. My dad wants me to stop, as it's affected my grades since I started, but I can't. I need to help provide. I feel like a burden to everyone around me. My family loves me, but in fits of anger the truth comes out. They tell me all the terrible things I think about myself. They make me feel worthless. They don't mean it, but I never forget. 
I just want it to end. I have no money for university. I have no future. No girlfriend. No confidence. No happiness. Nothing.
