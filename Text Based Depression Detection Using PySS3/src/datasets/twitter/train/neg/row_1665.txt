Death and GuiltWe just lost a family friend to cancer, he's been sick and deteriorating for a while. Similarly to how my grandpa passed earlier this year, I watched him for weeks go from coherent to incoherent to barely there to the last hours. Watched the bottom of his feet turn purple slowly until his complexion turned yellow and his last breath a were inconsistent and shallow.  I couldn't not be there with him but it definitely traumatized me.  I tried to use that image and that experience to light my life torch but that was in March and I'm still really deep in this hole.  I really do feel like a prisoner to my own mind. And then today to hear our family friend went in a similar way. I just feel like a wasted life like a waste of space, why am I not having fun?  Life should be fun I think, I hope it gets more fun relatively soon.  I don't want to live like this for long, and I'm really trying hard to get better.  My eyes are so heavy and it's not even that often I can fake a smile anymore.  What's wrong with me, and I know you're all going to comment that there's nothing wrong with me, but there clearly has to be.  Something's wrong with my brain. And nobody cares or believes me, people think I create my own misery but I've had a lot of trauma and I think I've just lost a little of my natural resilience to life's unpredictable events.  I'm scared I will die alone, I don't want to.  Hope y'all are doing okay tonight.  Still breathing
