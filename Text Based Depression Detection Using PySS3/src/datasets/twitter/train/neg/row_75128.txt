Goodbye, everybodyAbusive dad. Bullying. Being a wimp because I never had a father figure in my childhood. Never getting to fuck the girls I wanted to fuck. Never having a say in anything because I'm too weak to step up.

Three tours in Iraq. Killed people who tried killing me. Saw those people kill my friends. Lost both legs to a roadside IED. Wanted to become a physician but dreams are exactly that - a fantasy and not something achievable. Spent 10 years in prison after cops ransacked my home and found 5 grams of weed. 

I grow tired of wading through this hell every day. I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, and I have a 9mm ready to get the job done - quick and clean. 

Fuck this place.
