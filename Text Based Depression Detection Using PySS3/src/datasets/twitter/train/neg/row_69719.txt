Idk what I must do. BOTH LIVING AND DYING AREN'T EASYSo, I've been suffering in a toxic household. The effects of it on me are a sudden fall in grades, social anxiety, feeling bad about myself, and extremely low self-esteem. I am considering suicide as an option for a year now. Sometimes I get very depressed and start hurting myself. But now, I think death could solve all my problems. Honestly, my parents wouldn't care if am dead, but if I somehow survive I will suffer my entire life. I am 17 now.

I did a lot of research before my first attempt of hanging. But I retreated. Later I read a lot of articles on paralysis due to suicidal hanging. Right now I am confused...Whether I must live or die. I have no one to even cry or vent out. I just hug my pillow tightly and move to a corner of my bed and cry the shit out. I feel ashamed of myself. I just want to die. NOTHING ELSE. I am ready to accept and tolerate the pain but I don't want to survive the attempt.
