A Truly Complete FailureI don't even know what to do anymore, I'm a complete failure. I'm 19 years old and I haven't accomplished anything of worth, You read this and you think i'm exaggerating and being over dramatic like everyone else says i am but i have no future. I tried to join the Navy when i graduated from high school because i wanted to show people that i could succeed, I didn't even last 24 hours before I cried like a bitch and got sent home with a uncharacterized discharge. That was back in December of last year. I have never had any real friends, My parents are ashamed of me and tell me a 19 year old shouldn't be living at home. I have heard them talking about throwing me out. I have a learning disability in mathematics, I am trying to get an associates in computer science and then transfer to to get a bachelor's and then go into programming but people tell me i'm wasting my time and i'm going to regret it when i have to start taking calculus and other advanced courses that are required. Because of my discharge I have been told I will never work for the government or for any company that does contracted work for the government.

I can't find a job, I can't even get a interview anywhere. My sister makes fun of me and tells me she won't end up a failure like me, I do not have the money to go to state after i get my associates, I don't have a driver's licence and i walk to school like a ten year old. I fell in love with a girl who lives in Denver but that's a complicated story but to make it short she recently told me she can't do long distance and she complains to me about her problems and says that her friends have it worse than me and i'm just sad. I had to cut this down a lot to just save everyone some time butâ€¦ maybe when i'm gone things will get better for my family without another useless mouth to feed, I figure the only thing i can do right at this point is just end it and do a service to society by not existing anymore.
