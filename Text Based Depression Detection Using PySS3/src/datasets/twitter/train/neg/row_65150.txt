All the suffering broke me.I'm going through hell, often having vivid nightmares and paralyzing anxiety. My lifestyle is too addictive but it's not something that humans have evolved to live like. That's one problem. 

An even greater one is that economy will collapse in five to ten years, wars will break out on top of plagues and the first mass extermination event on Earth will rapidly unfold in the centuries to come. There's no point putting in any effort trying to be a better person. 

I just don't care about anything anymore. I don't care about how much suffering I cause or live through. I don't care about doing good work. The only way I can maintain my sanity is that I don't consider bad bad and good good anymore. 

Things are worthless, my feelings and pain are worthless, no asinine mortal is able to help. I will go on for some time, no matter how long and then kill myself no matter what way. 

I used to be angry and scared, now I'm just pre-dead.
