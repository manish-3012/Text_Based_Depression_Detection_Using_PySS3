Insomnia making me suicidalIâ€™ve had insomnia ever since I can remember but the past two months I just havenâ€™t slept. Here and there I get a couple hours. I wanna die. I canâ€™t take this anymore. I have tried just about every sleeping medication there is. Nothing works. Iâ€™m in therapy. She doesnâ€™t understand what Iâ€™m going through. Iâ€™m to the point where Iâ€™m becoming paranoid and delusional. No one can help me. I donâ€™t wanna traumatize anyone though, especially my sweet husband. I constantly think about suicide. Even fantasize about it sometimes. I just would love to die... when Iâ€™m sleeping. Wouldnâ€™t that be nice. I could finally get some sleep.
