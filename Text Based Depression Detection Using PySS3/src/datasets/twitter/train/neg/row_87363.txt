I need help, and I have literally no one to talk toFirst of all, I'm not the one wanting to die, its my wife. Shes been depressed for quite some time now. She told me around 3 years ago that life doesn't seem worth living, the world is an evil place, and she wants to die. She told me she can't do suicide because shes scared of it, but she just wants to die.

She broke down really bad last night. Just cried and cried. Begging me to let her die, to figure out a way for her to just stop living. I started crying with her because of course, I don't want her to die. She is literally all I have. We don't have kids, just 3 cats. I don't have many friends, maybe 2 that I can seriously talk to, and they live out of state and work all the time.

I don't know who I can talk to about this. I need help. I need to know what to tell her. She quit her therapy today. We can't afford insurance for her and so we can't get antidepressants for her. She got a bag from her grandma or mom, but I don't think she is going to take them.

Please help me. I'm terrified that shes going to OD herself or something.
