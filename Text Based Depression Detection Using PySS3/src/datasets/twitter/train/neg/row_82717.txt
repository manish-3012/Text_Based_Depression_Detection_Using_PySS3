Just feel like I never had a chance...I don't know why I'm wasting anyone's time... I'm too much of a pussy to off myself... but I've spent the last decade or so wanting to, and every time I start to feel better, it's just that much worse to feel like this again. I've seen four different therapists, finally found one I like... but it's still not helping much.

I was born into a shitty situation. That apparently wasn't enough, because I've had so much shit dumped on me... I can't even count the things that have happened to me, that, individually, are enough to fuck a person up for life. And it's just made me feel like... how am I ever going to dig myself out of this? 

I don't know... any bored and want to talk?
