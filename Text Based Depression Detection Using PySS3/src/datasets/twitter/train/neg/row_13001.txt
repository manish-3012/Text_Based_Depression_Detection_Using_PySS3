Why has Death Now Not Become Me -__-. Living in A lie of worldsHey all, not here to vent, but I keep trying to find reasons, to live, yes that fear of the unknown, keeps my weak self at bay from "The moment". I realized that the reason death would not take me was because, I myself was too afraid of what would come next, or really can it be true that a part of me wanted to live, because at least, we know what comes next there. Everything about me screams distruction, from a child to growing up or maybe I haven't since I'm here. There are real people who Actually deserve help and love and trust and life, but fuck if i just could have the courage to slit my throat, and donate anything useful to  society at least then, I will have actually given back.
