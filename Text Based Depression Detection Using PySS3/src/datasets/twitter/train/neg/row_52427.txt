Just a lurking teenager hereI don't know why we struggle so much around this age, man. Recently that empty feeling hits me again and the questions of "what's point of me living" crawl back. At some AM hours when I get up and do homework they don't help my poor concentration at all. At a result I couldn't get anything done. Tried reach out to friends and parents but the responses aren't helping. 
I couldn't explain to people at all. I'm not angry nor holding a grudge at anyone. I just feel like there's no reason for me to exist.
"I know you can do it, you're just slacking off". Sure, I can play along and be a straight As student. Be a good kid. Be a kind friend. But I couldn't stop thinking if I really could make use of anything. Or what is the point of doing this. If I'm really to go away, I truly believe everyone would be much happier. Minus negativities and burdens to them. 
I'm calm and I will be fine during the day. But it will come to the point when I'll go back to my little suicide plan and other self harm methods. 
I'm stuck in this endless circle and I'm tired.
Everyone says that I'm a sensitive kid. I wish I could stop overthinking and make a drama of everything.... 
I don't know if I should talk to my teachers or try one last time talking to another friend.
I really need help but at the same time my problems aren't just significant enough to worth other's attention.
