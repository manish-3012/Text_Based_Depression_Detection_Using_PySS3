Today's my birthday and I want it to be my deathdayHere's some context: I turned 12 today and have an abusive mom, my parents are divorced and she has custody my brother died and my life sucks. Also school is boring and sometimes I forget about class and do something else.

Ok so basically I woke up at 5 today and remembered it's my birthday cool. Then I just lay down and do nothing for a while until I come down at 10. My mom's been getting closer to finding out that I lie about anything since I'm scared of her. Later she got an email from my teacher saying I didn't do an assignment, so she got mad and screamed at me for an hour, nothing too bad just calling me stuff I already know I am.

Then checked this computer and saw I watched a little youtube (Thankfully I remember to use incognito for reddit) Instead of some work

So now I'm dead to her, I already get in enough trouble for forgetting one of my chores. I know this is my fault but suicide feels like the better option. I just don't know a good way to, I litterally found reddit a few days ago searching up how to painlessly kill yourself.

The worst part is I have nobody to talk to, nobody actually cares and I know my life is going to get better but not good. I also don't want to wait 6 years just for an occaisonal good day.

So happy birthday to me
