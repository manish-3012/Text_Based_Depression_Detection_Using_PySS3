I'm not going into work tonight but killing myself instead.I've openly admitted to people in my life that im a worthless loser and that I deserve to die. I've told them I plan to kill myself and nobody cares so tonight I am finally going to do it.

My life has been leading up to this point and nothing goes right for me. I have no friends, no family members that care. Nobody. I wasted 6 years trying and failing at what I wanted to do in life and now it's basically over for me.

Tonight is the night.
