contemplating suicide after break up..My Boyfriend Recently broke up with me... And I just feel so lost. We went from talking about marriage and having a baby send me messing up and him breaking up with me for it.I just feel so sad and alone and that I messed up don't want forever feels responsible for it. He was a great guy and don't think I can ever find someone like him. I'm pretty sure I will do it tonight, just scared as its so final.
