RantThere was a post circulating about a dad cradling his daughter after a suicide attempt. The replies were to be expected but it still infuriated me to read. People think they are just so fucking helpful or feel they have some fucking higher knowledge about suicide that no one else has ever thought of. â€œThink of your family.â€ or â€œDonâ€™t be selfish.â€ Itâ€™s fucking exhausting listening to people reiterate elementary mental health advice from Sesame Street. Of course it will effect your family but donâ€™t you realize by the time the person buys the rope, they are way past thinking about that. I know this is rant but Iâ€™m just so tired. Iâ€™m tired of trying to live my life the same while Iâ€™m crumbling under the weight of my mental health from all the years before. My family is useless and prayer isnâ€™t going. Religion isnâ€™t something that has helped, actually has done the opposite. I hate knowing that I will live is degenerate sexual lifestyle that will send me to Hell if I ever act on it. I am very lonely person and feel so untouchable. No one has ever wanted me to be there. My family are the only one that are around me yet I am trying to distance myself from them. The only reason I donâ€™t go is for my family, unfortunately enough. I would also feel terrible knowing how many people want to live or be in my place. Itâ€™s a terrible struggle so I just hate it when people bring it up like itâ€™s a piece of new knowledge. This is all over the place but I fear for my time on this Earth. I wish I was born normal so I wouldnâ€™t have to go through being inferior. I wish I was normal so I could just blindly believe in something greater like the rest of my family. My family cannot help me and I have no one. I am disgusted by myself.
