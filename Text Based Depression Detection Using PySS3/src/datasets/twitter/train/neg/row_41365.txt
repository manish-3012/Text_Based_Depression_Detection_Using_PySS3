Still sufferingHey guys! Remember me? I actually starting to stay away from Earthbound related websites and quitting them for good. 

Also I have an coloring app which makes me calm down or just to spend my time away from real life.

But things doesn't seem go really well these days, as I'm taking a prescription medication that can cause hallucinations, and I'm not really sure if I'm really immune to them.

Also, I can't really find anything helpful to make me feel calm, and I feel like Giygas is trying to kill me for some reason (although the recent dream during my sleep about playing virtual reality with not much color and random three-dimensional shapes are a good sign that I'm in a good progress of deleting the trauma)

I say I have at least 10% left of the trauma left in me for 4 months. But I need to be at least 100% clean before going to New York for vacation.

I have identified a few triggers and also how the trauma won't flow into my mind.

1. Trauma always appear when negative emotions emerge.
2. Enjoying my favorite music in the shower is a good way to not get triggered.
3. Trauma doesn't appear when I feel sleepy.
4. Trauma appears when I wake up in the middle of the night and not sure if it will attack me in the middle of the night (since I experience that in my dreams my middle school classmates are trying to drown me)
5. Trauma sometime appears when I dwell too long.

At least I still have my beloved Hyakuya Mikaela. Without him, I won't survive for like 4 months (counting from April 15). He is the almighty comforter to me because he gives me the positive energy to continue on.
