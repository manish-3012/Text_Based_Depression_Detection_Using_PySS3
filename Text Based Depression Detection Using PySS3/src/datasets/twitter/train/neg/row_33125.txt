Living in a van could be the only way to save my LifeIt's a conclusion I've been arriving to for the past 6 years, it seems. 

One one hand, if I killed myself, I wouldn't have to worry about waking up every morning doing some shitty 9-5 job anymore .. 

.. or alternatively, if I killed myself, I wouldn't have to bear the shame of living on welfare, either.

However, if I could live in a stealth van, and simply avoid attracting any attention from authorities, driving around the country.. that would probably be the only way I could survive without a steady income, and without having to take welfare.

I know I'm not mentally ill, I just can't cope with a job. Having a job feels so unnatural, my hunter gatherer instincts are screaming Nope .. every morning I wake up. 

I've been fired god knows how many times .. I've even been fired from voluntary jobs. I have trouble focusing on basic tasks .. I get distracted really easy. I'm a daydreamer. 

Food is extremely cheap, but rent isn't.. by a ratio of almost 1 to 10 or so. 

I'd have to turn my cat into an indoor cat, but that would be okay since I'd have more time to play with her, and she has had leash training.

I don't look like a homeless person .. always dress well, always moisturize, wear my makeup when going somewhere nice, shave my legs. Most people think I'm a college student.

What scares me most about suicide is not knowing what lies beyond. There is no radio signal you could ever transmit that would allow you to retrieve information about that which lies beyond. 

This world may be a living hell, a curse.. but at least it's a world I'm familiar with, and there's a lot of things I want to accomplish yet. If only I had enough money ....
