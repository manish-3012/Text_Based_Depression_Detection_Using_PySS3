Giving up.I live in ontario, have chronic pain in my hip down to my foot now. life has been hell for 3 years and the last 4 months worse with new pains coming everynow and then. I give up, all the doctor visits and this and that to be no where. i have spent so much money on soany different things that im not going anywhere in life. im only 23 and i really wish i had the guts to end it all. thats where this comes in, i can go for another 3 hours telling my life story and why ive come this far but im not. I was wondering about assisted suicide, no doctor has actually diagnosed me because no doctor has cared enough to label whatever is bothering me. I get brushed off like im the next guy in line.  How do I get help ending my misery.. every second of my life is pain..
