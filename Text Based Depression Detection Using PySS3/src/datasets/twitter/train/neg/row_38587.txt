I donâ€™t know what to doiâ€™ve always been pretty distant from my feelings since middle school and i hate talking about my feelings, at least to people i know, because i feel so awkward doing so and idk why but i just hate it. 

Even though iâ€™m not particularly sad, iâ€™m still miserable and i donâ€™t know why to that either, i just want to die, i just donâ€™t want to be here, iâ€™m too tired and not motivated to do anything. Sure iâ€™ve grown up in a house with an abusive father, and you would think i would hate being here or be upset when he yells or calls me worthless and such and that would be a reason iâ€™m always thinking about suicide, but i donâ€™t think it is, because i have no feelings towards him, i donâ€™t really care whether iâ€™m home with him or not, i donâ€™t really care what he says or i donâ€™t even care when he says things to my family and they cry about it, of course i have feelings of some sort but i just feel like iâ€™ve always been really apathetic to everything around me and now iâ€™m stuck because i canâ€™t talk about me wanting to die or my issue with self harming cause i feel too awkward to talk about anything. 

whenever iâ€™m asked by my mom or something i always lie as well, not because i want to but because it feels too awkward and weird to talk to her about my thoughts and such. two years ago i also attempted by overdosing and because the pills i took meds up memory i lied and said i just didnâ€™t remember. even so i was sent to a therapist who i have also continued to lie to and now heâ€™s telling me iâ€™m pretty much good and he doesnâ€™t really know where to go from here and i only have appointments like 3 times a year with him now.

my one close friend that i have iâ€™ve also avoided talking to about how i feel all 12 years iâ€™ve known her, i was thinking about telling her about some things but tonight she told me sheâ€™s rather die than talk to me about her feelings because itâ€™s weird and sheâ€™s also wanna die if i tried to talk to her about my feelings

something is just really really wrong with me, i feel so alone but i did this myself so arenâ€™t i the problem? i donâ€™t want to be asked by people i know whatâ€™s going on, and i also donâ€™t wanna talk to someone i know about whatâ€™s going on, i donâ€™t even know if i want help, i just know thatâ€™s what iâ€™m supposed to do. wouldnâ€™t it just be better if i was gone though ?
