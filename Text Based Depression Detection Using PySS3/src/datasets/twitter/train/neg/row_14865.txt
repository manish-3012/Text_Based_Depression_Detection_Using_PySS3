if you are sad and alone, read this.i wake up everyday and look online for a part time job that fits my studying schedule, i looked and searched and called lots of people, recruiters would call me and ask for my cv and i never hear from them again. never got a call back. i try everyday to find a way to make money, new business, selling stuff online, they didn't work so far. its been about a year give or take that i do this everyday, i feel so sad that i can't support my family and have to wait till i get my degree, it kills my slowly that i can't be helpful, it hurts me to see my parents unable to buy things they like or own a house. i never told them that i do this everyday, look online for jobs or basically a way to get money. it is very hard to do this alone, and i feel like at the end of a disappointing day i feel like I'm crawling and trying to survive, no matter how hard it is, how low i am, if my feet are broken and all i can do is claw my way, i will. never stop moving even if its  a fucking empty, dark, hard ground, shitty lonely street,  there is always a destination.
