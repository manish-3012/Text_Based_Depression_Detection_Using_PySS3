My life is coming to an end. I can feel itIm getting really tired. I've become way more depressed than I've ever been. People at my work advised me to go home as I'm not functioning well. I work in retail and been getting complaints about my depressed look from customers and co workers. Had some woman tell me "cheer up. Life isn't that bad" which annoyed me.. im seriously at wits end. 

I attempted suicide at 17 years old and the only reason i lived is because the bathroom light cord that I attempted to hang myself from snapped. After I survived.. ill admit. I felt hopeful about my future. 8 years later and not much has changed. I 
Wish i would of died.

Sure I got a job that im well liked at. I have a lot of concerned friends and my loving family but I just can't seem to go on. I was able to attempt suicide before.. I should be able to do it again and hopefully this time be successful. I seriously don't see any reason to carry on.

I was thinking about sliting my own throat with a knife, overdosing on paracetamols or hanging myself with a rope i bought online.
