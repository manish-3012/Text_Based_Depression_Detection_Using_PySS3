Tomorrow is the day I'll finally get to say goodbye to my endless painTomorrow, when I wake up I'll take a long walk to my local bridge. It has got railings to prevent people from jumping off, but it should be easy enough to climb over.
Then I'll jump, and all my pain will finally be gone.

Bye world, bye Reddit. Hope y'all can live your lives as I apparently can't.
