idk what to do anymore :/iâ€™m so so tired of life right now. iâ€™m only 18 but iâ€™ve had so many traumatic experiences throughout my childhood and because of that, ive been diagnosed with anxiety and depression ever since i was in elementary school. recently iâ€™ve also been diagnosed with an eating disorder so my mental health is just so messed up right now. for the past 2 weeks iâ€™ve been crying myself to sleep hoping i could just sleep forever and never wake up because life is too much for me. iâ€™m really losing hope every single day and i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll ever get better and finally live a normal life with a stable health. im so tired of having suic!dal thoughts and i need help but i donâ€™t know where and how to find help thatâ€™s gonna make me better
