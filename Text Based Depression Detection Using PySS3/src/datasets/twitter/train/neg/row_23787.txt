Life is too stressful and i have a hard time living through itWishing myself dead without having the courage to go through with it is a recurring theme in my life. There have been 3 peaks up to now.

 1) high school. Too young and stupid to think up a plan, but i tried to hold my breath or sleep under a lot of blankets in hopes i'd manage to asphyxiate myself.

2) when i learned my gf was pregnant. Yeah, say it i'm a shitty human being. But it didn't happen the way i wanted it to happen. It was a surprise. But i managed to live through it. That night i actually rolled a good 15 minutes in the incoming traffic lane on the highway because i plain didnt care for 15 minutes. I had many plans.

3) right now. My gf isn't feeling so hot. We now have 2 kids. She wants to quit her job and become a stay at home parent. But above, the potential of me losing my job in the coming month, not being able to find a new job, trying to manage to raise 2 kids and above all the financial stress of her not working. 

I wish i could just stand up, take measures and manage my emotions but i can't. I get angry. I try not to let myself take it out on the kids, but yes, sometimes the smallest thing will make me overreact.

I feel like shit, i can't make anyone happy, i know people care about me but the only thing i know how to do is to push people away. I'm even trying to push my kids away from me even if during my good days they make me insanely happy.

I have many plans, falling asleep in my garage with both cars working, haning myself from the balcony, hammer  to my head u til i pass out. Even the roof at my workplace is always unlocked and never told anyone.

I just never have the courage to go through. I'm scared for my kids. I'm scared for my gf, my parents. But holy fuck i want to die.
