Finally got closure.The girl I'm madly in love finally rejected me after many times of telling her to tell me. I think I can finally end it all. I just needed to.know she didn't love me. She cares about me but I can't continue doing this. The pain is starting to really hurt and now that I have closure I can leave with relief at the very least.
