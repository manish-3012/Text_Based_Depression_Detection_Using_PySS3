Please help meI have been with my boyfriend for 2 years (long distance relationship) and he is now telling me he wants space and I am so scared of my feelings.
My dad left when I was young, my grandad did the same later on and I have been brought up watching my mum in very unhealthy relationships so trusting someone how I trusted my partner was a a huge step.
We have been arguing a lot recently because I havenâ€™t felt wanted by him and am constantly too needy.
He told me that he doesnâ€™t want me to rely on him for my happiness and visa versa which is true but I honestly canâ€™t cope without him and I cant see how this separation will do us any good.
We have gone from being in calls constantly to not speaking properly for days.
He tells me he wants space but then messages me saying he misses me and loves me and I just canâ€™t deal with all of these contradicting feelings and messages.
My mum just moved out the same week that this started so I live alone and donâ€™t have many friends that I can actually talk to because I have been so focussed on my romantic relationship for so long.
I just want to be with hjm
I just want everything to go back to being okay
I am so scared of the thoughts that Iâ€™m having and I just really need some support before I do something selfish 
I canâ€™t stop crying and Iâ€™m resorting to what I know to be unhealthy coping mechanisms 
Please someone help me
