She screwed up.Guys, this girl I like screwed up and left the school i was in because she liked the other school better. It's super fucking ghetto over there, and she cant take it. Shes pretty much anti-social and she doesn't want to change her ways just to be in the "in" crowd. She has made friends with my friends but two friends ain' t enough. She doesn't have anyone besides me, and right now i hate her because, well she "broke my heart" and led me on. they don't teach her shit over there in the other school so she is failing some of her classes and she cant go to her parents because she convinced them to enroll her in the new school and they don't want to hear complaining about the new school. She got to the point of crying in bathroom stalls and thoughts of just ending it all. I'm no therapist so i really need y'all s help on this. If you need any additional information please just ask.
