DAE feel like they could sense when someone is preparing to walk out of their life?At this point I try not to think about the good memories i have with people in my life because i know theyâ€™re leaving. Itâ€™s probably for the best tho, theyâ€™re just trying to get rid of a walking dumpster fire. 

I just wished they could come up with better excuses. You know, something other than the old â€œI just feel like we are at a different place in our life...â€ , â€œI donâ€™t want to feel like I HAVE to do x and x...â€ 

If you want to leave me just fucking leave.
