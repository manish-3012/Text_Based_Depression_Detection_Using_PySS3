no clue what to doI've got to the point where I have no idea what to do. I just don't want to go on. Every night I close my eyes hoping that I don't wake again, I drink myself into a stupor half the time just to shut up my brain, for that self-deprecating amusement being drunk gives me. And I can feel myself getting to a point where it goes from hoping to trying. Thoughts of what happens to my family and friends no longer make me feel as guilty as before. When I'm driving I look at trees and think about how easy it would be to just swerve and wrap my car around one. 

And I don't know why. I look at other people's posts and feel worthless. Because I haven't had a hard life. I don't have reasons to feel like this. At the worst I'm trapped in a uni course I hate, but I can't go home and I can't leave because my accommodation is linked with being a student and I can't afford to rent privately without my student loan, I live with the gf who broke up with me  over a month ago who also happens to be my best friend. I lost another best friend of sorts in the spring... But really, my family are nice, I have a small circle of close friends. My student debt is relatively small and its the UK so it hardly matters what with the repayment scheme here. I have three jobs, all of which I don't hate. Yet I still feel this utter loathing for my entire existence.

The whole world is closing in and all I want to do is run, run to the other side of the galaxy. Which isn't possible for obvious reasons. And what other way out is there, what other way is there to escape the daily anxiety attacks, the inability to get up in the mornings. The constant pain and hate.
