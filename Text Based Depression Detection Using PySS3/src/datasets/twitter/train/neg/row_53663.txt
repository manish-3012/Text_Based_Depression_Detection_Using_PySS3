This fucking hurtsI feel like everyday I relive my childhood trauma. Itâ€™s unfair, I never asked to be born. I feel so unlovable. Guys just view me as a nut and thatâ€™s so fucking painful. It reminds me of my older brother who fucking raped me multiple times during my childhood. How fucked is that? The only time I got â€œaffectionâ€ during my childhood was when my brother was literally raping me. And now Iâ€™m older and the same story repeats itself. I want to be the girl someone cares about but guys just donâ€™t care. I want more, I want to be the girl they take home to meet their family. MEN ARE EVIL. This world is evil too. I hate it here.
