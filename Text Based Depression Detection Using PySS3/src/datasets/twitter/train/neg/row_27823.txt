I've done the work. I've committed t o the therapy. Years after, still f#$ked in the head. Doesn't feel like I have a lot of options leftWent to intensive outpatient with hospital program. Few years later, went to intensive outpatient DBT therapy for 8 months that included weekly group plus individual therapy. Hours and hours of personal therapy since then. A lot of progress but plateau'ed. Losing my job (again) due to behavioral issues (aka: I'm an asshole that no one likes) and my marriage is struggling. Lost all the friends I made past few years due to this too.

Only thing keeping me from giving up is my son. And the fact that suicide is so selfish. But those arguments are wearing thin at this date. Exhausted. And feeling that no matter what I do, I always end up here anyhow.

Both my mother, father and sister are mentally disturbed/depressed/malfunctioning. Feels like I'm fighting an unwinnable battle genetically.

Exhausted. Tired of decades of fighting when i always end up here anyhow.
