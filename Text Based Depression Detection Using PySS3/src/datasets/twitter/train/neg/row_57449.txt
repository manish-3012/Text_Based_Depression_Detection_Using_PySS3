If my life doesn't improve until 30 august I will commit suicide.Brief story about myself:
I am male 24 years old. I have self diagnosed myself with Avoidant Personality Disorder and Dependent Personality Disorder. I had a difficult childhood and I grow up in a dysfunctional family. 
I am working in a job I hate, I am living with my parents I hate more than anything, I am alone having no friends/girlfriend. 
My mental issues and depression is stoping me from improving myself. I am currently working on getting a driving linces.

If I have not made any singel improvement for my situation within 30 august, I will end my life.

Suicide: I will go deep into the forest where my body will be hard to find. I will stab my heart with a knife. If I fail to stab my heart and will just keep on stabbing till I bleed out.
