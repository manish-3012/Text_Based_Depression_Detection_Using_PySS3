Just a little trick to feel a little better :)) (also me venting real quick)Okay okay, i don't have much time for this because i have a huge amount of work to catch up on and its already late but here me out. So recently life's been crap (no sh\*t ik ik), for loads of people, whether its before the pandemic happened or during, we're all pretty stressed out. As privildged as it might sound since in the end i have it easy, i've been struggling too with part time online school, self harm and failling classes, dealing with mental health issues and just a bunch of random bad stuff. So tonight i was crying really bad over my grades, my  family and my life and i realised i wasn't even able to cry like a normal person anymore because of how much i've forced myself not to cry in the past. That's when the train of suicidal thoughts hit again and i reminded myself it'd all be easier if i just left. My brain then wandered and i imagined if one of the people i love the most did the same thing and it really hurt, it hurt so bad to think i wouldn't be able to see them anymore, even if they're not that close to me considering it all. It hurt i wouldn't be able to see them walk, talk and make eye contact with them, it hurt i wouldn't be able to hug them (in my head, let's stay covid proof here. Or just hug them after the pandemic / when its safe). Now i imagined what if someone (i don't know who but still) felt like  that about me ? Like i mentionned i'm not that close with them.. so idk if it can help anyone but next time you're really down... try to stay alive,  ik its hard, but just in case someone you can't think of immediatly, someone you barely know, might miss you so hard and so bad when you leave. You might think no one would but.. sometimes those thoughts blind us, and there's a little someone hoping they'll make your day, someone you don't know really wishes to see you. So just try your hardest to stay and remember trying your best is enough. You are enough :)
