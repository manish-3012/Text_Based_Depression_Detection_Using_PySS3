My looks make me want to commitI fucking hate the way I look. Every single part of me is just the most disgusting thing I have ever seen in my whole entire life. My lips are too small. My nose is too big. My eyes are sunken as shit and I look like I'm dead. I can't live like this anymore. It might seem shallow but everytime I look in the mirror I start crying because I'm not pretty enough and I never will be. My boobs are too small. My thighs are too big and I don't have any fucking ankles. I look like a fucking demon. God I wanna die so bad. And people around me tell me I'm not that ugly or that I'm pretty but I can just feel they're lying and it's crawling under my skin. I try to starve myself but I fail and everytime I do it just gets worse. I feel like death is my only option at this point. And it hurts cause every girl around me is beautiful in her own unique way and I'm just a piece of garbage. Literally.
