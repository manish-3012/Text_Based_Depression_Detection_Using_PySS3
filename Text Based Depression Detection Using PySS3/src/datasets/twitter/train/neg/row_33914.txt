What a week.Man, I have felt absolutely dreadful this week; two people I know (unconnected) tried to kill themselves, though luckily both failed. I've been drinking significantly every day just to shut up my brain for a bit, which is obviously terrible as alcohol is a depressant, not to mention the other effects. 

I have been depressed/suicidal since I was about 14, 11 years ago, and have always just thought that I won't do it for the sake of my family and friends. That said, I'm more recently coming to terms with the last thread of my family falling apart and my friends being quite involved in their own lives (that's not a fault on their part, they all have things going on and rightly so). 

It's just looking more and more like a logical decision to avoid the ever-increasing suffering of my life. I feel like an emo just writing that. My self worth is at an all time low and I think that unless something drastic changes shortly then I'm probably going to jump from one of London's very tall buildings to see if I've developed flying powers yet. Nothing seems to have helped thus far, it's just been sheer will power.
