Monday is the day... But no one will read this.So i posted here before and don't expect anyone to read or reply to this. I just kinda wanted to get it out. I wrote all the individual letters to people so they don't feel like my choice was their fault and i hope that eases some of their pain this will cause but i can't really stop that. I'm going through with this Monday so i can spend the weekend with my son and gf and when she leaves for work on Monday and when i put my kid downfor his afternoon nap I'll send out the text messages, call the police so someone can be here before my kid wakes up and I'll be gone by that time.. If i get the timing right. Wellthis is it i guess.. Anyone wanna tell me some stories or interesting posts to read? Maybe some cool music or something to enjoy before i go? Anyone wanna get something of their chest?
