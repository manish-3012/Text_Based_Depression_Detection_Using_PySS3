:)I'm almost turning 16 this year

I don't know how much longer i can stay this way 

It's always empty inside, i didn't belong anywhere and always felt myself as a burden to others

I don't wanna kill myself but i just can't help think its the only way 

I just want someone to talk to please help me :')
