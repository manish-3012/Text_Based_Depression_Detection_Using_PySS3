The thoughts of separationThis is no way a cry for help.

I wonder how do we move on from something...
When I was with this girl six months ago, everything was great.  Then we ran into a pickle and we stopped dating and talking.  I kind of miss her and we don't talk at all anymore.

I'm just curious to how people would move forward from a lost love.  I seem to be having some serious trouble with it.
