Really want to end my life right now but canâ€™tI just want to end my life right now because I donâ€™t find a goal in living. One thing holding me back is my religion because itâ€™s strongly forbidden to suicide.

I am a Muslim and there is a saying (hadeeth):
The Prophet (ï·º) said, "He who commits suicide by throttling shall keep on throttling himself in the Hell Fire (forever) and he who commits suicide by stabbing himself shall keep on stabbing himself in the Hell-Fire."

So whatever I do to suicide, I will be severely punished for it in the afterlife. I am not the most devote of Muslims but I avoid sinning; I never drank alcohol, pray 5 times a day, and fast during Ramadan. I also obey my parents and respect everyone. 

My academics are shit, my social life is shit (not what I imagine it to be) and Iâ€™m sick of life and its hardships. I have an exam on Saturday that is crucial to my university degree and I might fail the class a second time. Class is only offered in Spring, and Iâ€™ve already delayed my graduation a year because of my failed classes.
