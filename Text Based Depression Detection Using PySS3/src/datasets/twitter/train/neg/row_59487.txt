I'm going to kill myself in an hrI hate myself. I have an okay life that I cant enjoy bc I'm always so fucking sad. My bf wont come home from hanging out with his friends even though I told him I need his help not to die rn. He's been with them since noon and its almost 9 now. I skipped work and class bc I couldn't fucking handle it. I'm emotionally and physically exhausted. I haven't eaten in 24 hrs bc I cant bring myself to even fucking chew let alone heat something up and God forbid cook. 

I'm about to leave my apt and find a way to die. Nobody fucking cares about me not even my bf who I have given everything to. I have made enormous sacrifices for him and he csnt even cut a fucking playdate short for me.
