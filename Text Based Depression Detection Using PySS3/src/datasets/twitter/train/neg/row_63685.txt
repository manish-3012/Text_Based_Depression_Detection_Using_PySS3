ive tried understanding the world and i did better myselfive learnt a lot. people skills. how to present myself well, how to make friends and how to be someone even admired and how to work around power dynamics.

its not enough its never enough. im on top of all my shit but then im hit with same underlying feeling i hate myself i want to die and i wouldnt mind killing. im not close with any family and would be fine with suicide. its painful living is and rewiring my whole brain is what ive been doing. it doesnt seem worth it. its a lot of work and i already put so much in. i believe i will find peace in my death. i tried hard to understand the world but couldnt. thats my life, lets put it into peace.
