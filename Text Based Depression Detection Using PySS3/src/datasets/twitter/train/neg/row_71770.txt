I created a miserable existence for myselfI have always been the privileged girl. Private school, music lessons, blah blah blah. Everything was handed to me on a silver platter. I was also born with a slew of mental illnesses (the getting into fights, eating lunch alone in the bathroom, slitting wrists open and showing them to classmates breed of fucked up) and managed to sabotage just about single positive opportunity I had by either quitting or being asked to quit. Recently, in a flurry of drug abuse, wasted hours sleeping around, domestic violence, and above all else sheer laziness, I managed to fail out of a prestigious university (tuition free, of course). I was so messed up on psychedelics one night that I wandered the streets and into someone's house, making that psychiatric ward visit #2. I am failing again now in community college while working retail. I have no friends, because I was also a compulsive liar in those glory days. Mother told me I am crushing her dreams. I want to purchase a gun this weekend, drive into the woods and paint the trees red. So much pain, can't see straight, can't breathe.
