Sucidial ThoughtsIm Currently in 9th grade. I go to a pretty large high school. I have a decent amount of friends and no problems with my friends. I make a good amount of money myself and iâ€™m considered to be pretty wealthy (i sell shoes and clothing). Theres a few problems going on. School just started up and the first quarter ended. My grades were pretty bad. I had 2 Aâ€™s 2 Câ€™s 2 Dâ€™s and an F. I feel like i just ruined any chances i had for college by getting bad grades at the start of the year. My parents just got a rough divorce. At about the same time school started my dad moved out. My mom and dad fighting really messed me up. Girls is another problem. I havenâ€™t even been close to getting a girlfriend. My friends have had girlfriends and talk to girls all the time. Whenever i try i get shut down instantly. Im not even sure why. I feel as if iâ€™m alone and my life is just going to be hell once high school ends. I feel i can get better grades if I tried but is it too late? I really want to go to college but with the grades i got at the start of the year is that even possible? I sit in my room at night and just think of all the reasons I donâ€™t need to be here. I need someone to talk to. My friends donâ€™t understand what im going through.... any help would be loved.
