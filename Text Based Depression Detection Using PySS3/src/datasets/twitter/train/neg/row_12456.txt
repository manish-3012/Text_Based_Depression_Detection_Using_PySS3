I am an islandYou know what I mean.  Well today has been a shitty day and I have rope and damn does it look inviting. I am alone and isolated abandonment doesn't even begin to describe it. I am constantly tired and severely depressed but every time I go see a therapist or psychologist my brain just shuts down and I just say whatever I have to to get out of there. I have a lot of trust issues I can't stand my parents as they treat me like shit and constantly guilt trip me by doing things I never asked them to do then saying they did me a favor. I have no love in my life I just want to die in my sleep due to being in constant physical and emotional pain I want to fucking end it. Death please take me tonight. End my suffering have mercy on this poor soul

I can't fucking deal with life anymore. I don't give a shit if my family hurts. I have no family. They all treat me like I'm less than dirt
