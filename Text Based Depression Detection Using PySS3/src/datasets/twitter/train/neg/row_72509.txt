Doomed from the beginningIâ€™ve never been happy in life. Ever.
I didnâ€™t have a happy childhood even though I had good parents and everything I needed. Uncle started sexually abusing me in preschool and it caused anxiety and fear my entire childhood. Not just fear for that situation but suddenly everything was scary. Strangers, noises, night time, school, other kids. Everything was too much for me. 
Then my parents divorced.
Then I was scared I would get pregnant when the uncle started raping me. Then I was scared of being hurt. Then I was scared of how my peers would see me. Then I was scared because my mom remarried a man who was abusive.
Then I was scared because my dad didnâ€™t care as much about me anymore.
Then I would wake up to my mom screaming and I would try to protect her and wasnâ€™t allowed to tell anyone no matter how bad it was.
Then I was scared because my stepdad beat her and she lost the baby she was 6months pregnant with, and I lost a sibling I was so excited for.
Then I was scared when she got pregnant again.
Then I was scared when people found out about my uncle abusing me.
Then I was scared when I realized my own grandparents paid for my uncles lawyers.
Then I was scared because he moved in next door and would stare at me.
Then I was scared because I had no one.
Then I was scared because I knew I was doomed from the beginning.


Then I realized fear is who I am.
So I used alcohol and drugs and lying to become someone else.

Now Iâ€™m back to fear.

I cannot live this way.
Iâ€™ve always known that I couldnâ€™t.
But suddenly I realize I will be scared forever unless Iâ€™m just... not.

If Iâ€™m not alive I canâ€™t be scared.
If Iâ€™m not alive I wonâ€™t be told to move on.
If Iâ€™m not alive I wonâ€™t be reliving these events over and over.

If Iâ€™m not alive then Iâ€™m just not.
