I just got friend-dumped twice in the past 12 hours. Help me. I don't know what to do. I feel sick to my stomache, everything is going wrong for me. I have to go to work tomorrow, early in the morning. I don't know how to keep going. Why am I so wrong that people don't want to be my friend anymore, that I get friend-dumped. What do I do?? I thoughtt things were getting better. they aren't, im in the same place i was 3 years ago when depression started. how can i keep going if this is what life is like? how can i keep going, at least until the weekend. or something.
