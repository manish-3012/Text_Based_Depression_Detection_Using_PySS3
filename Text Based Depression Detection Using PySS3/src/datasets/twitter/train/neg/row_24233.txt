I'm afraid my best friend may finally do it this month.First thing first: some background. I and my best friend are studying psychology. We entered university at the same year and we're in our last year of study. He has spoken of both depressive and suicidal thoughts before, but I was never sure if he was really depressive or if it was a self-diagnosis (since we studied abnormal psychology in class), and never knew if it was suicide ideation or intention.

I discovered this sub only today, and I read the risk assessment guide. It scared me to hell because my friend shows several high risk symptoms. He thinks he's a burden to his mom and that everyone will be better off without him. Our peer group members have all graduated and moved to a different city, leaving him without support. He has explicitly told his family that he's gonna do it in August (this month!) and has made up his mind to submit a resignation letter to the university.

He doesn't wanna disclose his plan, that's why I thought he was merely seeking attention. He has told us that he won't change his mind and that he doesn't want help and he doesn't wanna be recovered from depression. He has stopped seeing a psychiatrist.

His relationship with his other family members is distant. Not many people believe he's really gonna do it. Please, I don't know what to do...
