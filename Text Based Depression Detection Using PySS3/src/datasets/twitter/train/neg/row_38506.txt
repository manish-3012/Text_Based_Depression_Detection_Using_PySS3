I guess it has come to an end no more reasons to move on.March 10th 2017 was when all this when deep before that I was still depressed but I had reason to move on all my life savings everything I ever worked for in this life went down the drain within the twinkle of an eye and I can never stop blaming my self for all that happened because It was all my fault and I think taking away my own life would be a fare decision. I got involved in a Binary Option scam lost everything life now seems worthless as I have no reason to move on again where do I start ? my rents are due I have no where to love no one to turn to I guess this is the end am out of this world afterall what impact would I have made even am just a clumpsy stupid person that believes in everyone I meet it was a shity planet after all. Bye
