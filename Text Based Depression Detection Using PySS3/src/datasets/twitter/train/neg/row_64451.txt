Once Upon a Time...Happiness has been a fairy tale for a good part of my life. I've been depressed for a big chunk of my life (I'm 22 and I remember it being really bad as far back as 15) and the depression has almost become a part of my personality.

It tempers my excitement when I enjoy something. it prevents me from being productive and then makes me feel bad for not being productive. Ending my life is a daily contemplation and has been since my first thoughts on it when I was 16. 

I don't even know what I want out of this. I sometimes come here to the subreddit to try and help other people hoping it will make me feel a little better, but I couldn't do it today. I sat staring a one of the new posts trying to think of something to say... anything... and all I could think of was "life sucks and then you die"

I don't expect help from here. Hell, I don't expect help from anywhere. I expect to some day finally be able to successfully kill myself and be done with this miserable existence I've been forced to live.

Because happiness is a fairy tale, and the only way to have a happy ending is if there is an end.
