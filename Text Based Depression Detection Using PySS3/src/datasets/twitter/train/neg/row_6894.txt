My friend diedYesterday, my friend died.

We met through strange circumstances, but what connected us was that we both had mental illnesses that made suicide a deep issue. But she, she was so much stronger than me. While I flailed and cried and begged to just end it, she was fierce and strong and witty and tough. She was loud, so very loud, and had so much energy. When she walked in the room, you took notice. When she talked, you shut up. When she laughed, it echoed off the walls. She was the embodiment of getting better.

And two days ago she attempted suicide. Yesterday she died.

I'm not suicidal. But I'm lost, and afraid, and hurting. If this woman, this woman who stood up to her illness and told it where to go and what to do when it got there, if she couldn't resist the pain in the end ... how could I ever hope to? 

So I'm wondering, how do we push forward when the toughest among us failed?
