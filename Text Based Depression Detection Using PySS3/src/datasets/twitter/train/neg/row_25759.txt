I cut myself for the first time today, and I feel so ashamed.Major TW for self-harm. 

I have no idea what came over me; just felt like I needed to punish myself in some way. I just took a pair of scissors and went at my arm. The even more fucked up part is how much I want to do it again, like this is the only coping mechanism I have left. Iâ€™m fucking 20 years old in college and Iâ€™m cutting myself. What happened to these being the â€œbest years of my lifeâ€?
