I'm so tired of "Journeys"A lot of people have given me a lot of advice over the years. None of it has worked. If I could flip a switch in my head and see the world differently, I would have a long time ago. I've tried medication. I've changed my career. I've been in a relationship, I've had a lot of sex. None of it worked.

Now I've stopped trying to see the world as anything other than hell. I've stopped going to college to pursue a new career in making prosthetics. I have as little interest in a relationship as I know a partner would have in me when she comes to understand me beyond what I do to get by socially. I stopped having sex, because it's as empty as masturbation.

The thing is, there's no more options. No more dreams to pursue. No new philosophy or sudden epiphany that's going to magically cure me. I fucked myself and I'm never going to get better. I know how what I'm going to do, and I know how I'm going to do it. It's just time, now.

What really makes me hate me is that I have no one to blame but myself.
