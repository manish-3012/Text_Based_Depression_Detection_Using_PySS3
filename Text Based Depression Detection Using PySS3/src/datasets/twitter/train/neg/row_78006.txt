Next TuesdayNext Tuesday is the day that I've decided to leave. I'm going to use the last bit of money I have and I'm going to drive up to San Francisco. I've been severely suicidal for over a month and it's only gotten worse. A specific realization triggered it and I realized the truth about myself. Once that happened I genuinely lost my will to live and ability to love (anhedonia, depersonalization, you name it). Every day I wake up at 7AM whether I like it or not and can't get back to sleep. My heart races... I have acid reflux. I endure the day until night arrives and the cycle repeats. It feels like existential torture. All throughout June I remember telling myself, "Just make it to the next day," but it hasn't gotten better. I'm sure that I'm mentally ill, though I've never been to a therapist to get diagnosed. I can't now because my health insurance recently expired. Honestly though, healthcare in my case would just be a temporary solution to a permanent problem. Consciousness is my problem. Awareness is my problem. Death is the only way to stop this.

I know that this will ruin my family and friends, but I cannot conceive of a future that doesn't involve the end of my life. I didn't see any of this coming. I was fine... I was fine for so long, and now... well... here I am.

I'm not sure why I posted this. Perhaps I just needed to get it off my chest.
