I donâ€™t even know anymore to be honestIâ€™m a total failure, Iâ€™m turning 22 this month and fuck am I ever a loser. Iâ€™m a disappointment to my family and most importantly my little brother, the only thing in this world I want is to see my brother succeed in life but here am I owing my 16 year old brother who works part time and full time in school $600. Like wtf the older brother who has a full time job has to ask his little brother for money? Iâ€™ve put myself in ridiculous debt where Iâ€™m barely breathing, living paycheque to paycheque having maybe $100 to spend on every 2 weeks after I pay all my debts, car insurance etc... I know for a fact my family would be better with out me, all I do is bring them down. The only time Iâ€™m ever happy is when I take a nice fat line up my nose. Iâ€™m a loser. 2 weeks ago I got drunk and crashed my car causing $5000 damage to my car. Canâ€™t do anything right in my life and like I said, this world would be honestly better with out me, I wake up some days hoping that a drunk driver hits me. My birthday is this month and Iâ€™m seriously considering going 200kmh into a wall and ending it.
