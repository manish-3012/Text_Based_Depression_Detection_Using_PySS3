Went to kill myself today but it didn't happen.I got fed up with these feelings of hurt and pain and was going to end it.  My parents usually keep a gun under the mattress but I guess they moved it back into the safe.  So that didn't happen.  I just laid in bed and cried all day.  I tried to eat but just threw up.  I don't know why I feel like this.  I feel like the reason is so stupid.  I have a lot of friends. A loving family and I just started going to community college.  I got accepted into a 4 year university a year ago but I couldn't afford it.  That really bummed me out and still does honestly.  The reason is my girlfriend left me a month ago.  We had been dating for a while.  I'd never thought I would want to get married to someone until I met her.  I knew she was the one and I still do.  This feels like such a stupid reason to be so depressed.  I don't know why it affects my mental well being so much.  It just eats at me everyday.  I've spammed her and it probably just pushes her away more.  Everyone just tells me to move on but I don't want to.  She still talks to me and I guess we were on good terms for a while.  But, all these bad thoughts came back to me and it hurts more than anything.  I feel like dying over something so small.  I don't even feel like my feelings justify posting here.
