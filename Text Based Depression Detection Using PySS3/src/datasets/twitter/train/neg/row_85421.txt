Call me?I have read through these posts time and time again. Most of the time it seems like people need to talk but it seems the suicide prevention hotline is too much. Im not trying to break any rules here, but pm me and I will gladly listen to you if you need to call a stranger. I am not a professional at all, but I will gladly hear you out if you need to vent.
