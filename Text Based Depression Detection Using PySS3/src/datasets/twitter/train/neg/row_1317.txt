About to cut my face and wrists.***EDIT***
Well, I'm still alive. My brother found me while I was bleeding out and I've spent the past 2 weeks in inpatient. I got my mess sorted out and I'm feeling a lot better. I've decided to focus on myself for a while, I got a gym membership and a haircut...i cut up my face pretty bad and needed over 70 stitches including my wrists. People look at me a lot now, so that's something to get used to I suppose. I still have an urge to self harm, but I'm hoping I can push through. Thank you all for your comments.

My life has taken many turns up until now. Not the worst you've seen on this sub. Sexual abuse dominated almost my entire high school life. I was afraid of sleep, as hyper realistic nightmares filled my sleep. I was threatened daily with torture and rape. I developed insomnia, depression, and psychosis. I was threatened with being kicked onto the streets if I didn't do whatever he asked of me. Once I got away from him, I was fine for a while. I was still depressed most of the time, but now I had little fits of manic energy, so I brushed it off. I graduated high school thinking it was all over. But then the dreams came back. My psychosis caused me to self harm daily, and I also developed an eating disorder. I attempted suicide for the first time this February. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2. I went to the psych ward multiple times after this, and in May, I attempted again. 

I've tried recovery, I really have. I wanted so desperately to be better, to be happy. But some people can never reach happiness. Some people just keep going down. I am all alone. All my friends have abandoned me, I'm just a drag to them, even my friend that I went too for everything told me they couldn't help me anymore. I have no one left to talk to. I have only one friend who will still talk to me, but I can tell I'm being a burden. No one can understand. In the end, everyone always leaves me. I won't go back to the psych ward. I'd rather be dead. Last time I went I was treated like a prisoner, had my rights taken away. I got even worse because of being there. 

I feel so alone. All around me are smiling faces, telling me I can recover. But they don't know that. They can't possibly understand. I'm done. I've put on my favourite movie, got my razor out...its showtime
