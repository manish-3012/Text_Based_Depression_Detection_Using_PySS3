Give me a reason to stay aliveEveryone says itâ€™ll get better but it wonâ€™t. If anything itâ€™s getting worse. Iâ€™m having daily suicide thoughts and the only thing stopping me from doing it are my parents and best friends. I think Iâ€™m too cowardly to actually kill myself, but Iâ€™m terrified that Iâ€™m going to spend the rest of my life just.. existing.
