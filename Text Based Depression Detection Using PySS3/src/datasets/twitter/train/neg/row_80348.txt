The thing I'm killing myself with arrives tomorrowObviously I won't elaborate on what it is to avoid rule breaking. 

I've worked very hard to summon the strength to pull all of this off. It took a lot more steps than just buying stuff. I had to actively work to drive all my friends and acquaintances off. It hurts to make people that you love hate you. It hurts to be an asshole to those people. They just don't deserve to suffer, I hope they'll care less now.

I've only ever hurt people and don't deserve to live. It's not fair for me to be alive. I just want everyone to be happy, and that's only going to happen when I'm gone.

I'm not looking for support or advice. I just really needed to get my thoughts out there. Sorry for blogposting
