AloneI am a 28 male. I live alone. No GF. Always been cheated on. Have a few friends but none that are close.

Everyone I know has a partner or is getting married and having kids. 

I used to have suicidal ideations all the time. When they got real bad, Iâ€™d reach out to my mom or sister or a friend. They all told me to go talk to someone.

Well, all I feel though is, is that Iâ€™m alone. Constantly. The past two months, my depression and ideations have regressed. However, I still get them. Such as now. 

I just need someone to talk to. Make me feel like Iâ€™m wanted. I reach out to everyone, but no one reaches out to me. When I talk to my mom, sister or even with my ex (when we were together), Iâ€™d be on the borderline of wanting to kill myself. They would say â€œIâ€™m always here if you need to talkâ€. When I do, Theyâ€™d say, â€œjust go talk to someoneâ€. I never ask for anything

Gee thanks, all I want to know is that I matter, someone to reach out to me... why should I live in constant pain to prevent others from living in constant pain by me ending myself when they donâ€™t even reach out? And when I do, itâ€™s always â€œgo talk to someoneâ€.

Thanks. Remind me again why I should live?
