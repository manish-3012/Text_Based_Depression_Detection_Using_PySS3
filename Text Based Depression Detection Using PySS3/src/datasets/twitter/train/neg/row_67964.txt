Iâ€™ve lost all motivation to liveIâ€™ve havenâ€™t had anything particularly painful or traumatic happen to me as of recently. I just no longer feel the desire to live. I have nothing that makes me want to get up in the morning. I feel like Iâ€™m never going to truly be happy in my life so thereâ€™s no point in really continuing. I debate killing myself for the simple idea that death will be more fulfilling than life.
