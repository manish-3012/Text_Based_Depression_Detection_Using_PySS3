Last 20 hours for the two of us.Not sure why I'm even posting here, just want to talk to somebody before I go.

Me and my husband have had the worst year. We can't conceive naturally, we can't afford the treatments, we can't afford rent or much else actually anymore.

We found a way and together tomorrow are going to go. We talked and honestly we are at the calmest we've been for ages thinking about it. Finally no more stress worries and jealousy. Everything will be calm finally.
