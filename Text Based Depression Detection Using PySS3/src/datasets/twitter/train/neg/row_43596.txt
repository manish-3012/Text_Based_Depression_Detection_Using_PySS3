Need some encouragementHello, life lost meaning to me since I can remember and I usually keep some checklist around to keep me out of suicide but they aren't enough these days. I'm sorry about the inconvenience but I would really appreciate some encouragement I don't know if this subreddit is for this but I'm feeling awful and don't know what else to do
