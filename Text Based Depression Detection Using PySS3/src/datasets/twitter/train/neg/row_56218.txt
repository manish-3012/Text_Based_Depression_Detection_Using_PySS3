I'm not sure where else to turnSo, I'm a 19-year-old drop-out. I've been suicidal for at least ten years at this point, but I've never attempted. I tried telling my parents at one point but they didn't do anything and I don't keep regular contact with the few friends I have.

I hated my school and it was really damaging to my mental health so I dropped out, but that didn't help much. I want to finish high school, but I can't go back to public school, I just can't.

I can't really go get help, I have no car or driver's license and going out with my parents just murders my mood.

I just sit day to day playing video games and browsing the internet, and at this point I don't think things will ever get better.

I should add that the fact that I'm a closeted bisexual girl in the Southeastern US doesn't help.

Well fuck, that's all I can think of for now.
