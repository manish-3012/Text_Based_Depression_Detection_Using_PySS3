How tall is tall enough but not enough to make a closed casket funeral?I really wanna know what to do. I've tried meds but always for some reason my parents appear in time. I was thinking of carbon monoxide inhalation with an electric grill and some coal but I don't know how to bring coal into my home like it's nothing. So I was thinking of "visiting a friend" and stopping by any floor to fly. Didn't wanna traumatize anyone with gore tho. Any tips?
