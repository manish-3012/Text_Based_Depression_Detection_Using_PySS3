Many would mourn for me, but no one would miss meI keep telling myself that and I'm starting to believe it might be true.

I have family, but I'm losing contact with more and more as years go by. Every friend I've made has either forgotten me or abandoned me. I don't blame them, I'm not a fun person to be around. I've always considered myself as the disposable one in a group of people. Nothing would be different if I was gone. 

If/when I die, I know many may be sad and may even shed tears, but they'll move on soon after. Nobody cares, or at least pretends to care, until you're gone.
