I'm close to my breaking point.I've been diagnosed with Schizophrenia but I never told my family. My fear is that it'll blown out of proportion and make the situation worse. My school life has made my life even worse to the point where I thought of suicide. I felt like scum throughout my school year to the point that I ask my self whats the point of living. If you have any tips please tell me. I don't be a burden to those that I love and those that I care about.
