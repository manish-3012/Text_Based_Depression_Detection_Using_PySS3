I got into it with my dad tonight and really donâ€™t see a reason to keep goingMy mom isnâ€™t in my life and a large part is due to her explosiveness. My dad works me up to a point where I say some of the most hateful things I can come up with and I hate myself. I hate that I lose control like that. I should know better and know to calm down. I hurt his feelings tonight and I really donâ€™t know how to fix it and have just been thinking about going upstairs and quietly ending it while heâ€™s sleeping. Iâ€™m really lost. Iâ€™m just sad all of the time, I struggle to find love for myself and it spills into other aspects of my life. I realized tonight I am my mother and I no longer see a point in being here. I donâ€™t want to be hateful like her and after what I said I feel like I need to go. I hate that Iâ€™m angry all of the time and I hate that I canâ€™t hide things like others. I try to hide my issues but it just drags me down so far that I canâ€™t pull out of it. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I really donâ€™t.
