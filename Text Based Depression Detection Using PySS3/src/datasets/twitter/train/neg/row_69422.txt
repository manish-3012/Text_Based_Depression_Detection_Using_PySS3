Things just escalatedI am 17 years old and have been struggling with social anxiety, depression and addiction for years now.

I can't even leave my house currently. I am too depressed to get out of bed. I ran out of drugs.

Now my mum visited me and called me worthless and said (out of anger) that I should just kill myself.

I am sitting here with a razor blade and I don't think I can stop myself.
