Hey howâ€™s it going? Iâ€™m the guy who said he was gonna blow his brains out last night when I realized Iâ€™m not going to get any matches on dating apps.Iâ€™m a ghost now, boo!

My cousin came in while I was writing my note and heâ€™s like 13. Didnâ€™t want to have him be the one to clean me up. One more Tinder boost tonight, and assuming Iâ€™m uninterrupted this roomâ€™s getting a crimson redesign once I go without a match.

You ever see the Tokyo Trial miniseries docudrama on Netflix? Of course not but letâ€™s act like you did. You know the Japanese general who watched the Allies move across Tokyo in his binoculars with a bowl of sake and then laughed as he swallowed his cyanide capsule?

Thatâ€™s how I wanna go out. Buy one last Tinder boost, watch nothing happen, then once the boost ends, BOOM! My boy knew it was game over when the Americans landed on Honshu after the Japanese navy and Air Force were annihilated across the Pacific, he just wanted to celebrate the end of his life and go out with some dignity.

Perfect timing, preferably. This is gonna be fun.
