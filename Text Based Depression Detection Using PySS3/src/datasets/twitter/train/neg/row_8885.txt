Help?My mom is extremely abusive, physically and mentally, but she is my family's only provider. I don't have anywhere to go if I leave, and I have younger siblings that I love with all my heart. I try to stay strong for them, but now it's getting impossiblely hard to stay strong. I don't want to hurt them if I kill myself, but I just don't know what to do.
