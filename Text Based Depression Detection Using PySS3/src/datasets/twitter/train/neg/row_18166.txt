Why does everything have to be so dramaticI have went through alot of shit, im really easily pushed into emotions, i suffer mdd, bipolar and im lowkey schizo, with extreme paranoid sides to it, my life's been fucking shit, and its never getting better. I can feel with people, but when i see "the void is coming" style posts, i just can't take it seriously... 

It honestly feels like attention cry, which is ok, i get it.. sometimes you're real lonely, need to be told by someone else its alright or will get better... But, come on... 

The people on here understand how you feel, you don't have to play it up people. Just be honest... You'll still get some positive feedback...
