No one will ever love me, I may as well go away so I never bother anyone again....I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m gonna make it the week, my family disowned me, Iâ€™ve been so sick and havenâ€™t been able to afford basic food or just a thing of alieve. My head hurts so bad. No one loves me, no one cares, itâ€™ll be better if I just go away no one will ever love me
