I (F13) am suicidal because of my special needs brotherIâ€™ve been suicidal since the summer. In the summer, I was trapped in the house since there was no school. My brother had always been always been abusive (physically) but since I was usually in school I could deal with it because it wasnâ€™t that many hours. Now it was all day. All day long was screaming, kicking, biting. Each day a new wound. I felt like my only way to escape was suicide. I still feel like that.
