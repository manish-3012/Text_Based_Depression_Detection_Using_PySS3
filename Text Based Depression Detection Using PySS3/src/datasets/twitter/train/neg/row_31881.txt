I am utterly aloneI don't know if I've posted here before but if I have then no one responded. I've just started my freshman year of college and I feel horrible. I was isolated all throughout high school and people said "just wait till college. It'll get better!". Guess what. It fucking hasn't. I just can't seem to make friends. I tried and still try but no one is friendly and I can't just keep intruding on their cliques anymore. My whole life has been a lone march through the darkness with not even a candle to light the way. I'm ready to stop marching. Thankfully I know how to tie a noose knot and it's just a matter of strength: finding strong enough rope and a strong enough place to affix it to. My own strength has already been sapped so I'll be relying on those two to to guide me out of the night.
