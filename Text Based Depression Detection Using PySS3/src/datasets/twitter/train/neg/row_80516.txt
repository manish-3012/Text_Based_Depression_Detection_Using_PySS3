Suicidal and aloneHi, I really don't expect you to care, as I couldn't care less about myself, but here it is.

I am 18 years old and have recently been discharged from a mental health hospital, being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.

I have no friends and I was in a serious relationship for a year which, if you know much about borderline personality disorder, ended badly.

I have taken 2 overdoses over the last 2 weeks, as well as cutting.

The relationship I was in turned nasty, and yet due to a fear of abandonment, also prevalent in borderline personality disorder patients, I continued to idealise her.

I was homeless for 3 months and survived by eating out of bins and wrapping myself in cardboard at night.

I am no longer homeless, but I am staying with my parents, which isn't exactly going that great with all my suicide attempts and whatever.

I am sick of being alive, I honestly have no other motive other than to kill myself, and I don't expect you to care, but this is my last hope.
