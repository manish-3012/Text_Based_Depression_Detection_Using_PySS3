Tired of being here...Every time I try at something I always fail,  it always comes out wrong. I can never do anything right. I try to impress everyone but no one seems to notice me, or anything. I'm so alone in this fucked up world. My cuts are getting deeper,  thoughts are getting worse and the voices are getting louder. Why can't I just be gone.
