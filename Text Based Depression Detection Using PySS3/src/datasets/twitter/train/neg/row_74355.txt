I'm so close to giving up everything, reddit..I don't know what to do anymore. I've been suicidal for the past 4 years, and it seems to be the easiest thing to do anymore. I don't know who to turn to for help.
 I don't have any close friends. 
 Turning to my boyfriend for my issues is only going to put my relationship at risk even more.
 My parents and "family" have fallen apart.
 Even my past posts (which have been deleted) to /r/ hasn't done me any good.
 I feel like people are no longer there for me, I don't know what to do anymore, and I just want someone who gives a flying fuck for once..
 Sorry for ranting.
