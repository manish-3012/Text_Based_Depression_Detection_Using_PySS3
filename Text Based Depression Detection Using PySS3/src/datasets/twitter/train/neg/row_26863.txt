I just donâ€™t care too much anymore;Iâ€™ve tried to just be happy. Or even satisfied with â€˜beingâ€™. It never happens. Iâ€™m tired of feeling trapped in my own skin. I feel confined by my body, and really Iâ€™m just exhausted of all the bullshit. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this. Maybe just venting or speak into the universe. I donâ€™t know. I just donâ€™t give a shit anymore, Iâ€™d rather not exist. Everyday is painful, even when I focus on what Iâ€™m grateful for. Or what positives I have. None of it matters as it used to when I was younger (even then it wasnâ€™t a ton).

I guess Iâ€™m glad a lot of people donâ€™t deal with this shitâ€” maybe thatâ€™s the bright side. Iâ€™d never wish this pain on anyone in a million years. Itâ€™s fucking awful. I donâ€™t know. If there were a way to leave that wasnâ€™t somehow terrifying for me, I wouldâ€™ve a long time ago. And I know people like to give this advise of â€˜donâ€™t do that, because of xyzâ€™ â€˜it gets betterâ€™. They just simply donâ€™t understand or get it. Which is fine, I wouldnâ€™t expect anyone to. I think thereâ€™s just a point where youâ€™re motivation and internal drive just ceases to function. You take on so much pain that a lot before becomes irrelevant. You just donâ€™t react anymore to all the pain. Itâ€™s just there; something youâ€™re suffering through.

I try to â€˜look on the bright sideâ€™ but honestly, I canâ€™t see anything there. Maybe Iâ€™m just broken because of brain wiring/predisposition. That could very well be the answer. Frankly, I just have no drive left. Nothing to seemingly look forward to.

Iâ€™m grateful for all the wonderful people Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to cross paths with. Appreciate you all. 

All the small moments of joy Iâ€™ve had here and there over the years. For being lucky enough to have food and shelter up to this point. 

But, Iâ€™m simply tired. 

Iâ€™ve survived long enough I believe. Iâ€™ve never felt as though I truly â€˜livedâ€™.
