Losing itCame very close last night.  Texted a hotline and  held off for a bit. But right back in the same place now.  I feel very out of control....Didnâ€™t sleep at all. 

Why am I even trying to fight? There should be euthanasia available if you want to die consistently over a long period of time. Time to embrace the inevitable. Working on a foolproof plan. Not going to fail this time.  Will buy a gun tomorrow.

The crazy thing is I donâ€™t even necessarily want to dieâ€”what I want is not to be me.  I want to destroy myself and if it is violent and painful so much the better. It is what I deserve. If only I could just trade places with one of the innocents that died in the mass shootings we read about every day. Let someone worthy survive instead.
