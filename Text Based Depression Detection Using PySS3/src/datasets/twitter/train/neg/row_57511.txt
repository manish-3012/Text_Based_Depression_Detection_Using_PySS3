[Title]I suppose I should say something here. Just in case I don't end up doing it later when it's more crucial. It's probably just the hormones and brain chemicals fucking it all up again, so I'm trying not to come off as just some bitchy SWM. I don't really have a lot to complain about. It's not like I'm in an abusive situation (anymore) and I'm pretty much a productive member of society.

I have no money problems at present.

I guess I just have no friends, or any idea on how to make them.

It doesn't really matter. I'm the one causing my own problems anyway. Maybe I'm depressed, anxious, crazy, who knows anymore. I can't figure it out. I don't want to waste people's time crying for help if there's no point to helping me. I should be able to deal with my own problems. I guess that's all I say right now.
