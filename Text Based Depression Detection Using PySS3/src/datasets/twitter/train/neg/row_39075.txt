i cant crysince i was like 7, i think ive cried a total of 2 times, and all my emotions just keep building up in an inaccessible spot causing me to to feel numb.
i was wondering if anyone else knows how to, if I google it it comes up with 'how to fake cry' bullshit, i havent found a single site that tells me how i can do it for real to let out real emotion.

sorry if this isn't the right place, i just dont know where else to ask
