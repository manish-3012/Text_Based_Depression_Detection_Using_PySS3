I cant live like this anymoreI have been depressed since I was eight, maybe even before, but that was when I first recognized it. I have lived with the shame of childhood trauma my whole life, but I canâ€™t talk about it until my parents die. Iâ€™ve been sexually assaulted twice, but I canâ€™t speak out about it bc deep down, I feel like I asked for it. I have these open wounds that I canâ€™t do anything about. I canâ€™t afford therapy. I went to a free college clinic and they told me I was such a severe case, I was almost beyond help. 

Iâ€™m gay but I donâ€™t feel like I can date who I want bc of shame and retribution from my parents. Iâ€™m queer and I donâ€™t know if I want to transition. Part of me thinks I donâ€™t want to, but part of me only think I donâ€™t want to bc of shame. Iâ€™ve had an eating disorder since I was 13 and I hate my body so much, and recovery seems impossible at this point. Iâ€™m obsessive and compulsive and paranoid. I canâ€™t sleep without all the lights on in my house because Iâ€™m terrified Iâ€™m going to die if theyâ€™re off. 

I have harbored so much hurt and trauma and all I can do is repress it deep down bc itâ€™s too painful to deal with, but at the same time, repressing it makes it worse. At this point, I just want to die. There are so many things I want to do in life, but every experience is tainted by trauma. Itâ€™s always in the background. Even if I got everything I want in life, it would still be spoiled. I want a career but I canâ€™t cope with daily life. I want kids but Iâ€™m terrified Iâ€™ll hurt them, even indirectly. I just canâ€™t live like this anymore.
