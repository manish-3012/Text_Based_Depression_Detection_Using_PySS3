20, jobless, can't afford college/no financial aid, no futureAs the title says, I'm 20 with no future. I lost my job as they closed down five months ago and haven't been able to find a new one. I'm socially awkward and overweight and not a conventionally attractive female which I believe attributes to my non desirableness as far as employent goes. I've been wanting to kill myself for a while and I think I'm finally ready to, I just don't know how to go about it. I have no family/friends outside of my long term relationship with my boyfriend. Do I leave a note?  I don't want to do it in our house as I'd hate for him to find me like that. I feel so desperate to escape this world because being alive feels more like a curse than a blessing. I just want to be free again like I felt I was when I was younger.
