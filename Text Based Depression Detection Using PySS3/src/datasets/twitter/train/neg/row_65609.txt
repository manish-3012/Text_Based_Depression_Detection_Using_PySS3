I'm just so sick of being alone..Every time I reach out to someone, they always tell me they're glad I reached out, that they'd miss me if I was gone; how losing me from their life would be awful.

I try so hard, but I don't believe any of them.

I really want to believe these people genuinely care about my life, just so I could have something (that isn't dependent on me, i.e. college) that I could hold on to. I'm naturally a pretty independent/introverted person, so I honestly love my alone time. I don't mind going out alone and making new acquaintances, or whatever, I just want at least one person to actually like me; for one person in my life to care about me on a semi-regular basis.

I reach out (when I'm feeling okay, when I just want to talk to my friends, like; not just when I'm feeling like I am now) every single time. I ask questions about these peoples lives because I do care. Why wont any of them do the same for me? I'm not even asking for much, I don't think, just a once-a-month FB message asking about my life.

I don't know, I don't expect much of anything posting here. I just don't know how much more I can take of this complete isolation.
