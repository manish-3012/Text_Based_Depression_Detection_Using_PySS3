why?why continue living on in this reality that holds no meaning? how is it that people can provide a sense of meaning to their existence and receive fulfillment from it? how can people go about life and not feel the urge to end it every day? i just cannot comprehend it, it's as if i'm missing something important. why can i not grasp the concept of wanting to live an accomplished life? i'm told i'm only 16 and i have my entire life ahead of me, yet i just don't see why i should care. it's almost like inherently most people care about living their life to the fullest, while i simply don't have that quality. if i were to die right now i wouldn't feel happy nor sad, almost indifferent towards it. i hate thinking like this because i know it hurts the people that care about me so much. what will it take for me to care about living? can someone please tell me?
