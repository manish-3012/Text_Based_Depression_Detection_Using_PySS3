I'm having suicidal thoughts and I think how can I commit suicide and start laughingI'm a queer teenager living in a conservative and close minded family, if they know they'll kill me I dont have any friends or someone i can trust or talk to. I've been thinking of commiting suicide but the only thing preventing me is my mom.. I always think of ways i can kill myself and laugh sometimes i think it will be cool . I can't tell anybody or get help from a doctor because I live in the middle east and it's a taboo to talk about these things . sorry for my bad English.
