The SituationThe time came about 25 hours ago now. While sitting around with friends I decided to do it and abruptly left to head home. I stopped to get my last cigarette and my last pint of whiskey and continued on my way. I seemed to be in the house alone, so I wrote out a note on a memo pad in the kitchen and hung it from the string that controls the ceiling fan. It simply read 

&gt; I LOVE YOU. 

&gt; Don't look. Call 911.


I went down to my bedroom and brought up the last song I would ever listen to. I lit my last cigarette and started swigging from my last pint. I grabbed my Ruger, in which I had been keeping a single FMJ in the chamber, because I would like to at least give my family an open casket. I would aim for the top of my brain stem. Halfway through the last song I would ever hear, I heard someone screaming for me, and then a banging on my door. It turned out someone was home. And I'm still here. But I think it's a matter of time before it happens again, a month at the most. And this time I'll be more careful. My guns were taken, which I wasn't supposed to have anyway, so next time I'll stop by the department store to grab a hose and some duct tape. I'll find a secluded spot on the outskirts of town and direct my cars exhaust through a window which I'll seal with the tape. I'll smoke my last few cigarettes and swig from my last point, and that will be that.

I'll probably be found before my corpse is too far gone for an open casket to be an option. No more me. Forever. It's a strange thought to think, but it's an even stranger feeling to get used to thinking it.
