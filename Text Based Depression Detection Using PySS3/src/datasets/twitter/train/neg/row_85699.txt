I don't beleive in "It Gets Better" meme anymoresocial anxiety depression ocd and many other things and problems in life( i have 0 friends online,0 in real life) because i have very bad anxiety i can't replay to messages online, i don't get out from my room since when i was kid... 7 years of social anxiety and depression i don't enjoy anything any more nothing can make me happy,, doctors or meds or anything didn't help me

sometimes i wish i killed myself earlier than living like this it just keeps getting worse

 now i can't even kill myself anymore because i tried to fix some "cheap chinese phone" for someone from my family and now he have alot of porn ads and videos from Chinese viruses I didn't know that after i fixed his phone, he didn't have this problem before....

if i kill myself they will probably think I'm creep weirdo who was watching porn 24/24h now

FUCK why i always have this bad luck in life
