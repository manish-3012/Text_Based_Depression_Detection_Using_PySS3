I feel like I'm closer to suicideFrom time to time my depression intensifies. Today is one day like that. I feel like there's no point on going on with my life, I work in a place that I hate so much, I have no time to do what I want because of the work also I have to study a career that I don't fucking like because the career that I really want is not profitable. All my friends are always busy and distant, my relationship is very confusing, my relationship with my mother is strange and we kind of hate each other. My father is very distant now, my half-sister is a fucking bitch and my other two half-brothers are distant with me too. The world is fucking dying and I hate my own species. I just want to kill myself right now by putting a fucking bullet in my head. I'm so fucking useless for everything. I'm bad making new friends and maintaining relationships, I'm bad in my job and my school... I feel like death it's the only way to be free of everything.
