been suicidal before, this is different thoughi honestly can't even think straight right now.  the last 2 years have made me into a zombie.  

when i've been suicidal before (2 attempts, one serious) it's always been an impulse, something that popped up within a matter of 72 hours or less. 

but now it's like i haven't felt joy in months. it's not that i don't have ok moments but everything, even sleeping, feels like a chore.  i've willingly isolated myself from everyone, i live with my mom because i haven't tried moving out and am terrified of other people, the only thing i do outside of the house is work.  i do work 40 hours a week, current position i've been in for 13 months with good attendance and no issues with performance or anything (unheard of from me in my early 20s), but i'm so barely hanging on most days at work.  still it's the only place i can seem semi-normal--but it exhausts me so much to fake it all day.

sorry i don't know i can't think straight, been up for a couple days with only a couple 2-3 hour naps in between. just looking for somebody to talk to.  i'm semi-considering telling my mom what's happening but i don't know how it'll help.  i feel like it'll just ruin my job and be a fantastic waste of everyone's money.

and i have to go to work in 5 hours.  i like work, it's probably the only thing i really get any enjoyment out of with any consistency but i'm just so not in a good place today

just trying to talk to someone, my head is basically hyperactive mush and i keep getting all on the verge of tears for no real reason
