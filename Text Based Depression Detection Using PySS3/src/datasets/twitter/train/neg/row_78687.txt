If it werenâ€™t for my babies, I wouldnâ€™t have made it this far.I want to die but I donâ€™t want to mess up my kids forever. I am a 40 year old woman and I have dealt with more betrayal than most in life. My first serious boyfriend lied to me about his job, his college degree, and who he talked to online for over a year. Once I split with him, I took some time to better myself and then met my first hubby. He was fine until he developed a drug habit and forced me into bankruptcy. From 800s credit score to bankruptcy over the course of 18 months of marriage. Pulled myself back up from that- got pregnant to a cheater who cheated on me until I left and he took up with an ex stripper with a felony record who helps raise my kid. After that came my second husband. Heâ€™s more drama than any of them and tried to ruin my life and friendships. He has made sure I donâ€™t even talk to my mom anymore. Ultimately, I can live with this pain anymore. I trust no one, I like no one. I just want to disappear but I donâ€™t want my babies to pay. They are so perfect and sweet. I wish I could afford to live alone with them but I canâ€™t. Even if I could I know I would feel so alone and like a failure so I would still want to die anyway
