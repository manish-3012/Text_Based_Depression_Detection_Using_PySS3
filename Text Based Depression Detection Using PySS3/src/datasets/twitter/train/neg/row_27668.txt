I'm tired and doneI'm so sick and tired of all things. And as of recently, I don't really have the energy to try anymore. One of the only people that kept me sane, cut me off. I was head over heals in love.... I miss the phone conversations where we would fall asleep talking to each other and I would feel safe for the first time in a long time. I thought I found a person who really got me. Really understood and tried.... but just like everyone, people get bored and leave, leave leave leave no one sticks around. I don't really care what people say, people get tired of me and they just ignore me and cut ties. What's so fucking terrible about me?
