Stagnation. Why go forward if you can never go up?I have no family. I have no friends. I live in a remote, isolated area. I have no transportation. I have no money. My body is in terrible shape, and the worst things about it are the ones I can't change. (Why lose weight if I will still be hideously mutated? I certainly have no desire to prolong my existence.) 

I don't see anything changing, in the near or far future, for better or for worse. 

I exist each day on my little, tiny corner of the planet. I eat, I sleep, and when I have enough energy, I shower. I refresh Reddit, Facebook and all three of my email addresses several times a day just to see if there is anything new.

I have a wonderful husband who loves me, despite my body. I have two cats who occasionally notice me. I keep telling myself it's enough. I keep telling myself to exist for one more day. For them. That there will be one more moment of intimacy with the man or the cats. He will kiss me one more time. One of them will climb into my lap and look up me. 

As the days and years grow longer, those moments feel ever smaller. I will be 40 soon, and all I want is for my heart to stop beating.
