Can't let this bleeding continue. I think this is a good time for me to go...Life have not been so kind to me. 

I have been giving and giving. I get nothing in return. I am almost broke living paycheck from paycheck. I turn 28 next month. I have $0 in retirement, I am going to work until I rot in the ground. After crisis after crisis, I had to break the piggy bank. I had plans to fix my teeth (born with a cleft pallet).

* Bed bugs that's $4K down the drain.
* Car completely breaks down. Repair too high, had to get a new one.
* Step father died and I have to take in my mentally disabled sister because no-one else cares. Not able to hold down a job or attend school.
* Uncle with pancreatitis and grandmother with heart condition constantly asking for money for meds not covered by medicare.
* Younger brother almost homeless living with his girlfriend. I give him $5K over that year, he promised that he will come back and help me out. He hasn't answered my texts or calls.
* Have to turn down dream job in Austin and work from home in this shithole because I can't afford to house, feed, and watch over two other adults.
* Mother health fails. Breaking the piggy bank for meds and bills not covered by medicare.
* Newer car breaks down. Still can't afford to fix it. I work from home and carry groceries from next door.
* Someone reaches out to me saying that he is my half brother. And my mother got pregnant at 16 with a much older man. She gave him up for adoption. I ignore it like a pulsating wound.
* Aunt who I barely heard of reaches out to me saying that my grandmother from father side died, my grandfather from father side is on his deathbed, my deadbeat father who I never seen in 15 years is seriously sick. I ignore it like a pulsating wound.
* Work fired my favorite co-worker with a bunch of other people. Constant nights and weekends as well as stress putting me on tasks without training. It destroyed any love I have left for my hobbies.
* Every time I take vacation (wasn't able to take one since Dec 2016), I have to use it to help family. I wanted to go to NYC and DC. Always wanted to go there in HS, but couldn't afford the $2,000 field trip.

I hate my life so much. People say will get better. It's been six years and it's only getting worse and it will only get worse from here. There are zero signs of it getting better. I am about to turn thirty in a couple of years, it's all downhill from here.

I have been thinking about a date and method for a while. Thinking about 21st. I have closet with 8 inch shelves, small chair, and a sturdy belt.
