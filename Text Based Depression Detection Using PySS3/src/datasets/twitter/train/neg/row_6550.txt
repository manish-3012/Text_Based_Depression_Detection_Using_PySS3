Venting, questionwanted to talk to something with maby getting feedback

I have been feeling more sad every year wich sucks a lot. Recently i stoped doing a lot of the things i enjoyed. Because i did not get the same satisfaction that i used to get. For example playing video games. If i look back at the time i played games i mainly did to forget and escape life. Now that i do try getting back in video games i just dont get the same feeling that i used to get when playing. 
Q: I am currently having vaction so suggestions of things i could do or new hobbys would mean a lot

I have not had any IRL friends for the last 3 years. Which i thought would be ok but now realise its absoletely not. There is not much to say other then it hurts
 
Good thing is i decided not to take my life. This is because i realise itâ€™s not that i dont want to live. But i dont want to live the way i do right now. 
Its 5 am when writing this havent slept yet so imma head to bed rn. For those that are still awake gn
