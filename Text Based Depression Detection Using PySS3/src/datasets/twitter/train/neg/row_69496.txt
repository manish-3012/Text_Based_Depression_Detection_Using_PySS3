Hello kind internet strangersI am gona be honest with you guys. Is it bad that everyday I get up I think of death? Like I don't even think about doing dangerous things that can kill me. I have one month of my holiday left before I go back to school and I don't think I am gona make it. I don't want to make it. I just want to close my eyes forever
