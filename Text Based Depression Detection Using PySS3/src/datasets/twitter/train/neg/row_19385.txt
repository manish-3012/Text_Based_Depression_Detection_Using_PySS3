A note from an alcoholic who pushed everyone awayI am drunk while typing this. Think that says everything you need to know. I've been through so many doctors, and counsellors and friends and none of them helped. Been on 5 different medications. It's not like they helped either. I am just alone. Nothing helps like alcohol. That sounds so bad when I type it out. 

I am just completely alone.

I have a job but they keep cutting my hours. I earn less and less each month. Still live with my parents. A fuck up in so many senses of the word. I just want people to let go. Everyday i wake up I wake up for someone else. I've never woken up for me. All I want to do is not wake up.

No one can stand me but they stay around because they pity me. It's such a pathetic exsistance. I just drink until I can barely stand then I get a taxi home. All my "friends" hate me for it. I don't blame them. I am not there to socialise I am there to drink.

I am a selfish bastard and should not be allowed to breathe. I take up so much space and it would really just be easier for everyone if I didn't exist. I just want to be let go. Why do you have to keep me here?
