I'm afraid of the void but I might just fall into it.I don't believe in the afterlife.

Death to me is a void and a ceasing of existence. Sure your body is probably still there but boi the mind and the life in you is gone cuz you're also biologically dead. Sort of getting off track but anyways...

I feel i'm on the top of a fence where I fall to my death or I fall short into life. 

I'm afraid of becoming nothing but there is this self-destructive yearning to become nothing but just a husk holding death. 

But then again the becoming nothing with no afterlife is the ultimate self destruction.

The Mark Twain predicament.
