Genuinely suicidal after betrayalThis isn't going to be long - this person that I care about so much has cheated on me 3 times in the past year. I don't understand why I'm so kind and end up taking them back into my arms everytime. I have never loved anyone as much as I love this person - but at this point I feel like I'm more in love with the person they used to be before the lies and secrets. 
I genuinely don't think I can do this anymore. I just found out the last time they cheated was 3 days ago. 
I just don't know what to do anymore.
