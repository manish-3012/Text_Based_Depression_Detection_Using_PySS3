I can't do it anymoreI've been struggling for so long and I just amn't cut out for this anymore. I was forced to drop out of college because I missed so much due to anxiety and depression. I now have no idea what I want to do with my life and I amn't smart enough to do anything anyway. I didn't get good grades in school and I don't have any skills. I can't do anything right and I just dont see the point anymore. All I'm doing by staying alive is hurting my boyfriend. I see the amount of pain I put him through every day and I although he tells me he couldn't live without me I know we'd both be better off if I was dead. I can't get out of bed in the morning anymore I'm just a failure and I don't want to be here anymore so why should i keep trying?
