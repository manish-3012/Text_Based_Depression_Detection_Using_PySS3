Life feels very messyThis is going to sound absolutely ridiculous.

My computer is messed up, my phone is broken, I don't think I can mantain decent grades anymore, I'm too lazy to do any work, I keep spending a gross 2 or 3 hrs on porn(even with blockers), but I don't feel addicted to it. I have so many things to read, thing to do and type, and just a lot of work. And I'm being lazy as hell which has made me a bit fatter and annoyed. I feel annoyed and angry and irritated. My sleep feels messed up. I can't stay up to finish anything. I spend way too much time avoiding work on other sites. My face feels extremely oily and my acne is being more active. I'm unable to get a shave properly. My skin feels a bit bad. I feel so conflicted in so many things. Time feels like it moves so fast. I suck at a lot of things and subjects. I'm lazy. I feel extremely unproductive.

Honestly I kind of just wanted to vent. I probably won't do it unless something big happens, but I really really want to.
