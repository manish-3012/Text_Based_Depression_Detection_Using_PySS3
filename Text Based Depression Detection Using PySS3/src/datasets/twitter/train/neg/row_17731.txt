Just tried to kill myself... Again.Not even an hour ago I tried to again. At first I tried to hold my breath and suffocate myself, chickened out. Then I looked up how to make a noose, realized I didn't have any rope. Then I went with a knife but got frustrated when it wouldn't cut my goddamn skin.

This makes the 4'th time I've attempted suicide. Hooray!
