I've never felt more alone and disappointedI missed my best chance to kill myself and I regret it more than ever. 

My caseworker just closed my case last week. She didn't seem to care too much. I didn't care enough to tell her that I'm still far from ok.

I'm on new meds. I've been diagnosed. Nothing's gotten better. 

I'm trying to change my plan now that there's so much snow on the ground and my room mates are back. Once I figure it out, that's it. I'm not missing another chance.
