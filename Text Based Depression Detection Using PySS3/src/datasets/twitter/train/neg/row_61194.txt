Failing college, just want a decent job...Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I made a similar post a little ago on this account, this is mainly me rehashing it with untold details. I'm a college student studying web development, and I'm not doing well in my classes at all. I'm probably going to fail my academic probation and be kicked out of the school. I don't understand Javascript, all I can do is basic stuff in HTML and CSS. All I want to do is get a decent paying job and be able to support myself. I won't be able to do that with just those skills, and especially not if I don't get a degree and tried to just get a job without one.

Supposedly suicide is never the answer. But if you aren't able to do the  basic thing that most adults are able to do, which is getting a decent job which you can support yourself on, then what is the point in continuing living? Especially when you know that is your biggest goal in life? I'd rather be dead than live as a failure.
