I have to die; only logical resolution to ongoing problems.Legal status instability, unemployment and underemployment, untreated mental illnesses for close to a decade, financial problems, no dreams or aspirations in life, no upper education, no career, no nothing. On top of it all I weigh on my family. Genuinely, if I were gone I'd lessen the load greatly. Both internal and external reasons; it'd be more irrational to stay alive. Survival instinct is stupid.
