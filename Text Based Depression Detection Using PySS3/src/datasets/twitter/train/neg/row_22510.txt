my life won't get better.i'm 17 years old. ive been waiting years for it to get better. i wish i was dead every single day. i hate myself so much. i'm so ugly and there's nothing special about me. i'm not talented, i dont get good grades. my friends all ignore me and i can't make new ones. i have nothing going for me and i can't imagine myself being alive past 19. i don't know why i was born this way. i didn't ask for it. i wish i wasnt still here
