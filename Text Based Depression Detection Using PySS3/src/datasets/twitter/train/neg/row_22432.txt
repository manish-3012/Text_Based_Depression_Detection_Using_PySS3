No more hopeI just found out today that Iâ€™ll need to schedule an appointment with my primary doctor to be recommended to a specialist for a possible rectal prolasping, or hemorrhages or whatever it is. It just isnâ€™t normal and now itâ€™s a big concern. Iâ€™m young and already struggling so much like everybody else. I was homeless from 17 until this year (now 22) and I already have to find another place to live before March. I have shitty health insurance that only lasts until the end of the year I think. I already have bad dental issues Iâ€™m trying to take care of and my appointment is before my birthday. Thatâ€™s already gonna cost me so much money, and now with the asshole issues Iâ€™m just spiraling. I got a new server job that I donâ€™t even want and havenâ€™t really started yet because Iâ€™ve been sick and am getting a Covid test. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s Covid, but you canâ€™t be too safe these days in 2020. Iâ€™m so tired of struggling. Iâ€™ve had to sacrifice my mental health for other more important priorities like making sure I can eat once a day is my eating disorder will allow me. Iâ€™m pretty sure my nana doesnâ€™t have much time left either and know thatâ€™ll be coming soon enough. I donâ€™t have any family besides my mom and her. My mom has her own sad story snd canâ€™t even help me besides emotional support, and I feel so damn guilty over that already. Whatâ€™s the point in anything anymore? Any light that has been in my life felt as if its all been ripped away from me. I feel another attempt again, and itâ€™s been 4 years since Iâ€™ve failed last time. I know Iâ€™d rather go through with succeeding to kill myself than to ever go back to any psych ward. Iâ€™ve wanted to attempt to kill myself the entire 3 weeks I was in there and quickly go out due to faking being better. Everything costs so much money that only less than 5% of people have and thereâ€™s nothing that would make anything better. Iâ€™m sorry that it might seem selfish only thinking about myself. I just canâ€™t fight this anymore. Thereâ€™s no hope left. There hasnâ€™t been for a long time.
