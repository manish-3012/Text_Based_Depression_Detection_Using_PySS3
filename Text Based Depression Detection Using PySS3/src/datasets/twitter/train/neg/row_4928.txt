How do I not feel like this is inevitable?When I'm in the calm of my depression I think everything is okay but my mind doesn't give up on suicide. I think about it constantly. It feels sickening. It's almost as if my body knows it's not what I want, but my mind is malfunctioning and is forcing the entire system, that is me, to shut down. I used to always think I could stay so long as it means I don't hurt anyone by leaving, but I can't find it in me anymore.

It's not that I don't care about anyone else...it's not even that I care about me...it's that I can't feel anything else to hold onto. It's like I'm not even a person. I know I have it under control just enough to hang in there for a while, but I'm terrified bc I feel like the outcome I want, but wish I could overcome, is inevitable. I feel alone in this and wish there was a way to get stronger, but it's getting harder to bottle it up.
