Sometimes I feel like I am never going to get a girlfriend.Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts because I feel like I am never going to get a girlfriend. I am 20 years old and every relationship I have ever had only lasted a week. I am nothing but nice to girls but they just act like I am boring. I donâ€™t see how I am boring considering that I am a music producer. I just really feel lost and need help.
