why do i still feel like thisi constantly fluctuate between a ridiculous amount of happiness or horrible depression. i donâ€™t know why i still want to kill myself so badly. i have a girlfriend who iâ€™m in love with and my home life is whatever and i have great friends but i still find myself planning what outfit to wear when i do it, what iâ€™m going to do. the only thing keeping me alive is packages that i ordered. i would have probably tried something tonight if i didnâ€™t see my girlfriend tomorrow. i donâ€™t know if this is considered serious enough to post here but i domt know where else to put it.

i think iâ€™m going to end up trying it eventually, i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen if it doesnâ€™t work. i am not allowed to be screened for depression or stuff like as i am a minor and my parents kind of rule my decisions. granted, i havenâ€™t told my mom i wanted to kill myself but she is strictly against medication and hospitalization and stuff like that. just essential oils and good old fashion christian therapists. 

i know i shouldnâ€™t want to kill myself and iâ€™ve brought it up to my girlfriend a few times but i always end up reassuring her that iâ€™m not going to actually do it when i think i am. i still have stuff to do like make sure my pets are taken care of and maybe reconcile with some people. 

i feel like if i try to kill myself itâ€™s a win/win. i either die and donâ€™t have to deal with this anymore or someone will take me serious for once. i think late july is what my brain is set on but iâ€™m not really set on a time.
