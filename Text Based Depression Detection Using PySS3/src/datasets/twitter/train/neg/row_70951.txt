I'm ugly and Have nothing to love.First, I think I'm ugly. I've told myself time and time again that I'm not but I know I am. I'm a fat fuck and I simply hate life. Everything I've ever loved other than my My mom and sisters has died. I have nightmares constantly about my dog's death. I can't sleep with peace. I have very few people to talk to. And I have nobody to talk to about this especially. I can't do anything right. I want to just end it all. All of my stress coupled with school has made me consider suicide on several occasions. I have no will to live. Every moment I'm here is pain unless I'm at home alone all because I'm too timid to talk to anybody. I don't think my post will get any attention. I'm not here because I'm an attention whore, don't get me wrong. I need help. Sorry if I caused any trouble. Pm or kik me if you can. I'm alone and ready to die.
