My best friend will betray me tomorrow morning.My closest friend, who I've built an immense amount of trust with, who helped me through the worst parts of my depression, who stuck with me and never told a soul what I told him, is going to tell another friend of mine everything. I told him that I self harmed, that I had suicidal thoughts, even that I was bisexual. I told him everything there is to say. Now he'll tell someone and I'm fucking furious. 5 months of building up trust, and he stabs me in the back just like that.

I'll go to sleep now, and get up in about 7 hours or so. If it doesn't get better, I'm done.
