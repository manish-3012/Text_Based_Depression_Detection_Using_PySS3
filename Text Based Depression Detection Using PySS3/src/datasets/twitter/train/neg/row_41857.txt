I don't know how to be happyI genuinely don't know how people can be happy. How they just carry on doing and enjoy doing things. Sure not all of everyone's life is great, but they still find happiness in something and want to live. 

I don't feel any of that. I don't find happiness in anything. I don't want anything out of life. I don't want friendship, love, kids, to travel, work, study, play games, learn a skill. Nothing. I just want to lie in bed, shut off my mind and sleep. All I think about is how great it would be to just stop. Just vanish from the world, because in a way, Im not living right now anyways.  

 I think a lot about overdosing or jumping from a bridge. I haven't went through with it only because I know that my mum would blame herself and suffer. I couldn't do that to her. I've wrote a note just incase, but I think I'll only go when she goes. She's all that matters. She brought me into this world and I feel so bad that I can't enjoy it and be who she thought I would be.   

I just can't wait for this to all be over with.
