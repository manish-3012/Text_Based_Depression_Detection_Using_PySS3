I want to goI made a post in r/offmychest about how I hope there's something after death. But a person commented saying that there's overwhelming evidence that suggests there isn't and to just enjoy my life. I'm not religious but the thought of some afterlife gave me hope. That hope is vanquished. I can't enjoy life knowing I'll eventually be nothing. I can't enjoy life knowing I'll never see the loved ones I lost ever again. The thought of suicide always gave me comfort, but even that's starting to fade. I just want peace. I want there to be something after life. I'm crying right now because I just can't take it. Everything that I held on to for comfort, happiness, etc doesn't do that anymore. Video games no longer give me pleasure. My motivation to pursue my goals is no longer there. Nothing else matters. There's no point in going on. I just want this to be over.
