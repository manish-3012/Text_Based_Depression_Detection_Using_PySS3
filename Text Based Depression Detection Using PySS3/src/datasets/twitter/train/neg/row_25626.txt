It never really does get better.Every time I feel like Iâ€™m getting better or that maybe I can keep going on with my life, something will happen that turns it all around and takes away all my hope all over again. Or maybe nothing drastic happens at all, just a feeling that usually comes at night that makes me lose feelings. Itâ€™s just a cycle and I donâ€™t wanna live with that cycle. I wish I could stop thinking all together. Nothing really gets â€œbetterâ€ I just distract myself until the very next time I feel bad again.
