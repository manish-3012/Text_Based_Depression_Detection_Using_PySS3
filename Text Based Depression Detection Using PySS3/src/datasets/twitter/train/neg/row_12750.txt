I feel trapped...I read a post that said that people who attempted suicide ended up losing many of their friends and family, who started to avoid them like the plague...

I won't do that... The consequences would be too high...

It's like I only have two choices... To keep on fighting, telling people what I don't like and moving on, or giving up, try to die to them probably lose many people...

What could I do?
