Sunk back into horrible depressionI don't see the point in living on this planet anymore, I've got no real friends and they don't care about my feelings, nobody ever wants to talk to me, my so called friends just keep abandoning me, unfriending me, I'm gay but I'm so ugly I'll never have a boyfriend, and my crush told my friends I was sexually harassing him which is so untrue because he sexted me first, and I thought he fucking liked being treated special because nobody treats him special irl

So fuck you Jake the Snake, you piece of shit, I hope you enjoy your sad, lonely life after I'm dead.
