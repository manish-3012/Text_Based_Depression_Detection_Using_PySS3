I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m suicidal, just depressed but no other subreddit seems to help with this.I feel like a husk a lot of the time, rarely feel anything, donâ€™t have interests, or strong opinions. The only strong emotion I feel is pain when Iâ€™m alone which is more than I care to admit. This has been happening for most of my life. I am fairly smart but I donâ€™t care to do anything with it. I am pretty ugly, I had a girlfriend for two years, idk how, but ever since she broke up with me, I havenâ€™t been the same. We broke up almost 9 months ago and I still hurt every day from it. She wasnâ€™t a bitch or anything about it, she was nice about it but I just miss her. I have never been close with anyone for more than three years and I had the illusion she would be different. I was wrong. I used to do well in school but my gpa has dropped 0.5 since then. I have no interests, I have friends but half of them graduated last year and the others have jobs so we never talk. I donâ€™t know who the fuck I am or what I like. I just know that it probably isnâ€™t good for this to be happening to me. Iâ€™m not good socially, Iâ€™m not attractive, I donâ€™t have good work ethic, I have never done something creative in my life, Iâ€™m not even that clever, all I have going for me is being able to learn things fairly fast but I ruined that with what happened with my gpa. I literally donâ€™t see any redeemable qualities about myself, Iâ€™ve volunteered and helped people but only because my dad has made me do it to try to help me grow up learning how to help others. But here I am, Iâ€™ve never done it just because I want to. I donâ€™t know if everyone goes through this or feels this way or not and I donâ€™t know if I need therapy not to mention Iâ€™m too scared to admit to needing it if I do. I just need help understanding everything I guess.
