Need to talk to someoneI don't wanna sound like a whining kid or anything, but I'm a 17 year old who's in a pretty dark place right now, and I can't talk to anyone in real life, and don't want to say anything publicly online where everyone can see it. I don't even know if someone will reply to this, but at least I tried... thank you to anyone willing to help a little
