Nothing left to give, hope it all ends soonTonight I stood in the mirror and looked at my face covered in tears and I started to cry even more because I wish I could just end it all but I'm too scared. I feel like I can't do anything right, not even kill myself. I just feel so pathetic. It's gotten to the point where I'm too scared to open up to anyone because no one gets it. I told a friend I was feeling suicidal maybe a month ago, and she told me she couldn't "fathom" wanting to kill yourself, and that she'd "never understand". How do you explain to someone that you hate every fibre of your being, that you are disgusted by your own thoughts and personality, that looking in the mirror repulses you, that you wish you could love yourself like everyone preaches but no matter how hard you try you just can't? That hate your entire existence? How do you make them understand? The only friend who ever truly understood me cut me off completely which ate a part of my soul away and I've never recovered. It's getting too much to bear.

There was one thing I had to look forward to - I was going back to the place I lived overseas and a friend was going to come along with me. I was excited to show them around introduce them to the place that made me happier than I'd been in a long time, but due to coronavirus she cancelled her flights and now I'm going alone. I feel stupid being mad about it but I guess she values her life whereas if I caught the virus I genuinely wouldn't care because I'd just get the ending I wanted anyway. I guess I know it's not that big of a deal but it just felt like a kick in the guts, another declaration from the universe that I'm not supposed to be happy.

Yeah I just don't know how long I can go on with this emptiness and loneliness. I hope I get the balls to end it as soon as possible.
