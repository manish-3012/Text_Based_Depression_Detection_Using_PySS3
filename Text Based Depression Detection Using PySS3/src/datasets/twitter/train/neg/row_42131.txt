flare upHey; don't know what to do right now so I thought I'd try and talk about. I'v attempted suicide last year and have since recovered; leading a norma studentl life for the most part. At certain times when I'm really stressed I still think about, and now is one of those times. This may sound really stupid but I'm also really self\-conscious so here we go. I had a haircut last week and for some reason I got it into my head to ask her to cut the fringe off completely. One of the only things I like about myself is my long hair and I feel absolutely awful, ugly and vulnerable now. I'm meant to go on holiday next week and I was really looking forward to it; I just don't want to go with hair like this. It's like my mind is a short\-circuit and won't let me out; constantly regretting my decision and thinking things would be so much better if I had asked to keep it long \(which they probably would be\). I desperately want to change things that can't be change and when I get that feeling the overall feeling is; dying is the only way out of this. So, should I push through and go next week, hoping it's grown out back then, or just take some time off and miss it but also miss what I'v been looking forward too for a year, and how do I deal with all this in a way that I come out alive.
