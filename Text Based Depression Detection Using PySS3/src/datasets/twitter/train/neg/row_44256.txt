Going to try again later todayOnce again Im going to try and end it. Ive tried to get help but nothing and ppl who I thought cared don't care anymore at least not since I told them I was gay. The only person who even wants to talk to me is my boyfriend and I hate that what I might do will crush him but I have to much pain im tired of going to bed and waking up wishing it would just stop but It wont stop. All people say is it gets better I'm tired of waiting for it to get better if anything it just gets worse and after 5 years I have no hope anymore. And ppl will never understand who I am.
