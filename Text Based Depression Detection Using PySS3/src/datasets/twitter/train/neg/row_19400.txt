I am past the point of feeling suicidal.I hate my life. I don't feel anything at all, and I just want it to all be over, but unfortunately I am so bad at life I can't even fucking kill myself. Since age 13 I have tried killing myself 11 times and I was only caught the last time because I posted it on Facebook. I spent three days in a mental hospital and it was the worst time of my life. I felt like I was a sub-human, and now here I am picking fights on Reddit and other places just to feel something. I don't feel like anything is real. I feel dizzy and like I don't belong in my own body. I don't have friends, and I've fucked up every relationship I've ever had because I am so self-destructive. Whenever I hear sounds at night I pray that it's someone who's going to kill me while I sleep because after 11 times I can't do it myself.   
Edit; I keep refreshing the page hoping that someone commented. I fucking hate myself.
