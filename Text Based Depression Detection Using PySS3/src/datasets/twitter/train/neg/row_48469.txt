Admit myself into hospital?Hello, has anyone voluntarily admitted themselves into a psych ward to prevent yourself from going crazy and commit suicide?

Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide since middle school. I am currently on my honeymoon and Iâ€™ve had a hard time controlling my anger towards my husband. He threatened to beat me up because I told him not disrespect the country and king of Thailand. Which can be illegal and you can go to jail for it. Iâ€™ve received many threats from him before over silly things and I try to stay calm but lately I canâ€™t hold it in and I unleash my anger. Now I feel pretty down and we are thinking of getting a divorce. He wanted to sleep with other girls. We are both at fault but mainly me for my anger but I just feel like a bad person. 

Anyways I feel like shit and just want to jump off the 32 floor of our hotel room or hag myself. I keep trying to logically reason with myself but I just want to give up. I ignored the red flags for the first three years. This honeymoon opened my eyes and made me realize I married the wrong person. Iâ€™m so alone and just want to go away. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want to talk to a therapist because I donâ€™t want him to go to jail. Just go on my merry way or not exist anymore. Even if I told his parents they wouldnâ€™t believe me because itâ€™s their son, I donâ€™t want them to be involved. No cops either.
