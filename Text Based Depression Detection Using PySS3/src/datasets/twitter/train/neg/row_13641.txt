Just lost my best and one of the people i only got to talk to consistently after two yearsI'm feeling like trash and extremely down and suicidal for the first time in about 6 months, I was finally starting to improve but now my best friend is gone and I don't know what to do. I've been crying to hours and am lying in my bed unable to get up. I don't know why or understand.

I'm A, she's L.


[14/06/2013 7:46:52 p.m.] L: Well since no one is talking to me I guess I am gonna go to bed, night.

[14/06/2013 7:47:07 p.m.] A: You can talk to me :)

[14/06/2013 7:47:17 p.m.] A: I'm hella bored and lonely right now

[14/06/2013 7:47:37 p.m.] L: I dont want to voice chat though (since i have been crying all night)

[14/06/2013 7:48:02 p.m.] A: Why have you been crying?

[14/06/2013 7:49:02 p.m.] L: Because the fires in colorado

[14/06/2013 7:49:11 p.m.] A: ???

[14/06/2013 7:50:47 p.m.] L: Huge fire, the worst in colorado history (beat out last years fire) this one has been going for 3 days and its already burned 15000 acres and 380 homes. And the royal gorge, which is home to the tallest bridge in the US. I have memories of me and my dad there. and 48 of the 52 buildings burned, with damage to the bridge and the tram that takes you over the deep as gorge has also been destroyed.

[14/06/2013 7:50:59 p.m.] L: and last year the flying w ranch was burnt all the fucking way down

[14/06/2013 7:51:50 p.m.] A: Wow, I don't know anything about it :(

[14/06/2013 7:52:06 p.m.] A:  /hug

[14/06/2013 7:52:39 p.m.] A: You can wipe your tears on my shoulder

[14/06/2013 7:55:02 p.m.] L: And people have been letting their horses go and taping their info to them or writing it on their halters, horses have a better chance of escape if they are free, and some people werent home (so neighbors did it for them) and some people don't have trailers

[14/06/2013 7:55:37 p.m.] A: Do you want to talk about the fire?

[14/06/2013 7:56:09 p.m.] L: I want to kill whoever started it.  Thats what  I want, I want them burned alive like people and animals already have.

[14/06/2013 7:56:28 p.m.] A: =/

[14/06/2013 7:57:21 p.m.] A: I wish I could give you a hug :(

[14/06/2013 7:58:58 p.m.] L: =( It makes me sick to watch my home burn

[14/06/2013 7:59:10 p.m.] A: I know how you feel :(

[14/06/2013 8:00:00 p.m.] L: Because you had the earth quake a while back right?

[14/06/2013 8:00:06 p.m.] A: yeah

[14/06/2013 8:00:17 p.m.] L: =/ Its a terrible feeling

[14/06/2013 8:00:27 p.m.] A: Yeah, it's pretty shitty

[14/06/2013 8:01:00 p.m.] L: It is, I mean all i can think about is how awful it must be to lose everything you love... to not know if your pets or loved ones are okay

[14/06/2013 8:01:17 p.m.] A: Yeah :(

[14/06/2013 8:02:21 p.m.] L: Ugh. My anxiety and stress have been waaaay much more then usual

[14/06/2013 8:02:34 p.m.] A: I understand, going to sleep is probably a good idea

[14/06/2013 8:02:54 p.m.] L: I am not tired though

[14/06/2013 8:02:58 p.m.] A: Ahhh

[14/06/2013 8:04:00 p.m.] A: Well I'm more then happy to sit here with you, I can't make things better though :(

[14/06/2013 8:05:21 p.m.] L: I know, no one can.. i think this may be why Thor has chosen to come into my life now, he comes when we need strength

[14/06/2013 8:05:31 p.m.] A: I see

[14/06/2013 8:09:19 p.m.] L: &lt;Link&gt;

[14/06/2013 8:10:36 p.m.] A: That's really good :)

[14/06/2013 8:11:03 p.m.] L: &lt;Link&gt;

[14/06/2013 8:12:23 p.m.] A: damn

[14/06/2013 8:17:36 p.m.] L: &lt;link&gt; edited it

[14/06/2013 8:23:52 p.m.] A: It really sucks :(

[14/06/2013 8:25:29 p.m.] L: It does.

[14/06/2013 8:26:08 p.m.] L: the least i can do is try and get them some donations

[14/06/2013 8:26:16 p.m.] A: Yeah, you're really kind :)

[14/06/2013 8:26:53 p.m.] L: I would even be willing to take some revealing pics if it got more peoples attention and get them to donate

[14/06/2013 8:27:48 p.m.] A: That isn't probably a good idea

[14/06/2013 8:28:30 p.m.] L: Why

[14/06/2013 8:29:15 p.m.] A: Because it won't help

[14/06/2013 8:29:37 p.m.] L: Um it will, it'll bring in more people who see it, and then more people will donate

[14/06/2013 8:31:12 p.m.] A: People did that with Christchurch, it didn't help

[14/06/2013 8:31:40 p.m.] L: Or is it just you having a problem with me getting basically naked?

[14/06/2013 8:31:53 p.m.] A: OH

[14/06/2013 8:32:02 p.m.] A: I thought you meant revealing pics of the disaster

[14/06/2013 8:32:38 p.m.] L: BS

[14/06/2013 8:32:57 p.m.] A: you really don't believe me?

[14/06/2013 8:33:12 p.m.] L: Revealing pics of the disaster? that makes no sense

[14/06/2013 8:33:25 p.m.] A: Like corpses and things

[14/06/2013 8:34:36 p.m.] L: YES because they allow people to march into a mandatory evacuation zone to take pictures of burnt people, only 2 people have died so far. Not even news crews are allowed in

[14/06/2013 8:35:25 p.m.] A: Well, it's your call to believe me or not

[14/06/2013 8:35:53 p.m.] L: And im not even in colorado you know this, so clearly you are back tracking

[14/06/2013 8:36:05 p.m.] A: Whatever

[14/06/2013 8:36:46 p.m.] L: Am I wrong? You know I am not in colorado

[14/06/2013 8:36:59 p.m.] A: I have no idea where you are

[14/06/2013 8:37:07 p.m.] A: you know how trash my memory is

[14/06/2013 8:37:24 p.m.] L: Bullshit, I have told you 10000 times where I am, there is no way you have forgotten
