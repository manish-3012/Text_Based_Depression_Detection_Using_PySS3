School is unbearableI'm currently at a political sciences institutes, this is the only school that i like since they are the only in france to propose all what i like. But since the first note it has started to be unbearable, all of them are too low and no one wants to help me, all the professors, all the students, all the psychologist, they ignore or refuse me like the universitary psy center because they have not enough room for me. I never talked about it to my parents and i still don't want. I'm starting to become crazy, all what's at school makes me want to end my life but everything else in my life makes me want to continue and i'm completly thorn apart. IDK what can i do now, with the exams coming in may i'm really starting to be really scared, but by something scarier than death itself. I'm completly loss. Internet is my last option, please help me i don't know what could i do.
