What do I do?One of my close friends is more suicidal than usual lately and the only thing I can think of to help him involves me threatening to leave him and I think it would be too hard on him right now. What do I do?

So basically my friend has pretty bad depression/bpd and heâ€™s tried to kill himself before but thankfully he has terrible luck when it comes to that. Recently I thought he actually managed to do it when I didnâ€™t hear from him for two weeks but it turns out heâ€™d been in the hospital after a pretty bad one. Now, tonight, he disappeared again, and although Iâ€™m devastatedly worried, heâ€™ll probably be fine, and he also lives in another country so I canâ€™t reach him myself or even call the police. (itâ€™s only been a few hours and maybe just went to sleep early, Iâ€™m worried but heâ€™ll probably be ok, though Iâ€™m very open to suggestions on things I can do to make sure he is)

But the problem is what I should do when he gets back. You see, most of his troubles lately have been from a toxic relationship heâ€™s in right now, but he canâ€™t stop himself from seeing this guy because he craves the attention so bad. Iâ€™ve tried talking him out of it, telling him Iâ€™d do anything for him to stop seeing this guy but itâ€™s useless because even he knows the relationship is toxic. The only idea I have left is to say that if he doesnâ€™t break up with this guy, I canâ€™t talk to him anymore. At first I thought it was exclusively for his benefit but when I thought about it, I canâ€™t keep thinking heâ€™s dead every couple of weeks and keep my mental health. If I can stand my ground on this, Iâ€™m almost certain itâ€™ll be enough since weâ€™re pretty close. But I also donâ€™t want it too be too much for him, and have him die for real because of something I did. Is there something else I can do, or do I have to risk it?
