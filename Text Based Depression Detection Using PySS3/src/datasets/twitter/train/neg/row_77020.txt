Resources available?Friend of mine attempted to kill herself today, not the first time, though its been a number of years since the last incident.  Has a very young child with her physically abusive ex-husband, she currently has custody but I expect this may very well change that.  She's on 72 hour watch in the local hospital atm, unknown what will happen after that.

Anyone with more knowledge of these situations have any idea what resources may be available? I don't know where to begin, and I'd like to have some options or ideas to offer her.
