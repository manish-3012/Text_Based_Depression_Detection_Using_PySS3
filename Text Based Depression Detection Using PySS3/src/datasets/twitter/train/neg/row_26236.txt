I'm back. I'm worse.I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/37nwqp/set_a_date_writing_letters_now/) almost a month ago, but I don't think anyone really understood my situation,  which always seems to happen. In a way. It makes it worse, which is why I don't like sharing things with people. 

I started cutting a few days after I posted, first time I've ever done it hopefully the last as well. I don't know what urged me to do it, it was like a a feeling in my stomach that wouldn't go away unless I hurt myself. 

I want to get away from everyone and everything. Including my family. I want a fresh start where no one knows me. But I'm too young and at the same time I don't want to leave people behind. I want to start fights with people and feel something but I don't want the drama that comes with telling people their faults. I want to spill my feelings out to someone but I don't want the awkwardness or rejection. I want to be awesome in my exams but I can't be bothered to do the revision. All I feel is isolated like if I do anything it'll end up with my sadness. That it will make everything so much worse for my own depression. That it will make me hate the world more. That it'll make me want to die more.

I can't stand living like this and I don't know what to do. If I tell someone it'll make things worse. If I don't tell someone my friends ask why I don't open up to them. There are so many people that just seem to be in much worse situations, I just feel guilty to be like this.
