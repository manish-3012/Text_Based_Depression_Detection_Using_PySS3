killing myself in a monthI already know where to get the pills to overdose on. im so empty and long gone I dont even have the effort or strength to keep typing here. I cant feel anything anymore. I'm so broken beyond repair. I would kill myself tonight but first I need money to pay the drug dealer. I want the pain to stop I want it everything to just stop.... it's so unbearable and I'm trapped....
