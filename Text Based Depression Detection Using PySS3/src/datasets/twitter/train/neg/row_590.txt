"Suicide is selfish", "permanent solution to a temporary problem". Bullshit.I have heard these for years. It drives me fucking insane. I find it amazing people don't see the blatant hypocrisy.

They think it is selfish for someone to kill themselves, and put their family through pain. But somehow, they don't see it as selfish that they expect someone who is suffering to keep living so that their family or friends don't have to suffer through the loss.

Like really, as if it is isn't enough of a shitty deal to be depressed and suicidal, they have to stick you with the guilt of being selfish for wanting to just be done with it all. Unreal. And I'm the selfish one?

Oh, and my other favorite. "Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem." Yeah, ok. Spoken like someone who has no idea what chronic depression is like. There is nothing temporary about it. It is forever. You might get some brief breaks from it, but it's never gone for good.
