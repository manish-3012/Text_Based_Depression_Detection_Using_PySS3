Back to the wasteland of my own mindMy divorce finalized in January. My wife admits last night sheâ€™s been sleeping with someone I know for over a year. Fighting the urge to hurt myself or others. I knew it was coming but the fact that itâ€™s been going on with someone I know while she was sleeping with me makes me sick to my stomach. She took my kids, house and now my dignity. I want to be committed so I donâ€™t hurt anyone. But thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™d ever see my kids if I did. Itâ€™d look bad if I take her to court for custody. Fml put me in the dirt
