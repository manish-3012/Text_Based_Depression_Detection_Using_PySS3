I have no idea what im doing.I'm 25 living at home. I fell for a girl who is 36. My whole life I have been suicidal well since i was in 4th grade. when i was in 2nd grade i was put in a mental hospitle for being suicidle. they put me on depressants and anti depresants at the same time. told me i wanted to kill myself. now im in love with a 36 year old  she sems to fncy me as well which is good. but theres a problem im transgender. she dont know i dont want to tel her so i cut my beautiful lkng hair cut mu perfict nails. now im depressed but thats nothing new i get that way at th drop of a hat. i ate eberything about my self im a ugly fatass who will never amount to anything i deserve the most painfuly slow death even burning alive isnt slow and painful enough. i daydream about my death. im fucked up.
