Feeling weirdly blank.I don't really know how to describe this, but the last few days I'm feeling suicidal, but am not sure why. My life was a roller-coaster for a while, but now everything is pretty okay. I'm not even depressed. Unless maybe somehow my depression has morphed. Is that possible?

I just keep fantasizing about destroying all my stuff, going down to the beach, and just swimming out into the ocean. 

But again, I'm not feeling depressed. Or anything at all really. I just feel like a blank slate. It's like "Yeah, I guess I could go on, but I don't really want to, so I'm just going to call it a life, good game everyone." 

I've never felt like this before. I'm not even really afraid of the pain, which is usually my biggest suicide deterrent. 

Yeah, I don't know what else to say. It's just really weird. I am feeling nothing as I type this. None of the negative emotions I used to feel that led me to being suicidal in the past.
