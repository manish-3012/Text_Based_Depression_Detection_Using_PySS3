I don't want to dieI'm on a ssri and I take hydroxyzine for acute anxiety. This usually suffices to keep me numb enough to function. Sometimes the darkness just washes over me though and I feel surrounded by decay. Somewhere beneath it all is a stillness and a rage quietly in bloom like a midnight flower.
