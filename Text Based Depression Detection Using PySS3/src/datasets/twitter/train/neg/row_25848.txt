TiredThe other times Iâ€™ve felt like doing something Iâ€™ve felt this deep sadness that I need to escape from. And I feel that now, too. I feel sad, and I feel lonely, and frustrated, and so, so exhausted. But I also just feel sort ofâ€¦ resigned? Like, it just makes sense at this point. I am scared, still. Iâ€™m scared of messing it up, mostly.

I know thereâ€™s probably going to be some pain or discomfort involved no matter what method I use. If I could get an endless supply of morphine and just load up on it and fade away that would be ideal, but I donâ€™t know that thatâ€™s really possible. Iâ€™m sure even if I didnâ€™t take it into my own hands it would hurt at least a little when it happened, however it happens. I have a rope already, Iâ€™ve had it for about eight months now. I bought it around New Yearâ€™s, when I was having thoughts like this again (that wasnâ€™t the first time Iâ€™d had thoughts, or bought a rope, even, just the most recent). Iâ€™ve thought about doubling up on methods, somehow, to give a higher chance of it working. I donâ€™t want to mess up. I think I could probably do it. I live alone and itâ€™s not uncommon for me to go days without talking to anyone, except for work, I guess, but I could do it on a Friday or a longer break. I was thinking around New Yearâ€™s, actually.

I went to the doctor, yesterday. He was really nice. I was talking and my voice was breaking and he rolled across the room in his rolly chair to move the tissue box closer to me. I have a prescription to go pick up. Iâ€™m supposed to look at the list of counselorâ€™s heâ€™ll be sending. Itâ€™s been years of this, now. With long stretches of feeling sort of okay, sure. Iâ€™ve tried medication, and therapy. Iâ€™m not saying they donâ€™t work, ever, for anyone. Iâ€™m just saying itâ€™s been years upon years, now. The thought of trying, trying and trying and trying so hard just for a chance at feeling sort of okay, for a while, maybe, is so exhausting. Some things have changed over the years, sure, because theyâ€™ve had to. But a lot havenâ€™t. And Iâ€™m getting so tired. I say that every time. Iâ€™m so tired, I donâ€™t know how much more I can take. But Iâ€™m really so, so tired. I donâ€™t know how much more I can take.
