what the fuck am i missingim trying really fucking hard to be okay, ive done nothing but try to fix myself and im only getting fucking worse what am i supposed to do, im so fucked man im so fucked i dont know what to do, im lost and alone and scared as fuck. im 17 and ive been so suicidal for years now, i dont know what to do, nobody knows what i can do so they gave up on me. everybody gave up on me i wish they didnt i miss so many people i really wish they were still here. i dont feel much anymore just empty. im not even sad anymore, the emptiness hurts but its not sadness. i wish i was sad or angry, i just dont care anymore, ive completely fucking given up, im done, what the fuck am i supposed to do its fucking rigged man no matter what i do i end up worse i cant be fucking bothered this is so bullshit. so bullshit, how is everyone so much happier than me why do i deserve this im a fucking child and ive felt dead since 14. why man why.

the only time anyone shows me any compassion is when my mother is crying about me, and she only does that when other people such as doctors or counsellors get involved yet when i firste reachecd out to her a\nad told her i was going tos kill myself she laughed at me. i wont make it to 20. i wont get married. i wont have children. i wont have a job or my own car or anything meaningful because im too much of a lazy depressed cunt to do anything other than dream of suicide and hide in my room fuck. i just want to jump man i cant deal with it, i keep slipping. things keep looking good for a moment then i end up here again. always here again. fuck
