I see opportunities... High buildings, trains, speeding cars, trucks, places to hang myselfIt just doesn't feel good...

Every opportunity I see, I'm just doubting

I didn't do it... but just the fact that I'm so deep in my mind when these opportunities appear... it makes me feel like... I won't feel anything :/
