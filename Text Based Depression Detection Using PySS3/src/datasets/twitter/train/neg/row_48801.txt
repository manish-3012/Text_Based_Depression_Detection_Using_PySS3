i don't want to be here anymorethings aren't that bad in my life, but yet i still find myself longing for it to end. the voices in my head, the paranoia, telling me that everyone around me is against me, that they all hate me, gets stronger every day, to the point where i feel so uncomfortable interacting with anyone in any way. i want it to end. last week, i was contemplating writing a note, so if it happens, people know why, but i thought if no one cares, what's the point of writing one. i needed to just let it all out, because i don't know anyone in my life i feel comfortable telling right now.

i want to fall, and never get back up again.
