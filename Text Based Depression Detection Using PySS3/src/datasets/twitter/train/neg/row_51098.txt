Uselessness and a waste of a fatherBeen diagnosed with Bi-Polar, anxiety and sever depression. I also suffer daily dabilitating migraines. What is there is left to live for. I miss all my kids events. They never visit or text or call. Neither do they respond to my texts. 

I am done. Been working up to ending my life. My plan is in motion.

Thanx for the rant...

See you on the other side
