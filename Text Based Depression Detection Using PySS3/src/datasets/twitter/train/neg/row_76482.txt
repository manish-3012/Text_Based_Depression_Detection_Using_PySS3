My brother said that he was suicidal. I don't know what to do. Please help me.Hey reddit. Today I was at home after school while my parents went to go pick up my brother from work. I went to go talk to my brother but then my mom shushed me. My brother went upstairs and she told me that in the car, he told them that he didn't see the point of living anymore, that he was a loser and nobody loved him. I never suspected him to be depressed, he was always very happy and is really good at hiding his emotions. I'm really scared reddit, please help me. Some background info: I'm a 14 year old girl, he's an 18 year old male uni student that's back for summer vacation.
EDIT: Thank you for all if the advice.
