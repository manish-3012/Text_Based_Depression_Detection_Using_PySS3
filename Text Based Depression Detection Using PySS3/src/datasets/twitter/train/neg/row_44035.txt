I'm tired of life. I'm retardedIn have horrible people skills, yet I deal with customers on a day to day basis at work. I get confused easily and am forgetful, I feel bad that my coworkers have to work with me. I recently had a manager joke that they talk about me a lot in the chat (a messenger group of all the managers where they can text each other stuff) then she kind of stumbled over her words and said "all good things of course". I doubt they're discussing how good of an employee I am, the sad thing is that I'm actually trying.

Im currently a senior in high school, have had other kids comment on how stupid I am, and I agree with them. I realize that I'm stupid and awkward. I feel like I'm trapped, life just isn't worth it.
