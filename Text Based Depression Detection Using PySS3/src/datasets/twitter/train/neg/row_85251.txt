I'm out of hopeWell... Where to begin. I'm mildly autistic, 35, and I have polycystic kidneys. My wife asked me for a divorce 2 weeks ago because she just needs her freedom... And I can't bring myself to be angry with her.

Today I found out my kidneys are dying, and I'm unemployed and unemployable due to a history of severe depression and anxiety. I've got no income, and won't have anything for a long time.

I'm living with my family right now, but they have no idea how to deal with me. My father last night raged against me for wanting to go see the solar eclipse, accusing me of abusing my family. I'm afraid of being depressed around them because it's always taken as a personal attack.

I'm sitting here weighing the honest value of my life. Among all the folks in the world, I'm nothing. No job, no wife, no value. People care about me but... Everytime I need help I'm turned away. I'm medicated and going through counseling, but this is just too much.

I just want the pain to stop.
