I will follow youRecently I've fallen in love with a woman and the situation is real fucked up.

 I've been in many loving and long relationships in the past but I have never felt like this for someone. We're amazing together and for each other but circumstances have kept us apart and forced us into secrecy. 

She struggles with Bipolar disorder and came very close to killing herself last night, overwhelmed by the fact that we can't be together and everything that stands in the way...  I can't tell her (she should already know),  I won't guilt her into staying alive but if she dies... I'm going with her
