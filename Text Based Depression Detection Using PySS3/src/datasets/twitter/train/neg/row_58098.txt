I cant do this anymore, I'm crying. I'm so weak and i hate my self.I've had social anxiety my whole life and now that's not my biggest problem. My vision is. Everyone think I'm crazy my friend and my family. They think I'm making things up. But I'm not. I'm going to the doctor's tomorrow and I'm so scared. If I get told I'm going blind I'll end my life. Up untill now I thought I was emotionless and I thought I hated everyone. But today had proved that to be false. Its took the fear of blindness to realise that i love my family and friends. And now I'm gonna kill my self. I deserve this I've waste all 18 years of my life. I'm so sorry
