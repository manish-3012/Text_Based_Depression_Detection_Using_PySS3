I'm Getting Kicked OutSo I've finally reached the tipping point, my mother's kicking me out after being unemployed for a year now. My most recent job interview was a disaster, I got nervous(which I'm not normally) and I talked like an idiot. I knew instantly that I wasn't getting the job. Even then, I've been to interview after interview, scouring job listings on Glassdoor, Indeed, LinkedIn, etc. All to no avail. I've tried every suggestion I've been given for looking for a job, and I'm still unemployed. 

So now, I'm at a point that I'll soon have nothing. Doesn't matter, it just further incentivizes me to do what I need to do. I'm unfit to live, clearly I am of no value to anyone if they won't bother to hire me. Doesn't matter what skills I have, doesn't matter how much experience I have. I'm a fucking failure and I'm sick of living like this. Not like I have a choice in the matter, my mother and every employer I've applied for made the decision for me.
