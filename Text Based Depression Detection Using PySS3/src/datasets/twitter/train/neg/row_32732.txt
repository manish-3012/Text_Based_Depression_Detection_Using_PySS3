The lightI was months ago in the darkest moment of my life so far when i tried to kill myself, but a message from my little sister and also from a very close friend saved me at that moment saying that they loved me a lot.
That when i decided to go to therapy and after a little while things started to get a whole lot better and now that yesterday was my birthday i realized how many people care a lot about me.

So the point is that there is light at the end of the tunnel. I hope if you are in the situation i was dont give up and give life another chance things will get better and i wish you all the best and really hope you decide to stay with us.
