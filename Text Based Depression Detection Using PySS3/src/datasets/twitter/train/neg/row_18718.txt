18 and ready to dieCurrently on 40 mg valium and still can't go to bed because of the shit swirling in my head right now. I have incredibly awful anxiety/depression. I used to be a cutter and I have a substance abuse problem. When I sleep I have nightmares of the good times before all of these problems, then I wake up miserable knowing none of it was real and I'm back in reality. I feel like a completely worthless waste of space and a burden to anyone who cares about me. I doubt anyone will reply and even if you do I won't believe you when you say it's gonna get better/be okay. I've lost hope and I don't know how the next few years are gonna play out, awful probably.
