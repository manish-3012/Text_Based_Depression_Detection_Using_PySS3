I need helpMy whole like has been a downhill spiral. My dad left the day I was born, I was abused by several step dads, I gave up my own social life through high school to take care of my grandpa, finallt at the age of 23 I found my soul mate, we shared everything in common, literally everything, we were so in love and I let the PTSD of my past turn me into a mean person, I said things I never ment and lost her, lost my better half, my grandpa died a tear ago and he was basically my dad, and today, after a long sloppy 3 month breakup were i held onto hope, this morning I find out shes dating someone else, I have nothing in this world, Ive been homeless, ive lived in a junkyard, Iam only used to pain, I lost everything. The thoughts of ending my own life become more and more appealing everyday, calming, soothing, the thought of not having to endure another day of this life. The pain I feel everyday waking up, I just feel like its the best thing and Iam starting to want it.
