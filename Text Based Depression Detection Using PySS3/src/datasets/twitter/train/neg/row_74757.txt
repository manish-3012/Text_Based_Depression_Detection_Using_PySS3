I'm feeling so sad....Hi,

I'm a 24 year old boy from the Netherlands. I have a rather happy life.. i have a great job, i own a house, i have a nice car, nice friends, great family and i tend to do lots of fun things (A party every once in a while with friends, family weekends, having nice diners etc). That part is fine.
But i'm very very bad at being "alone". And the worst part is yet to come, i like boys.... i had my first boyfriend at the age of 16, and while it was fun, exciting and interesting i've always had issues acknowledging that i'm gay. I'm a quite straight acting guy, i only have straight friends and i'm not happy when other gay boys are around me. To make it worse, i only like boys that are also straight acting and you don't see that they are gay. But because of that, it's very very hard to get to know new guys that i could potentially like.
I've tried to harm myself multiple times in the past, but never succeeded because i wasn't brave enough or someone came in right before i wanted to do it.. But this feeling is here already for years and years, and every week it's getting harder to keep my head up and act like everything is ok. I've talked to professionals numerous of times, and they are also kind of stuck with the diagnosis. The last one thought i was homophobic while liking boys....

I really don't know what to do to get rid of this fucking annoying feeling :(
