My best friend committed suicide and Iâ€™m having a hard time coming to terms with it. Help?This is my first time posting text, but I read enough posts that apologize for posting on a mobile phone; apologies if itâ€™s hard to read. 


Recently, my best friend committed suicide and Iâ€™m struggling, a lot. I have so many questions that I know Iâ€™ll never receive answers to. It didnâ€™t seem thought out, nothing was left behind to read. Every time I close my eyes I see her and I picture how it happened and I want to cry all over again. I miss her so much it hurts; yet at the same time I am angry with her. Am I a monster? She was such a beautiful, beautiful soul and the world is darker without her. I donâ€™t think she realized how many people would hurt with her gone. I honestly think she thought the world would be better without her in it and I wish so much that I told her one more time how important she was to me. 


People that have gone through this:  first off, Iâ€™m so sorry! This is one of the hardest things Iâ€™ve gone through and I commend you all for being so strong! Secondly, do you have any advice or coping mechanisms that youâ€™d like to share? Thanks in advance to whoever reads this:)
