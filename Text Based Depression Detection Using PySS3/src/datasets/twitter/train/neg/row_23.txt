I hurt another person because I am too ungrateful that I am alive.I feel so messed up. 
I was venting to someone on chat, and I told him what I am planning to do. Killing myself sometime this week. 
He told me he has lung cancer, only 5% chances to live, and he wants to live. He called me ungrateful fucking shit because I want to kill myself only because I don't feel happy with anything anymore, how he wants my life. I hurt him so badly. I apologized like 100 times. I know I can't just apologized about that. He sent me a video with himself calling me all these things, and he was literally crying his eyes out. 
I hate myself. I did hurt him so badly.. 
I still want to die, even more now. I cut myself for the first time ever today. Just to feel a little better. 
I can't forgive myself now. 
I am still planning on killing myself, I guess.
He told me to never talk to him again.
