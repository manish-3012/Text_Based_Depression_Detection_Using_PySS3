â€œYou are selfishâ€I truly donâ€™t understand this sentiment, one of the main reasons I want to kill myself is because I feel as though I am a burden to the people around me. I am severely mentally ill and am constantly hurting people or needing help from them. I hate other people being in pain because of me. I understand my suicide would be extremely upsetting for my loved ones for a while, but the long term lack of toxicity in their lives will be far more beneficial to them as opposed to me staying alive just to perpetuate the idea that all life is sacred and important.
