No desire to liveI have absolutely no desire to go out and do things. Everything just feels so boring and pointless. I donâ€™t find meaning in work or socializing or any of that shit. All I want is to live an easy life without having to do things I hate. Life is so fucking stupid. I wish life wasnâ€™t such a shitty condition to be in. Fuck living a hellish life like this. I want to disappear and never come back here.
