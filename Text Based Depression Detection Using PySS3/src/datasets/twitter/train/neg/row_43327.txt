I donâ€™t where Iâ€™ll be or where Iâ€™m going. I just am.I deleted all my social media. Every photo of me I had on Instagram, deactivated my Facebook, and everything else. Iâ€™m not sure what that is going to do or if itâ€™s even going to help me figure things out. All I know is with each passing day I feel less and less here. In the present I mean. It feels like Iâ€™m just getting closer and closer to no meaning at all. Itâ€™s not to say I would just go off myself right now.. All I know is I barely feel alive anymore and Iâ€™ve just felt so self defeated and nothing has helped over the past 9 years. Itâ€™s gradually getting worse. No matter if I seek help or not. I want to feel okay but even when Iâ€™m not thinking about it.. in my subconscious I can feel that I am. Iâ€™m terrified but at the same time almost relieved as every day comes and goes. Because a part of me knows it will eventually all fade away and I think whether or not Iâ€™m ready for that. Iâ€™d be okay.
