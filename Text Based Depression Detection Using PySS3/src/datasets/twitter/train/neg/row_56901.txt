Honestly, whatâ€™s the point?When I was in elementary school I was bullied and because of that I had suicidal thoughts, I told my teacher which led me to a kid like mental hospital.
Years later and Iâ€™m 18. I thought I was fine but I guess Iâ€™m not. The cousins who I grew up with and love with all my heart and would do anything for donâ€™t like me anymore and I donâ€™t know why. They never invite me to their gatherings or even talk to me unless their parents tell them to say happy birthday to me.
They only invite me when its like a family thing and I have to be there. Iâ€™ll told my parents about it and while my mom agrees with me my dad always thinks Iâ€™m over reacting. He never listens to me, my mom, or my sister. Well tell him the way they treat us and how we feel but heâ€™ll just get mad at us and heâ€™ll take that anger on my mom leading them to argue and sometimes fight. Iâ€™ll always love my cousins because theyâ€™re family but I donâ€™t feel the love from them.
Also I never had a girlfriend. I never had my first kiss or even held hands with someone. It fucking sucks knowing that Iâ€™m going to die alone. It fucking sucks how I canâ€™t talk to people, Iâ€™ve made new friends and have been hanging out with them recently, but I feel like I donâ€™t deserve it. I feel like a wasted space. I know my problem is not as big of a deal or important compared to the others here.
But whatâ€™s the point? Why go on knowing that Iâ€™ll never be satisfied with what I do knowing Iâ€™m just gonna be sad and alone for the rest of my life?
