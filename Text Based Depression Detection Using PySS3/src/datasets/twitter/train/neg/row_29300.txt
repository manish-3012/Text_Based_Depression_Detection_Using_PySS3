I've made a plan in my head to kill myself if my mother ever diesHonestly I don't have much going for me right now, I've got no friends and the few I though I had recently have just been talking to me out of more pity than anything, my father died a couple years after I was born and my mom and my sibling are my only family left for the most part and growing up as a kid watching your mom cry over her dead husband really takes a toll on you and even though I'm some worthless scumbag asshole the thought of my mom crying over her dead son because he killed himself is a thought that's just a little too much for me, me and my siblings have never been really close so I doubt it would affect them all that much and my distant relatives are of course distant and probably wouldn't care either. So basically my point is that my mom's the only reason I'm alive right now. I know when multiple guns are that I could get my hands on without too much trouble and I figure whats the point really? I've spent all my life trying at least to treat others better than I treat myself would it really be so bad if I did one selfish action? I feel like honestly things would even out in the end so I was neither selfish nor selfless, I dont know why I'm bothering to even think about it I'm a fucking god awful person like seriously I'm just the worst so I think I'd be doing the world a favor also I'm posting mainly as a confession because I can't think of anyone irl who would listen let alone give a shit which I'm not expecting anyone here to but it might be a good read? Idk

Oh btw I'm pretty sure its against the rules for anyone to tell me but If it's not does anyone know where exactly I should be aiming for to kill myself instantly? Cause I've seen both the in the mouth thing and the temple sorta head area and so like am I just aiming for my brain in general or like maybe my brainstem? Idk any tips would be appreciated
