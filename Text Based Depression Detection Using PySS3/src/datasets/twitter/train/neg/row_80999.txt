I have tears running down my rifle, I can't do it anymore.The love of my life is with another man who manipulates her
and treats her like shit. I can't sleep, I drink to cope.
The irony is that I save lives for a living, I've taken lives 
for my country... I've learned its do much easier to take a 
life than to save one. I've delivered babies and pulled 
people away from death...but I'm done... I can't anymore
I've done all I can to help others but where is ANYONE when 
I need help?
