Is it worth itI don't know if it is. I've never thought anyone will miss me and I think it would just be better to go. People have told me I can vent to them, but it's a waste so I don't. I don't have any particular problems and I don't know why I'll just randomly get upset. I don't know why people get so worried about me sometimes. Like, I haven't done anything bad yet. It's just annoying because all I'll ever hear is "but you're sooooooooo lucky so you can't complain." Sometimes I'll just want to take a jump just to spite people for ignoring me. I don't fucking know what's wrong with me. I'm too scared to go but I have no problem with getting hurt or self harm. I just feel like 2 different people. One is a whiny spiteful brat and the other is a sensitive piece of shit. I don't know which one I hate more. They just never ever eevevrr ever leave me a lone and just scream and shout in my ear all day long. I just want everything to shut up and go to sleep.
