I'm not worth the resources it takes to sustain me?So I want to kill myself to sacrifice myself for the planet. I get so heartbroken thinking about all the disgusting toxic waste my very existence necessitates. I mean sure, I can reduce reuse recycle, limit my use of plastic, and whatever-the-fuck, but I can't shake the feeling that my meager existence could never, ever even begin to justify the destruction my body's rampant consumption does to the planet. I'm what, here to marry so I can help make more destructive abominations, just to make my mom happy? It's not a good enough reason for me to keep fucking shit up at the rate that I am. I can't bear the thought of the elephants. Why is it shameful to want to go back to the void? Why do I have to suffer and languish here for godknows how many more years for the sake of other people? Why can't it be noble to opt to leave? I think I should be free to make this choice with honesty to everyone in my life, but I know that will never, ever happen. I'll never be able to talk about it with anyone in real life without them completely freaking out, so here I am here. What do you guys think? Life is amazing, and weird, and beautiful, and profound, and I love you all truly and deeply. But I just want out now. Can't that be okay?
