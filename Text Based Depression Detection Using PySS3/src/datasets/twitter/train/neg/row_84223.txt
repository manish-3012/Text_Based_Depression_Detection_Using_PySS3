everyday is like a war.Im 23 i live in England and since i got thrown out if home all i have done is take drugs and become a shell of my former self, i dknt want to get up anymore, my so called friends steal from me and make all there jokes at my expense, so i decided to show them, at 3pm GMT today, i am going to kill myself, i dint want talking out of it, i just wanted to leave some trace of myself somewhere, as i know i wont be remembered in people hearts due to the harm i have caused with my drug habit and stealing, mostly i will miss my girlfriend, the sad things us she has no idea about this dark cloud i carry around, she won't understand why. Thanks for being there guys.

**EDIT** So my landlord has found blood and broken glass in the sink from me cutting myself, he then proceeded to scream at me and call me a worthless fuck. Now i don't care about three pm today, fuck it, im going to leave this here and im going to start sliding everywhere i can. It's people like him who don't give a fuck that make me want to do this even more.
