My Girlfriend is suicidal.I love her with all my heart. She is constantly depressed but goes through periods of almost normalcy before sinking into depressive episodes. She constantly says she /needs/ to go and that she wants to go, that she is ruining my life by holding me back etc. (It isn't true however.) I love her very much and I never have any idea how to help; I've read the sidebar links and she hates counselling and will never go not even with me and she is firmly against using meds saying she would rather die than use them
