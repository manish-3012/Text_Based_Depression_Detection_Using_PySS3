I feel like my life is a lieFrom time to time, such as now, I get an overwhelming sensation that my life has only happened for others to abuse me and get their kicks out of it. I'm not foolish enough to end it, but given this outlook it gets tempting as hell. It feels like this life is going nowhere and no matter what I do to try and make it better, somewhere else in it someone is going to try and screw me over. I can't think of a time ever in my life where I felt as if everything was going all well and fair for me at once. Somewhere in it someone was always fucking me, no matter where in my life I was prospering. Though I'm grateful for those areas of prosperity, it makes me sick that nothing ever works out for me and I can't even be weak enough to put it to an end. I'm too hopeful.

I don't know what to do. It feels like my soul has disappeared and nothing has meaning or worth. Nothing's worth keeping.
