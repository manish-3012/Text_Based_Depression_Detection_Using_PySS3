My life, the Universe, and other junk.So Hi reddit, 

Recently I had taken some 25c Nbomes*that could be wrong*
Anyways after taking it I came to a construction of life is beautiful and death isn't something I go to because I hate my life. No its something about the fact that in the smallest, and I mean .0000 to long to keep clicking 0001% is a trick to find out if humans would rather live a hard life rather than *Cheating to paradise* in suicide. I'm not going Soon like tomorrow, but I know I'm going to end my life rather than let life end it. But I just wonder, what do you think on the idea that *sure we're all individuals, and were all probably connected in a stranger way than some, but life is a trick to see if we'll live or not?* I mean Christianity made suicide a sin? why? Lost productivity? in a universe that's meaning might as well be *find your own destiny* whats the point of stopping one from killing themselves other than to scare them from trying?
