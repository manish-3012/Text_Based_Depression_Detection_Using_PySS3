Just..in an escapable holeI feel like I can never get ahead in life. Bills keep piling up and I'm in the hole every month. I have a loving family and friend group but my pride and guilt keep me from asking for help. I just cannot imagine myself being the person I thought I was going to be 5 years ago and living seems to be pointless. I hate not being able to escape this perpetual rock bottom.
