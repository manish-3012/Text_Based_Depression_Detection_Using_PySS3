I feel pure dispare of nothingnessI want to feel something. There is nothing to feel. The only thing that makes me feel is drugs. I'm in a state of mind I cant escape. I dont know what to do. I don't even know why I'm writing this post, I guess I just need to vent. I have thoughts and fantasies about ending my life and how it would make things better. I want 3 things. Drugs death and love but I cant have any of them? What am I supposed to do end it? Try to dig myself out like I have so many times before? Get high af and cause more problems? Try to find love? Well I'm too scared to end it I have no motivation to fix my mind, I do drugs and it's a temporary fix and leads to dependence and I try to find someone compatible but they either get clingy only want sex right away or lose interest quickly so I've given up. I think I need to work on myself more anyways. My mind is dark as the deepest crevasse of a long cave. At least that's what I felt feels like. My emotions are cold and dry and nothing is fun. I think I'm going absolutely insane I just want help but I'm too cowardly to even ask.
