It's inevitable. I hate life. It's just a matter of time.I'm 19, I've been depressed for years and it's gotten real bad by now. I've already attempted suicide by hanging at one point and at another by alcohol poisoning after downing a couple bottles of voka and various other drinks.

I can barely bring myself to do anything including brushing my own teeth on a daily basis.

I'm currently doing a Bachelor of Information Technology at uni as it's all I was accepted into. I've had no sleep. My first lecture of the 4th week is in a few hours and I can barely bring myself to go. I already missed all of last week. This whole course feels like a waste of time, I feel useless doing this. The entire 1st year is business bullshit I can barely pay attention to, and the second year is when they finally get to the damn 'introduction to programming'... Another waste of my time.

It feels like I have to suffer 1 and a half years or more of stuff I either hate or already know to possibly learn anything I actually want to.

And now I've gotta go to the dentist this week to get a root canal for a tooth which is gonna cost a fortune for my family. I don't see the point. I already think about jumping in front of a train every time I'm at the station. All getting a root canal is gonna do is give us a hefty bill to pay for no reason since I don't think I'll live that long anyway. Waste of money really.

I'm not sure why I'm still here at this point, I have no reason to live any more really. I don't know how much longer I'll last.
