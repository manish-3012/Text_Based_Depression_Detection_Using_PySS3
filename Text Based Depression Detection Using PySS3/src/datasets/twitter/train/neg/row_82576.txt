Know exactly where Iâ€™m going to goIâ€™m just literally to lazy to leave my house but Iâ€™m going to soon muster the energy to clean my house and then go jump off a cliff.

My house is really fucked near horders lever of messy and Iâ€™ve called in sick every day this week because I was having panic attacks about cleaning nd therefore dealing with my life....  just donâ€™t want what I leave behind to be messy. But then I think every day I donâ€™t clean is a day I wonâ€™t kill myself.
