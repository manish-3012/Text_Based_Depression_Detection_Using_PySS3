I think tomorrow morning will be it. I donâ€™t want to live anymore.Hey,

I feel like a fucking asshole posting here. I just made a new reddit account for this. Iâ€™ve felt like this for a long time. I lost the woman I wanted children with. The woman I wanted to marry. Iâ€™m 26 and spent five years with her. I was bad to her. I had never been on prescription medication in my life but Iâ€™m on Celexa now. I canâ€™t wake up in time for work. I drink a lot now. I donâ€™t skate or make music or write or progress or do anything like I used to. Iâ€™m not sad right now, I just know I have to do this. I searched â€œsuicideâ€ on reddit and this was the only result. I feel like the app is blocking communities that I could post to. 

I almost did this earlier but I have four younger siblings that I love so much. But shit, every day is regret.  Sheâ€™s probably going to marry her new man soon and I donâ€™t want to be around for it.

I just donâ€™t feel afraid of it anymore. Iâ€™ve figured out arrangements and wouldnâ€™t leave my family with too much to deal with.
