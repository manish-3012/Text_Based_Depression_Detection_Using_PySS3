Wife cheated on me and shows no remorse.So long story short this is my first reddit post in 3 years. My wife cheated on me and when I confronted her she blamed me and showed no remorse. She told me for years that she didn't want to be a wife or mother. She told me she needed to work on herself so I gave her the space she asked for. She told me when I confronted her that I wasn't their for her. I've been drinking heavily for the past few months hoping I can just stop the pain. She's staying at a friend's house because I want this to work. But when we try to reconnect we see each other for a few moments and then she makes an excuse why we can't hang out longer. Then she's out doing something else. I've reached a point where I'm just going to kill myself.
