"Just change your mindset"I've been told this many times by family members and from the very few friends I have. I really wish I could. I have tried. It always comes back to the same thing no matter how many times I try to change my mind. "I want to die. I'm incompetent and very inept. This life isn't worth living" My mindset hasn't changed in a decade. I feel that once I'm dead they won't have to worry about me anymore. They'll be sad but it's probably for the best.
