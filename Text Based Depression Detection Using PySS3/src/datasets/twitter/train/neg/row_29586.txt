I have failedI've failed, my life is in ruins. I'm only 20 but it feels like I'm ancient. I've failed out of college, I've failed my family, I've failed my friends. Everyone had such high expectations for me and I failed. I have a few days left on this vacation before I do it. I haven't decided how yet. I thought that maybe I could keep going but I can't see a reason to. I've burned too many bridges. The only reason I haven't yet is because I know it doesn't get rid of the pain, it only passes it on to others. But I'm selfish, my shoulders are too sore. My body aches, my chest feels like someone's squeezing the life out of my heart. I don't have anything to live for. I know this for a fact. I can't seem to justify this everyday struggle anymore. In my dreams I see the faces of everyone I've let down, their faces dissapointed, looking down at me with shame and disgust. I can't stand it. I just want it to be over. My friend killed himself over the phone with me last year and I miss him. I thought he was a coward for doing it but I can see his reasoning. I'm alone. I've failed. I'm coming buddy.
