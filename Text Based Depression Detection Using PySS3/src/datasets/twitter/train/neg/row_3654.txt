Panicking and thinking about ending please helpMy parents found out that I messed up and had some incomplete applications (basically, missed the deadline). I don't really care about the applications but now they know and I'm panicking. Thinking about how much easier everything would be if I weren't here. I'm scaring myself with these thoughts. Please help.
