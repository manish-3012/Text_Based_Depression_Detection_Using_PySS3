i am killing myself tommorowi have run out of chances, and there is no hope for me, i have failed already, in a situation where inever win. in a nutshell, i have been brought up on painful memories, bullied by teachers and students, shamed,excluded, hated, lived with adhd and depression for as long as i can remember, already attempted suicidee 3 times, ahve bad grades right now, so bad and  everything has comr to the point my parents hafve taken everything awaty from me. but i dont care about my stuff. i just want to escape and have one last chance at life, to be happy again. i dont want to die, but i really have to, its the only way to escape this nightmare. i already told my parents about 1/4 of my entire story, and it didnt make an impact, trying again would make them think i am making up stuff and bs ing. i am too young to have any rigths, to run or move away.(15) all my friends look so much better than me, do everything better than me and have everything i ever wanted, the same with my enemies. i am dying for real this time. this sounds like a mess, but at least ill be dead by the time omeone reads it, like all my other reddit posts on other handles where i only got one or two half aassed reply. im just a terrible attention seeking whore. you know what, i think i am killing myself sooner. i really need help, even though i dont deserve it,
