I think this might finally be itIâ€™m overwhelmed and tired. Alone, always. Iâ€™m near the end of a literally impossible performance plan where Iâ€™ll likely be fired anyway. And all the jobs Iâ€™ve applied for, havenâ€™t heard back on any. Already did lots of interviews but not one job. Iâ€™m just so tired. The year is ending anyway. All the odds are against me. And I have nothing to live for anyway. This world is so messed up. Iâ€™ve seen enough.
