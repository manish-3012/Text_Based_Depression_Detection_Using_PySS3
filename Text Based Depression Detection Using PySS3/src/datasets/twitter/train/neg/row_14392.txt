A failed attempAfter a failed suicide attemp, I just don't know how to feel.
It was set off by some one throwing something traumatic back in my face.

I took a bunch of drugs guess it was not my time but I'm just left feeling hollow and empty inside, how do you start to get back to some sort of normality.
