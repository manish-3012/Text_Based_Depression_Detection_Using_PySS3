heartbroken and filled with despairthe girl ive been madly in love with since i was 8 came over from israel a few nights ago and i missed out on it.  she's the most beautiful person in the world and ive obsessed over her since third grade (im 20 now). shes kind, sweet, reserved, cheery, has an adorable laugh, drop dead gorgeous, is empathetic and genuinely cares about making the world better. shes the only girl ive ever been in love with. ive tried falling in love with other girls, but i just cant feel what i feel about her for anyone else. she's irreplaceable, perfect in every way, and ive never had the balls to tell her that i think that of her myself. ive more or less gotten over the crippling social anxieties that plagued me as a child, but it's like they come back in full force as soon as i even think of approaching her. i despair every time i think of her, how she probably has long since moved on from me and doesn't care, and am filled with resentment every time i am reminded that my best friend from school went out with her and now they're both in the IDF together. i hate myself, for this and so many more reasons. i want to die.
