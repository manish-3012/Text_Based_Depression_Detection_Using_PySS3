Iâ€™d rather die than face the world anymoreI donâ€™t know where my sudden fear of the world came from, I donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t leave my room without crying anymore, I know that I hate myself for it and I know itâ€™s getting to a point Iâ€™d rather be gone than to feel this. Iâ€™ve never been an introvert now all I want to do is stay at home, in my room, door shut alone. My loneliness is why I want to die but I feel even more lonely with people around. I donâ€™t understand what Iâ€™m feeling any more but I know itâ€™s not good and I donâ€™t want to keep feeling it.
