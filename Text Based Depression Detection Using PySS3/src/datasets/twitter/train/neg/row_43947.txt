I don't think this is worth it anymore.I'm not sure what to say, or even why I'm writing this post, as I'm sure I will delete it soon after posting. I know it's cliche to say, but I don't think anyone will care about this. I'll probably just keep this short, as to not waste too much of your time. 

I've never felt alright. Gender seems so unimportant to everyone else. I guess that's why it took my so long to realize what the problem is. And honestly, I feel so fucking awful for even complaining about this. But I just can't live like this anymore. I've been on hormones for three months now, and I don't feel any better. If anything, things have gotten worse. How is it only me? I feel so fucking uncomfortable in this body every second of every day and no one understands how exhausting that is. And even now, I feel horrible for complaining. 

I just want things to get better. I don't want to die. But I don't know how else to fix this. I'll never be allowed to be myself, no one will ever truly love me, and I'll never be able to have babies. What's the point in even trying anymore? I'm just a stupid fucking tranny and I'll never mean anything to anyone. 

I give up. 

Thanks for reading this. I'm truly sorry for wasting your time. 

I hope you have a good day. Whoever you are, I love you.
