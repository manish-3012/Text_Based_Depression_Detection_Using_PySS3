So this is it then?Working a dead end job for 40+ years so I can grow old and watch everyone die around me, then spend my last years laying in my own piss and shit unable to even feed myself, in constant pain until I finally die?

I keep telling myself that there must be more to life, but no, this is it. This is "the gift of life". Spending 80 years trying to ignore the pain of existence as much as possible by playing video games, doing pointless hobbies, sleeping, having sex, doing drugs and partying. God I hate it. It's all so fucking dull.
