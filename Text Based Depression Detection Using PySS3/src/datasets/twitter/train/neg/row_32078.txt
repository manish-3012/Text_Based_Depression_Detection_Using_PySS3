Accepting suicideHi, 
so I was suicidal for like 3 years now, i always knew that i will be suiciding but the day i started balding i knew it is time as a short ugly guy balding is just the last thing i need, i also have heavy health issues and no real social life. even tho i got my master degree in finance i couldn't land any good job because of low selfesteem and because looks matters when u apply for a job so i am stuck in job i hate where i cant spend a dime because i was "saving" for a transplant and where everyone hates me, i always wanted to end my life seeing how guys r popular and how they could have love and attraction from other while all i got is disgusted looks and what even made feel worse that i always try harded at university and i couldn't make nothing out of it and other people who halfassed it r know accepted in best companies. I disabled social media like 3 weeks ago and the nothingness made me realize that i am better of to choosing to that for my life too. so two weeks ago i picked the 15 March as a D-day and chose to try everything that is supposed to help me like going to doctors and going to gym etc... yet, so far nothing helped. i always wanted to end my life but never had the balls to do it but i found out the key to that is accepting nothingness. Maybe it was amplified from parents treating me so bad and from the worst genes that they gave me. Well, i hope u all to be well in the future and try talking to professionals or therapists if if i ever reincarnate i hope i get a better conditions than the ones i did in this life.
