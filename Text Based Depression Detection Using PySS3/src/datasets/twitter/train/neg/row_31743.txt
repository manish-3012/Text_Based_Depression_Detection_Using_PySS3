I know I can be replaced and forgotten aboutFuck here I am again, for the billionth time thinking about ending my life. I keep telling myself that the very few people in my life can forgot about me in time, they won't even spend a second thinking about me and my suicide won't impact their lives. I don't want it to impact their lives. I want to just slip away and the world to forget about me. I didn't ask to be born, I didn't ask for my mental health issues, I didn't ask for my financial issues, I didn't ask for my loneliness. No one will see this coming, I'm always faking a smile and pretending I'm okay. I'm going to see my family one last time tomorrow then I'm getting my supplies and leaving this life. I don't want to be lonely anymore and left with my thoughts.
