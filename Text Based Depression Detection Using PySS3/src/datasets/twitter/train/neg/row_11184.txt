Has anybody just had a year where literally everything has gone wrong ?Going from straight happiness to..what the fuck..how can so much go wrong. Its 230 in the morning I havent slept in days. All I can think of is...wow...is all this really happening, how can so much go wrong in one year. I cant even have an anxitey attack or cry because my mind just fucking quit and nothing is working on me. Im lost, im alone...and i dont want to be here anymore
