Why am I so selfish and irrational?So last friday, I attempted to kill myself by drowning but I couldn't do it. I started feeling mad and sad because I don't have any friends that are there to know that I am suicidal. Even though I tried calling for help it just seems like they never get it. Why do I have to explicit tell them that I am suicidal in order for them to help me? Why can't they tell? I know I'm being selfish and irrational because they wouldn't know. Why can't they be there to ask if i am okay or if i'm doing well and just ask me, like how I ask them? I always reach out to them whenever they feel sad but how come no one is there to do the same for me? Do I have to explicitly tell themselves that I am suicidal in order for them to help me? But that would make me seem desparate for attention and I dont want them to think that. My friends mean the most to me and I wrote suicide letters to them in order to help them heal if I ever die, because that's how much they mean to me and i don't wanna hurt them. How come they are not there for me?
