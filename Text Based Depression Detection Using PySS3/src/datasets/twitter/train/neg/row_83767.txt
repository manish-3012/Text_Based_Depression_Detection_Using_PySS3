I'm killing myself right now.Nobody gives a shit about me, i've completely ruined everything with everybody that i cared about. My closest friends hate my guts and i'm pretty sure my family are finished with me as well. I normally go to my dog for comfort but i'm starting to think even he doesn't give a shit about me too which should honestly tell you how pathetic and empty my life really is. All i ever wanted to do was fit in, find my own clique of friends and do what im good at but there's no fucking point in trying anymore since i don't even have any talents to begin with, nor am i good at anything. One step forward a million steps back is basically the norm of my life and im just done with it. As soon as i hit send on this, ill go jump off a flat or something, boom you won't ever have to deal with my annoying ass anymore. Hope all you people that ignored me and treated me like shit for the past couple years now are happy with yourselves.
