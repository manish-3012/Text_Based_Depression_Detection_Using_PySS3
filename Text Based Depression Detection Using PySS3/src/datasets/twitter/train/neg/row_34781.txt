I've never felt more free in my life than knowing I'm going to die tonight.Not gonna put my whole sob story out there because you all have enough to deal with. 

I just know it's the right thing to do. Tonight I told someone I was going to kill myself and he said that I was too much to handle. I think he's right. 

But I just needed to say goodbye to someone. I don't even have anybody to leave a note to. 

Goodnight &amp; goodbye all, and I truly hope you find a different path than mine.
