Leaving for a while?Hi people. So yeah I've been thinking about blowing my head off with a 12 gauge for years now. Well any ways, I've been thinking that I might as well delay such actions and try and do something interesting. I'm thinking about just packing a whole bunch of shit into my car and leaving.  Quitting my job, dropping out of school, and just driving somewhere else. Or maybe even leave the country. Thinking about cutting contact with everyone I know. My parents are paying for my college right now and would be pissed about me wasting their money. However, I feel like they would rather have me gone and their money wasted than a dead son. I'm hoping such a trip will allow me to find some satisfaction and enjoyment out of life. Is this a good idea? Have any of you ever tried something similar and perhaps just found out that it is your circumstances or the people you know that make your life miserable?
