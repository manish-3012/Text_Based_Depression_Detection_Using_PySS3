I just dont know what to doi dont know where to start. My ex left me about a year and half ago for reason mostly due to our age and disapproving parents. I have been depressed since then but for some reason part of me always hoped it would work out. She messages me last thrusday saying that she has been raped but needed to talk to me about it...this devistated me. I still love her and have done nothing since her. She was raped by her now ex and finding out she had moved on emotionally and physically kills me.. I was her first for everything and i wanted to be her everything. I just dont know what to do. i have been crying for hours and have been thinking of killing myself for days. I'm honestly not sure why i have not yet. I just dont know what to do. I only have one real friend that i can talk to this about and they are asleep. I dont want to call a hotline cuz i feel they will just take me away and i dont want that. I want to die, but I love my ex and want to live for her. Her coucelers helping her with the rape and her parents told her not to speak with me anymore so i no longer have hope of trying to get back with her... sorry for rambling and spelling. I cant stop shaking
