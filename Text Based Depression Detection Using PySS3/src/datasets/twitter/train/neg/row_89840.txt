Iâ€™ve come to peace with my decision.I used to cry all of the time because I wanted to die. I used to feel so sad that I couldnâ€™t shake the feeling of wanting to end my life. But after some serious thought I am for certain that this is my way out. I have never been so certain of anything in my life honestly. I donâ€™t know what day Iâ€™ll do it. I know itâ€™ll be within the next week. I just have to find out how and where I want to do it. Iâ€™m oddly excited to see the end. Iâ€™m excited for this to be over. Life never treated me too well.
