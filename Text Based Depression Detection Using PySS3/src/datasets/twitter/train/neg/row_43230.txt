Therapist doesnâ€™t believe me Iâ€™m panicking Iâ€™m scared no one else does as wellIâ€™m sorry I post so much on here but my therapist doesnâ€™t believe in me that Iâ€™m transgender and I honestly donâ€™t have the strength anymore to switch therapists.

Thought I could do it at some point, but I canâ€™t face this kind of rejection and distrust from someone who Iâ€™ve shared my traumas to again. She thinks itâ€™s a coping mechanism and now Iâ€™m scared itâ€™s true Iâ€™m so lost oh my god why would she say that after Iâ€™ve suffered my entire life being trapped in this body
I donâ€™t know how to help myself anymore I have to die I have to Iâ€™ll never get better
