Why the fuck are there people here that'll literally just comment telling you to do itI made a post and somebody commented basically laughing and saying nobody would miss me. 

what the fuck.

That wasn't even the only time that's happened to me. How are people openly telling somebody at risk of suicide to do it. Can't even just saying that be a crime? Like if somebody's on the literal ledge and you say do a flip that seems illegal
