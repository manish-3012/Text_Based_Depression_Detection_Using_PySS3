4 more monthsThe winters here are cold and dark. Summer was always my favorite time of the year, the sun never sets in summer. 

Thereâ€™s this beautiful forested valley close to where i live, thatâ€™s where iâ€™m going in June. 
I will be hiking in and finding a tree to sit under, iâ€™ll listen to music and watch the midnight sun while i fall asleep for the last time.

In the time before june iâ€™m just distracting myself watching the movies i love and replaying the games that meant a lot to me.
I havenâ€™t talked to my friends in a while now, it just hurts thinking about them.

Life and death are just two sides of the same coin, to live means to accept death. iâ€™m just going to the station a little bit before the others, i hope they wonâ€™t hate me too much for it. Maybe iâ€™ll see them again someday.

Iâ€™m looking forward to june, for each month that pass, it makes me less scared. 

Im not sure why i am sharing this with strangers, i guess i just wanted someone to know. 

I canâ€™t wait to feel that summer breeze again.
