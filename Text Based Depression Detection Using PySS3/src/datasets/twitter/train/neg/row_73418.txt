I would rather dieIâ€™m just so sick of the same thing being repeated over and over, â€œplenty of fish in the seaâ€, â€œyouâ€™ll find someone eventuallyâ€, somebody should have told these people how big the sea is and when eventually is. Iâ€™ve been trying for a relationship since I was 7 and sexual-esque activity since I was 15. Iâ€™m in fucking college now, people have had sex in high school already, 16 was the dream, I talked myself down to 17, now Iâ€™m 18, but I turned this year so I told myself I can just say the year and hope people assume I was 17. Itâ€™s a big deal for me to get this out of the way early so I could understand myself, but what people never understood is that I treat this with not only importance but urgency. If im just gonna be a virgin loser for college too than my youth was practically a waste of time, and itâ€™s not like life gets better, this is where Iâ€™m peaking, if I canâ€™t have this kind of fun now, I might as well die, since Iâ€™ll be deprived of one of the best things in humanity, teenage sexual fun.
