Need some helpI feel I might do something stupid. 

Haven't spoken to anybody besides shopworkers in about two weeks. Just have NO people in my life. Don't know what I'm living for and physiologically I'm freaking out a bit. 

I'm a loser across the spectrum : Love, friendship, career, family, you name it. 

Nobody cares, nobody even takes my call. The world really wouldn't miss me. Why am I struggling on?

Please help.
