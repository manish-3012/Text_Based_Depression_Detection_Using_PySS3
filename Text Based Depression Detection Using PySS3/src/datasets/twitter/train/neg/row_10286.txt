Itâ€™s a sad world when a 15 year old kid is contemplating suicide to escape his emotionally abusive parents.Iâ€™m sick of being called â€œa fu*king animalâ€ by the people who are supposed to raise me to be a productive adult. Itâ€™s years of emotional trauma brought up by their anger towards each other that they take out on me verbally. I donâ€™t get help for any of my issues and they refuse to believe that Iâ€™m spiralling towards rock bottom.

 I thought since my friends couldnâ€™t care less, my parents called me ungrateful a hotline just told me â€œlife will be okay soonâ€, Iâ€™ll just open up to the two strangers here on reddit.
