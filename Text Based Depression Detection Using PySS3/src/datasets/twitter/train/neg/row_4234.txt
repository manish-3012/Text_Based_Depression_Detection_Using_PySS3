What to do..I'm 23 years old, married for going on 4 years now...I have a beautiful 1 year old daughter and from the outside looking in me and my family would seem as though we had it all. My husband has a very high paying job so I get to stay home and take care of my baby...I recently lost my dog of 11 years from natural causes, I was going through something before this happened..but after he died I've been feeling really off...I've been so depressed lately I've been finding that I cry a lot....for no damn reason,literally I wake up in the morning and from the second I open my eyes I'm crying. We bought a puppy a week ago hoping it would help....n if anything it made things a lot worse. My husbands never home because he works so much...so all the responsibility of the baby and pup fall on me..we recently moved from my hometown and this move has made me realize how lonely I really am.. I have no one... A lot of my friends I lost before I got married mostly because my husband didn't get along with a lot of them...I don't have much family so there's really no one to talk to...I know my husband loves me but lately I've been feeling very spiteful towards him...I think it's because I've been so depressed lately and he just kinda wants me or expects me to be ok...he don't really try to help..or comfort me...making me feel like something's really wrong with me...he's happy, always in a good mood...I'm tired of feeling like I'm what's wrong with this family...I have no one to relate to...when I was in high school I attempted suicide quite a few times. Put myself in a coma with pills at one point...it's been years since I've tried to do anything like this...I still have a pretty bad scare on my wrist from attempting suicide years ago...and it's a constant reminder of that dark time in my life...I haven't thought of hurting myself in years...but lately the thoughts are so strong, I feel like I'm just floating through life...numb...not really feeling all the emotions that make life worth living...the only emotion I feel emptiness and sadness
