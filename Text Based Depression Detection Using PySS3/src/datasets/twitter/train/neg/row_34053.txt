Iâ€™m scared.Iâ€™m 24, f. After a few years of not hurting myself. I did it again after being left in an extremely emotional state because my boyfriend wanted to go to bed. Not angry, he literally just wanted to go to bed, which somehow made it worse to me. Every time I need help, people just leave. Iâ€™m in college and doing well in my classes. Iâ€™m afraid to tell my mom how Iâ€™ve been feeling because I know sheâ€™ll be disappointed that I have to stop school and take care of my mental health... again... in the same month this happened before years ago when I tried to kill myself. But I canâ€™t kill myself now because sheâ€™ll be even more disappointed. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to hurt myself so Iâ€™m locking myself in a room. I canâ€™t go to bed with my boyfriend because being next to him makes me so sad knowing heâ€™ll never care about me in the way I need him to. He will never see the pain Iâ€™m in, even when I tell him. And now I cut myself again. Relapse after years of not doing it. My mind keeps flashing ways I could do it. And Iâ€™m so scared. People will leave me, if they knew what Iâ€™m feeling and going through- I know it. Doesnâ€™t matter what I stuck with my boyfriend through, I know heâ€™ll leave if I told him. Iâ€™m never enough. I spend my energy on other people and no one is here when I need it. But I guess I also pushed all my good friends away years ago because I knew they deserved better than me. I distanced so they could make better friends with people I knew they wanted to with, and sure enough- they are all much better friends than we ever were and seem so much happier. And Iâ€™m happy for them, but now Iâ€™m left with no one. Whenever I let the mask drop, itâ€™s always the same. No one takes me seriously until I try to kill myself. I know that canâ€™t be the way it actually is, but it sure feels like that. And tonight, Iâ€™m more afraid than ever. I stared at myself for half an hour in the mirror trying to see anything other than a shell. I canâ€™t.
