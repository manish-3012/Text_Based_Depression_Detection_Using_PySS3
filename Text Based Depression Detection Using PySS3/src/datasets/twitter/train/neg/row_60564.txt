There is no reason for me still being aliveI'm too much of a coward.

I have cried so much during the last 2-3 years that I have become unable to show pity for human suffering.

The only thing that I can see that can produce something in me other than myself is animal abuse(I hate animal abuse, because animals are the only pure thing in this world)

I am unable to cut myself, I find cuts unbearable, it's much more easy for me to punch myself until I bleed than cutting myself.

I love my parents and my cat, I love my relatives and my only friends(3). But I'm just a burden, I have no real talents nor do I contribute to their personal lives.

Other than my cat, my own cowardice is what is stopping me from taking my life.

I have lost all trust in my close ones since an incident that occurred 2 years ago, where I trusted someone that destroyed my life.

Even though I'm 15, I already take 100mg of sertralina daily, but It's not enough.

I just want to end myself, end my suffering, end my uselessness, end my waste of space, end my waste of resources and end my close ones suffering.

I want to end it all before I turn into someone that harms other people.
