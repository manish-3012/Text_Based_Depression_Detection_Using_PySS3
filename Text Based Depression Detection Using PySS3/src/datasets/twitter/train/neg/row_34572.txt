I'm so sorry :(I'm sorry.

I'm sorry for anyone who finds me.

I'm sorry mom, I love you so much!

I'm sorry dad, I love you so much!

I'm sorry Amanda, raise Emily well. I love you so much!

I'm sorry Emily, I wish I could've been a better uncle. I wish I had seen you grow. I love you so much. So very much!

Everywhere there's too many memories.
No matter where I look... I see memories of Meaghan - us moving into our own place using a shopping cart. I see memories of Karine - the long walks we used to take... I see our camping trips. I see all my friends now long gone. I see everything. I've wasted it all!!

I've wasted everything.

I need to do this now. Before I become crazy and end up homeless. 

I've failed you all.

PLEASE FORGIVE ME!!!!
