My girlfriend tried to kill herself tonight and I don't know what to domy girlfriend tried to kill herself tonight. she called me a few hours ago and sounded completely insane because of all the meds she took to end her life. thankfully she regretted it when she was starting to black out and tried to vomit and get everything out of her system. she said she called me because she wanted me to know that she was still alive. i thanked her for it, tried to calm her down and tell her that i love her but i honestly don't know what to do. she hung up when her mom got home because she would have to explain everything.... we're in a long distance relationship and her family doesn't know about me, there's no way for me to reach her, so i'm just glad she's not alone right now. (ps: she broke up with me yesterday. we've been together for one year and a half, during this time she broke up with me like four or five times when she was going through hard times, only to take it back after it was over)

i love her with all my heart and i guess i just want some advice about what i can do to help her, things someone who just tried to end their life would like to hear, stuff like that.
