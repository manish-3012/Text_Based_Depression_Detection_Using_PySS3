Iâ€™ve wasted my life and have no friends and may have killed someoneIâ€™m 30 and nothing to show for it: I donâ€™t like my job, donâ€™t have many friends (though I have superficial friendly acquaintances), and my romantic history is a mess.

To be positive, Iâ€™ve travelled a lot and have a (useless) degree. 

I had severe OCD as a teenager that left me housebound, and I missed a bunch of social development. I have some trauma etc and have borderline personality disorder, OCD and generalized anxiety disorder.

I canâ€™t find reciprocal romance. Whenever Iâ€™ve slept with someone, itâ€™s been out of a sense of duty, rather than genuine attraction.

I hate being rejected and become controlling and stalkerish. Thereâ€™s probably about 10 people who hate me. 

Just recently, I was on holiday in New York. I hadnâ€™t slept with someone in a year. I met a cute chubby Jewish guy (so in theory not a player) and we slept together. I thought we were going to keep meeting up, but the next day I sent too many texts and supposedly scared him off. Then he started making suicide threats and accusing me of all sorts of things (â€œplease donâ€™t hurt my dogâ€, â€œplease donâ€™t hurt my familyâ€). It was really out of proportion to what I said. 

Since then Iâ€™ve tried to contact him to have a conversation, but heâ€™s blocked me on everything. I refrained from contacting him, then called a lot of times tonight. I just got home and Iâ€™m really jetlagged. 

I just want a 2 minute conversation about what went down. Then Iâ€™d have a resolution and could move on.

But now Iâ€™ve called so many times heâ€™s probably scared and going to kill himself or something and itâ€™s my fault. And I donâ€™t know how to escape this situation. I just want to talk on the phone and be free. Iâ€™m not attracted to him. I was just shaken by the threats he made. It seemed like he was exaggerating his fear as an excuse not to see me again. I feel like he just used me for sex.

So now Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ve called too many times and heâ€™s done something. And I canâ€™t see any reason to go on. I donâ€™t like my job and I have no friends. All my relationships are jokes and a bunch of people hate me. I canâ€™t shake this horrible obsession with having a conversation with this guy. And Iâ€™m really tired and canâ€™t sleep. I havenâ€™t slept in 36 hours now. 

I suck and Iâ€™m a failure and Iâ€™m afraid. He doesnâ€™t even care enough about me to have a quick phone call. I feel worthless. And Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ve somehow pushed him over the edge. Itâ€™s probably a crazy fear, but itâ€™s frightening. 

Iâ€™ve wasted my life.
