This might scare the crap out of you...it did for meSo I was thinking today about how tired and bored and distressed and dissatisfied I am with my life again. 

I've been here before. I know the story. 

The idea of suicide seems like such a great ending to this. 

But now another idea crossed my mind: **what if it's not over even after you kill yourself ?** 

What if you wake up in a new dimension, with dead relatives floating away with you, telling you how you haven't escaped from anything, the thoughts you're having and the feelings you're having are going to haunt you constantly, the tiredness that you have felt in this life is the same tiredness you'll going to live with in that new, unknown, strange dimension - nothing changes, but actually it can even get worse. 

You might find yourself with all the mess you're trying to escape from - but instead of being able to actually do something about them, you're in a powerless, paralyzed, spooky state in that another dimension. 

**For the 1st time in my life, and trust me that I'm depressed as fuck, I realize that perhaps I can see life as a privilege, if I look at it from this angle.** 

I mean, suicide seems attractive only because we think somehow it's going to be "better" after it - **what if it's actually just the same or even bigger crap waiting for us ?** 

It makes me glad to be alive.
