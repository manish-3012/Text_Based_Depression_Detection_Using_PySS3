I want to die, but my girlfriend doesn'tI'm crippled with doubt that things will ever get better in my life. I'm in the middle of a huge depressive episode and last night I was holding a handful of pills, the only thing stopping me was my girlfriend trying to make me feel better. She keeps saying that my life is going to improve but I can't imagine anything beyond this total shit. I'm afraid I'm going to do it and I don't want to hurt her but I'm just tired of being alive.
