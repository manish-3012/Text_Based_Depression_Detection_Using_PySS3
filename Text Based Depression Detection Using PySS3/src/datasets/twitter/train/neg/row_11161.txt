Tonight was so weirdI wasnâ€™t able to sleep tonight. Which was kinda weird because I do love sleep. I found this peace tonight. Like I finally realized that I donâ€™t have to hold on so tight anymore. Iâ€™ve accepted that she is better without me. That she will do great things to help this world and I actually was hindering that and not helping it. Doesnâ€™t mean I donâ€™t love her and will miss her greatly but itâ€™s finally been set right. Then I feel like Iâ€™ve finally accepted that I just made to many mistakes. Itâ€™s ok. I really did give it a good go early on but once my mom passed I just never was able to correct course. Finally I just feel so at peace with moving on to see if thereâ€™s something after. I think Iâ€™m going to stay a few more days with my grandparents and just relax. I donâ€™t have a job I have to worry about anymore so after thanksgiving I think Iâ€™m gonna take the last $1400 cash I have to my name and get in my car and drive. I might go see one or two places that Iâ€™ve always wanted to go. Somewhere warm and peaceful maybe. Listens to some good tunes on the way and maybe find some good dinners to eat wherever I pass. Defiantly gonna end on huge bacon cheeseburger somewhere. And once itâ€™s all gone. That will be the end of the road. One final road trip to the end of the road. 

â€œPeace be the Journeyâ€
