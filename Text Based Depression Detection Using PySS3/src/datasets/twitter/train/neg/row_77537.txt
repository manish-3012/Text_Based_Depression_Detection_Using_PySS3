Everytime i go outside i do something embarasing, i'm so tired of my existence.I feel like my brain is too foggy to actually do anything well.

My mom ordered me to paycheck something (yay, let's fucking let something so important to a depressed ADHD person that it's likely goingto fuck up and not pay atention, what could it go wrong?), okay...the door was locked...but there where people inside...i see there's people waiting outside well...for some reason my brain through it was a good idea to not go to the queue...so i standed still there for 4 minutes and people where looking at me...and i realize "what the fuck im doing?" and i embarasingly go to the queue wanting to die inside.

Then when i finially go inside, the receptionists tells me i don't have x thing so i have to come back latter, it was so embarassing!

When i arrived home i started to cry i'm just so fucking imcompetent, my brain doesn't work well i'm fucking broken.
