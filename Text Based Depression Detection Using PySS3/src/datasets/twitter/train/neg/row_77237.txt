Lack of work, can't find job, end of rope.Hey guys,

Sorry, I can't believe I am posting this but honestly it's come to the point that I'm scared of what I might do to myself. I've been unemployed since the beginning of August and have had zero luck looking for jobs since then. I actually quit my job to pursue a successful business I had started  with but my luck turned to the worst when I lost my business right as I quit my job. I was hoping I wouldn't have to enter the workforce again, but here I am and because I currently don't have a job it makes finding another job exponentially more difficult. I had hope that I'd get a role at a start-up I interviewed for but I just got my rejection letter today which I can add onto the pile of other rejection letters I've gotten. I had always hoped I'd live a successful life but god gave us Covid and killed my dreams. Not just my job, but everything I had was ruined with Covid and I am financially in the hole. 

I have had suicidal idealization for \~7 years now that has been on/off based off my external circumstances. The past 2 months have brought me to the lowest I've been mentally in the past 7 years, thinking of suicide daily and more recently planning on ways of doing it. It almost feels like I can't control the thought and in times of clarity I think to myself that I shouldn't and can't do it. The biggest thing stopping me is my mom &amp; dad who would be destroyed if I did it (I'm an only child). Also I have a best friend who attempted years ago and when I got a call from him in the hospital I broke down crying and I don't want him or my girlfriend to feel that way about me. I can't keep the thought out of my head that ending it all will be my way of getting back at society for the way my life turned out.

I want it to be clear I am not in immediate danger, I am trying to prevent myself from getting to that point. Thank you for hearing me out, typing this out has helped a little.
