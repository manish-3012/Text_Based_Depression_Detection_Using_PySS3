Failing hope.If I were to be honest with myself there is one crystal clear person that I blame for the way I feel. I hate them for what they've done to me and how useless I feel tonight. All he does is sit around all day dreaming about how things will be better tomorrow but never able to just get up and do the simplest of things. I'm talking about myself, 33, married and hurting those I care about most every day. I'm out of work and the best I can make myself do is to maybe have dishes done and dinner cooked for when my wife gets home. The rest of my day is spent trying to distract myself from feeling sorry for myself... Telling myself that others have it harder just fucking man up and do what you're supposed to do. Yet there I sit watching life as my wife begins to resent me and all I want to do is yell and change and be better, but the weight of it all feels like it's grinding every spark of life out of me. I sit here thinking about ending it all, not because I don't want to feel anything ... but because I want my wife to be free from me. She says she won't leave me even though it feels like I don't care about her or us anymore. She's about the only thing I do care about but even that doesn't seem to be enough to break these chains. I feel like if I don't cut the rope I'm going to drag her down too and I can't live with that. Every night I go to sleep with the hope that tomorrow I'll be a man worth her love again and every day I fail miserably.
