Anyone ever wish to die naturally because they don't have the courage to commit suicide?I want to die but I know I don't have the courage or the resources to do it. I stay up at night and wish that I would die naturally. That I would get cancer or any terminal illness. That I get into a car accident. That I die in my sleep. Anything that allows me to die without having to do it myself. Does anyone else feel like this? I know I'll never have the courage to take matters into my own hands and kill myself so I know that I have a very long time left to suffer. Im only 23.
