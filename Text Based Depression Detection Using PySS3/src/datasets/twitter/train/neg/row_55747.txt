i'm passively suicidal all the time.something bad happens? i immediately think of suicide. these thoughts never go away and they're always festering in the back of my mind if i'm ever happy. and i'm so sick of it. i may not be actively ready to do it, but i'm always thinking about it and fantasizing about my death. i can't get hospitalized again due to expenses, so i'm stuck. i'm giving up.
