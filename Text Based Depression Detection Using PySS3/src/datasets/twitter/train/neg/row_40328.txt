Sorry it's long I needed to vent.I just don't want to leave my room and I just want to sleep and never wake up I've seen and heard some f**ked up sh*t, and I just feel so guilty for stuff that I should of said. My best friend told me it's not my fault but if my pathetic excuse for a father raped me instead of all my brothers and sister then I would be at peace I've seen how badly it effects my siblings and I'm the youngest it's just messed up that nothing happened to me. I just feel like it should have happened to me so nothing happened to them and now my father is hiding away he got off Scott free and the judge said "it's family problems and to work it out at home" I just cried for 5 hours or more when I heard that. But I hope one day I will be able to talk to him and make him feel like nothing I hope one day he tries to kill himself and ends up as a cripple I just want him to pay for all the pain  and hurt when he dies I will be at peace because God forbid he does something to a kid I'm not a religious person but I pray he doesn't do anything to another kid, and all I do is pop pills smoke weed and drink to cope and no one knows about how I feel in my family they just think I'm some happy kid that loves life I'm the opposite I despise life.
