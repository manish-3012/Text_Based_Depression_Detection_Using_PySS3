Worried about someone I had to fire.So I had to fire a guy today who has made comments in the past that he had been suicidal.  I know him well enough to know he is not in a good mental state.  When I let him go I had to call the police to get him to leave.  He didn't threaten anyone or anything he just acted hysterical and wouldn't leave.  He finally did right before they got there.  Here is my question.  I am worried about the guy but for reasons that are obvious I cannot be in contact with him.  I thought about asking the police if they could do a well being check on him but I worried that will only wind him up more or end up arrested.  Apologies in advance if I have broken etiquette or rules.
