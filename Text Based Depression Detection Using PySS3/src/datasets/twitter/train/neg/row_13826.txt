Just lost my best friend, trying to work up the courage to kill myselfAll my life I've eventually driven away everyone who's gotten close to me, and I just can't live like this anymore. I am useless, a burden and defective. I've written my suicide note and I'm trying to work up the courage to get it over with. I'm so sick of myself and constantly having to fight just to maintain a false facade of normalcy. I can't do it anymore. I went to psychotherapy for a while, got turned away because my therapist thought I should quit weed and establish a routine first. I smoke way less often than I used to and feel no better, and it'll take months to get back into psychotherapy. I don't know if I even can get better, and I don't feel up to sticking around to find out.
