Do you ever try to force fateâ€™s hand?I mean, like, making your situation in life nigh inescapable but down that one dark path?

I suppose Iâ€™m writing just to write. Iâ€™m sure I wonâ€™t reply because of embarrassment. But on the off chance I do, Iâ€™ll spill it all. 

Iâ€™ve ignored my job for days. I might have one still if I call them within the next 12 hours. 

My husband is finding excitement in another woman who heâ€™s not met yet. But he spends 5hrs a day video chatting, ignoring me. 

I might not have been a great spouse, but this is now my life. 

I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s recovery from being such an awful woman as I.
