I just have no idea what to do anymoreIâ€™m typing this up and I have really no idea what to say. I just feel trapped and it feels like I just keep flip flopping back and forth between hating myself and wanting to die then thinking that I donâ€™t deserve to think like that and that Iâ€™m not really depressed and I have no right to be depressed. I just donâ€™t feel comfortable talking to people about it. I love a pretty good life. Iâ€™m successful in school (4.0, all honors, 29 on the ACT, all that shit) and I have good success in sports and I have plenty of friends and people like me but idk it just all feels so fake. Nothing feels like itâ€™s just ever enough. I always feel like my friends really donâ€™t like me and that this is some kind of pity project everyone is in on but me. Everything just feels like itâ€™s gonna collapse on me any moment and itâ€™s suffocating. And I know Iâ€™m prolly posting to people whoâ€™ve been through some real shit but idk I feel like I needed to just get this out here cause idk what to do otherwise. If youâ€™ve read all of this thank you and if you have advice please tell me cause Iâ€™m lost rn
