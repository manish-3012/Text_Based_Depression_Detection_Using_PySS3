Iâ€™m defeated.Iâ€™ve met people in my life who told me Iâ€™m a loser, pathetic, ugly, not going anywhere in life. Theyâ€™re all right. Years of trying to convince myself that better days arrive is just not true. Thatâ€™s just the way it is, life is just completely unfair.

I hate how theyâ€™re all 100% correct. 

After I graduate college in a year Iâ€™ll kill myself. It was incredibly hard making good friends in highschool and Iâ€™ve heard how hard it is making life lasting bonds outside of school.

After being alone for so long it gets hard being by yourself. Not even talking about a relationship, my friendships are all over. There are days where I dream about having someone to talk to daily.

All I ever wanted to do is connect with someone, no one wants to get to know me because Iâ€™m poison. Everyone who enters my life leaves eventually. They move onto something better, everyone moves on to something better, and Iâ€™m left behind. 

I have been alive for 18 years and I have nothing to show for it. All my life has added up to absolutely nothing. No one is better off knowing me.
