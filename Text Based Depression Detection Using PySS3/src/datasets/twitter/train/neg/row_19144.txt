Iâ€™m so tired27f, Iâ€™m just so tired of living. Iâ€™m tired of getting up. Iâ€™m tired of trying to get a better life but failing at everything I do. I canâ€™t hold down a job because of my ADHD/depression/anxiety related memory issues. I have absolutely no one other than my sis, my dad, and my mom. If I died, they would truly be the only ones that care, and Iâ€™m not even sure about my mom. She keeps pushing everyone away and I doubt sheâ€™d be willing to go out of the house even for my funeral. My sis and dad would be gutted. But thatâ€™s barely getting me through the day.

The last therapist I went to basically threatened to call the cops on me unless I told him I wouldnâ€™t kill myself then spent the rest of the session ranting about why my sister should be on antidepressants. (She wasnâ€™t at the time, but has since gone back on them.)

Iâ€™m sure some of you will think this is fake since Iâ€™m not an active Redditor, and thatâ€™s okay. I just want to let someone know that itâ€™s just gotten too hard. And I donâ€™t want to push this on my family. Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ve heard enough of my whining.
