I canâ€™t do this.. I donâ€™t want toI just feel so terrible and low.. I feel so alone and am literally on the verge of a breakdown. I just want someone sweet to be there for me but I know thatâ€™s too much to ask for. I just wish I was good enough.. good enough to keep being loved by her.. good enough so that she wouldnâ€™t had left for someone else. Iâ€™m such a good for nothing fuck up.. itâ€™s all I ever was. I wish I had the will to end myself the time I tried. This pain is too much..
