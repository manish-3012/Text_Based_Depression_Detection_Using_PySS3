I don't know what to think i have had these thoughts since childhoodever since i was a child, i always had these weird urges to just escape my body, 
these urges changed when my dad had told me he had never wanted me when i was a teenager, it really messed with my psyche somehow i had made the connection that if he had never wanted me, i should just be dead, 
now from time to time i will just have these random thoughts where i kill my self, 
sometimes these thoughts get bad, real bad, the other night i had a thought to go grab a chainsaw and just saw my brain in half... i really don't know what to do some days....
