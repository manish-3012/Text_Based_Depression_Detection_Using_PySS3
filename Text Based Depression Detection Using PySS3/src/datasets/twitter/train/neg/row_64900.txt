My Plan for TonightI would give a step by step rundown but I don't want to trigger anyone else. 

But in the end, it involves me comfortably dead. 

I am sick of trying anymore. Even when everything goes right, I still feel like a heaping pile of crap. I've tried dozens of meds and treatments. Still, nothing.

I'm through.
