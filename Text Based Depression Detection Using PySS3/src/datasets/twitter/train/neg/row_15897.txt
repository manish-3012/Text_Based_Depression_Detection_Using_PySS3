I had dreams. Dreams of being an architect, one that incorporated nature and grew with it, as to save Nature and let her blossom with us, instead of cutting her down and paving over it all, destroying her very being. Dreams of being a writer, creating whole new worlds, ideas, people, whether through fantasy, book, movie or otherwise. I had dreams of traveling the world and spreading love to all.

I also had lucid dreams. Dreams that you could control, and have the ability to do whatever you wanted. For years I sought after these dreams and learned many techniques as I grew up. It sounded amazing! Do whatever you like! The freedom! The only problem?

Waking up fucking sucks.
-
Waking up from them. Not noticing anything wrong at first. But the world would feel different. Then over time, you'd wake up feeling off. Like something wasn't right. Followed by a chaos ensuing your mind. Darkness would descend upon the spark within you. This storm would grow and warp, turning from anger, to sadness, to hatred and confusion, and then to bitterness and fury. The spark remained lit, but wavered from time to time and slowly started fading. The last few weeks of my life I sat in the final stage of numbness and understanding. Within these weeks I realized: I couldn't wake up from these dreams anymore. To be ripped back into a reality that I control less and less each day? The dreams used to help, now no more. The spark was the smallest it ever was but was still going, still fighting, trying to grow. There were things left fighting for. There were people, and places! But..the moment that the cloud overwhelmed the spark and finally blew it away, was when I realized..

I'm tired.
-
Tired of my body hurting so damn bad every time I look at it, because even as it blossoms, i still mostly see my flaws, and can see nothing but lies my brain tells me. Dysphoria's a bitch. Tired of questioning everything. Tired of the world being such an unkind place to live. Tired of not being able to fix all the suffering in the world. Wiping away the pain of others. 
-
No more.

I'm one with the trees
Keeper of the keys
Where you see as loss
Is where I dance and sleep 'mong the moss 
Come away with me 
Even for a minute, see
What the world could truly be
