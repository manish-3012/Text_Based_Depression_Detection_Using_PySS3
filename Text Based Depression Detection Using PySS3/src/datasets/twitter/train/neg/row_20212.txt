Is anyone preparing for the lonely Friday night thatâ€™s inevitably coming.Just want some re assurance Iâ€™m not alone in this, dreading Friday more than any weekday. Its just a constant reminder of how happy I used to be, getting off work or out of school to go and socialize and getting caught up in the moment, enjoying life. 

But now, like I said, it keeps those good memories at the forefront of my thought process so when I realize that tonight is only coming with a craving for drugs to escape, no friend to share my life with, and a constant fantasy of eating a bullet in my shower it only makes the day I have ahead of me more pointless and miserable.
