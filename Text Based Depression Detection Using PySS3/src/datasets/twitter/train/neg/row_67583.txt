Depressed Aethist Vs Depressed Theist !!Who is more prone to suicide and how can i stop myself?As the title suggests, Iâ€™m in the middle of nowhere.Agnostic maybe the proper word for me. 
Whatever, Iâ€™m in deep trouble and depressed.
Only something *miraculous* can save me from this misery. As a leaning atheist, itâ€™s too difficult for me to believe and pray to god for a *miracle*. Every passing day is taking my hope away. 
This dilemma itself attributing a part to my depression. I hope people of this sub can suggest me some solutions.
Thanks
