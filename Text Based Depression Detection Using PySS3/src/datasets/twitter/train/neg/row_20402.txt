SighI don't understand. I was the prettiest boy in the school when I was a kid. I was the most intelligent. I was the best in Math. I had perfect A grades. I was the national Karate champion. Multitalent for everything.

All that until puberty hit me at 12. I ditched the only girl who said she liked me, because I thought she was manipulating me. And I never got her back. 

Look at me 8 years later. I'm sexually and emotionally frustrated kissless virgin. Psychologically, intellectually, spiritually and physically devolved and underdeveloped miserable pathetic loser, going lower and lower. Tons of psychological pain, depression, Homophobia and Incestphobia OCD, generalized and social anxiety, hatred towards human race and opposite sex, etc. Trying to pass the exams which don't need studying on some unprosperous phylology "college" in a shitty town with masochistic people. Bad financial situation and family bonds. Zero social life, can't look at girls, girls can't look at me. I won't ever touch a girl that's not a virgin.

Killing myself on Monday. How did it turn out like this. Why. That's my only question.

Edit: I was at the top, fell on the buttom. My elementary school teacher will never believe I'm the same person.
