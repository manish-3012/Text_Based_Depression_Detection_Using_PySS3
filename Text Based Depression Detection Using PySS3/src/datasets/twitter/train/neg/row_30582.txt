I feel so sorry for my parents.It must be fucking horrible to have such a shitty son. I canâ€™t even imagine whatâ€™s it like to see your son that you love grow to be such a fucking disappointment. They honestly did everything they could and provided me a good life, but I still ended up such a piece of shit. I am so fucking lazy and incompetent and pathetic. Holy shit. I canâ€™t believe they had to put up with 18 years of my bullshit. I have so much respect for them for that. I canâ€™t fucking believe it. How is it even possible for me to be this fucking awful? I am so so so fucking shit. I am shit. I am worse than nothing. And this whole self-pity bullshit that Iâ€™m doing right now? Itâ€™s toxic as hell and that makes me hate myself even more. I canâ€™t fucking escape. I really should just fucking kill myself. But that would scar and break my parents! Thereâ€™s no fucking escape! Thereâ€™s nowhere to fucking go and nothing to do. I have to keep running, but my legs feel like theyâ€™re going to give out and my lungs burn and I have a cramp and thereâ€™s hurdles in my way and thereâ€™s people holding me back and Iâ€™m wearing weighted ankle bracelets. But I have to keep fucking running but I really really really want to stop. Please I want to die. Please. Please somebody fucking kill me. Please.
