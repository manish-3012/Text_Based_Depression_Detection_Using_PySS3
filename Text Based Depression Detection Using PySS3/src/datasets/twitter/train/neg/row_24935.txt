I want to dieI ruin any relationship thatâ€™s ever meant something to me. My best friend hates me now because I slept with my ex, her boyfriend at the time, and didnâ€™t tell her. I know it was wrong and I will spend the rest of my life regretting that decision. He kept telling me that he wasnâ€™t happy with her and that he didnâ€™t know how to end things without hurting her (bullshit lier) he swore he would never tell her because he knew what it would do to our friendship. Well he told her anyway without warning me and now she hates me. She was my everything and I loved her with my whole heart, now that sheâ€™s gone and Iâ€™m alone I just donâ€™t see the point anymore.
