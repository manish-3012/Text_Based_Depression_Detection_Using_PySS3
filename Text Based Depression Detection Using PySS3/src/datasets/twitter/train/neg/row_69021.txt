Alright boys. Itâ€™s time to be honest for once.Well Iâ€™m a compulsive liar, Iâ€™m in the navy, I canâ€™t feel anything, and I have anxiety all day long, for no reason. Sleeping is terrifying, I hate being alone, when Iâ€™m out I feel just as lonely as I always do, thereâ€™s a beautiful girl in my life. But I love her so much it gives me anxiety that Iâ€™ll fuck it up. I just want this to end, my life, i failed out of BCS, Iâ€™m a failure. I want help but Iâ€™m afraid to ask, because I am sure like all of my other things I need in my life no one will care.
