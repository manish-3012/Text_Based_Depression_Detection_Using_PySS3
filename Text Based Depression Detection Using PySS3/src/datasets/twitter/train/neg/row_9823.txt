I don't have anything to live for.I have no actual friends who like me. I managed to push away the only person who loved me. Now I have no one. My mother broke me, my father enforced that. I really don't have anything to live for. It feels like I'm spinning in circles. I'm right back to where I started. Stuck in this circle of self hated. My whole world is falling apart and I can't stop it.
