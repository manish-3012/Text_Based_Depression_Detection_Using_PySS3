sad, bored, and sickOver the past month I have become so sick that I throw up at least once a day, have extreme headaches, and my doctors cannot find out whats wrong with me. Sometimes I think that I did this to myself from stress about school and lack of enthusiasm that has happened for a long time.  I just got a medical leave from my school because I cannot concentrate and keep crying whenever I try to do school work. I watch almost everything and cry. I can't walk far places without getting this dizzy feeling overcoming me and the need to sit down. I am tired. I'm so tired of feeling shitty and depressed about school. Sometimes I want to die but it seems like that would destroy my family so I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't know what to do. I have been a long time lurker on reddit and this is one of my only posts ever. Please help, I don't think I can take it anymore.
