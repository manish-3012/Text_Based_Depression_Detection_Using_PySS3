At a loss...I don't even know where to begin. My life feels as thought I'm trapped at the bottom of a pitch black pit entangled in debt, marital issues, regret and just general unhappiness. 

It's such a long story. I feel talking to an anonymous person(s) may help. 

I live very close to the train tracks and the trains whistles have become more inviting and welcoming lately.
