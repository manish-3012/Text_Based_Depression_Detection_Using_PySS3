Feel like I dont want to live anymoreHey guys. Sorry for bothering you. Today I felt something I hadn't felt in a long long time. I feel like dying. I just don't have the strenght to keep going anymore. I'm tired. I'm sick of trying everyday to be better, to be stronger, but with the results being the same for years. I want to give up. I just want to fucking die.
