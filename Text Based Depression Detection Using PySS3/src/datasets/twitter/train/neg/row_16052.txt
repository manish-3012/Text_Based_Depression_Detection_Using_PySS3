I donâ€™t wanna live with IBSI went to my doctor today. I havenâ€™t lost any weight. That was very disappointing. My weight is pretty bad. Itâ€™s not as bad it was before but itâ€™s still bad. I donâ€™t wanna show myself in public anymore. But the worse thing is he thinks I have IBS. 

I have had issues diarrhea since I was about 15. Itâ€™s very on and off. When itâ€™s on, I have to go to the bathroom 5-6 times a day. These issues stopped a while back after I had gallbladder surgery but they came back. I went to my doctor to discuss them. He didnâ€™t seem to look at the scans but he said it looked like an â€œirritable bowelâ€. That got me scared. Later I asked him if this is forever. I think he said about it being chronic but I donâ€™t remember much about what he said.  

Iâ€™m scared. I canâ€™t live with all this pain and dysentery all my life. I donâ€™t want my organs to feel like theyâ€™re always being grinded like clockwork forever. I might kill myself over this. I wanna die right now. Given all the other horrible things in my life, I donâ€™t wanna climb up all these mountains so I can spend my life running to the bathroom every 15 minutes half of all days. 

I told this stuff to my friend who is incontinent and has IBS. He tried to assure me. He told me to take the probiotic that was recommended and see if it works. He said â€œeverything will be all rightâ€. I canâ€™t believe him :(
