Why?I'm not sure how to describe it, but I've recently been feeling like nothing. I'm not sad or anything, but I just dread the future. But I'm mostly in a state of dissociation (as always), as if I'm treading along a narrow bridge and anything could push me over. 

I've accepted suicide and think that I could do it any day, but I don't feel as scared about it as I was before. That option has become a serene place in my mind, a potential solution to any problems I experience. 

I think it's strange because although it's difficult for me to get out of bed due to my fear and worry of the day I will experience, I'm still organizing, studying, and planning for my future. Yet at the same time, I'm sending people "thanks, goodbye, and good luck" emails, writing up my motivations for my death, and searching for painless methods (no good options yet).

Is this "peace" a good thing? I'd consider this state of constant dissociation and confusion to be better than chronic torment.
