This is for youI don't know who you are or where you're at in life right now but it doesn't matter. Things are hard and that's ok. There are people out there that understand, believe me. There are people out there that care, even if it doesn't seem that way sometimes.

I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a very long time. I have made a post on here three months ago, that day I didn't attempt. I hated myself for who I am. I thought my death was the only possible solution, I thought it was the only option I had left.

I attempted suicide in February, that was the second time I nearly died. My sister's birthday was two days ago, mine is coming up soon. I have been struggling with substance abuse. I have been off of hard drugs for a month now. My family is very religious but they are more accepting of me being gay than I could have ever imagined.

If I had succeeded, I would have missed out on so many things. I would have missed out on my sister growing up or playing fetch with the dog my neighbours recently adopted. I would have never seen the way water clings to cobwebs again. I would have missed out on the concert I went to with my friends or the new album that's coming out. I would have missed out on life.

I'm not going to say that it will get better, because that will most likely not help you and because it might not seem like it does. But it got better for me. I used to think that I wouldn't mind missing out on all those things because I would be dead, but that's not true.
