No one to talk toI'm (12F) considering it. Its been really hard to open up to someone, ive tried talking to a few close friends, but they didnt get it. Whenever i talk to my older friends, they start talking about how I am just a kid, then i just agree with them and not talk about it again. It makes me feel guilty about feeling this way. I dont really have many friends because I cant really relate to any of my classmates. I barely get the chance to hang out with someone, my best friend, started being really distant too. I dont have anyone to talk to. I feel glued to my bed, not wanting to get up, dont feel like listening to music, painting, anything.
Tried talking to my parents, didnt work either. 
Im kinda anxious of posting this too, might get judged. What should I do?
