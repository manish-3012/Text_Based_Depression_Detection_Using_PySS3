I just want it all to endI want all the self-hatred, sadness, and loneliness to end but I know it wont unless I end it all myself. Im caught in an unforgiving cycle and no matter what I do when Im full of hope everything comes crashing down eventually. The worst part is I have no one to blame but myself...why cant I just be like everyone else? Why cant I just go out and do the things I want instead of silently contemplating every action? Why cant I reach my potential? Why do I get in my own way? These are the questions I always find myself asking...

Sorry for wasting anyones time for reading this but I had to vent. My life is truly meaningless and I have nothing to live for due to my own negligence. I should have left already but I guess Im a damn coward.
