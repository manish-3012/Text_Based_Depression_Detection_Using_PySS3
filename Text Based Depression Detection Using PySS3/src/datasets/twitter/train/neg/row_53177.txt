I gave myself two years to try and fix things and make my sad excuse of a life worth living. That was one and a half year ago. Every attempt made has ended abysmally bad.I think it would be a good idea to start writing a note in the near future and figure out what to do with the little stuff that I have left. 

There is no chance of getting better. Every attempt of getting better results in a failure. 

I'm never gonna be a person who's worth giving shit about. 

I'm never gonna be someone who someone is gonna care about.

I'm never gonna be someones "partner".

I'm never gonna be a first choice
