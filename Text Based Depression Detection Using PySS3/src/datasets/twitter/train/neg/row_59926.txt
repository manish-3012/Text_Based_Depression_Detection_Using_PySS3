WorthlessI feel so anxious every moment Iâ€™m still here I donâ€™t even know how to reach out and talk to people anymore I feel so stunted and dumb. What the fuck is any of this for. It means nothing. I feel awful by the way I push people away. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m like this. I want everything to stop. I want to like rip open or combust I need something brutal to just shut it all out and fucking kill me. Like a switch. Slide into a place numb
