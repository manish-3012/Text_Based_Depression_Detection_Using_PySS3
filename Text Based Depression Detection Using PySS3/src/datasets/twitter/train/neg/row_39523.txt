Tonight I found out that my close friend, fellow redditor, fellow service member and all around great guy was a casualty of depression.If there's anything I can say to help anyone who's considering suicide let it be this.  I cannot express the emotions, fear, guilt, sadness and so many others I feel right now.  Losing someone close to you this way is unimaginable, please please please if you feel like you might take your life, don't.  Please contact someone, a friend, a relative or one of the many resources available to anyone in need.   If you ever need someone to talk with PM me and I will be more than happy to help you in any way I know possible.
