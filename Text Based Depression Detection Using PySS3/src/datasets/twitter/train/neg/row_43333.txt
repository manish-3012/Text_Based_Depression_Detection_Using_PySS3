Need someone to talk toHello, I feel really bad and I need someone to talk to, my past has really hurt me and I have not spoken to anyone about it and it really is killing me quite literally.
My thoughts and my anxiety are not helping me.
Everyday for the past couple of months I have suicide on my mind.
I want to live but Im afraid I will hurt my self or worse.

Please I need help :(
