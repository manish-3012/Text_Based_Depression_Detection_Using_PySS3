Iâ€™m in a rut that I canâ€™t get out ofLast week was one of my best weeks in a long time, I ate, exercised, slept well and because of that my mood and productivity was the best it ever had been this year. However I feel myself slipping back into the rut and I realise now that none of my highs are gonna last and my life is just going to get worse and worse as it currently is.

I dropped out of college after finding that I lack any passion for the degree Iâ€™m in and I donâ€™t have the resilience to pick up a whole new area of expertise.

My family either outright hate me, silently despise me or are ambivalent towards me. During high school I always felt that i was only friends with my friends because we were forced to because we went to the same school and this was proven true as my friends dropped away moving into college. Iâ€™ve been given a load of money when I was 18 and my family have exploited me for it and continue to do so.

I seem to blow every other potential relationship due to my lack in confidence. I was finally fired by my job of 4 years which although I hated makes me feel like an incompetent piece of shit.

It feels that when you a kid you are given so much love help and support but as soon as youâ€™re of age youâ€™re on your own. I hate that we live in this type of individualistic world.

As you can see I am so deep in shit that it feels impossible to climb out. Iâ€™ve never been predisposed towards self-harm and suicide but it seems like the only way out. I donâ€™t like asking for help or calling for attention like some people whose attempted suicides come into double digits. I will just do one successful attempt.
