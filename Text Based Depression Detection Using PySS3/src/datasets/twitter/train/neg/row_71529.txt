My friend, lets say jasmine [F15], is suicidal and i dont know what to say to help herTitle... mostly. Jasmine is a really nice girl and she has tried killing herself before but she is on the verge again. Some background to the situation, jasmine comes from an abusive home, her dad threatens/attacks her and her mum, she suffers from dopamine deficiency (lack of dopamine being produced naturally in the brain) and bulimia. Jasmine has tried finding ways to stop these thoughts through various ways, such as therapy, medication, drugs, smoking and alcohol. She has anti depressants but often forgets to take them, and she also gets drugs, cigarettes and alcohol from her parents. Im trying to help her but i really dont know what to say to help her, she has also shown me pictures of her stomach (claiming she is fat yet she isnt as she says she weights 49.3kg), her arms and legs where there are marks from self harm. Please help, i dont want to lose my best friend :(
