Idk anymoreA week ago I tried going to see my mom since my parents are divorced. I'm a 15 year old boy who hasn't seen his mother in months. When I got to her front door she opened it. She started to yell at me and ended up slamming the door in my face. That's not even the worst thing. Yesterday she came over thinking that I wouldn't notice her. Her and my dad started talking about me, the walls are paper thin so I heard everything. They said they didn't trust me and that they wanted me out of their lives and that I was a piece of shit. I was using drÅ«gs when she was still in the house. I was 3 months clean until last night, I felt horrible. I'm trying not to hurt myself but it's getting really hard
