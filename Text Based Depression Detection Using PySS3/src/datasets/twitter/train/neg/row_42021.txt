I just want to stop hurtingI'm really hurting because of a relationship gone bad. It's complicated, and I can't really talk to anyone about it. Every night I go to bed sincerely hoping I won't wake up in the morning. I've never been so hurt in my life. I don't think I'll ever really be able to trust anyone again. I just wish I could talk to someone. Or maybe just get a hug. I'd be happy if I could have just one good day where it's not constantly on my mind. I've thought about ending it before. I just don't know if I can. I don't want to die, but I don't think I can deal with this forever. It's been over 6 months and I feel like it just keeps getting worse.
