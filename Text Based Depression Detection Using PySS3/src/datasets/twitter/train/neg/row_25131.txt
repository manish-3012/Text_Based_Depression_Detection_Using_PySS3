I just need somebody to talk toI feel like I'm losing everything all at once. I'm going through a breakup, my friends have all gone home to their countries because they are international students, and my parents don't seem to notice how much I'm hurting. My ex boyfriend and his friends bully me online, and it is hard to talk to my friends about how sad I am because they didn't like my boyfriend from the beginning of the relationship. My parents don't allow me to date at 20 years old so I can't tell them what is going on. I'm not sad about the relationship ending, I'm more upset about being bullied and treated without respect. My parents also accuse me of stealing money from my older brother but he is Autistic and unintentionally signs up for subscriptions online which my parents don't believe he is capable of. I feel like I have no one to talk to. I'm thinking about suicide because I feel so lonely and worthless and can't seem to find someone to talk to.
