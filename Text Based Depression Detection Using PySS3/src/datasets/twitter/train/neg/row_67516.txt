I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself later when Iâ€™m alone.I woke up feeling so awful and low that I can not bare it anymore.

Iâ€™m not really scared of dying like I used to be, Iâ€™m going to fill my bag and shoes full of rocks and walk into the sea. 

I can no longer deal with the embarrassment and pain of being alive, I simply wish to not exist any longer.
