Only one way to make it better now.I got help, I waited, and I tried everything I could think of, and I almost deluded myself into thinking it was working. Fortunately, I was reminded of how unwanted and worthless I am.

 I'm moving up the date of my suicide to this December, probably around Christmas as a nice gift to everyone. At least I have plenty of time to write my note, I want the apology for sticking around as long as I did to be thorough. For the record, the point of this is for me to tell you that it's awful you give people false hope here. It won't get better, and it's just mean of you to say otherwise.
