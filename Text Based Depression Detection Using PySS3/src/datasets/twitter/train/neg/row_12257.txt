CollegeI moved into college. I made the choice to move away from home even though I knew I didn't have the social skills for it. I am autistic. I have Tourettes and ADHD. I don't have any friends here. Im so so lonely. I tried to make friends, but it doesn't work. I annoy people to no end. There's no point in this anymore. I don't think I can do this. I'm going to kill myself here, so my family doesn't have to find me. Im so lonely. Im so alone. All the time. Theres nothing I can do anymore. I just need to write a note for whoever finds me. And to my parents and brother. They'll be okay. Ill be okay. Everybody will be okay. Thank you.
