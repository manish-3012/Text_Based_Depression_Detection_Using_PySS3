I can't hold my feelings in forever.I want out of this life, but I know I can't go. I'm needed.

I'm just miserable for so many reasons. I'm not a naturally happy person, and I suffer from depression. I have no true joy in my life. I always feel alone. I tried being in two relationships but I was both times abandoned and left with feelings of hurt. I think I suffer from social anxiety. Lastly, I have no faith to guide me through my internal sadness.

I am probably just a liability at this point. I always thought I could find joy or purpose to continue if I was in a relationship with someone, but that's all wrong. It's not healthy. You need to already be stable and emotionally balanced before you engage in a relationship. I don't know if I can ever be like that now.

All I ever wanted was to spend my life with someone who I could care for, and maybe they would care for me right back. But I cannot and should not count on it. If I want to find inner peace I guess I have to look elsewhere. I don't even have the energy or willpower to do that though. I wish I could give up without hurting the people who need me. Until my misery outweighs my duty to them, I guess I'll just have to keep suffering.

Thanks for reading.
