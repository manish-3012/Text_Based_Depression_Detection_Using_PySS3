I'm a stupid fucking teen who had a crush on a girl and now shes killed herself and I dont know what to doAnd its so fucking unfair so fucked up. They say you dont appreciate things until theyre gone and shit and yeah I had an old account where I took advice from r/offmychest and i forgot the password of that acct now but basically I really liked this girl who had a birth defect that caused her to stutter a lot and speak slowly in general and and had a slight lisp and when I first told her I liked her like the shithead I am she just got angry and told me shes suicidal and I shouldnt look for flawed girls or something? Anyway I posted about it on that subreddit and got advice and we talked a little and we decided to become friends and I never once have seen her smile or do anything except cry or be scared of everything and it was really unfair God put her through immense suffering daily and it finally happened she shot herself with her dads gun 2 weeks ago and her suicide note said it was because of how she felt left behind and not worth anything and idk im a huge asshole for saying this but I wish she'd just let me take her out or spend quality time with her or something just let me make her feel wanted but I know that wasnt possible but I would much rather live in a world where she hates me and is in love with someone else and wants to kill me than a world where shes fucking dead because at least shed be around making the world around her a better place just existing guys you dont fucking get it shes dead shes gone she's not coming back shes dead please bring her back but guess what you can't I can't no one can God will pay for the suffering he brought upon her I will make sure he will suffer just as much as she did she was the most beautiful thing ever in my life even if she never smiled never did anything worthwhile I dont care I tried talking about it to a friend irl and he made fun of me because everyone kinda took her for a joke and by the way let me go on a fucking tangent for a second her shyness wasnt cute or endearing it kept coming in the way of her life and she was scared and sad shitless and it showed she never slept and kept drinking all the fucking time and had no interests in life I once got a little sampler I had to school and that was the first time she showed any real interest for creativity she liked hip hop I guess idk shes fucking dead and j cant do anything about it except die myself and make god pay for it all
