I just don't belong hereI wish not to wake up tommorow. But i won't be that lucky. There is nothing for me in this world, but still i'm a coward by not having the courage to end it all. Turning 30 next year and have absolutely nothing no money, no friends. Living at home, whole family fights with me. Have no social skills. Nothing gives me joy now, nothing to look forward to.
