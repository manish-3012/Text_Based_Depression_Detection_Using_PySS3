I don't know how much longer I'll be hereSome might have seen my post about a week or two ago when I was very upset. I managed to live but I haven't been able to shake the feeling of wanting to die this badly.

I feel like there's nothing left to live for

I don't know even how to talk about it I feel so stupid but I hope I go through with it tonight. I haven't told anyone about my desire to die this time. I only have online friends so I'll just tell them some story about not being able to be online or something and they won't have to worry

I don't know how to deal with my family but maybe I'll pretend to move and cut all contact and then do it

I don't know. I just want to disappear and the pain to end.
