The only thing that kept me from killing myself was my fear of painI never had any friends (at all - and I'm not exaggerating), my family doesn't give a shit about me, depression is slowly taking over my life and I have no one to talk to (in real life), I repel people no matter how hard I try to connect with them, I'm boring, ugly, unlovable, too introverted to ever socialize and a waste of space and resources - nobody needs me; nobody would care if I died - I'm 100% sure that I'm going to die alone, if not my fear of pain I would have killed myself a long time ago, but because life can only get tougher I came to a conclusion that there is nothing else I can do than to end it all. Goodbye and farewell.
