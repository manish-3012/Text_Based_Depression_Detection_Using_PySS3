Canâ€™t speak about this to anyone irl soI (21f) have made this account specifically to post here, because I donâ€™t know what to do at this point.
Iâ€™m scared because I want to end my life for a multitude of reasons, but I donâ€™t want to get it wrong and end up a vegetable or something.
I get itâ€™s really messed up to ask for advice on this, and I canâ€™t talk about this to anyone because in the past when I tried I was berated and called an attention seeker etc, and I am currently doing a psychology degree that Iâ€™m 99% sure Iâ€™m going to fail, and due to this degree I didnâ€™t feel like I could go to anyone about my depression, self harm, anxiety or suicidal thoughts because if I did get better who would hire me? So I just let it fester to the point where I have no job, no qualifications, nothing to show for myself and for years now no real will to live. If anyone could suggest a way for me to end it as painlessly as possible without a gun because I have no access  - I know thereâ€™s no guarantee but still - I would appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to read this
