I dont want to do this anymoreI have been depressed/ suicidal most of my life and many times I have promised my loved ones that I will hold onto hope and continue living. I went after my dream job and got it (product photography). I live with my girlfriend in a beautiful house. I have sought professional help and now see a therapist and take meds. I'm proud of my achievements and I'm proud that I found help and none of that changes that I want to die. Suicide has been the single biggest urge, motivator, and influence in my life. I have moved, changed careers, started and ended relationships because of it. I have never been able to get it to go away. Is there a point at which it's reasonable to just off myself or is the reasonable thing to do just continue suffering?
