Life is pain. So is death.You know, how sad is it that I have such an a amazing life and all I can think of is death. I have an amazing girlfriend that I hope I can merry someday. I have enough money to live a comfortable life while I go to school. I have good grades in college doing a major that I like and will make money. And in spite of all this. Even with having this amazing opportunity for my life most days I think about killing myself at least once. I picture whole scenarios of who will be notified. Who will find me and how Iâ€™ll die. The face of my mom dad and siblings when they find out. The shriek that my girlfriend will make when she hears about it. 

I know by all means killing my self is not the answer. I know that I should be happy. And I am happy with how my life is. But I still want to die. I still come to think Iâ€™m worthless. I still think everyone will be better off without me. Even with these scenarios playin fin my head of all the pain itâ€™ll cause itâ€™s offset by the relief I feel others will have in the long run for not having to deal with me. 

Just how sad is that. Thatâ€™s pretty pathetic. I have never achieved anything in my life. I have loved a useless life.
