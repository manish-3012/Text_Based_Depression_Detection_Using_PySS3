I want to die because I'm scared of finding happiness only to have it ripped away from meI found what I thought was happiness once and it's gone now. I'll never feel that again. It's torture knowing I'll never have it again. And even if I'm able to find happiness again one day, it will just be taken away from me by death. We all die. I don't get how people can live their lives knowing they're going to die one day. I can't live with that anxiety, so I'd really really rather get it over with and choose when I die myself..

Is life some kind of joke? If I reach all my goals and find happiness, it will all disappear at the end. How do people live with this?
