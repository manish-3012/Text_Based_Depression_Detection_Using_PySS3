I feel like I'm going to snap under the pressireI am in my final year of college, and I feel like I'm barely hanging on sometimes. I haven't had a full night's sleep in almost a month trying to keep up with my work. If I don't get this degree, it's over for me. The last thing this world needs is another overconfident, undereducated fuck-up. Sometimes I evaluate different methods of ending it all if I fail. I've never felt like this before, and I'm fucking scared... I'm so fucking scared.
