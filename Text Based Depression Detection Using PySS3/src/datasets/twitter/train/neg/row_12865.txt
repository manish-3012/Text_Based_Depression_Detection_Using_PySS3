Am I Suicidal?I'm not sure if this fits with the typical posts, but I'm not sure if I'm suicidal or if I should seek help.

I've had some arguements with my family recently, one with my aunt that got me pretty upset, and one with my father that was a lot worse. And both times recently I've had thoughts that I haven't had before.

When I got into a fight with my aunt while camping I went for a walk in the woods and started crying, and as i sat next to this large lake, I started to think of swimming until I was too weak to keep swimming. 

Today was worse. I got into a fight with my dad, who's been verbally abusive to me for years and has never cared about how he hurts me enough to even apologize. Today as I was driving around sobbing I was thinking of killing myself just to prove a point. 

It only happens when I'm emotionally distressed or upset, I start to get thoughts of suicide, I think about ending it just to show them the pain they've caused me has a fucking consequence. And this has only really started recently. And I haven't told anyone about this.

Should I seek help for this? Is this normal? I just dont want to get to a point where I'm so emotionally overwhelmed and hurt I do something to hurt myself.
