I don't know is living worth a try. (cry for help).I have been battling for my though's quite while. I have means to end my life. Detonators at hand. Car. Living in a high place. Train track near. 

I know that I don't wanna take anyone else's life with me. Just me. So, that kind of rules out of Train tracks. Living in a high place, well it takes quite a lot of time to fall, what if a neighbour walks out and I fell over her/him? So there goes that. Car, well surely I can pick a spot where no one is near? Yeah, right there is always a chance that some is going to be there and by then it's too late to miss.

Detonators... well.
