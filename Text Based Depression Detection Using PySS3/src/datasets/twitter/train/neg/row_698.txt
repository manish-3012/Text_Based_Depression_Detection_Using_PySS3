fuck it, im over this shitI Thought losing weight would make things better. â€œI just need abs and Iâ€™ll be happyâ€. I still look in the mirror and see the fat kid who shoved bags of Doritos into his mouth daily. I Thought going to college and having fresh faces and a fresh start would stop the feelings deep down. It didnâ€™t. Thought finding a girl to be happy with would make me happy. It didnâ€™t. Thought starving myself to finally make my body how I always wanted it to look would help make me feel better in the long run. It didnâ€™t. Everyday I wake up wishing I hadnâ€™t. I still get out of bed and try every day though. Some days are better than others. Today was amazing. Spent the entire day with a beautiful girl. Her laugh and smile made me laugh and smile. Yet here I am at 1am with suicidal thoughts. I fight a losing  battle every fucking day man. Things arenâ€™t getting any easier. Iâ€™ve realized I have no passions. No hobbies. No real drive for anything in life. I feel so lost everyday. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold out honestly. The only reason I havenâ€™t jumped off a building yet is because it would ruin my family. I love my little sisters and I know how much it would impact their lives to attend the funeral of their big brother. Guys your big brother is trying, I really am. I just want to be happy but every day is somehow worse than the last. Iâ€™m sick of picking myself up just to be knocked down again. Fuck this cycle. 

If anyone ever ends up reading this - know I did it because I woke up one day and wasnâ€™t strong enough. Iâ€™m sorry, donâ€™t blame anyone but me.
