I need adviceAfter months of chronic stress that were hell Iâ€™ve finally been pretty stress free. But now because of the stress I now have cognitive troubles. I can barely manage to have a conversation or watch tv without being overwhelmed. I canâ€™t do anything because itâ€™s too much for me. Also I have headaches everyday that are really bad and itâ€™s making me wanna blow my brains out. They stop me from doing anything I just lie around all day until it goes away and I can do something and even then I donâ€™t enjoy anything. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m gonna get a job and move out like this. My mind is mush. Sometimes I wish that it turned out I had a brain tumor so then Iâ€™d have a reason for everything thatâ€™s happening. I donâ€™t even know if itâ€™s possible to heal and get out of this but Iâ€™m trying. Just typing this out was hard for me. Hopefully everything Iâ€™ve said makes sense. But yeah thanks for reading &lt;3
