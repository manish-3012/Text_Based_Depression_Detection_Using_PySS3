I think I am ready.I had a voice that used to tell me not to give up and that every time I wanted to do it the voice would convince me that I am doing something very stupid. Recently I fell in love with a girl I was going out with and we had something great going. But due to my insecurities and I guess hers too we broke up. I think she was the one positive thing that was going strong in my life and I was happy with her. But after the break up the voice has disappeared. She was the one person I couldn't get angry at and the one person I felt safe to be me. It's like the voice agrees. I'm scared that I am not Gona be able to stop myself this time.
