Iâ€™m an 18 year old stripper with nothing to loseI was supposed to be a lawyer. I was in college and everything and I just... I donâ€™t know that happened. Well, a lot of things happened. My dad left. My family fell apart. I became addicted to cocaine and alcohol and anything else Iâ€™m able to get my hands on. 

I slept with the manager at the club I work at. 20-something with pretty words and a god complex. I was so fucking stupid. I fall in love too easily, and I know that, but I didnâ€™t think I would with him, because I havenâ€™t had any sort of feeling or real emotion in months.  I feel like I keep giving away pieces of myself to people and now thereâ€™s nothing left. 

Now it feels like Iâ€™m feeling all of it. Like someone had been slipping away my feelings from me and collecting them, storing them away for when I needed them the least and now... Now itâ€™s all just too much. Itâ€™s not even because of him, or my family, or my job. The reasoning behind it is actually pretty simple.

I donâ€™t like myself. In fact, I think I hate myself. I think I always have.

Someone asked me today in conversation what the worst thing iâ€™d ever done was. I thought and thought and realized that all of the bad things I had done, I had only done to myself.  Ever since I was a kid Iâ€™ve set mutilated in one way or another. I developed an eating disorder pretty early on. I started using drugs when I was 16. Iâ€™ve spent my whole life destroying myself. 

I donâ€™t even wanna die. I donâ€™t want the vomiting and the convulsions and the funeral and the weeping loved ones. I just wanna disappear, quietly. leave a note that says iâ€™ve run off to some foreign country when in reality iâ€™ve just vanished, vaporized, died in a field somewhere where no one will ever find me to mourn me. 

I canâ€™t do this anymore.
