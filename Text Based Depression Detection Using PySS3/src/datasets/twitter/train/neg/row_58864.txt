Reaching out for help...I've never reached out for any help because I've always felt I'd be wasting someone's time. I don't want to be the way I am anymore, and the only way I feel I can accomplish that is through suicide. I don't have anything in general, but I can answer specific questions, is posed.
I'm not trying to waste anyone's time, though I feel like I am anyway.
I just want help, and I don't know who to turn to anymore...
