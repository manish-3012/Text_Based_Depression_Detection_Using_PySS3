I'm so tiredI spend every day just wanting to end it, I live next to a train station and some overpasses and they haunt me. Every night I go to bed praying to god to take me away from this place. So many people have it so much worse why do I hate being alive so much? Why is it so hard to function? I just want to be like everyone else, I'm sick of standing at the border of life and death. No one cares about me or even knows me I've tried everything to make my life better, exercise, diet, therapy, school, clubs, social groups, just about everything but nothing helps. I think some people are just destined to be the bottom rung, to suffer. All I want to do is sleep and I get screamed at constantly for it, I can't keep a job, I'm not doing well in school, I'm alone. What do I have to live for.
