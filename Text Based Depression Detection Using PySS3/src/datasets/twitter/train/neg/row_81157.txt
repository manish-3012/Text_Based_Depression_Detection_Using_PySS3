I know I know, Iâ€™m just a whiny bitchBut once my brain matter gets splattered on a wall, everyoneâ€™s going to be all â€œI really cared about himâ€ and â€œHow tragic.â€ I donâ€™t have some fucking traumatic event or anything bad so everyone just thinks Iâ€™m a bitch. I donâ€™t do drugs to cope, I donâ€™t have a bad life, so Iâ€™m fine. Iâ€™ll show them what fine means.
