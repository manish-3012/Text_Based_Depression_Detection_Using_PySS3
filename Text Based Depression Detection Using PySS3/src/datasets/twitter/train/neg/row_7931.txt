Im planning a suicide for march 21Im 11. My birthday is coming up in a few days, but i dont even give a shit this time. All its doing is bringing me closer to death.

Why march 21? No particular reason, chose a random date and it stuck. It started as a joke, before the suicidal thoughts. Its not like everything suddenly changed witha family member dying or anything, the depression just gradually got worse.

Ive been wanting to commit suicide pretty bad, but im worried about my family being sad, or my 2 actual friends. Or another worrying thing is that it wouldnt work and i would just be crippled for the rest of my life.

I am going to shoot myself, thats how ill do it, but i have no ammo. The ammo got moved to a safe a while ago, before depression. No biggie at the time. But now it actually matters.

There is a slight chance that thingsll get better, but, at this rate, theres at least a 75% chance ill kill myself when and how i planned. If i can get some means of ammo.

To sum it up, life is shit, and im probably gonna end it.
