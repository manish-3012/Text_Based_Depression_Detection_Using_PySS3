I said I'd do it after ChristmasWell the times here (don't worry not actually tonight). I'm gonna push it back til after new years, I wish I gave myself an exact date. I wish I had a good way to do it planned. This is something that needs to happen and I keep putting it off and that means I'm stuck with me for that much longer. I'm tired of being a piece of shit and I'm tired of the mandatory 1 to 2 hr loop of suicidal thoughts that come before bed no matter how good a day it was. I can't be happy its not how I'm supposed to be. I don't think I was ever supposed to be here in the first place.
