Nothing motivates me, I see no point in living anymoreEver since I was about 12 things have gotten worse and worse. I'm now 17 (18 in a few months). 





Absolutely nothing motivates me. I have no energy to do anything. Everything in life seems so hard and pointless, so why bother? 



In the UK, people my age have their a level exams. These pretty much determine your future. Everyone seems to care, studying for them, I'm here and couldn't give a shit about if I pass or fail. I find passing will be worse as it will give me an excuse to continue living. 



I can't call a suicide line without being overhead, so that isn't really an option (my dad is unemployed and he will hear me). 





I initially I had thoughts on suicide, but didn't think of doing it. But now I'm determined to end it. 



The only thing that makes me happy in the slightest is imagining myself dead. Whenever I'm in class, I imagine as if I died and I was no longer there, and the thought of being dead genuinely makes me happy.
