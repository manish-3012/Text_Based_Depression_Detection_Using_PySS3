Kicked out of rehabI've been trying to get clean from meth for thr last half year. I cant stop. It fucking hurts. I admitted myself into rehab after an OD. I was there for about a month but i ran away from the facility and got fucked up at a stranger's house in a neighborhood I don't know snd passed out in front of the facility. They wouldn't let me back in the program, called my parents to pick me up and take me home. I feel like s fucking failure. My significant other is pissed off at me.  I csnt do this anymore. I csnt stay clean. I'm hitting up dealers as I type this. I wanna shoot some h and just off myself. I'm done disappointing those I love
