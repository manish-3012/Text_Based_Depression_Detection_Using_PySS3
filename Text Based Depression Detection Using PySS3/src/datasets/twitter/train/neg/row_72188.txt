I have no will to live.Hey, I'm fairly new to this subreddit and reddit in general, and I came here for the sole purpose of venting. I'll just get right into it.

I'm basically only alive out of obligation for my parents and siblings. But before I delve into that, I should probably describe myself. I'm short, overweight, and have no relationships outside of my family. I'm an utterly hopeless, cowardly, depraved piece of human garbage. I'm afraid of practically everything, and that's not much of an exaggeration. I talk to myself because I have no friends and doing so sometimes makes me feel like I have people to talk to. I'm in a college that I didn't want to go to, studying for a career that I don't really care for. Then again, that doesn't matter much because I have no clue what I want anyway. I have no talents, hobbies, or interests. I complain about never having time to rest, but when I do get time, I overwork myself instead. I work a dead-end, shitty retail job. But I guess that it's a perfect job for someone with no motivation to do anything. I used to play video games, but I don't even do that anymore. I whine about not having friends, but I'm too afraid to try and make friends.  I complain about everything, but I never try to change anything. I'm 18 and I already feel like there's basically nothing to look forward to. I constantly, *constantly* think about killing myself, but then I have to remind myself that my parents and siblings would be upset if I died and that they still have expectations of me. Expectations that I can't hope to fulfill. I'm planning on just waiting until my parents and siblings die so I can finally end my miserable, useless life without anyone to remember me. Luckily I'm the youngest child, so I only have to wait a few decades. The fact that I didn't feel a shred of anything typing that out is probably concerning. 

In conclusion, I don't feel any desire to live for myself in any capacity. Sorry for the length and any spelling errors.
