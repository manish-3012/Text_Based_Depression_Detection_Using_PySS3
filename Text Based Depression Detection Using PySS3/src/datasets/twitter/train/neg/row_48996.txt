Reddit please help meI need your help.

My girlfriend still loves me, but I yelled at her because I thought her dad was judging me. My girlfriend said that he was calling me a bum and I said I wanted a "fucking apology". Well that was an overreaction, like I always do, because they were just joking around. Her brother now hates me, and I will never get his respect again, but she still loves me after the way I treated her.

She said she would break up with me if I ever did it again.

Reddit, I cannot take that chance. I don't have the heart to break up with her though. Either way, I'm gonna hurt her.

I need someone to come kill me, or give me a way to kill myself. I cannot live with myself anymore. I'm the worst human being on the face of the planet, and I must be killed. Please god kill me. Please.

Please.
