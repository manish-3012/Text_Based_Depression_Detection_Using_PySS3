Just stupid poetryLife
What's that word mean to me anyway
I've never really had one
And at the end of the day
I ask whatever's out there to put an end to this

I sit and think each night
Especially when the moon's bright
And just think
What what happen if I disappeared
And crumbled away to dust
Would they miss me
Or attend my funeral because they must

I wish I could find some peaceful place to rest
Something like a cozy nest
Somewhere up in the stars 
Maybe then I would twinkle down
And bring happiness to the people all around

I'm so tired
I wish I could rest my eyes
I'm so sad
I wish I could stop all the lies
That they feed us

I'm so stressed I feel I could blow
I wonder when it's time to go
I wish I could know

I'm so sad I feel like i could drown
Into salty black abyss I sink down
Into glittering black waters

I'm so angry I feel I could explode
Everything knawing me forcing me to erode
Until I snap
Life feels like a trap

I'm so confused I can't figure out where to go
Everything moves so slow
But then slips by
I'm not sure there's a point to even cry

Life is nothing but pain
Where so few get to gain
And the rest of us drain
All we have to feed
Those far from in need

So what is life anyway
It's not fair
Some get to play
But in the end we are made to pay

I wish I could blink away
Become a star
Or a new tree
So I could watch life go by
And finally be free
