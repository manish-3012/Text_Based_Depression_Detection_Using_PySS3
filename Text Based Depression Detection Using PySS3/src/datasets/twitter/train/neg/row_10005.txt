Recently survived a suicide attempt... Just decided I'd do a little bit to help you guys so you don't make the same mistake.Hey /r/suicidewatch, I decided I'd come here not to tell you guys of my story, or to depress you further, but I really, seriously want to help anyone who wants to be helped. 

I know that talking to people helps, and if you want any advice, or just someone to talk to, anything at all, I'm willing to stay up all night and do my best. I won't judge you, I won't force details out of you. Even if you just want to talk about ANYTHING, no matter how irrelevant it is.

I'm not doing this to be a "white knight" or anything, please don't take me as condescending and superficial, but I've realized and regretted my actions - I'm very lucky to be able to sit here and type this.

I want you all to be able to sit there and type for a very, very long time.

EDIT: And if you wanna know my story, you'd have to PM me! That's the first step.
