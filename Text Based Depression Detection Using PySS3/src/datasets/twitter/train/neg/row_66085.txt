What can I do?My son came home to find his best friend hanging in my sons kitchen.... he got him down and attempted CPR but it was too late....they are both 28 years old... this is the same night that another friend had died in a motorcycle accident less then 5 hours previously...... I am a Firefighter/first responder/EMT and was on both calls.... the call to my sons house I responded alone, with the only information being my sons address and there being a 28 year old male found hanging in the kitchen dead..... I responded alone not knowing if my son was the victim..... my son now is refusing to return to his beautiful home that he has worked soooo very hard for... he is staying with me and his father and we donâ€™t know what we need to do for him..... I donâ€™t want to leave him alone,  yet I donâ€™t want to smother him and make him feel like heâ€™s â€œliving with his parents againâ€.   Can anyone lead me in the right direction.... I was there I saw what he saw,  but Iâ€™m trained for that and it wasnâ€™t my best friend...... my son is also isnâ€™t one to open up... he shuts down.... and I know that he wonâ€™t come to me as his mom because he wonâ€™t want me to worry.... Iâ€™m just at a loss on how to proceed.
