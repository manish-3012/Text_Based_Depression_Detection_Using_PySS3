How do I tell my friends?Iâ€™ve been depressed all of my life but I was recently diagnosed with anxiety. Iâ€™m in a really bad place in my life right now and I canâ€™t always be emotionally available for my friends. It gets harder and harder to hide my depression and anxiety, especially since Iâ€™m a high schooler. But I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Idk if I want to tell them or not (Also Iâ€™m too scared to go to my school counselor for help so thatâ€™s not an option) 
TLDR: how do I tell my friends about my mental health problems?
