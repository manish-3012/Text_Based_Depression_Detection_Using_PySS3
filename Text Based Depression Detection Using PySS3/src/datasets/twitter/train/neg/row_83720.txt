My girlfriend is threatening suicide right nowWe were friends for a couple years in high school and got together about two months ago while I was on break from college. We go to different schools so we're long distance and don't see each other except on breaks. I know she's had problems with depression in the past, but she seemed mostly over it. 

About 15 minutes ago she sent me a long FB message basically saying she doesn't feel like she's meant to be alive, she feels like she's in constant pain and losing all of her friends. She mentioned having sleeping pills. I'm on the phone with her now. What do I do?

Update: She just said she won't do it tonight because she wants to see me again, but I'm not sure if she's lying so I'll hang up and she can do it or if she's having second thoughts, or if she's actually planning on waiting until after we see each other again.
