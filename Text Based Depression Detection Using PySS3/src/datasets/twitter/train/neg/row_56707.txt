I hate it when people congratulate meSo just for a bit of background: I got delayed at uni because of two failed suicide attempts in 2017. Now I've completed all my units for my degree and am set to graduate with honors this year. I'm not really happy about this or anything, it's more of a 'so I can get it over with' deal.

The thing is I hate it when people (especially those who know the circumstances which caused my delay) congratulate me. I honestly would have preferred to have died when I tried to kms. When people congratulate me it just reminds me of my failure to not get caught while trying to catch the bus, and it makes me want to try again even more.
