Thatâ€™s it, Iâ€™m done.I have only one reason left to live for, itâ€™s my friend. Iâ€™m not in love we her, not at all, I just want attention from her because she is the only one able to provide me mental help, but the more I think about I feel her unwillingness to be in my company, or even to talk to me.
I remember what a horrible person I am and how much I should die to help the world. This week I almost lost my keys and cost my parents maybe even 2,500-3,000 dollars. 
In addition to that Iâ€™m starting to feel these tingling in my hand and the urge to kill myself, to end it all, to stop this suffering. Although I have no friends and no more reasons to live for I didnâ€™t take my own life. 
Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m not going to do anything to myself soon, Because Iâ€™m such a fucking coward.
