At this point Iâ€™m only staying alive as an obligation to others.I know a lot of people would be sad if I died, which is better than a lot of people can say and I should be grateful for that. Itâ€™s just so mentally stressful having to continue living despite my own wishes only because I donâ€™t want anyone to be sad. Iâ€™ve considered making everyone I know hate me, or cutting them all off, just so that I can die quietly and no one will care that Iâ€™m gone.
