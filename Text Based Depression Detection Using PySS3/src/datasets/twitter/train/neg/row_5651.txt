It seems like the only option leftI guess the main reason I haven't offed myself yet is because I haven't yet found a painless and easily accessible way of doing it. At this point, I neither enjoy nor have an interest in life. I don't feel like working, studying, socializing, playing games, nothing. I come from a family with a history of depression and mental illness. My parents are no exception, which is why I've had to distance myself from them just to remain sane. 

I've always considered myself to be different from everyone, even as a kid. I would spend a lot of time in a fantasy world rather than reality.

I no longer see the point in studying or getting a degree. All I want to do is sit here all day and be as passive and useless as possible. Medicines make me functional, but they don't allow me to enjoy life or even remotely connect with anyone. There is no place for me in the world.
