Preparing for suicide.I turned 16 on Friday, and i put depression aside until after the party, when i got home, i was reminded of my friend, who killed herself almost two years ago and it hit me like a truck. That night i decided i was going to join her, none of my friends make an effort to talk to me, or even talk to me in general, I've got no one to talk to and no one cares anyway, I'm a waste of space, I'm either gonna bleed to death or swing, which ever comes first. People say time will heal wounds words can't, but thats clearly bullshit, it's been almost 4 years and nothing has gotten better, since everything started I've started cutting, started doing drugs and became addicted to nicotine i could quit smoking but why does it matter? I'm a dead man anyway
