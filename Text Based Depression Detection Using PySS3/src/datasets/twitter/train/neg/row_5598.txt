I'm running out of optionsI hate my life. I quit my PhD after 3 years of agony but since then haven't even come close to finding a new job. I even get rejected before a first interview. My girlfriend doesn't care about me and blames me for making her feel bad if I'm not 100% optimistic. I'm afraid to break it because of her reaction. I don't feel like doing any sports while I used to be so active before. I don't dare to drive any more because every time I want to just drive off a bridge/into a railing. I made a lot of wrong decisions in the last 5 year, and I can't get back from them. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is the feeling of how my mother would feel when I wouldn't be there any more. But I don't know how much longer it's going to hold me from doing so. Is there another way out, because I don't see it.
