I don't want to do thisI don't want to spend the rest of my life working and cooking and cleaning and having responsibilities and bills and eventually children that I never wanted. I've wasted my life and youth and now that I'm almost 20 I have nothing to look forward to but constant suffering. I'll have to spend my time getting internships and working and desperately using what little free time I actually have to try and keep up with constantly changing technology and trying to decide whether I want my 10 days max of vacation time to be spent with friends, family, or traveling and being exhausted all the time and never having any personality or interests or hobbies and I just don't want to do this. I just want to die. I haven't killed myself yet because I don't want to hurt my mother but once she's gone I'll probably do it because I have nothing to look forward to but suffering and the worst part is that it doesn't matter that I'm struggling and miserable, life will never change or improve.
