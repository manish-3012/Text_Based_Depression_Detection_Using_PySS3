I've been working through the entire pandemic and I just can't do it anymore...I've been slaving away for shit pay through this entire pandemic... and my anxiety is way too high to "get a better job" or "work more hours".  I start freaking out just thinking about it. That shit makes me want to kill myself even more. I've put on 50 lbs. I started using pills again. I have 200 dollars in my bank account that I have to somehow stretch until next friday... seriously what the fuck is the point of all this nonsense?
