My boyfriend wasn't suicidalI barely type from tears. Had fight with my boyfriend today about something. At some point he told me about accident that happened 3 weeks ago. I was worried about him since he talked about death at that time and called the police for welfare check. I thought he was going to kill himself. Today he said he was barely conscious and on medication and now everyone at his job avoids him. He told me he never attempted suicide they just dragged him in ward. This happened in USA Not sure if he overreacted or nah but I think he was completely honest. I am crying. He ended up blocking me. The only thing I will ask is my therapist to write him letter explaining everything we fought about today and then leave him be.

The fight was about fiancial situation and something else
