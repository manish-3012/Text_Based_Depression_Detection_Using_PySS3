I hate working, but I don't want to be homeless.I just don't want to work anymore, but being homeless doesn't seem much better. So suicide seems like the only option. I guess there is "stuff to live for" but even if I wanted to do any of that I'll never be able to afford it. I think I'm just too lazy for life.
