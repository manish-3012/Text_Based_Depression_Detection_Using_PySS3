It's my birthday and I want to die.I've suffered from depression since I was a freshman in highschool , just turned 23  . But it always seems to get worse around my birthday month , I everyone else is celebrating and I'm just reminded that  haven't accomplished anything with my life. Friends try to cheer me up by saying i make  them smile and my art makes others smile.Idon't believe them , or rather I can't see it their way.  My boyfriend Is loving and supportive and that just makes things feel worse. We both moved out to get away from toxic family members and he's determined to make it work. I've had difficulty  getting a job while he's working his butt off. I'm nothing but a burden to those around me. This stupid  day is just another reminder of that. I really wish I could kill myself. But I've already failed twice , I can't even get that right.
