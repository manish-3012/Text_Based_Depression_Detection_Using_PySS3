Iâ€™m not sure what to do.This is my first time opening up my feelings to anything that breathes, so I should mention that my life is pretty good. Iâ€™m in good physical health, my worst mental health conditions would be autism and anxiety. Iâ€™m pretty young and not even in high school yet, and Iâ€™m homeschooled. I have a loving family that isnâ€™t dealing with any hardships outside of what everyone else is this year. I donâ€™t have many real problems at all. My only problems ever started this year. Like everyone, I havenâ€™t been doing too well with 2020. Everything I liked that was even slightly productive was either canceled or made Zoom-centric, the latter of which I hate and find even worse than simply refraining from the activity entirely. However, I predicted earlier this year that Iâ€™d feel much worse when the holidays started. I was right. I felt more sad than usual on Halloween night just because of all the reminders of whatâ€™s going on. However, November has been even worse. Iâ€™ve felt gradually more hopeless since, and Iâ€™ve begun to despise myself more and more, unable to see anything good about myself. For the past few days, Iâ€™ve been considering suicide more and more, feeling particularly awful today. Today is Thanksgiving, and I wasnâ€™t able to see any of my other family members due to social distancing. I like nothing else about this holiday, but my family and the rest of the world has been preparing as usual, as well as talking about what would normally go on. Which has been triggering me all day. Like I said, I have anxiety and Iâ€™ve begun to strongly hate myself to the point where even I feel like Iâ€™m really just fishing for attention by making this post. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m scared to open up to my family. I feel like theyâ€™ll either say Iâ€™m just â€œbeing emoâ€ (I wear normal clothing and think existence has meaning, but Iâ€™m generally a pessimist) or (like me) think Iâ€™m just being a manipulative piece of shit who wants attention. I donâ€™t know what to do.
