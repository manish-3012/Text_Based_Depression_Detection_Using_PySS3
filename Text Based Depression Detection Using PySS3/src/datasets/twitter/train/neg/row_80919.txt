help, please.Im 11 and think about death every day. I have tried banging my head into walls and have seriously thought about stabbing myself with clothes hangers. Im an A-plus student, all in advanced classes that's been all over the world. Nobody knows what im truly like so I can only pretend to smile. My brothers don't support me when I need it the most and I have been asked to go die in a hole several times by them. I don't feel needed nor valued and know its not too much time until I get the courage to hang myself. Someone please help me.
