I am aloneI could have been friends with people but I didnâ€™t feel comfortable making a direct connection. So I keep things like distanciatrd in some way with everyone . The result is I see all these people who I know being close with one another, and if I had been less scared maybe I could have been close too. But instead I am alone without anyone to really talk to, just watching but never really getting to make contact . I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m like this. The last time I made friends with people and got close it ended so badly. I donâ€™t want that to happen. I donâ€™t know why it is that if I get close to people I will be hurt and humiliated and I will hurt them too. I need connection but itâ€™s not something thatâ€™s safe to pursue . 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll keep going too much longer. I give myself a year and then imma probably take a bunch of datura seeds or something if a lot of things donâ€™t work out just exactly the way I need them to. Which they wonâ€™t, obv, so yeah.
