I have no friends nowI used to be at a school where I was the clown that did the disgusting shit, did stupid stuff to make people laugh, and acted like a retard. 

Now that I moved I feel a lot more free. I donâ€™t have to where a mask anymore of this fake smile and laughter that used to plague my daily life. Now, I know people, but theyâ€™re not friends. No one has spoken to me since quarantine began except a select few chats with people I am most close to (still not close though), and of course random strangers online.

The usual advice for someone in my situation would be, â€œYou can focus on improving yourself! This is a great opportunity to get your life together!â€ No. I havenâ€™t done jack for the past 8 months. It only feeds my self-hatred and guilt, a problem I dealt with in my own a while back, so I ignore those feelings. 

One thing this has taught me is that for someone who really has no other problems except my mental health (I mean my financial situation, as Iâ€™m a hs student), the only person who can save you is yourself. Fuck therapy and fuck other people. Iâ€™ve been dealing with this shit on my own and I taught myself how to live with myself. 

No one knows Iâ€™m depressed of course, as there are not many people who know me. I do consider myself, however, to be not socially inept, as I am able to socialize with another person, in person. This whole thing has taught me that dealing with other peopleâ€™s shut is ducking bullshit. Be a selfish little bitch. Nothing else matters except you in your life. Put yourself before others and help yourself.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m sharing this. I just feel like getting it off my chest. Maybe this will help someone else here who, like me, severely lacks social relationships, but is otherwise well off. I hope the best of luck to people who, unlike me, carry the burdens of their own problems, not just mental health. I sincerely hope all of you find a solution.
