Definitely think it's time.I have been fighting this for so fucking long. 

I keep thinking I'm finding these pockets of happiness, but I am so fucking stupid.

Reached out for therapy help over the last few weeks and it is fruitless. Even therapists don't want to put up with my bullshit.

I genuinely can't do this anymore. I am so lost and so sad.
