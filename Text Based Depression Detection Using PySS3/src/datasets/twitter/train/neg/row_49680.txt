Fuck this!I want to kill myself pretty fucking often. I want to crawl into an isolated place and blow my brains out. I despise people and the world in general and my anxiety makes it to Where I canâ€™t enjoy jack shit anymore. There are times when I love life. When I hold my dog or catch a fish are times when I can bring joy to my own existence. Iâ€™m done letting the world dictate my happiness. Iâ€™m not killing my self. Iâ€™m not letting the world I hate get the best of me, Iâ€™m shoving it right back in itâ€™s stupid cunt face and enjoying shit again. If I can overcome anxiety, Iâ€™ll just fuckin do it anxious. Iâ€™m fishing, Iâ€™m hiking, Iâ€™m eating great food and Iâ€™m going out of my way to help people. Those are the things that make me not so horribly depressed and theyâ€™re things I can do. Life is just a sensory experience, a big dream weâ€™re all watching. Iâ€™m not letting mine be a shitshow. Itâ€™s gonna be a fellow who realizes he has power to turn it around. I want to be a rebel to a cause thatâ€™s internal. I say â€œFuck the worldâ€ but not by leaving, by changing the parts I choose to engage in and discarding the rest. If I donâ€™t like something Iâ€™m gonna change it or ignore it. Iâ€™m focusing on the good and if I end up blowing my brains out, itâ€™ll be because I let the world overtake me again. 

*watching bud Dwyer kill himself on tv proves no one cares even when u shoot urself.
