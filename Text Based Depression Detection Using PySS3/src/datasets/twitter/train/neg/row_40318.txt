I did the wrong thingI donâ€™t know where the right place to post this is so forgive me if it is not here.

I was walking my dog yesterday and on the walk there is a bridge over a road and a walkway under it. Someone was stood on top on the side of that bridge with their toes over the edge, crying, trying to call someone.

I looked over at her when I came the other side of the bridge and almost carried on walking. I ALMOST CARRIED ON WALKING. I phoned the police to come and when they arrived I left.  For 5 minutes I didnâ€™t talk to her, I stayed on the line with the police, I didnâ€™t help. 

I WAS GOING TO WATCH HER KILL HERSELF. 

In the end she was okay, she didnâ€™t do it, and I guess to me that is the outcome that matters, but I havenâ€™t been able to stop thinking about it, what should I have done, was there anything I could have said that would have helped. Thinking that I almost left her on her own now makes me feel sick. 

I guess what I am asking is, what should I have done here, I canâ€™t find any advice online, mostly because I am not exactly sure what to search for, â€˜How to stop someone killing themselvesâ€™ doesnâ€™t talk about what to do when they are up there. Was there anything else I could have done. I need to know that the actions I took were enough, what is expected but I know they werenâ€™t. I am exactly the kind of person I once thought that I was above. The person that freezes under pressure and makes the situation worse. 

This would have seriously fucked me up if she did it. More than it is now.
