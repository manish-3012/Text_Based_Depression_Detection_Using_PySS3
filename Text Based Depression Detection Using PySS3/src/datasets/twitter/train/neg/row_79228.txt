Everyone thinks my life is perfect.To so many people, my life looks perfect. They think I do well in  school, I landed an amazing summer job, and I lead a club that has reached new heights. I've been selected for an amazing opportunity out of all of the interns at my job, and I constantly have students in years below me tell me that they aspire to make their lives like mine. I seem so, so happy to those around me.  

But it's all hanging by a thread. I feel so empty. I can't take living like this anymore. Being happy feels so natural when i'm with other people, but it's draining and I want nothing more than for my life to end.
