I don't want wake up anymoreI hope I die from overwork
I hope I die on my bike, while trying to make it sanely home
I hope I go back to self harming cuz that felt good
I wish I could stop giving people my time, especially when they don't bother to be as kind
I want to grow cold and go back to that place when I'd plan my suicide attempt
There is no such thing as a friend. It's BS. I genuinely want to die.
I want to stop being optimistic.
I want to slice my wrists and bleed to death slowly.
It'll be like going to sleep and never waking up haha
