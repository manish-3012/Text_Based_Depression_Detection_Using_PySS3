What do I do? I am lost.Throwaway for reasons....
Let's try to start from the beginning I have had a terrible childhood but obviously not as bad as a lot of people I'm just too weak to handle it... full of beatings and verbal harassment from a state trooper stepfather in the good ole US of A. And I'm not gonna blame this on that... it's just context. Following that I moved from alcoholic bio father to a mother who is completely self centered but I guess you could say that about myself. I've inheretid the alcoholism from my father... this will play into the story further down. Throughout my teenage years and school years I acted out majorly, therapists, psychiatrists, 5150s from self harm.... anyways we are now at 25 years old I've not had a good couple years, 3 spinal surgeries and an addiction to opiates.. I'm clean now even though its recent and fucking with my head. I also held a very nice job for 3 years and met the love of my life alas I had to leave the job after the first surgery to be reoperated on twice. Now here I am recovering and I've fucked my relationship up with the love of my life who refuses to speak to me. I've self harmed again... stabbed myself in the leg with a scalpel, cut into my arms just to feel something.... last night I drank a bottle of vodka and went joy riding about 90 mph barely keeping it on the road half hoping I would smash into a tree... what the ever loving fuck do I do. I just want to be happy again without the label of being a fucking lunatic. I just need someone to convince me it's going to be ok.... sorry for bothering all of you... I'm just at the end of my rope.
