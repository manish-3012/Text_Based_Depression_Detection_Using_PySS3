I'll draw for you, too.  (taking requests)I saw someone else did this and got an abundance of responses.  Figured I'd do this to help lighten their load.  I'm going out for two hours, but post your requests.  I will get to as many as possible when I return.  I will continue throughout the week if I keep receiving requests.  Just a good way for us both to keep our mind off bad stuff.

Stick around, won't ya?  Someone cares, &amp; we're listening.. &lt;3
