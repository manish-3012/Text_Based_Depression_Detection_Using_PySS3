ExhaustedI have diagnoses for PTSD, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder, I don't function, and I'll never be able to trust what I feel.

I'm a survivor of CSA and physical abuse. I experience mood shifts that last for weeks, and seem to have a mind of their own. I'm constantly losing time to flash backs, and dissociation. I can't sleep because of racing thoughts and night terrors. And it feels like the ground is constantly shifting beneath my feet.

Meds only make me feel sluggish, and therapy doesn't work. I can't sleep, I can't focus, and I keep losing time. I'm visibly trans, I've lost most of my family, and every day people treat me like subhuman garbage. I feel like I'll never truly have any control over my body, or my circumstances.

I'm exhausted and trapped and there's no reason to believe that my quality of life will ever improve.

I want rest more than anything, and tonight I want to die
