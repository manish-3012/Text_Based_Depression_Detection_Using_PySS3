Whats the point of this life.I feel like I am trapped in a limbo and I have no one to talk to. Having a shitty job with toxic work environment, nerve eating bosses and the most fucked up part I have no savings at all to finish my graduation. Every time I think of quitting my job I get this pressure from my brother to find another job before resigning. Without graduation no one will give me better job. All my friends have moved forward and away from me. Cant go back home country cuz of work. I feel I am wasting my life here.
My gf cheated on me several times yet I kept quiet cuz atleast she was listening and supporting. She left me too. I have absolutely no one to talk to. 

Every morning I wake up like robot. Go to work come back and sleep it's like life has left me with no meaning, been two years now I am living with this fake smile

I AM ALIVE BUT DEAD
Praying the lord to end it soon
