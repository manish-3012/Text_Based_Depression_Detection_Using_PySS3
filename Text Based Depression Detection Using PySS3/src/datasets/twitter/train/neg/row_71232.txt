soon, i hopeI don't know what's wrong anymore. I just want to stop existing. I really wish I could fall asleep and never wakeup. I'm tired. 

My life has been awful. And I ruin any chance of happiness because I feel undeservingâ€”of happiness, of love. I don't bring anything good to anyone's lives or the world.
