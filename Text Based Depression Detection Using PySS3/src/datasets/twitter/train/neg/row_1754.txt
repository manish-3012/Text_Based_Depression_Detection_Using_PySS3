I really want to dieI'm being threatened with court action over a house I can't pay for, I'm only 20 and my friends knew all along and never told me and I'm at risk of losing them over this. Everything is going wrong, my life is at a complete standstill, I don't get loans anymore which means I can't pay for this damn house.

I don;'t know what to do but I don't want to be here anymore, as well as everything else that's going on I'm just at my end point and I just need a way out
