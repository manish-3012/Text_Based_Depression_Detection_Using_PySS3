i don't want to stay anymore guys.there's nothing to my life anymore. i don't feel lucky or want anything, or want to be in contact with anyone anymore. my face and head hurt these days. i can't talk to anyone i know and whoever i have tried to talk to even my close friends or whatever ahven't come back. 

i feel so weak these days. my life is now on autopilot and the way  i never wanted it to be. there are billions of people unluckier than i am but i dont' deserve what i have in more ways than one. social anxiety isn't much of a problem but my brain feels scrunched up now like i'm getting a gun pointed at my head when tomorrow arrives. people have given up on me and even my parents. there is no incentive to talk to me anymore and nobody does it, and not many really want to reply either. i have made myself distant from everyone else by trying to be the funnyman in the room. how fucking bitter i've turned. that's all that's left, now that the humor's dried up. nobody's laughing and especially not me. this is so goddamn tiring and it hurts a lot. i'm old already.

and it's not that i've become something extraordinary in all this isolation. i have rotted. i am completely worthless and in no way redeemable. people who were invested in me and had faith in me walked away. i cannot even help anyone i am incapable of doing this. i'm barely 25 and i've been away from everyone long enough to silently do the deed. no one's missing anything, for twelve years i've been jerking off and going to bed and insulting others for laughs. who gives a shit. this is not close to a news story to anyone within a mile of me. and the oh-god will turn into a shrug. and i'll have rid myself of all this. like i'm stuck in some godforsaken contraption and i cannot move. the frown takes more muscles but comes more naturally to me. i need a bit more sleep this time.
