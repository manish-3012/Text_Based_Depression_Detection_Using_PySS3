I feel hopeless and stupidI'm really struggling. I have a tab on my laptop open for the nearest hospital for me to get in and get back on medication, but my anxiety is so high that I'm afraid to do it.

I feel like I made a mistake moving in with my boyfriend, I feel like everything I do is a mistake or annoys him. I don't know how I feel about our relationship anymore.


 I got an OWI and have to pay for that ticket; plus I have to pay $290 for a drug and alcohol assessment. In addition I have to pay rent, water, internet. The only upside is that I'm taking the semester off to work some of this off and try and save some money, but I'm having severe anxiety about making rent/water/internet while also paying for the ticket and the assessment.

I feel lonely, and ugly, and I feel like it would be easier if I just went away forever. I'm so unhappy with myself. This morning I ripped apart a painting I started with a knife. I was so excited to start it, but now I Feel like i don't deserve to be happy. I hate myself, and the worst part is that I feel too frozen to seek out help. I'm too afraid to move out of this apartment, we haven't even been in it a month yet, and of what it means for my relationship. I feel like human garbage.
