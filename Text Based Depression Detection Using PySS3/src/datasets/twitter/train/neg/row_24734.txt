As I sitAs I sit my stomach turns, my life crumbles around me as the people continue on their day. The gun up against my head my life flashes before my eyes just like what I imagined. I've done it all, I've given everything I have, but you get to a point where you can't give anymore. 

You will find this one day Mom and you will know who I am. I am the person who you thought was so smart but ended up so dumb. How is it that everyone else around me is succeeding and I'm struggling to put food in my stomach? How is it that I can have all this brain power and not get past something as simple as eating? You'd think I would have figured out a way to just make it appear. You think I could stop being such a failure. You were wrong. I can't eat, I can't stay where I am. I've tried. 

How can everyone love me but nobody actually loves me? How is it that my father can up and leave for dead but a child that isn't even his can be such a prized possession. How can my Brother judge me for things I do, yet, when I'm desperate for just a meal he turns me away. I'm starving Mom, I can't do it anymore.

All I needed was a friend, all I needed was a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm not an infinite source of love and when everyone takes and takes and takes and you get nothing in return you break down, you lose hope. I've lost hope Mom. For months my days have shortened, I've lost my will to live and it's world breaking, you think you understand but you don't. My heart says no, don't do it, it'll get better, but I know this path that I'm heading down and there isn't anything left for me, I'm dry and I can't refill this time. 

I was hopeful for so long, I hope you know that. I was that ball of energy you knew and loved, but it's not enough,  everyone needs more and more, they take and they take and they take but they never give back, I just needed someone to give back a little. 

Du hast mich Mama, ich liebe dich.
