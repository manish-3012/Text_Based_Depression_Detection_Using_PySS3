I have no idea whether I'm an attention-seeker who is lying to himself, a pussy, a suicidal person or not any of these.On Friday I came back from school, I was feeling very very depressed since like 2 o'clock. I got home, got changed and grabbed a knife in the kitchen telling myself that I'd kill myself on that day. I already decided that I'd slice one of my veins or arteries such as my femoral artery. I was shaking and I was sending messages to all of my friends telling them to keep enjoying life and to do well and so on. Before I used to fantasize about killing myself in a glorious way with people worrying about me and someone who I considered important to me trying to save but I had no idea what to send them and the person most important to me didn't even say anything. Anyway I got around sending the last message while holding the knife in my other hand and then I hear the front door and my parents coming back from work. I didn't end up doing it.


I have no idea whether I'd do it or I was just lying to myself and acting around to convince myself that I'm not just attention seeking. I have no idea what to believe in anymore. I was shaking and thinking that I couldn't kill myself when I was holding the knife.
