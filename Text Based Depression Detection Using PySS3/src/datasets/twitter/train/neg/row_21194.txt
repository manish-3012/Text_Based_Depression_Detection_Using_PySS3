Clocking out tonightAt the end of my rope, again. Couldn't hold a job before all this started, everything looks especially bleak now. I have no money, my car is taking a shit, and nothing seems to be turning around. I'm trading the last of my possessions tonight for some dark and jamming that needle into my arm hoping I don't wake up.
