I've lost interest in everything, even life.I just can't take it anymore. I'm tired of acting like there is nothing going on, tired to smile, tired to breathe. I had a very sad childhood, I always got rejected, that made an insecure person. Now that I'm older, I don't trust anybody and don't make any friend. Since I lost the women I love my heart is broken, my world is more upside down. She was the only thing keeping my inner flame alive and she didn't know about it. I never told her that because I was so afraid of losing her. Now she is gone and I just want to end this. I already got a big scar on my neck because of a failure. I just don't want to hurt my mom. Every second I am wishing to die... I don't even know I am telling you this story of mine...
