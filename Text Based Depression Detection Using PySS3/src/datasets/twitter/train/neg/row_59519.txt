Can't seem to place my dog for adoption.It's the last thing keepng me alive.  I want to know that he has a loving and good home to live in after I do what I want to do.  But no one wants him and I don't want to send him to the animal shelter where he'll be euthanized.  He is the only thing keeping me hanging on and I want to know that he's in a good home before I do what I do.  I'm old, fat, ugly, single, and forgettable so I may as well just do what everyone's waiting for me to do anyway.
