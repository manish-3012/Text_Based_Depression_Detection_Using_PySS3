My Heart Is Broken, Sheâ€™s Done With â€˜eShe broke my heart, left me because my mental issues were too much for her and she said so many hurtful things to me about how Iâ€™ve hurt her and how sheâ€™s been nothing but a therapist to me and not an actual gf and how sheâ€™s much happier without me, it hurts really bad and Iâ€™ve never had my heart broken before but on top of everything Iâ€™m going through, I think Iâ€™m done guys, my dad is dead, my sis might not walk, and I just got left.... Iâ€™ve been contemplating suicide for a while and I think this is finally it.
