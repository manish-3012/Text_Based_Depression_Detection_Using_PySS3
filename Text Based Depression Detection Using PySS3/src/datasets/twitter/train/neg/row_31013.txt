I've decided I'm going to kill myself. I just want to thank you guys for the support I've gotten.I just really can't handle life anymore. Nothing is going to fix me. I hate myself, that's never going to change, talking to a therapist isn't going to help because all they will do is give me exercises that I won't want to do because I'm too lazy and I will still have to suffer in agony for weeks or months to get any results. It's just not worth it anymore. Every day I wake up alone is just another day of reminding me that my life is a failure and I should never have been born. No one is ever going to tell me they love me or be happy that I loved them. I'm a loser and a waste of genetics and the planet's food resources. Life isn't worth living. And I give up. I'm going to end it in the least painful way I can find, whatever that may be.

I do want to thank you guys for support and advice the last while. I'm sorry I was a lost cause.
