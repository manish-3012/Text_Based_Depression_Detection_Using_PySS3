I donâ€™t want to die I just donâ€™t want to be here anymoreIâ€™ve been thinking about disappearing for a while. I live in an apartment with my best friend who then became my boyfriend. I love him and I thought he loved me but... I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I got divorced last year from a very manipulative and emotionally abusive man and before that was routinely sexually abused by my ex boyfriend. Every time my current boyfriend gives the slightest amount of coldness of any sort to me, I just assume heâ€™s going to start abusing me somehow, or at the very least leave me. And I canâ€™t get out. He supports me financially and takes care of me and heâ€™s never done anything abusive heâ€™s just occasionally cold to me which I understand people arenâ€™t perfect and maybe I should be forgiving but my trauma is too much. I just want to disappear for a bit. Get some space. See if he really cares about me enough to do anything about it. Heâ€™s all I have right now. I moved across the country after my divorce and I have no one else near me. So I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m supposed to do but I canâ€™t stop crying.
