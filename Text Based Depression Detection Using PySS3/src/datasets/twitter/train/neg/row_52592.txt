Working with COVID makes me want to dieIâ€™ve worked so hard during the past few months with clients tested positive with Covid. I made 70+ hours a week for 3 months straight. Because so many colleagues were sick. I lived a lonely life all those months, no physical contact with anyone but my clients and the few colleagues working. 
Now that everything is going back to normal. I canâ€™t function anymore. I feel alone, left out, stressed, I canâ€™t sleep. All that I have seen keeps replaying In my head. 
The words said by my manager, that it was all our fault, and my friends, that I am a pussy for not partying with them. 
I just want to die. I feel like I canâ€™t live anymore after what Iâ€™ve seen and gone through. Nobody understands, cares or listens.. I canâ€™t go through this again, but the numbers are rising and nobody gives a shit... I keep having these panick attacks. I donâ€™t know where to seek help.. I need it but to be honest I donâ€™t if I want it. Dead sounds so peaceful now.
