Can't take the anxiety anymoreI really hate myself, but some of it has to do with my weight. I really wish i had grown up in a different family who enforced healthy foods but with my family it wasn't the case. I used to eat like shit when I was younger and my parents didn't care, and it affected me greatly. I've changed my habits for roughly five years, but I get horrible cravings all the time which i think are due to the antidepressant I'm on. I avoid junk food and fast food like the plague, yet I'm still terrified of getting diabetes. I still get sugar cravings which I substitute with fruits but I eat way too much fruit all the time. I am also not very thin. I'm not fat, but I used to be a lot thinner but felt like shit and became more obsessed with eating less, and still felt like i was fat. Now I've gained weight...I'm not fat but I still am terrified of getting diabetes/fat. I live with this fear daily and nightly and can't take it anymore. I feel like I eat WAY TOO MUCH. I wish I never knew the taste of unhealthy, sugary crap. I wish I grew up skinny and eating healthy foods all the time. Makes me suicidal because I wanna be reborn as someone else. I wish I was skinnier. I knopw I have to eat less to get there but it is so hard.
