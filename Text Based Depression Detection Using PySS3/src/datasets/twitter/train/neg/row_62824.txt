Too afraid to dieI wish I could die or actually, go to sleep and never wake up. Life is meaningless. Everything we do, feel, and see is nothing. When we die, that's it. The void. In a few years, no one will remember me, mourn me, miss me. We are all nothing. And what we do means nothing. Does anyone else get that?? Our life is a blip in an ocean of time. Look at your family, the people you work with, EVERYONE!!! They and you are all infinitesimal, meaningless, bags of flesh. We are not bright snowflakes and all the work you put into your life is nothing. It doesn't change anything. There is no magic. No love. Why are we here??? NO REASON!!!!! If I could just sleep. my dreams are a much better life than this. I don't know I'm meaningless when I'm dreaming. I can be anything.I have tried all my life to find a reason to live and I'm really just trapped by emotions that mean nothing. I'm so tired of life. It's exhausting. Eat, sleep, shit, feel pain and do it all again and again.
