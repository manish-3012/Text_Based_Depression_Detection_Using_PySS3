I don't know what to doI live in Toronto.

I have a beautiful wife, 8 months pregnant. It was a miracle. We tried for years without success. I have loving family and friends.

All I can think about is driving with my eyes closed into traffic. I research ways to make suicide look like an accident/natural causes all the time. 

My problems are financial, mental health, fear. I can't do this much longer.
