Hope doesn't exist.Hope is bullshit, people are bullshit. Everyone online I meet are the absolutely worse fucking people (not even humans) I've come across all the time. The internet sucks. I've also seen that things are always hidden from us. Most guys grow up just dying alone. Adults are horrible, I think I'm gonna kill myself before 18 hits.
