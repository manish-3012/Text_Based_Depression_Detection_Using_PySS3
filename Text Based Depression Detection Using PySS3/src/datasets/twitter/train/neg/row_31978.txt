Depressive moods had pushed away loved ones and I'm afraid of what I'll do nowhey I'm a 21m and to begin I wasn't constantly suffering from these depressed moods, before they came every couple months and disappeared after a week or so. However, I've had this current down period for 3months now and it's only getting worse.

I have my family who I love but I can feel myself pushing them away more and more. I did have my girlfriend of 4 years who I love more anyone or anything, but I've pushed her away and broke up with her for reasons I don't know. I've pushed myself to the point where I have no one but myself .

Right now I'm sitting looking at a bottle of bleach and wondering if the pain of drinking the bleach is worth the release of death. I'm truly terrified that this might be it for me. I don't even know why I've posted here but I'm so desperate and need anything.

TL;Dr: 
21 m in long depressive mood. Pushed away family and friends and girlfriend. Contemplating whether I should just commit suicide now.
