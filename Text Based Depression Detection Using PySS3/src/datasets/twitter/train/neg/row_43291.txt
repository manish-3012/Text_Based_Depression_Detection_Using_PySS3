No motivation left. Except for ending it.I made it through my first semester of college and Iâ€™m not sure what to think about the results. I failed two classes and Iâ€™ll have to retake them again at some point. Which means Iâ€™ll have to be more in debt and feel more of a failure to my family. 

My parents say they donâ€™t care, but it feels empty when they say it. Theyâ€™ve been suggesting multiple different things to do other than what I thought was right. 

At the moment I donâ€™t know what I want and I donâ€™t know why. My been told to find something I like and use that as motivation to work harder. But nothing is doing it.  Do it for money, do it for my gf, do it for my fam. None of it. I donâ€™t have the motivation to to do it.

I feel empty and a failure to everyone. Iâ€™m still acting happy around everyone, but when I have these thoughts it all goes I just lose it. 

I still cry some nights. I just want everything to stop. I donâ€™t care if I just died right now and I donâ€™t care how. I donâ€™t know and I donâ€™t care.
