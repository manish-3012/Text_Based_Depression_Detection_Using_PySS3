I want to talk to people, but nobody wants to give me what I needI want to talk to my family and friends about my decision to end my life. I want to have one last conversation and outright tell them goodbye, not just leaving them in the dark when they find my body. I want to tell them what Iâ€™m about to do and why Iâ€™m about to do it. I want somebody, just one person to tell me they understand why Iâ€™m doing this and that they respect my decision. But eeryone thinks that my life can be salvaged. I know itâ€™s too late. I donâ€™t want to be taunted with threats to call 911 or have me locked up again. I just want to go away peacefully. For once I want someone to understand me.
