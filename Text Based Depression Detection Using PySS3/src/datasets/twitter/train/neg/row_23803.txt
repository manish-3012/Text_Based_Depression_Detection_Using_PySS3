I'm done fighting.I have fought for so long, and I can't fight anymore. I just don't have it in me. I have experienced dizzying highs, and deep terrible lows. But the lows keep getting lower, and lasting longer. And I just cant anymore. 
I'm so tired, and I've lost everything. 
I have everything I need. I've even written the note. But I'm scared. I am so cold and alone. I never pictured dying, scared, cold and alone. But I can't see any other way anymore. And I just don't know what to do.
