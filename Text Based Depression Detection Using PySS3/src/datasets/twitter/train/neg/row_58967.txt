Daily depressionI'm pretty much suicidal everyday. It annoys me my father sees my depression as extreme laziness and self centeredness. I've been diagnosed with bipolar depression three times by three different doctors yet my father insists I don't know what I'm talking about.
I would honestly kill myself but I fear the Oblivion of death, hellfire and I know how it would hurt my family.
I see myself as a flaw in my family.
My depression comes out in ruminating, obsessive thoughts, violent homicidal thoughts, an urge to destroy something, moodiness, anger, withdrawing from my family.

I don't know if I should tell my family. My father wants me to share things with him but he'll shut it down quickly and tell me it is merely laziness.

I have no respect for my father. I will admit I'm emotionally abusive towards my father.
