its 4 am im on top of my dorms balcony and i really want to jump off.its mostly in the title, but i'm highly suicidal.  i don't really know why i'm posting here, but i am so here we go: 

my life is actually fine, i had decent parents, i did well in school, and i have a few close friends.  now i'm in college i'm still doing fine in school, i have a good group of newer friends, and i still keep in touch with my two best friends from high school.  

but i just can't take this anymore.  i don't like feeling depressed almost all the time, and when im not depressed, i have a lot of anxiety.  hell, i've had three panic/anxiety attacks this week.  i just don't feel like i deserve any of this.  i'm a piece of shit and i suck at functioning as a human being.  i already wrote letters, and now i guess its just a game of will i end up actually doing it, or be a failure again and back down at the last minute.

i already know they'll all miss me, this isn't my first attempt, but i just can't ever hear it.  i dont know what else to do.  so i guess i just have to give up.
