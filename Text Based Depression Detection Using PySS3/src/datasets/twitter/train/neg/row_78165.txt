Fuck you David part 2Guess what?  I got out of bed and got a shower.  The sun is shining and im going to see my sons.  Yes, I still hurt, and yes I still love you .  But im broken.  But you can't get the best of me.  You actually told me once that I should just kill my self.  Why do you hate me so much when all I did was love you.  I treated you fair.  You layed up in my apartment like a bum and when I kindly asked you to contribute your fair share you attacked me with words.  Then the last time you used your hands.  But you didn't punch me.  You only shoved me.  I was the one who fell, it was my fault that the dresser was there and i hit it.  And by gosh, I deserved it.  Lies!!!  Why are you transferring your hate for yourself to me?  Is it because you think im going to tell everyone how you really are ?  They know.  You hide behind jokes .  Fuck you, I have to dry my hair.
