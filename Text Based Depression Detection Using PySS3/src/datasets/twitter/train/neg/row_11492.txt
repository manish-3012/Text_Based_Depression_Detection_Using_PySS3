Need someone to talk toSo I've struggled with suicide for about five or 6 years. There are a few reasons, a big one being the fact that I'm transgender and have been out for about a year, but I feel like people don't really see me for who I am or who I want to be. Dysphoria will take up every corner of my mind sometimes. I'll never pass and I'll never be happy, so why do I bother staying alive? I have a few other things to talk about but it feels weird talking about them so openly. Message me if you want or whatever
