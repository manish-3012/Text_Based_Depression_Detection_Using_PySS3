Best way to prepare friends of new?I think my death is inevitable and Iâ€™d hate for my friends to find out so suddenly about the news. I have 3 friends that have been helping me a lot with with trying to feel better but I think my time to go is now. What would the best way be to let them know of my decision so that it hurts them less and that they know itâ€™s not their fault and that I appreciate them for trying to help?
