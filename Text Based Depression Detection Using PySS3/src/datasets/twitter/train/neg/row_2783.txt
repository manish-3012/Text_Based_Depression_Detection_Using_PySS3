I tried so hard.Whelp I'm 34 I've done almost nothing with my life, i had to beautiful children from EX, haven't seen them in about 5 years. I did terribly in school so I've jest been working low tier warehouse gigs. i did quit my last job to pursue school but i get the feeling its too little too late. then to top it all off me and my wife are done. she says she's not happy and has been faking it for the last year or so. I loved this woman more than you could imagine i finally found the one that gets me. I wanted to have a life with her, children growing old together. all the cliche shit. So I think I might kill myself this weekend, she's gone staying at her sisters so she won't be here for a few days. But i feel like I'm scrambling to find one thing worth living for, and I"m out of ideas, maybe this is some subconscious last ditch effort to find something to keep me here. Maybe I'm just ranting and the weed is messing with me. maybe someone can think of something that i over looked, the weird thing is that i kind of feel ok with the thought of not existing, like scary calm. just throwing my thoughts into the ether i guess, i don't know what I'm looking for anymore.
