I just want it to be overI am so tired with everything. Going through the same shit. Making half baked plans to look up 'socialising' and how I can fix my shitty situation at the weekends...before zoning out and distracting myself with films, youtube videos...anything that will stop me from thinking. I am so tired of being a 29 old virgin. A guy with literally no friends, social contact or interests...a husk, who feels shit. Worst of all I am tired of getting my hopes up that I can change and that things are improving...that things have finally turned a corner...only to fall back to this shit. Like some sick fucking groundhog day. Each time a little part of me dies...my hope diminishes. How long has this gone on for now? Years. I am fucked. Broken. There is something wrong with my brain. Jesus I am so fucking pathetic. I didn't want to hurt my family...but I don't want to do this anymore. The only thing that I look forward to now is when I don't have to deal with any of this. I can't do the depression, the anxiety, not feeling anything. I want it over.
