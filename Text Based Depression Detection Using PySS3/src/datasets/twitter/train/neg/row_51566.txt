A lot of suicidal thoughts todayIm not actually diagnosed with depression cause I dont trust psycologists I do think I need help, I have epilepsy and my doctor told me I should seek therapy if this keeps on going, I just feel broken , like Ive being broken on the inside for a while and Im starting to forget how it feels like to be whole to have all your parts, a friend send me a lot of Keanu Reeves memes so I promised I would write something to entertain myself and wait, Im just scared becaused all day I've being daydreaming of dying naturally on my sleep to start reading about ways to die withouth pain or with th less pain possible and oh mama it is difficult to die when you want to Im scared of the pain and scared of ending not-dead and withouth chances of trying again and I just feel like this is just prolonging just buying time and that one day the pain will be greater than the fear
