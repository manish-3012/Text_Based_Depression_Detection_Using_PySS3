It constantly feels like I'm being set up to fail. No matter what I doI dont honestly know how much longer I can cope with being constantly reminded of much of a failure I am.

I'm shit at my job.
I'm shit with money.
I'm shit with taking care of my friends.
I'm shit with looking after myself.

I cant fucking bare the constant reminders anymore. 

I dont want to make it home tonight. I want to work out of work and onto the highway. Or go lay down on some trains.

I'm so ready to be done with this shit.
