13 Years and don't know what to do...I don't know how to start this so I will just get to the point, I play 2 sports (Hockey and Lacrosse) with a school where everyone loves me! I was even voted most humorous in the school but that is just a place where I keep my actual emotions bottled up... I deal with lots of stress at home and at the sports I play, I have a brother who doesn't care of anything I do and argues all the time with my dad who is never home EVER! He is either out drinking or yelling at his computer because his work is causing HIM stress! My mom is the only person I can go to for support but sometimes she just makes things worse... I thought maybe a dog would help but a couple weeks later he but my face and we had to get rid of him. My parents were divorced last year and I have seen any help I can get and now im deciding, what will happen when I'm 15, when I get my license... Where will I go without anybody ever knowing I was gone. Sports don't make it any better when all you do is get bullied and criticized for ANY MISTAKE YOU DO! I had people tell me "Shutup, Don't talk to me, Nobody likes you and you should kill yourself!" Should I do what they say and just end it...
