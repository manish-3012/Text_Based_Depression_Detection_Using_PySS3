maybe if i get myself into deep enough shit iâ€™ll finally have the balls to kill myselfiâ€™ve been struggling. i called in sick to work this morning, lied of course, and said i had a fever. they told me iâ€™m required to get a doctorâ€™s note in order to come back to work since yknow, pandemic, and obviously how can i do that when i lied in the first place lmao? i dunno. iâ€™m just very depressed but iâ€™m too scared to kill myself. maybe if i fuck up my life enough iâ€™ll have nowhere else to run. i donâ€™t know why iâ€™m even holding on.
