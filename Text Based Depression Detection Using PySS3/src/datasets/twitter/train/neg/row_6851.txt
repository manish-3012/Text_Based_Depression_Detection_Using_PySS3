feeling suicidal everyday - I donâ€™t see myself living past January -Everyday I wake up anxious and have to distract myself via my phone. I just feel constantly trapped and I just hate myself. I donâ€™t want to leave my friends and family behind (I know theyâ€™d be devastated) but I donâ€™t value myself really at all, and I donâ€™t see a future for myself really.
