Im a lost cause.Have been posting here for quite a while, in hopes of me finally being able to have some sort of enlightenment or a will to live. However, I could never escape the constant fear and feeling always on the edge, haunted by flashbacks of past memories (sometimes, I could even feel what I felt back then. the intensity was still so predominant).
What's the use? I dont even want to help myself anymore, why not stop wasting other's time and my time and call it quits?
Perhaps I might miss out on the beauty of life hiding from me in a corner, but i seek a different paradise, one that calls out my name in many many dreams, luring me to god knows where. At least its way peaceful there, compared to here where the world is black and white, darkness clouds over even the purest of souls, corrupting them to the core.
Hope is slipping away day by day, time is always in a haste, red lights flickering dimmer dimmer counting down judgement day. Detonate.
