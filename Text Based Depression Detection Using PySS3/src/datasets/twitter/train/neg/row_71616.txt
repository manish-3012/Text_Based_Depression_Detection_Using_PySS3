none of my friends would help me last night, heart broken todaySo basically I was chilling with 2 of my best friends on Xbox (its rare that we talk since they are busy all the time). We where chatting and all I'm a huge pot head so I was baked since I felt suicidal earlier (I love weed since it helps with my ADHD, depression and suicidal thoughts, haven't cut for 5 months because of it)  So I was enjoying my time and was venting to them about problems, i
I told them about this girl (lets call here Sara), so I told them that Sara has been pissing me off for a while now because she never texts back anymore and leaves me on read, I have a huge crush on her and she and me used to be best friends until now
So my 2 friends said "she's told me she's not into you anymore" only person Who knew about me liking her was my 2 friends s they told her. After that they started talking  shit about me jokingly and I was not in the mood for it, I felt like crying so I left the party and got high, about 15 minutes later they convinced me to join back, so I did they asked if I'm alright and I said I'm baked so ya, and she went off on me talking shit that I always talk about weed, I said back that what is there to talk about all I do is get baked and smoke cigarettes, she got more pissed, so I said fine wanna talk about cigarette? Alcohol? And she kicked me from the party and i blocked her. After that I was angry and was tearing up since I was emotional that night and I help like depressed so I decided to message one of my friends who i really liked, messaged her saying I need someone to talk to that I'm depressed and all, she left me on read, I messaged another 7 people all of them left me on read and didn't want to talk. The next morning ( right now) I feel like shit and heart broken that none of my friend wanted to talk to me even when I was considering suicide. Fake friends, but that's high school.
