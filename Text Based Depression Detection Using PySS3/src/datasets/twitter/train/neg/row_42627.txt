Worked so hard for nothingAll I wanted was money for rent. 

All I wanted was to do my dream Job that Iâ€™ve been dreaming of since I was 13. 

I finally got the job and worked it for four months. Each shift whizzed by. I never experienced that before. I was getting paid to do what I love. 

But then they told me to resign. Now Iâ€™m broke. If I try to go in the same field they will probably trash my app. I probably will never work in that field again. 

I never got a degree. I was one semester off but that degree is so hard. I failed over and over and over at the same class. 

There are no jobs for me. I canâ€™t support my family. I am a loser in peoples opinion now. 

I am mad. I am sad. I am defeated. I donâ€™t want to exist anymore.
