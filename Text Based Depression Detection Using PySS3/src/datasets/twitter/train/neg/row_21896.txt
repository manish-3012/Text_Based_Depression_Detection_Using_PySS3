Last Night I wound up at the ER. This is the disgusting treatment I endured.Early hours of Saturday morning I was so depressed I wanted to actually die I am someone who bottles up all my feelings, I don't open up - not to strangers at the very least, and never, ever over the phone or in person - but I couldn't take any more. I knew that if I didn't get help that night I would actually attempt suicide.

I called a charity line in my country. They literally hung up on me (I heard them put the phone down).

So I called a proper health service crisis line.

So the crisis line lady called an ambulance on my behalf. Two female paramedics came to my house, were very friendly and gentle with me. They drove me to hospital, and left as is their job. I cannot thank them enough for their understanding and kind nature.

Once I was there? I was left for SIX HOURS alone in a room until a Psyche Nurse came to see me. She did nothing. She let me talk about what was wrong, handed me a leaflet and said "book an appointment with your General Practitioner", and off I went. 

I am in that "numb" phase at the moment. I hit bottom so hard I kind of bounced back a bit and I am generally okay right now. But how long for? I've reached out for help exactly FOUR times.

First doctor laughed at me.

Second doctor sent me away.

Third doctor said "I don't have time to listen to this" and shoved unsuitable meds under my nose.

Fourth time I just told you about.

I won't seek help again. Next time I'll just do it. 

Four times I have no official diagnosis. I don't know EXACTLY what is wrong with me. I can only guess.
