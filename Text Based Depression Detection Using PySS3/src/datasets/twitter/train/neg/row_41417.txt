Not suicidal, very indifferent and depressed.To start off I'm a 25 year old female. I am of good health and mostly sound mind, or so I thought. All of my life I have always felt extremely indifferent or... Neutral about pretty much everything. Unless it really strikes a nerve and means something to me, typically I just don't care. I don't understand why I am this way. 5 months ago my soul mate committed suicide. I have had a horrible time dealing with the loss of him. It's to the point where I'm still crying everyday. I don't ever stop thinking about him. It's almost become an obsession. I sleep in his clothes, I have things he's bought me and things of his around me at all times. At work I even have a picture collage of us. I bought the laundry detergent his mother used on his clothes to use for my own so that my clothes would smell like him. At this point in my life, this event has been the only thing that has really rocked me to my core and made me ponder on life itself and why I am here when all I want to do is be with him. Is this normal? I mean who's to say what normal is anyway but, this just feels.... Bad. 

I am depressed but yet I feel indifferent. Do these two coincide? I don't actively plan on killing myself but, I don't want to be here. Help?
