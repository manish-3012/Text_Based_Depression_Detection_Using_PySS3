Need to end the lie that became my lifeI'm 19 and I've been pretending to be in school for the past 2 years. I've wasted $14k+ of my parents money doing absolutely nothing for 2 years. Buying junk food and locking myself in my room and listening to music/reading comics. And the semester will be over soon. And I'll have to head home with my forged transcript of A- grades (and a few Bs to make it realistic). The thought of my family finding out gives me panic attacks and I can't breathe and eventually collapse. I can't continue this cycle any longer. Don't tell me to talk with my parents, there is literally nothing i wouldn't rather do. Compared to that, killing myself is a piece of cake. I don't care that they'd rather hear it from me, let them find it out along with my dead body. I ruined my life and I'm too much of a coward to face the mess I made.
