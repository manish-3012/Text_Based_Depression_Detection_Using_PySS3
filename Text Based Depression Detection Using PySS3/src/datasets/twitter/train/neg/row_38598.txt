Now what?Three days straight, just lying in bed and having these thoughts don't really help. When your whole family disowns you, you just can't stop thinking "Basically, they don't give a shit anymore. So now what? It would probably be easier for all of us if I'm gone."

They cut me off when I needed them the most. Thinking that it would teach me a lesson about being an adult. But would it? I can't see the lesson. They took a step without trying to understand what's going on with me and honestly, the thought of leaving is a lot easier when you know they don't give a flying fuck anymore.

All thought of solution only leads to one thing. I'm afraid of what might happen. I've thought about this a lot for the past few years but my family's the reason why I held on, but hey, since they're not there anymore... now what?

It's not peaceful here inside. It's not peaceful here inside my head. I need peace. I need everything to be quiet.
