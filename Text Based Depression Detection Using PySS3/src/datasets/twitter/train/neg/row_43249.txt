I don't know what to say.I want to.  But they don't want me to.  Why?  I only exist to serve people, to make others happy.  My parents had me because they wanted me.  I never asked to be born.  I never asked to be given this life, this mindset, this destiny.  All my life, all I have done is serve others.  If I want to take a step forward and request some authority, some permission to act for myself...I'm shot down.  I'm insulted.  I hurt other people.

In that way, if I end my life, it will be rude of me.  Because I will have done something for myself instead of served others.  Part of me is saddened by the way others see me as a tool to get what they want.  But I know I shouldn't be, and I have guilt over those feelings.  My whole life has been built around taking care of others.  I just wish I hadn't been so selfish before.  I'm sorry.

EDIT:  I just showed my girlfriend a photo of a guy who lost a lot of weight as a way of admiring all the work he did, and she made a negative comment on his appearance.  I said I was showing her to inspire her, not to make fun of him, and she said I've been overreacting the past few days.  After she walked away I started crying a little.  If I say anything against others, I'm insulted.  This just further reinforces my viewpoint.
