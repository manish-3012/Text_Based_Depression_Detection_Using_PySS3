I Try Very HardTo make sure that I do not do or say things to hurt people. Even when I know they are in the wrong. I try so incredibly hard to be a good person. Occasionally I get recognized for it.

Sometimes I'm truly happy. But most of the time I'm sad underneath the cheerful facade I put up. Lately more than ever it's hard to keep pretending that everything is okay. I try so hard to keep my family together. To pay my bills. To be a good person. To be a good friend. I'm so tired. At this point I feel very strongly that the only reason I'm still alive is that if I committed suicide it would just cause unnecessary harm to those who love me. Lately I find that I'm beginning to care less and less. I just want to sleep.
