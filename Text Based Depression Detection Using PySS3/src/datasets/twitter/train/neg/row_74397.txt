Breaking a promise.I made a promise to someone I cared about a while ago not to act on my suicidal thoughts. Now that theyâ€™re gone, I donâ€™t have much obligation to keep it. I have nothing else to live for.

Iâ€™m just tired of keeping my head up and waiting for the next time Iâ€™ll be broken again. Iâ€™m tired of this neverending cycle of depression, anger, perfectionism, and trauma. Iâ€™m tired of not meeting my own expectations. Iâ€™m so fucking tired. I just lost my last anchor. My familyâ€™s a bunch of narcissistic dickwads. Iâ€™m a loser with nowhere to go in life. I might as well end my fucking disastrous life here.
