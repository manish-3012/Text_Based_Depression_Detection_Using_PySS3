How do you tell someone you want to end your life?Constant suicidal thoughts are getting to me. Someone close to me knows Iâ€™ve made a plan before, but that was a long time ago. No one knows my brain assaults me with suicidal thoughts every hour upon every day. How do you put that burden on another person? How do I tell someone this without changing the way they look at me? I just bottle it up at all times. To be honest I donâ€™t talk much at all.
