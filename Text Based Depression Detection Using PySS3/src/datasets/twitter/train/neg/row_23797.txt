I wish people would stop telling me that life is worth living and for once just try to understand how I feelI'm not asking them to encourage me to end it. But I wish someone, literally anyone would just empathize with me for just a minute. Just say that they get it. Say that they understand why it's so hard to keep on living. I know that it's wrong to want to die and I know that I need help and I know that my life has a purpose but those are empty statements made by people that don't seem like they actually care about seeing it from my angle.

I've chosen a method. I added the supplies I need to my cart on amazon and then chickened out and didn't place the order. I don't know if I really have any intention of actually using it, but I just want the comfort of knowing that it's there if I need a way out. 

I don't need people to tell me that I'm doing the right thing by getting supplies to go through with it but I also just wish someone would tell me that they get it and that even if they want me to feel better they know that it's not that easy. I wish someone would understand how tired I feel constantly because just waking up and having to face the thought of going through another day is enough to wear me out.

Not sure what I want out of posting this. I just feel so alone and I'm scared of myself. I'm scared of ordering those things. I don't want to and at the same time I want to more than anything because I just want everything to stop. I want it all to be over. I just don't know what to do anymore.
