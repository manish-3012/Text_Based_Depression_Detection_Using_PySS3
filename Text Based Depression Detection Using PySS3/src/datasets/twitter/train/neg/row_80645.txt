I'm pretending to be doing better than I am.I've basically resolved to kill myself this weekend. I spoke to a friend I trust who doesn't know that, but knows one of my coping mechanisms is doing riskier things like long road trips, and attempting to peruse a motorcycle and pilot license. She agreed to hold on to a sealed letter for me in case of the worst. I joked that it would contain things like "burn my porno mags" etc, but it's more than that. I intend to write three letters, one instructions letter with general instructions about the other two and what to do (and thanking/apologizing to her heavily), and two additional letters individually sealed within a larger envelope. One of the double sealed letters will be labeled "By Accident" and one will be labeled "(Unlikely) On Purpose".

Even if I don't follow through with my resolution for this weekend, then I still need to write these. I need the piece of mind they'll give me. The knowledge that, if something does happen to me, then someone I trust will be on top of the situation. She admitted to me that, in light of the shit I've been through as of recent, both she and one of her other closest friends would have fully expected me to have already fled the area to go home. I honestly don't see any path right now that takes me willingly back to being at the college I used to attend. I'm just so lost.
