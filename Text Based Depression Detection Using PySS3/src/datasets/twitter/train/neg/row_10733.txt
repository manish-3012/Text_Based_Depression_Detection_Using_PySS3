Suicide just seems logical for meThe more I think about this, the more resolute I become in my decision.

**No future**

I'm  a BS in Biology. I'm applying for jobs at temp agencies but the only  interviews I'm getting are from MLMs. There are always menial jobs  available, but this just confirms to me that I will be paying off my  debts through minimum wage jobs the rest of my life. All these open  opportunities that people talk about is bullshit. There are none for me  because I have no networking, I have wasted the last eight years all for  nothing, and there is nothing ahead.

**Settlement**

I  refuse to settle for my future than for what I could have become. But  at this point, how could I not settle? I can't afford grad school. It's  still an unlikely climb for me to break into a M7 MBA program. If I have  to choose life and take in the bullshit that mental health  professionals want to sell me, then I have to forever live with the fact  that I will always be lesser than what I could have been. This isn't  even pride, I have to accept the fact that I settled for my future.

**Lack of Mourning**

My  brother is the most stoic individual I met. I honestly doubt my suicide  will affect him. Perhaps he will be angry that he is now financially  responsible for my mother. My mother will be hit the hardest; and it  won't surprise me if she follows me. I'm taking steps that this won't  happen by leaving suicide loss groups for her to contact.

But  I honestly think her death will be inevitable. I was her meal ticket,  and once she hears I was expelled, it will hit her incredibly hard. She  will be terribly affected either way and her life is bound to shorten  regardless.

I don't have friends.  My deans never gave a shit about me. No one will ultimately miss me  except for my mother, but honestly this is best path forward. Otherwise  she'd forever be worried about my future, trying to help me financially  despite the fact that I am supposed to provide for her instead.

**Debt cancellation**

Medical  school is expensive, and I took out a lot of loans. Honestly, I think  I'm okay living with debt; in perspective it's like owing a couple car  payments. And If I could get back into medical school and put myself in  more debt, I'd take it. But the fact that my debts won't be transferred  to my family and that they can keep the student loans I have taken out  does help me pursue this decision.

**Difficulty**

Suicide  just seems so much easier to than life itself. I understand it's  cowardly, but I have accepted the fact that I am one for various reasons  and the label won't throw me off this path. If my deans won't give me a  second chance, why would I. I'm irredeemable at this point.

**Poetry**

Perhaps  the dumbest reason of all, but in some ways I feel I'm destined to kill  myself. There are jokes among my dad's side of the family of a family  curse, since it's so much like Asian arrested development. My great  grandfather was an orphan who became a self-made wealthy landowner, and  each generation since has gotten misfortune. There's a joke about  deadbeat sons in every family. In my grandfather's that was my youngest  uncle, who killed himself. His oldest brother was murdered, but before  that he had to beg his wife not to divorce him; the widow later received  a large life insurance payout (she had nothing to do with the murder).  My dad's sister was hoodwinked into a marriage and now lives poorer than  us by selling gingseng she collects with her family on the countryside.  And it seems fitting for me to end my life this way too, with no where  else to go.
