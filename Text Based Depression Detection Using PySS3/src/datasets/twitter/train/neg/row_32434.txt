I wish I never left for so long because now she doesnâ€™t acknowledge me anymore. Iâ€™m sorry A.Iâ€™m sorry I was gone for so long, but I may leave for a longer time soon, the longest time for anyone. I donâ€™t want to exist anymore. Wipe all my data from the universe, I wish I had never been created. Maybe if I do go through with it, io be forgotten in time and know would know who I was. Thatâ€™s a comforting feeling.
