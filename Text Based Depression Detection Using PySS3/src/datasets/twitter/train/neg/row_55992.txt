help.Please just help. I have not been so close to going through with a plan than I am now. I don't want to call anyone because I can't go to a mental hospital right now. My marriage has officially fallen apart. My religion has abandoned me. My family is going to disown me. I received the diagnosis of infertile. The only thing keeping me afloat right now are my dogs and my husband. Help. Please. 

Say something. Say anything.
