CloseIâ€™m getting closer and closer each day my mind seems to be deteriorating started as anxiety after a break up but itâ€™s been a spiralling fall. 
I donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel. I canâ€™t remember being happy. I canâ€™t remember what it feels like to feel human let alone feel like me. Iâ€™ve been putting in so much work to try get better and I keep falling backw.ards. Iâ€™m about to give up. Thinking about it en ing seems to bring me peace. Even where Iâ€™ve pwicked my method and in  clouded thoughts ordered what was needed no questions asked. Iâ€™m not scared about going itâ€™s almost like Iâ€™m a peace with the idea. Almost happy with it
