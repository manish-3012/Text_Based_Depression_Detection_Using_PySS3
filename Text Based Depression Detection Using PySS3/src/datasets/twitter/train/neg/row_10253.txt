Iâ€™m fucking tired of my constant problems and pain and sufferingSo I already have adhd and have very little friends so when I got depression I started struggling, I canâ€™t tell anybody though because Iâ€™m scared that that wonâ€™t believe me and that they think Iâ€™m just looking for attention because Iâ€™m still pretty young, Iâ€™ve considered suicide but Iâ€™m scared of what that will do to my family. I just need a way out of this
