I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m really depressed or just asking for attention or lazinessFor example, today I had a fight with a very close friend of mine and my solution was to cut myself. Most days I would say that I donâ€™t feel much, but I can get on with my daily life fairly ok.  Sometimes I couldnâ€™t even get my job done because I just couldnâ€™t be fucked. But why donâ€™t I feel like dying every single day, just when I have some difficulties with the people I love? I donâ€™t know if I just want attention from the people that Iâ€™m having troubles with or itâ€™s a coping mechanism. Iâ€™ve never spoken to a therapist either because I keep thinking itâ€™s not that serious. I donâ€™t know anymore.
