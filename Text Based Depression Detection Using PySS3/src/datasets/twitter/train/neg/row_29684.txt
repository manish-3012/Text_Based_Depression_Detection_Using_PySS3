the second my grandma dies iâ€™m killing myself.sheâ€™s the only thing keeping me alive. i donâ€™t think i could breathe knowing she wasnâ€™t here. she isnâ€™t that old but sheâ€™s in bad health and doesnâ€™t take good enough care of herself. i donâ€™t wanna keep living if she isnâ€™t here. i think iâ€™ve always known that i feel this way though because i used to always say â€œi hope we die the exact same time so i donâ€™t have to live without youâ€, thinking about that now it was a bit sad for a 6 year old to say since she will most likely die way before me. i donâ€™t have much more to live for, iâ€™m constantly sad or mad or both.
