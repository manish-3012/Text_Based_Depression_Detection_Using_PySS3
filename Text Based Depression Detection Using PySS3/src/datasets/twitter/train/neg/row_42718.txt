Fuck this modern world, I want to return to monkeFunny but serious. I feel like the only way I could exercise any control over my life is by literally blowing my brains out, I have no control over anything else because i'm *poor.* 

*"*Hey poor guy, here's a fucking parking ticket to add to your spiraling misery. Oh? You can't afford to pay it? Ah, well your punishment for being poor is that you're not allowed to renew your license, so good luck getting to work. Enjoy being even more poor! :) Fuck you, you poor piece of shit!"

All I want is an average job with an average salary and its literally fucking *impossible* to find. *nobody* will hire anyone without a university degree + 3 years experience even for a job someone with half a fucking brain could be trained to do in a week. 

I'd *literally* rather rot in the ground than work minimum wage for some moronic piece of shit manager again. I'm so fucking close to giving up. We weren't meant to live like this, for all of human history you could just *decide* to work and you'd have just as much to show for it as anyone else. Now there's a ridiculous series of over-complicated loops you have to jump through for *years* to even have the privilege of working for a decent living. I'm so fucking sick of being poor and being continuously punished for being poor.

Money *does* buy happiness, every single fucking problem I have would be solved if I just had an AVERAGE SALARY. I'M NOT EVEN ASKING TO BE RICH.
