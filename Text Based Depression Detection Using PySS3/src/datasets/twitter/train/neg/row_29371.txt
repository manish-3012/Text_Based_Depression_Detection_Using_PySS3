Why is there no one to guide me?I am treated like shit and expected to do as everyone pleases. I am brought into this world with no one telling me why I am here. Everyone acts like it's my fault that I am here when I didn't ask to be brought into this world. No one will tell me where to find a better paying Job, if I should drop out of college or do a trade, where to find a partner that is right for me, how to pursue hobbies that interest me, and no one will tell me kill myself. If there isn't an answer to what to do about not having family in my life, why isnt suicide the solution?
