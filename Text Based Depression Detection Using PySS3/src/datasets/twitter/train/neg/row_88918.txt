March 30th, 2019I chose the date that I'm planning on killing myself on. It will be 1,000 days since I had known happiness. I want to do it now, but something is holding me back.

I thought I'd be over her after a month, but that came and I was as miserable as the day she changed her mind. 100 days came and I was still miserable. Five months passed, and I lost all my sanity. She claimed to be my friend but she showed me nothing of the sort. I put my trust in her and she told me that things were fine but she did nothing but lie and drag me along. Leaving me lost with nothing but my imagination. And I lost my sanity. I became obsessed because I couldn't understand how someone could lie to my face and put me through that torture.

Even now I'm 8 months away from when I first lost all joy and nothing is getting better. I WILL NOT LIVE A LIFE FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT THIS PAIN AND DARKNESS. I want to die now, I want Michelle to shoot me in the head and take the only thing that I have left, my life, away from me as she took everything else. But I won't, not yet because even though 8 months have passed and I haven't gotten even a little bit better maybe 16 months will change things.

But when March 30th 2019 comes I will kill myself and I will make sure that Michelle knows that she did this to me.

I don't know if this is allowed here but I have no one else to tell. I want to tell Michelle, but I promised myself and her that I was done talking to her. And I don't want to drag my family or friends in to my own problems.
