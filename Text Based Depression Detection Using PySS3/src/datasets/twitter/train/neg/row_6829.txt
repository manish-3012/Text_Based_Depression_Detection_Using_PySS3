Please help.I genuinely want to kill myself tonight. I desperately need someone to talk to and yeah I have friends but I donâ€™t want them seeing me like this. I donâ€™t want to hurt the ones I love but Iâ€™m hopeless, exhausted, and just lifeless. I cannot see my future, I donâ€™t even care to anymore Iâ€™ve sabotaged everything good in my life. All I have is my boyfriend but he doesnâ€™t deserve this. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t have the strength to stay alive anymore. Should I commit myself to the psych ward? I honestly think I might kill myself tonight.
