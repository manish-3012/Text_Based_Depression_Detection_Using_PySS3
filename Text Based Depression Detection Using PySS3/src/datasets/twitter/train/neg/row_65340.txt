I gave myself a week, but that seems too generous. I can't get over the decisions I made. I am so pissed at myself for sharing every detail of my life with someone that I thought gave a shit. I'm mad I told them enough about me that they could easily hurt me in fights, then laugh in my face when I became even more upset. And I feel hopeless for letting him shape my thoughts; thoughts that made me believe that I am the worst person on this planet. I would give anything to change the past. I don't like hating everything about myself, and I'm embarrassed that I wasn't smart enough to see that he hated everything, too. 

I gave myself a week to live so I could finalize a will and get some things sorted out, but now I don't feel like I can even make it to see the sun come up. I'm sad, I'm angry, I want to put my fist through a wall, cry in the shower, slam my face into my desk... I've never felt so horrible in my life, and I want the feeling gone. I can't even bring myself to drink to numb the pain. 

Words are hurtful. Don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise.
