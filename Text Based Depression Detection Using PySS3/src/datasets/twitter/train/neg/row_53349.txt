I donâ€™t know what to doMy life is falling apart and I am only 14 years.

 you can now more about how it go to this seeing my other posts.

Today I have discussed with my family, almost died from a car accident, my dog put trash in the floor, and my parents beat them until they cried, even the one that did nothing, just out of anger.

my father is the reason behind all this.

We his literally the worst dad possibly, the only thing good he ever did was bringing money home, but he spends it on things futile things just for him.

My mom is just stuck in this marriage,she is a wonderful person and very emotional, the only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because of her and my dogs and birds, I already tried 4 times and have cut myself numerous times.

Now he is threatening putting my animals in the street to die, I am in my bedroom crying, I will possibly kill myself   I am doing my notes already, I donâ€™t know what will happen, I have thinking of killing my dad and killing myself, I donâ€™t have any hope anymore.
