I want to kill myself because I'm so ugly.I'm so freaking mad. When I tell my father I'm ugly he just says I'm pretty. THAT'S IT. THAT'S ALL HE SAYS. HE DOESN'T SAY WHY I'M PRETTY HE JUST FUCKING SAYS IT. Nobody takes me seriously. My mother always sides with dad. I have a mole on my face and I want to remove it but he won't let me. Every time I look at my face I hate myself even more and more. I want to kick my dad in the face extremely hard because I hate my moles/freckles SO BAD. My father doesn't want to see a counselor or therepist. All because we're different and homeschooled. I'm autistic and my little sister doesn't eat or drink anything except water, and only a few foods. I'm really stressed, upset, now really want to commit suicide but I feel scared. What do I do?
