How to develop a sense of morality?I don't have a solid foundation. I don't understand why I should do things or what right and wrong is. Currently, I believe there is no such thing as right and wrong, merely preferences. So that's put me into limbo about so many things. Should I commit suicide? Should I get out of bed? Is there any point to continue living? Is there any point to not continue living? Should I try to heal myself? Should I go on a psychopathic rampage and kill everyone in town? If there's no right and wrong what should I do? Why should I do it?
