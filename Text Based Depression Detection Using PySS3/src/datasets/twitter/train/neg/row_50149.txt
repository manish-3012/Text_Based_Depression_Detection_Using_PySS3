Fuck this WorldDepression has destroyed everything in my life. It has destroyed friendships, relationships, and any sense of hope that I have left. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide before but sadly I survived which makes things even worse looking back at it. Heading into this new decade worries me so much. I donâ€™t have the courage to kill myself which stresses me so much. I hope that I find the courage to end it all very soon because Iâ€™d rather end this miserable pain than having to live in this prison of a world we call. Iâ€™m on borrowed time so Iâ€™m looking forward to the day Iâ€™m free from this world.
