(X-posted from ask transgender) My adult, physically disabled trans woman friend being abused at the facility she's staying at, and wants to commit suicide to escape the abuse. What can I (17 yr. old friend) do to help?Will ask somewhere else if this breaks rules, but I'm honestly at the end of my options here. My friend, whom I'll call J, has a family who's extremely abusive and transphobic. She's been mistreated by them and bullied outside of the house nearly her whole life, and has bounced between abusive and transphobic shelters. She's severely depressed and suicidal, and one attempt (unacknowledged by her parents) left her crippled from the waist down. In the latest disabled-froendly shelter she's in, she's experienced all kinds of abuse, from verbal mistreatment to neglect. They didn't respond to her asking for food until she was almost fainting (I had to help her focus to stay conscious), watched her fall out of her wheelchair and made her crawl into the bed...it's absolutely disgusting. Needless to say, she is very suicidal -- I'm probably one of the only reasons she hasn't killed herself. She wants me to leave, forget her and not worry, as I have my own problems (I'm in foster care fighting my own abusive parents in court), says that she fucked up her life and that I still have hope, stop stressing yourself out with me. I've spent hours talking her out of suicide, emailed her parents and intend to email the superiors of her abusers, but if this place doesn't shape up, all she has to go to is her parents, who don't seem interested in treating her well whatsoever. Her dad once held a gun to the back of her head. Just, fuck Missouri, why don't they have a decent place for her to stay? It feels like there might not be much more I can do, and each morning, I fear waking up to her suicide note...what more can I do to help? There has to be something...anything...
