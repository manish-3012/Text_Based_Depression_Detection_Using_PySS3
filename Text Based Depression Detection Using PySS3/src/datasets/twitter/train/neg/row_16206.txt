I think about killing myself a lot. as much as I think about ending my life, at this very moment the urge is the greatest ive ever felt. right now I feel my choices are to admit myself to some hospital or therapy group or chug whatever fucking chemical i find in my bathroom/kitchen. im feeling low and I can't keep numbing myself with weed or alcohol.
