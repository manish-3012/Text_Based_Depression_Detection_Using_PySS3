IdealizationI drank last night &amp; in a fight with my SO. I'm a horrible drinker do to mental health issues, I know better &amp; deeply regret my decision. Today I have such bad anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. I'm unhappy, i have so much love to give, but feel its never wanted. I'm a stay at home mother, and the codependency is driving me crazy as well. I feel drained by my thoughts today. I'm embarassed of myself. I'm not sure how to get help, because I'm scared.
