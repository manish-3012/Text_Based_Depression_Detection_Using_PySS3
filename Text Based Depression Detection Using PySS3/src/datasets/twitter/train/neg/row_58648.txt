the hardest part is not tying the ropeMy last post explained that my best friend of 11 years who was my strength and loved me through my fiancÃ©s Suicide has broken our friendship and only he has the key to fix it but he just wonâ€™t. And it feels like Iâ€™m walking in on my fiancÃ© all over again. The hardest part is not killing myself. He was my last friend, as in I have no other friends. He was my sanity, my rock and my soul mate in one way or another.... but Iâ€™m not worth it. I knew that but he always said I was.
