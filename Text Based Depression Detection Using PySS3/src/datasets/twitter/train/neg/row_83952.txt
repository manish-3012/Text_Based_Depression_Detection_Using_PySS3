I'm tired of my lifeI'm a Indian boy, gonna turn 17 next week and I'm going to give the best birthday present by not existing anymore. Basically I'm from a low middleclass family. I'm tall and little overweight and people of my age. I haven't studied anything for a while, I've been getting bad grades since 11th grade. I'm the only child of my parents, yet they are ashamed of having me. My mom is kinda disabled, she has Parkinson's disease, my dad is the only one earning money. He says it isn't enough for us to run our home. 
            This may sound inhuman but I hate my parents. Its not like I'm wasted or anything. Its just that everything I do,it disappoints then. Since this lockdown my dad has to go his office leaving me and my mom so I do everything to take care of her and yet she's got something to say that I'm not enough. Since my dad pays the bills, he thinks he should control the house. He's like controlling me. He admits that his life has been better if I didn't exist.
           I see kids my age having wifi, Netflix and all but I never asked my dad for that. He's always mean to me and finds a way to let me down. Yeah, I'm jealous of other kids of my age. I've got no friends and I don't even think talking to someone is gonna change anything.
            Idk if this is the right platform to post this but it'd be great if anyone thinks my life could be better. And sorry for the bad English
