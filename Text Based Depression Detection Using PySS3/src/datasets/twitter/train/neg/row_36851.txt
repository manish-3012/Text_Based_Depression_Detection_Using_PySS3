I haven't felt happiness or laughed in 2 monthsI think I have depersonalization disorder and literally all I've done for the past two months is research about suicide and look at suicide forums. I am extremely suicidal and am desperate for help. I'm only 21 and its so scary feeling this way because it's not going away. I don't even feel fucking real. Nothing has felt real for a long time, and I'm terrified this is permanent. I want a way out so bad. I'm scared I'm just going to be locked away in a mental institution feeling like this for the rest of my days. I need to end it before that happens, I'm just so scared.
