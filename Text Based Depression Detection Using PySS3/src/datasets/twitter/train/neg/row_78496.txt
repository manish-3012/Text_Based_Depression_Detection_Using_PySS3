I don't have any control over my life and I keep on pushing everyone awayI know Im not fucking psychotic but my opinion doesn't fucking matter. Im 18 but I dont even have legal rights over myself. That's for other people, not me. My guardian is an abusive controlling piece of shit who has fucked up my schooling and chances of graduating on time and going to college. I have a guardian until im 19 even though im not officially diagnosed with a mental illness, im crazy and have an smi determination. Im done trying. I want to fucking die but suicide is too god damn hard. I cant even talk to anyone about anything because my feelings arent valid. What i think doesnt matter. I dont fucking matter and im going to end it the first chance i get.
