I think this is over for meI lost it all. Finally it happened. Not worth it without you even if I really hate you sometimes. I canâ€™t take it. I really do hope I end it soon especially now that I think I finally lost you. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m really fucking sorry. I just canâ€™t try. I donâ€™t have anyone of anything to try for. Nothing makes it worth it. I canâ€™t live as myself and itâ€™s final. I just really do hope it happens soon. It shouldnâ€™t have ended like this but of course I made it worse. I am so mentally abusive to myself that I have just ruined my life. Iâ€™ve ruined me. Itâ€™s over.
