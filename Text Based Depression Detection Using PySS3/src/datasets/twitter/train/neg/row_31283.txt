Why tryIâ€™ve been trying to save and go on travel to different countries as itâ€™s been a dream of mine but then Iâ€™m sat here just wanting to die so badly. Iâ€™ve got a plan and I just want to go through with it. Idk why I try to stay alive when all I am is miserable in life. The panic attacks are too bad, the urges are so strong. I canâ€™t stand my own body that the confidence I once had is completely out the window. I hide who I am pretty much every day to avoid talking about things and the judgement. I give up. Itâ€™s time I die.
