10 yearsItâ€™s been 10 years since then. I saw you smiling at me and at everything I do because you were amused. We laughed and talked for hours on the phone and woke up late together. You were dissing your colleagues and spilling tea about them to me. You were thankful to have me around. You may hate me now but I keep the good memories somewhere in my head, even if I donâ€™t really remember anything anymore. This or next year would be the last day of living. Everything has turned into a full circle. I believe mankind should be given a choice to end their life whenever they see fit. You donâ€™t know this side of me and you never will. Iâ€™m not interested in love, happiness or relationships. Death is getting closer.
