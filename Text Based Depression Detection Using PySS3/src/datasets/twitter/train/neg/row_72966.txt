Every day I struggle with the same thoughts.And the idea of hanging myself becomes increasingly attractive. I have had enough of fucking my life up. I have no motivation any more. I will try anti-depressants and counselling before making an exit plan, but it's hard to want to even do that. 32 years old and can never be happy.
