Trying to get helpHow do I ask my doctor for help?  I want to try to help myself but Iâ€™ve known my family doctor since I was born, he delivered me, itâ€™s almost like telling a family member that Iâ€™m suicidal and need help.
Do I just say like hey I think I have depression or something, I donâ€™t have the will to live anymore ðŸ‘‹ and what will I tell my parents if I get medication or something? I have to go to my family doctor alone because I know my mom wonâ€™t believe me and if she does I donâ€™t want to see her face when she realizes my situation. If I say Iâ€™m on anti-depressants they will know another part of me that I donâ€™t share with anyone. Iâ€™m scared. They wonâ€™t understand how hard it is for me to just live, like to wake up, shower, eat, do homework, care about my health. They wonâ€™t be malicious but I just know they wonâ€™t understand me
