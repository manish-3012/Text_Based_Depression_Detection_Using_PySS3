Alone on New Year's? Who cares! Fuck it.I'm alone on New Year's eve. Yeah, so what? 

I'm alone on New Year's because I'm too squirrelly to show myself at these dinner parties and more than slightly ashamed of myself and somewhat notorious and people have told me about their plans but didn't invite me. But FUCK THAT NOISE. I'M NOT GOING DOWN. 

I decided I wasn't going to die yesterday and I don't care if I'm alone on New Year's because... well, fuck, I'm not going to let these fuckers murder me. Because it's not suicide. I'd be letting all the abuse and shame just fill me up and kill me. It's not mine. I don't deserve to die. 

So what if I'm a "drug-addled alcoholic" whose "life must be pure hell" (that's my family talking) and is something of a pariah because people don't understand benzo withdrawal or domestic violence? So what? 

I'm not gong out of this fucking world because some assholes decided I have zero value. Fuck them, I'm a goddamned motherfucking superhero. People don't know what it's like to endure shit for years. Fuck them. I should not die.

Okay, I don't know if this rant was appropriate for here, but I've been using this place as a general megaphone coping mechanism.

Gahhhhhh they won't kill me!!!
