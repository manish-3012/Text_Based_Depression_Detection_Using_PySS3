Anonymous places in Shelbyville, IN or Southeast Indianapolis?I can't use the phone or use my credit card because I could lose my job if somebody found out I was seeking help or if the things I talked about were revealed.  Anybody know a walk-in place that I can remain completely anonymous in the above mentioned areas?  I think I'm cracking up.  I just can't help but feel all the protests and riots going on are because of me.  I know this sounds weird but you people just don't understand the things I've done.  What I've participated in.  Everything that mob hates, it hates in me.
