I wish I wasnt so afraid to end itEvery day I think, maybe tomorrow will be better but it never is and I just want to end it but part of me stops me.. I just need to get over it and fucking end this bullshit, Im so lonely and I just want to find love but no one wants me because im a pathetic loser

I've know i've posted before but i havent been this  low in my life im actually considering ending it but I cant but I want to and i cant think and my head hurts...
