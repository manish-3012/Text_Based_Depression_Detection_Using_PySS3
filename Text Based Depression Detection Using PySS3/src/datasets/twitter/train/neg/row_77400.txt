The only thing that keeps me going is knowing I might be helping someone stay alive. Knowing my efforts succeeded and knowing when they havenâ€™t. I hope youâ€™re all doing ok.Maybe you may not think anyone will care if youâ€™re gone, but the longer I spend on this community the more people I meet that end up taking their own lives. Iâ€™m sorry.
