Wanting to die (again)Day in and day out itâ€™s just having to make up for all the trauma and abuse Iâ€™ve experienced. Iâ€™m so tired having to work for the right to live everyday without feeling anxious or wanting to die, only followed by me wanting to die anyways so who fucking cares really? Why prolong the inevitable???
