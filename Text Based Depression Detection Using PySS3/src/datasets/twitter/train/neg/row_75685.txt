empathy machine brokelong story short: i see those â€œi donâ€™t want to hurt my friends/family if i kill myself,â€ and i can barely relate on a good day. i donâ€™t care if theyâ€™d be hurt; iâ€™d be dead. whatâ€™s it matter if theyâ€™re hurting over someone whoâ€™s already gone, who canâ€™t feel any guilt, and who canâ€™t offer any apologies? 

i dunno. i feel like i should be worried about killing myself when my dad says iâ€™m his â€œfavoriteâ€ (which is kinda a joke, kinda true), or that my sister would lose her support against our shitty mom. i guess theyâ€™d miss me, and they would be hurt, but like... that only matters if we assume i can feel guilt after death. i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll be close enough to see any of it, if thereâ€™s anything after life. 

idk, itâ€™s late and iâ€™m probably gonna just post this and go to bed, but i guess itâ€™s food for thought.
