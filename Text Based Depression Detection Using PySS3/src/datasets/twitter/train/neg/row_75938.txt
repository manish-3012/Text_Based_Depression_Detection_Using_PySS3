I can't handle it anymore.My dad and mom are pretty sucessuful lawyers, my brother is gonna graduate in law this year and already has a job on the area, my sister is brilliant student and a professional athlete who will pass on the uni selection this year still.
i'm 1000 miles away of them, studying a uni I didn't wanna to just so I woulsn't do nothing, I don't have amy friends here, I hate my appearence in general, my romantic live is noexiwtent and I fell I will never pass on the uni I have been trying 3 years so far to enter.
I feel like just a money burning failure to them and I sincerelly don't eanna live anymore.
I just wanna the courage to finally end it.
