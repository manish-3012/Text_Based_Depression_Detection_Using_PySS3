Well I've met the end of my road and counting down..Well I feel like this is it. This the end of the road for me. I've tried and tried for so long but I feel beat. I feel like I can't go forward anymore. I'm 25 years old and don't have a career.. i still live at home because I financially suck at saving money. I work at a studmill and it pays good and is union but I don't care for the money and benifits.. i just want to live a happy life and be happy and be around people I love. I met a girl roughly 2 years ago and I fell head over heals. We were okay and then something happened that rocked the relationship to break. I wanted to still be with her and move past that but I vent allot and spoke to  my friends about it when I should of just tried to keep it to myself.. but I didn't and sunk her views from others to hell. I told her those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind and I told my closest friends that I was working on it again and that's that.. be my friend and accept or not I didn't care because I felt something I never did with her and I fucked up and wanted to fix it so damn bad. Don't get me wrong what she did most people would walk away immediately but I had hope. I've never been given the dream of a life and that's what she did she gave me a dream of a life. We talked about living in a quite home and doing this and that but long story short she told me she's not happy anymore. I'm lost. I'm crushed. I'm ready to say my goodbyes and kiss this world goodnight..
