Why do tiny things always make me suicidal?So I accidentally got water on my Mac and it's not turning on. I Googled the solution so it's currently upside down with a fan underneath.

I wanted to die because of this. I'm not really sure how my brain got to that solution but it did. I have all my important stuff from my Mac backed up and if worst comes to worst I can afford to buy a new one, but I'm still unbelievably upset about my mistake. I feel I've improved my mental health so much over the past few years but I find that whenever something goes wrong my brain always goes back to thinking 'why don't you kill yourself? That way you wouldn't have to deal with any of this any more.' And then I just ruminate about suicide for a while and feel shitty until it goes away. How do I get out of this pattern?
