I've been in bed all day and haven't had a proper meal in 3 years.My family has disowned me. They rather not deal with the shame of having an anorexic woman in the house. They are millionaires but won't pay for my therapy or anything I desperately need. They have no unconditional love. It's all about image for them. Makes me sick.
My brother raped me for years and threatened to kill me/rape my little sister if I tattled..
and when I finally told my mother, she a.d my grandmother covered it up..swept it under the rug. He stopped the rapimg but continued to sexually harass and torment me until I left home at 22.
Couldn't leave home until 22 because I was in college. Third world conservative country, parents would rather see me dead.
Got a job, made enough money and escaped to first world country.
Things were good for a little while. Without financial support of family I struggled. I was ok until I became anorexic.
Downhill from there. Think I have struggled with depression for at least 10 years. Never been diagnosed. Been raped since 12.
Went back to home country to seek help. Thrown out my family in a week.
Back in Canada. Very poor and almost out of money. Dont have much hope left. And i dont see the point of continuing. I dont want to see my 25th birthday makes me feel sick. I always had high expectations of 25. Married with a kid. Happy. Over my bad childhood. But instead im an ugly corpse with no future who is loved by no one and a waste of resources. Anyway this is one of the worst days of my life and ive had many. I want to watch the inauguration in the morning and after that Ive got a plan. Feeling a sense of freedom right now as fucked up as it is. Im writing a note for my sister. I hate the rest of my family. No friends so going to be a simple death. Lol i wonder how many days it will take for them to identify the body.
