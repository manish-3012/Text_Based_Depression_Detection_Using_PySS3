There's no point anymoreIf I get help I'll be hospitalized until I say I won't kill myself anymore and then I'll get out and nothing will change.

Therapists can't help me and there's no way to change my situation I was born to be miserable. My life is just laying in bed and eating once a day and maybe going out once a week but I can't function to do anything else. I don't really understand the point, I'm not really living anyway but people seem to be okay as long as I'm not dead. I just don't want to be in pain anymore. I won't ever get any better
