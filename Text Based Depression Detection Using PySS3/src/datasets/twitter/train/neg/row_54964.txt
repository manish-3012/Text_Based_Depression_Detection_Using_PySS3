RacistI'm so tired of this world. Being white is evil according to blm supporters.  South Africa is the most industrious, productive, and wealthy county within Africa and that's solely because of the large white population but it's also known for killing white farmers/raping/ etc. Why is this world so evil? I'm sick of all the riots, the murder, the looting. Why can't every race go back to their own country? blm protesters looters are killing black people but they still blame white people. Other races migrate to these white countries and complain about the government here too. They cant be happy, ever. I'm tired of this FUCKING world
