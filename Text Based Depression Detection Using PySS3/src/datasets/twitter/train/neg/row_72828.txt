I want to get out of this nightmareShe doesn't give a damn about me anymore. We used to be pretty close, and I still try to interact with her as much as I can because she's the only thing that keeps me going in this shitty life, but it's so damn apparent that she couldn't care less about my existence now. What's worse is that she's actively flirting with this other guy who she seems to be in love with. I've seen it happen in front of me multiple times and it hurts so fucking much dude. All that effort put into getting her to like me...only to watch her obsess over someone else.

I know that this seems like a minor problem to you all, but it's genuinely tearing me apart. I legit cannot handle it. It makes me feel like a worthless loser who'll never get what he wants in life. Seeing her and that other guy be so happy with each other makes me want to bang my head against the wall out of both frustration and sadness.

This is by far the worst I've ever felt and there's nothing I or someone else could do to help me. I'm trapped in a nightmare and I want it to end.
