I just don't know how to keep going.A user directed me to this sub and as I read through it I just think I could have written so many of these posts. I really just want to eat the rest of my prescriptions and wash it down with a bottle of whiskey. Tried a couple nights ago and was angry when I woke up the next day. 

I just really don't know how to keep going. I've been through so much in my life but I think I finally just broke. My dog that I adopted 12 years ago is dying and my two front teeth were extracted a couple weeks ago. I can hardly see her without just breaking down. This little dog saved my life when I was battling depression in my early 20s. I'm about to go through a breakup and I don't have anything or anyone. 

I tried so hard. I got so healthy and was so strong and it's all just gone away. 

I'm tired.
