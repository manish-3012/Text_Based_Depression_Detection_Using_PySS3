Doing horrible in school and I've never been so suicidal in my lifeDon't get me wrong, I've always had the rare suicidal thoughts since I was a toddler. But I've never had so many every fucking day. I'm not doing well in exams for half of my classes and I feel like if I give myself a gap year to recover mentally, that I'm a failure to my family. I feel like my time is running out and I can't do that. I'm afraid that if I see that I failed a class, I'll do something stupid. 

I love what I'm studying (veterinary medicine). I'm afraid that if I take a gap year, what if it's just me? What if I return and everything is the same? What if I'm meant for an easy life with a dead end job? What if I can never have a better life? What if it's all just because I'm lazy?

I just finished an online exam and it went horribly. He gave us 30 seconds per question when we usually had up to 2 hours to complete an exam. I feel so stupid and incompetent. I'm tired of wanting to kill myself over school. Am I not meant for this? 

My sister did great even during her worst times. She's always been better. I have no excuse for my poor performance. I've had the better life and yet I'm fucking crap. She had a 9.3 gpa and the lowest she got was 8.7. I can't even pass a stupid exam.
