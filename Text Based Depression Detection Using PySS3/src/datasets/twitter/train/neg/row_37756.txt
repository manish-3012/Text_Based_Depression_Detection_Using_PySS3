For the gay, in the closet, suicidal comic book nerds like myself...I am Spider-Man. Yeah, that one.

I am at the front of a runaway train, desperately attempting to keep it from falling off the elevated track into the river below. I aim my webs to the buildings surrounding me. The first two break and fall to the ground, doing nothing to calm the inertia of the doomed train. My webs become more and more numerous. I shoot them to any surrounding brick wall, steel frame, and glass structure. After what may seem like hundreds of web strands the train slows, escaping certain death and destruction. 

I am Spider-Man.
I am the train.

I am a train bound to run off the tracks in silence. The inertia is moving me faster and faster towards death. I can't live in a world where I am not comfortable to be myself. With every web I shoot from my wrist, with every person I tell about my homosexuality, the train slows. Sure, some strands will break; not every person in my life will accept who I truly am. But with each web I shoot, I am closer to the calm and peace I strive for. With every strand I am farther away from death and closer to the life I intend to lead.


I wrote this on a piece of paper and taped it to my wall. It gives me an extra boost of confidence everyday.
