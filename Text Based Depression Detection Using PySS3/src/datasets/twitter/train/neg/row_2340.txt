I give it until the end of year.I'm going to be gone by the end of the year.

I've realised that people don't actually care about you, and that's fine. People are selfish by nature and when they say they care and are there to talk, it's to fuel their ego and make themselves feel good about themselves, as opposed to wanting to seriously see you get better.

Fuck relationships and fuck emotions.

I would have been dead already on Monday if everything went to plan however evidently I can't even kill myself right, fuckin hell.
