For the first time, I'm really considering suicideHi all,

I've been having severe anxiety, panic attacks and depression for long now. I've fantasized about suicide for a long time, but I always told myself how if I did it, I'd just hurt my wife. No matter how much I thought I was a burden.
She is depressed too, and has been having bouts of anxiety. So when she felt suicidal I felt a real fear of losing her! I was always sure I could not do that to her, so all my suicidal thoughts just stayed in fantasy world. Just a thing to make me feel better from time to time.

Fast forward a few days ago I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life (I hadn't had one even close to being that strong in a few months now). My wife seems to be in pain and trying to hide it. She finally breaks and tells me how hard it is to appear strong when I'm panicking. I asked her if she felt I was a burden to her. She actually told me yes.

So... the single thing that has been preventing me to actually execute a suicide (pun intended), is now gone.
I'm back to thinking practical things, like the least painful ways to die. The least likely to fail.

I think of my friends, siblings and parents. Perhaps I'll hire somebody to make it look like an accident or something [If this counts as an explicit method, I'm truly sorry]. I don't know why I'm sharing this... Yet somehow feels right.

A big hug to you all. I know your pain.
