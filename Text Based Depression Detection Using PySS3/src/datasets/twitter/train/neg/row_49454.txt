Are there any coders here?Programming is the only thing that stops me from having suicidal tendencies. Are there any coders here like this as well? I don't know anyone like this irl and it would really help if I knew I wasn't completely alone. 

Feel free to share what keeps you alive, even if it isn't coding. I want to hear about you. I think you matter
