I've had enough.People can be so stupid.. you can SHOW them evidence and they will find a way to say it isn't true.  
cognitive dissonance has ruined any productive conversation.  
I can't take it anymore. I don't want any part of any of this. I've been alone for YEARS prior to covid and now I have nothing.  
I want to die. the only things that keep me going are my parents and my dog. but i don't think I can cling to those or continue to let them outweigh the negatives of being alive. I want out. I don't know what to do.
