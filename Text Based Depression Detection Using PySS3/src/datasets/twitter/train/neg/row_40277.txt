I'll be ending my life tonightLong story short I'm almost 30. A virgin, not religious and just drained out. I have OCD and depression and its made it hard to have a life. The anxiety makes me not able to keep a job, I am in debt and there is just nowhere else to go. Can't get insurance to get help and I'm just tired of trying and failing. And in all honesty there might be 10 people who are legit actually sad about it. I live at home so feel like a leech and nobody here understands. I'm tired of burdening my parents so this truly is best case for everyone.
