I lived a bit too long because Iâ€™m stupidI was going to kill myself about 2 and a half months ago. Instead I tried something to save myself, a last chance. I was stupid to think there could be hope, my suicide is inevitable. Iâ€™ll try to say goodbye over the next couple days, I canâ€™t make it obvious though. Iâ€™m just upset that I thought there was any saving myself. Now I know better, itâ€™s too late today, either Monday night or Tuesday night. I need to buy razor blades and I donâ€™t think I can do that until Tuesday. I hope it works on the first try!
