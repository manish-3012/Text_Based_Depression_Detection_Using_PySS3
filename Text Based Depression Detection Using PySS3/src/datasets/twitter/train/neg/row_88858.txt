Want to kill my self on my moms 15th anniversary of suicideI was just recently diagnosed with bipolar and I feel like my health is constantly declining. I always feel sick , in pain, tired. I donâ€™t have any friends and I feel so alone. I canâ€™t get medicine for 5 weeks and if I go to the stress center Iâ€™ll mess up my studies that Iâ€™m Behind on already. There seems to be no way out. I hate being alive . I want things to get better but it feels like life is one cruel joke on me. My moms suicide was on September 19 and I just want to die on that day . I canâ€™t get out of bed or function. Iâ€™m dizzy constantly . I cried so much today I almost vomited . Iâ€™m mentally so exhausted . Whatâ€™s the point in trying when you just canâ€™t win.
