So much apathy, so little change.The closest overpass is the equivalent of probably 3 stories high, it is about a 25 minute walk away. 

I have a pool in the backyard, but I don't really want my family to find me in that state. 

Knives would work, but that's so plain, I'd rather do something more thrilling. Cutting my wrists would be nice, maybe. 

Suffocation - the same as drowning. 

OD would be easy, but it probably wouldn't work. 

Neighbor down the street has a gun, I could get it, all I have to do is stop by to say hello tomorrow and grab it on my way out. But then, where would I go to end it? What if it isn't loaded? The guilt they would feel.

I think I'll forego the antidepressants tonight, and toss them for awhile. That will give me the courage.
