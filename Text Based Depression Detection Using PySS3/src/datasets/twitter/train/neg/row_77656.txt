Estranged, alone, soon to be jobless.I was the product of a teen pregnancy and was put up for adoption at birth. The household I was adopted into in was physically/sexually abusive and I became estranged from that family after finishing high school. I struggled with homelessness for the first few years afterwards. The holidays are especially rough on me emotionally because of the focus on being with family and loved ones -- I tried to be happy when my coworkers talked to me about their holiday plans, but it just hurt so much inside to be unable to be a part of all of that. I have a difficult time making connections with other people. After everything that's happened it's hard to trust people, and I feel like no one would really want to be near someone with so many issues anyway. 

In October 2015 I got my first full-time job, and thought things were looking up. About a month ago I got a 60 day layoff notice. I have a few interviews lined up, but I'm not optimistic and don't have much in savings to keep me going after my job ends. Yesterday I had a rough day at work, and all I could think was that my life isn't going to improve, and that I could save myself fifty more years of pain if I ended it. I stayed up all night tonight looking into making my own exit bag.
