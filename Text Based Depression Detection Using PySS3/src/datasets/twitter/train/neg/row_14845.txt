I donâ€™t want to kill myself anymoreIâ€™ve made a few posts here talking about how I am going to kill myself this year. I have decided that I will not kill myself anymore. I guess Iâ€™ll try to just stay alive and see what happens. I donâ€™t want to make any promises for myself, but maybe life wonâ€™t be as bad as I might think
