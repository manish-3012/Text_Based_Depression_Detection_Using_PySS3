I jsut dont want to exist. 21FI have a beautiful baby girl, five months old.
I have a fiance that is supportive and loving.

I have a dream life so to speak.

No, it hasn't always been milk and honey for me, but it's good now

Why am I still so miserable?
Why do I still want to die?
What is wrong with me?
