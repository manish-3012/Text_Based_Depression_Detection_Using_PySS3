What do you do if your friends are literally telling you they're suicidal and that there's nothing you can do about it and they live or moved far away?Someone on another reddit thread directed me here to ask this question. Another commenter told me that listening was very important. How can I be a good listener? "Oh wow I'm so sorry to hear that" seems useless. How do I actually help?
