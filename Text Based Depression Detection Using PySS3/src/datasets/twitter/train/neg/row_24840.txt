i dont want help, nor do i want to get betterit sounds really bad. i know. i have the resources to get help. actually, iâ€™m getting â€œhelpâ€ right now but itâ€™s just not working out for me. i agreed to do it because my friend was worried about me. he isnt now, and i never wanted help in the first place. the only thing i want help in is committing suicide.

itâ€™s not going to get better. iâ€™ve been told that for three years in counting, and iâ€™m tired of counting. even if i do stop being depressed, iâ€™ll always know that life is pointless and no matter how hard i try, iâ€™ll never be able to give myself purpose or have something to live for. i just want to end it all and not worry about anything anymore. i work towards nothing. i live for nothing. and i will die for nothing.

ive started to enact my plan. since iâ€™m a minor, i wont have access to many things - even buying medicine will seem suspicious. i look too young to pass as older than 18, and my anxiety prevents me from even thinking of the mere possibility that iâ€™ll be asked to show an id. iâ€™m set on two methods since others seem unreliable and give way to living after the attempt, which is obviously not something i want. i just.. ive given up. and i know that the only way i can get out of this cycle is to die.
