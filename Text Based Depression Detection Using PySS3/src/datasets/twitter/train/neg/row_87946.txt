I need someone to talk toI have spent the last couple of weeks thinking about running away or commuting suicide. I think I'm going to run away from my house tonight. No one ever notices me at school and I am the middle child out of the other 2 that live with me (I have 5 siblings total). I barely ever get any attention when I'm at my house. My dad is a fucking douchebag. He complains about everything but gets pissy when someone confronts him about anything. I don't think anyone would miss me if I left. None of my friends would care. My only problem would be if they found me and brought me home. What would I do then? My dad would pretend like he missed me. My mom and my two sisters would be the only ones that actually would miss me. I can't talk to anyone I know about my hate for everyone and everything. What do I do? I'm 14 if that matters to anyone
