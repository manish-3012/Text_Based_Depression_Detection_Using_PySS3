Thank you to all the people here.Thank you to the people that try and help. The ones who reach out and try to make the difference in another's life when no one else can. You're all amazing people. 

I wish you knew my situation, and I wish someone had some insight to help me. I've looked everywhere and inside myself for a reason to stay. But I'm honestly just miserable and sad every day. I can't shake this empty feeling and this constant anxiety. I don't want to feel like this anymore. 

Goodbye lovely people. Be well and look for light in the darkness. I hope you all find the love and support you're looking for. 

I have no note or will, so I hope somehow my family will eventually see this. 

I love you all, you mean the world to me and it breaks my heart being so far from all of you. Not seeing the kids grow up, or spending time with mom even though I'm so scared that I'll lose her since dad died. I just want peace. Please don't blame yourselves you're my entire existence.

I love you more than I can ever express
