With this, I bid thee farewellI appreciate all the support I've gotten here, but ultimately it was in vein. I am going to take my life and that is that. I've got my method and my note written. However, please do not blame yourselves. This was a decision I had to come to after many many sleepless nights, and not an easy one to come to. Ultimately, there was nothing that could be done and that is the reality of things. I could not be more grateful. You people truly are some of the greats. Goodbye
