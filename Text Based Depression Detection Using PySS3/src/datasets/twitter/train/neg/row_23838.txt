I don't have a reason to live anymoreI try to think of one but I just can't. I'm a burden to everyone around me. I hate myself all the time, the idea of being stuck inside of myself makes me sick. I guess this is one last post or try, nobody really ever wants to hear about me and even if they did I wouldn't want to talk about myself and make myself a burden. But I can't keep pretending anymore.
