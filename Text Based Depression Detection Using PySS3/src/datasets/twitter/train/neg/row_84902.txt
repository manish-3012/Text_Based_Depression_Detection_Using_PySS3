How to Stop ThisI can't stop wishing for the ability to die without much pain to my loved ones, planning out elaborately for a failsafe way even if I try to chicken out, seeing myself dying everywhere- train, buildings, cars, bridges. I visualize it so clearly over and over again. I also have a history of impulsive serious self harm without even making a conscious decision to do it. I just got out of a psychiatric inpatient facility for the ninth time. I realized the last time it is completely pointless- the doctors don't see you long enough to be willing to make necessary changes, and/or overmedicate, then the cycle continues after a little while on the outside. Going in just makes me feel worse while there and especially after getting out. I'm rationalizing things, I've done my research and I realize that my feeling like a burden and desperation put me at higher risk, as well as previous attempt and impulsive decision. I'm trying everything and things just keep getting worse. I'm scared and tired and these thoughts don't go away the next day, they just get worse over time.

I'm not even deciding to die right now, but I have a feeling I will soon due to some random impulse and don't even care. I have a great support system with a therapist and psychiatrists and friends and family. I care about them and continue living for them, but I'm tired of living for others, I want to live for myself. I can't find a reason why though, I hate life and have hated it for quite some time, and the future looks bleak. It's funny, I try to save others but I don't even want to save myself, except for a half assed post on reddit.
