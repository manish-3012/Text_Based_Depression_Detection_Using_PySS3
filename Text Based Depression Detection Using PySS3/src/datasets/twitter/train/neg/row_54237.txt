I think it's just a matter of time at this pointIt might be a few months, it might be 10 years, but it's going to happen.

I've never been diagnosed, but there's no way I don't have clinical depression.  I've always had really bad stretches here and there, but the last few months have been really tough.  A half day or maybe even a full day here and there where I actually feel pretty good, followed by hell for weeks at a time.  I'm practically in tears at the moment, and I feel like punching myself in the head (which I've done multiple times in the past... the only thing stopping me is I hate the way it feels).

I almost went out to the garage yesterday and started up the car.  I've planned it out a few times over the years, but I've really scared myself lately.

I've been trying very hard to improve myself lately... but it's just not happening... been exercising a lot, eating a lot better, but not seeing much weight loss.  Been avoiding porn, been reading up on how to actually approach a woman in real life, but the realities of the dating scene just make me more depressed.  A romantic relationship would be just about impossible anyway, as I'm very sure that I have avoidant personality disorder.

Whenever someone asks for help, I just do it like the sucker I am.  And in return, all I get is contempt.  I know I'm a quiet (very quiet) guy, and everyone thinks I'm weird, but goddammit I'm sick of being treated in this fashion.

I don't know, a lot of people have it worse than I do, maybe I shouldn't complain.  I'm in my 30s already anyway, and it's probably too late to change anyway.

**EDIT:** I've actually felt alright the last few days.  My sincere thanks to those who responded.  I'm going to delete this throwaway account in a few minutes, and I just wanted to let you know that you really helped me out.
