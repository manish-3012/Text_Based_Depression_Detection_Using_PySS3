Does it ever get better?I've been struggling with suicide for the past fifteen years. These past couple years though, my urges are significantly stronger and more frequent to the point that I don't think I'll ever be "ok". 

I've been locked in my bathroom for over an hour and I can't leave, but I'm scared to call a helpline and I don't have any friends or family I feel I can contact.

Is it possible to ever actually get over this mental anguish, or do you just have to accept that some of us have shitty brains that are constantly trying to kill us and make our lives miserable?
