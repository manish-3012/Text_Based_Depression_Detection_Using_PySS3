I cannot deal with the worldI'm done. I've attempted many times before and right now I'm done. I cannot deal with the stresses of life anymore. My ex tried to get me back but she is abusive. My girlfriend now isn't sure we will work out as it's already a 30-45 minute difference between us and she's moving farther away. The best times of my life is when I'm in a psychiatric hospital because then I don't have to worry about the stresses of life. I'm just done I have suicidal thoughts everyday but I keep them hidden as I'm already on the max dose of lexapro and remeron. I'm just done. I'm an alcoholic and recovering coke head and I'm only 18. I've fucked up my life and I'm just done with all the stresses.  Just done.
