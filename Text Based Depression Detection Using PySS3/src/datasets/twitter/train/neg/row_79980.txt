I can't take this anymore...I'm sick of it all... this constant cycle of feeling happy for a short while only to fall back to thinking there's nothing worth living for, of being confused about what to do with my life.
Everything that I've lived for up to this point feels so meaningless and distant to me, my parents, friends, a bright future... I just keep catching myself wishing it would all just end. 
Life is hard, man, and I don't think I want to go through it anymore, but I just can't find the guts to end it... I feel like such a fucking coward, both for thinking of this easy way out, and for not being able to do it.
Add in my constant paranoia about those closest to me, thinking about how they secretly hate me, and I can feel my mind slowly going insane from it all.... 
I can't even cry it out, only bottle it all up and keep it in, it gives me a constant sinking feeling deep inside. I just want it to end, I just want peace and a reason to live
