It's a Wonderful Life?I decided it's time. I can't seem to get better. No amount of friendships or God or love or accomplishments have helped me. It's not enough. Nobody cares... why am I trying so hard to live a wonderful life when it's trash? 

I'm counting down starting today. Not sure if I'll make it to the new year. I'm going to wrap up all unfinished business, take 2 weeks off from work and slip away. I'll do some research first so it's seamless. I'll give an update tomorrow. &lt;3
