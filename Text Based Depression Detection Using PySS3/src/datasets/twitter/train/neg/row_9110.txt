Utterly Despondent and Feel TrappedI have lost the woman I want to marry - - she is now "ghosting" me, and I have almost no way to contact except stalking.  I am nothing short of obsessed about her.

I have a history of anxiety, depression, and alcohol.  I ruminate on suicide constantly.  I just don't have the "guts."

I am talking to a professional but I have never felt so utterly bleak about life.  My nerves ring like bells.
