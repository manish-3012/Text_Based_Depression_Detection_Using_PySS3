Need to distract my mind.I don't know why I feel this way. Probably a breakup I never saw coming and I'm struggling to get over no matter how hard I try. Plus I shouldn't tie my worth into being with someone. I know better than that. 

Still at night on my drive home I fall back into my hole. Which is why I'm here. That hole feels pretty damn deep tonight. I'm pretty good at climbing out of it in the morning but I'm scared one day that I won't. 

Which is why I'm here. I need help staying afloat. Therapy has never worked; they come off as disinterested and boring.

If you're reading this, I miss you and I just want you to acknowledge my existence.
