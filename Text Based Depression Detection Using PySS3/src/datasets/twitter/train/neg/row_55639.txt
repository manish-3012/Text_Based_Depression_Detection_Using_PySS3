Please help meI don't know why i feel so suicidal lately but I do. I can't sleep and I feel so lonely even though I know I have people I can talk too i just feel like it would be no help.  My boyfriend and I fight constantly and I love him so much but I feel like he doesn't love me the same because he always breaks promises that mean so much to me and when he does and I find out i get more and more depressed and so now whether things are going good or bad I can not trust him and I hate myself for that. Also when I need some one to talk too the person I need I am to scared to call, I tell myself its because of the time but I know its because actually Im so scared of how the will view me or treat me after. I don't want to cause anyone more pain so i feel like i should just end it all.. i dont deserve to live anymore in my eyes and I know that isn't how i should be thinking but death just seems so much more peaceful. I don't want to hurt anymore. I know what happiness is and i havent felt it in over a year. I might've waited to long to change my mind set but I need advise on whether it would be a good idea to go through with it all. I dont feel like putting my whole life story on her because their are family issues as well but I just want to be happy... and if thats not possible i can't do it anymore
