My life is a frustrating wastei work for a non living wage.  Iâ€™Things donâ€™t feel like theyâ€™re ever going to get better for me. I want to work i kitchens but itâ€™s all part time hard labor. 

I wish i could buy a used car but i canâ€™t because itâ€™s way too fucking expensive to buy a good one. There are lot of things I wish I could afford.

 I deal with my shitty dad who get offended over the tiny things. I walked in front of him after an argument over not being able to hear his logorrheic instructions on how to do his laundry, he blows up. Heâ€™s spends all of his free time watching trump on msnbc. Itâ€™s probably affecting his behavior but heâ€™s always been reactive.

 My mom doesnâ€™t work and i doubt she ever will again. Low empathy, judgemental, and self involved. This year we found out that she built up 20k in credit card debt. In middle school she managed to rack 100k in debt. I thought their marriage was over. I thought there would be progress towards something better but that was wishful thinking.

Iâ€™m stuck with these two and i hate the majority of moments i have with them. 

i want out. Iâ€™m not ready to commit homicide or suicide but iâ€™m tempted.

I wonder if Iâ€™m destined to just suffer.
