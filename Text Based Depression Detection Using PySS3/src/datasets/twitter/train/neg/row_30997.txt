SchoolSchool straight up triggers my depression and suicidal thoughts. Some days are worse than others, but no matter what it seems like I'm stuck in this perpetual cycle where nothing really changes for the better. The reason I'm studying nursing is because people online said the job security was good. I don't think I ever made a risky decision on my own it was the internet making the choice for me. I'm so done. Even on the really good days I want to end it. I think I will make the leap because I don't have anything left to lose at this point. Wish me luck ! :)
