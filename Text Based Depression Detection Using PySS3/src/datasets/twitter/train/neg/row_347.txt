Suicidal 11 yr oldI'm 31 and my best friend of over 25 years has an 11 yr old who recently tried to kill himself and was later admitted into suicide watch after detailing a plan for a second attempt. My best friend is an incredible person and wants to help but isn't well read or a great communicator. My friend has asked me for help because he knows he's not great at these things and I want to do everything I can to help because they've both already persevered through so much and he's family as far as I'm concerned.

What are the best things I can do to support them? 

What are the best resources for parents with suicidal kids?

How can he best support his son?

Your advice means more to me than you know. Thank you.
