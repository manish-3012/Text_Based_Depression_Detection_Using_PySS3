Another Post, Spoiler ; I'm still a piece of shitI am currently the most depressed I have ever been in my life. I feel worse than I did a year ago when I tried to kill myself. I have started putting my cigarettes out on myself and cutting again after being clean for 8 months. Yesterday I cried so hard I fucking puked. I hate myself. I hate everything I have done to myself and other people. I hate that I feel this way and I hate that I deserve it. I have been asking God for a sign I should kill myself for a while now. Yesterday when I got outside to start walking home from school it started pouring rain. This morning I was told to go home and change my shirt as soon as I got into th building, again it started to pour while I was leaving. I got home absolutley soaked and I think that the rain is God's sign for me.
