I'll finally do it tonightI'm ready. I don't feel worried or sad or anything much really. I just know this is what is right for me. I never asked to be born and I don't think I'll ever be happy with life. I hate being alive. So this is my goodbye. I don't want to alarm my boyfriend or my parents but I still want to let it out. I've made up my mind.
