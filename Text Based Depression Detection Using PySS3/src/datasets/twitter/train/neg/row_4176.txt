I don't know what to do.This is actually the first time I've ever spoken about my feelings. And I feel like I'd rather be judged by a bunch of strangers then all of my friends and family.
I have had depression since I was 14, because I was molested and raped by my sister's husband. 
And I always felt like it was my fault. Maybe I was too attractive as a teenager. So I decided to make myself ugly. I stole weight lost supplements from my mother (she was trying to lose weight) and really increased my work outs at school. (I did gymnastics and fencing as hobbies) so, I ended up losing a bunch of weight. I was 70kgs of normal weight. But I ended up graduating grade 10 around 40kg. Which is underweight for my height. As I got older and tried to be in relationships. My depression would always come back. I never believed my partner's compliments. I always felt ugly. Disgusting. I've never ever cut myself. But I've always wanted to. I've overdosed of medications. Pain killers. Alcohol. And it's all coming back for some reason. I've had severe migrains. The pain killers aren't working. I even tried dancing. It didn't work. I feel so low. I feel so disgusting. I tried taking my own life tonight by throwing myself in front of a car near my house. I'm 20 now. I thought I would be over these feelings. I just need someone to talk to.
