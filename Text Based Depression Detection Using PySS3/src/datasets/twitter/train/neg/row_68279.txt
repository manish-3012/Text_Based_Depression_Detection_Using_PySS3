More I hate myself so goddamn muchThis isn't about sucide but I love this community a lot and needed a place to vent a little on how I feel about myself rn.

Context: I wrote a bunch of messages to ppl on Pinterest about how wild animals aren't pets and such and now I realize I am stupid and wrong.

So yeah that's the gist, basically I'm a stupid idiot who acts to proud and almighty just to be able to never accept defeat because it hurts my pride, my non-existent pride because who am I showing off too? who am I showing I am confident? No one, I am always a coward unless online. So yeah to the ppl who say I don't suck, I really do and I'm sorry you can't see this side of me, because it would be better not to acknowledge me at all and my selfishness.
