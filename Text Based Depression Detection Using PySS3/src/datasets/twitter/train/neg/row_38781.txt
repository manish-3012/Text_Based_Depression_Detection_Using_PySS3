I canâ€™t take it no moreI have been dealing with mental health issues for a long time, Iâ€™m 17 and my last year of school was online and that deteriorated my mental health by a lot. I started to do good for myself by going back to school and trying to make friends and get past my anxiety of it but then COVID hits and Iâ€™m forced back home and all the social skills I worked so hard for are gone. My mom just thinks Iâ€™m fucking with her every time I try to explain it and I know theirs nothing I can do Iâ€™m fucked.
