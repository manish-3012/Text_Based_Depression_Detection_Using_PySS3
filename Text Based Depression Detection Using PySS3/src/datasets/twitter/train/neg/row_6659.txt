The end of a meaningless and destructive life.I  have destroyed my relationships, I have hurt countless people with my issues and my mentality. I am pure darkness, I am the personification of a black hole. I take good things and I sabotage them.  I  could be happy,but something  inside me wants pain and suffering. I will not live after this, life is pain and  people that feel otherwise should enjoy their lives and let my life end. I just want to die, other people are so much stronger than me. I can't live with  the things I have done. Everyone that ever loved me or knew me, ended up much worse for the experience. There is not much to do but to plan.I wish everyone in the world knew me, so they could hate me the way I hate myself. Maybe I am manipulating you now, I have no idea, too far gone.  Nothing worse than natural evil thinking it's inherent good. Goodbye.
