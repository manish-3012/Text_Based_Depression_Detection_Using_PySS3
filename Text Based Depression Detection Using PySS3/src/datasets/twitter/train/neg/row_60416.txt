I'm tired.I have BPD and depression. I'm not medicated or in therapy. I usually have enough will power to repress it and keep myself in check. I tried twice in elementary. No one knew, I tried reaching out to my dad in the last attempt but he yelled at me about jesus and satan. If I didn't have my husband I wouldn't be here. My eyes are bad and they hurt, like something's behind them. I'm tired of waking up. I don't know why I'm here, but I don't really care. I don't think I'll ever make anything of myself. I'm wasting time and money. I'm scared I'll be a financial burden to my husband. I'm scared of all of the bad genetic shit coming my way. I'm angry my parent who have such strong history of illnesses and issues in their families made me. My eyes, my bones, my heart, my skin, my hair, they didn't think oh maybe all of the health our families have suffered could be bad for the kids as they get older?!

Doing it now would just be easy, no one's here that I care about they're all far away. But I don't want to, I just feel like it. I don't have a reason other than I'm just tired of being here and I want a permanent break. No more waking up, no more school, no more staying up to get things done, no more getting up early. I want nothing.
