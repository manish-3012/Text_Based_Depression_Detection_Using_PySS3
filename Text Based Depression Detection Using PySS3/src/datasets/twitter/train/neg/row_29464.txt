Second time here (27/f)This is my second post here. I am unsure if it will be my last. 

There is 1 person tethering me here. Just one. And thats alot to ask of him. 

I met him here. On this subreddit. We have helped each other alot but I cant get the thought out of my head. Why the fuck do I deserve to be the one here. Why couldn't my steobrither have been the one. He deserves it more than me. But this ill ness took him too. 

I know youre going to see this and I am sorry I not stronger. I am over feeling his numbness.

But I made you a promise and I am trying to be brave. 

Maybe its the alcohol or the lack of sleep talking but I am so done.
