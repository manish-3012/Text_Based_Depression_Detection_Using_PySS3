HELP I OVERDOSED ON CHLORPHENIRAMINE AND I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO AND I REGRET ITLast night, I took 3 4mg tablets of chlorpheniramine prescribed by the doctor. Then, when I woke up, I took another which would have made it 12 hours apart and just then I took two. Iâ€™m only supposed to take one a night but I regret what Iâ€™ve done. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s serious because itâ€™s just an antihistamine meant for allergies, but I donâ€™t know if I should do anything. Is there any way I can stop it absorbing?
