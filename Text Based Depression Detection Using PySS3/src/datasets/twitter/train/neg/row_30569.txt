Just not interested in life.This is my throwaway account.  

I'm a middle age male. I'm married. We have sex maybe 3 times per year. I have a dead end job that makes enough money to barely be middle class. I drink 3 nights a week. I can't kill myself because my kids need me. But I have no will to live. My wife doesnt like me.  I'm not sure if I like her.  I'm not sure why I married her. We have very little in common.  

Not sure why I'm posting here. Just need to get these thing off my chest. 

I have a therapist. But I can't bring myself to tell her that I dont like my wife.  I married her for the same reasons that I stuck in many toxic relationships over the years. Because I'm sure no one else would like me.

I'm just sad and lonely all the time.
