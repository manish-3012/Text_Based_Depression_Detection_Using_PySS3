Persistent ideation from a perception of a non optimal life trajectory.Posting on a whim, as a Iâ€™ve been facing a resurgence of suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™ve recently graduated a top university in a field I have interest in. I had to take time off during my education, a result of self medication with psychedelics and stimulants to escape reality, which left me a year behind and resulted in graduating this spring. In light of the ongoing economic depression Iâ€™ve been unable to find work and it feels like a self imposed punishment which I know I could not have predicted. I struggle with suicidal ideation out of laziness, out of a notion of convenience. I recognize this but I canâ€™t shake the thoughts even with the lack of logic. 
I had a successful experience with antidepressants, but stopped two years ago and now may go back. The process of typing this has helped me understand myself and I hope it is appropriate to post it here. I do not mean to diminish the experience of those facing more hardships than myself.
