There's no way I'm going to live more than thisI'm 31A and I'm completely useless. 

I have severe low self esteem and confidence, depression, generalized anxiety, chronic loneliness, trust issues, I'm a "shy quiet person". I have one friend that doesn't give a shit about me and is using me to fulfill his own desires. I studied and worked along a fruitless path and now I'm out of a job. I don't know how to drive, not even how to move around the city in public transport. I'm scared to call over the phone to ask for help, let alone search for a new job. I have not a single useful skill. I only know how to listen but you don't get paid for that. I'm going to die because I don't know how to live. Dying feels natural and correct. I'm living with my parents, narcissistic mother and alcoholic father. I'm scared of everything and everyone. I got his gun and her sleeping pills, they blame each other for their disappearance but don't have the nerve to ask the other. Makes me feel better to know they are in my possession. I'm useless. Im not needed. It's all my fault. Is not going to get better. I don't have time. It's all been for nothing. I don't know how to live.
