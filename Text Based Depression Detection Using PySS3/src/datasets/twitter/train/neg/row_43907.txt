Anniversary of a friendsâ€™ suicide, and all I want is to die but I just canâ€™t handle the guiltI lost a friend one year ago tomorrow and I am so sick of the constant desire to die, I want to honor him by doing it on his day and maybe I can join him wherever he is. 

I have a dad and a boyfriend who I love so much. Besides them, I donâ€™t even think anyone would truly miss me. So many people would just feel so guilty. And I donâ€™t want to leave that behind. 

Part of me is hoping that someone I know will happen upon this post because I just donâ€™t have it in me to communicate what Iâ€™m going through with any of them. I know that they wonâ€™t know what to say or how to accept that Iâ€™ve been feeling this way, and honestly I think I might be less of a burden if I just disappear! 

I even am considering that if I still feel this hopeless years from now, I could tell everyone I know that Iâ€™m taking a trip to Europe or something and I could just dissolve into thin air as far as everyone else is concerned. None of them would ever have to worry about me again.
