I need someone to answer this questionI'm 22, jobless, habe no direction, and no friends because people make me anxious. I've had way too  much drama with people to be able to trust anyone ever again. I don't see a reason for me to continue. I'm so broken that I have problems communicating with people and life is too exhausting. My question is. Why should I not kill myself?
