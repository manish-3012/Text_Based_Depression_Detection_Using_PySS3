I donâ€™t have the strength anymoreHey.
My girlfriend broke up with me in August and the last quarter of a year has been horrible. Every day I feel worse and worse and I feel like I canâ€™t deal with it anymore. She was my lifeline, the only person I truly loved. She randomly ended it over text and gave me a lie as a reason. Sheâ€™s cut all connection and I feel so lost. 

Iâ€™m out of touch with reality, I have no sense of time. I just hurt constantly. My head always throbs from my thoughts about her and what Iâ€™m missing. Hell, I dream about her every night and my soul get crushed when I wake up and realize it was all in my head. 

She said I â€œwasnâ€™t big enough to pick her up and hold herâ€ meanwhile sheâ€™s nearly 5 9 and Iâ€™m still 2 inches taller than she is. And she said she â€œcould do so much betterâ€. This came from a mutual friend and I wish I never heard about it.  I couldnâ€™t believe after all the time I made her laugh and all the time I spent talking to her she could even think of saying that. I swear she spent more time laughing and smiling around me than she did talking. Itâ€™s fucked. She told that same friend that she has no time for my emotions meanwhile Iâ€™m struggling to even keep living. I feel betrayed, lost, alone. 

I texted her two weeks ago after I worked on revising a text for 2 months with the help of friends and all I get is â€œdonâ€™t text me wtf stop.â€ I never did or said anything that would warrant any of this and itâ€™s purely because she lost interest. She was my best fucking friend man, it just hurts. Iâ€™ve talked to specialists at school and even a psychiatrist but nothing helps. I spent my 18th birthday in tears all day unable to move. 

I canâ€™t do this anymore. I just canâ€™t. My best friend and girlfriend left me because of my looks. Itâ€™s beyond fucked. I would do anything to get her back regardless of what sheâ€™s done and said, itâ€™s the only way to keep my head on straight. Otherwise, I donâ€™t see myself lasting much longer. I just canâ€™t do it.
