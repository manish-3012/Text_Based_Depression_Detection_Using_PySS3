Exp date: Mon May 20So last week I decided to put a deadline on ending it. The idea was that I have a handful of things that I want to sort out before heading out. Monday is coming up but I'm behind schedule... My question is, am I missing much from the following list?

To do:
- letter to family 
- letter to roommate (who may find me)
- general letter to friends/acquaintances
- provide log-in credentials to a friend (with a backup in case the first friend doesn't want to do this) for accounts on Grindr etc, as well as contact info of scattered men I'm romantically involved with to inform
- burial instructions 
- list of various debts 
- allocation of property 

Thanks
