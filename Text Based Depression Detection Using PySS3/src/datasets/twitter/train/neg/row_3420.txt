I should take action for once.The holidays are always bad but these ones have been extra brutal. I've done nothing but cry, sleep and eat myself into oblivion for the past two days. Things are too late and I'm too late. 

I need to return someone's sweater. I want to jump in front of a car. I don't know how else to get it done. I really think this is the best option for me. 

It's just never going to get better than this.
