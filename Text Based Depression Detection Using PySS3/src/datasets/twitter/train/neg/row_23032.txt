I just want to be gone already.Iâ€™m about to go to college and all my friends going to different ones with plans just makes me realize I canâ€™t really do anything with my own life. I was good with writing last semester of high school, but I havenâ€™t been able to write ANYTHING good for goddamn months. Thatâ€™s basically my only possible route. Canâ€™t really work that well, i forget things much more than others, Iâ€™m basically dead weight. I have cystic fibrosis thatâ€™s pretty bad and I have like 4 different lung infections that we can only delay. Whatâ€™s the goddamn point of me being around when I feel too tired from all the meds to do anything half the time? Ive tried to make it work, but fuck. It canâ€™t. It isnâ€™t meant to be. I shouldnâ€™t be alive. I really wish I had died when I was born, then I wouldnâ€™t even have to consider this, but oh well.
