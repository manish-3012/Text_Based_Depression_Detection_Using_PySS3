I canâ€™t live without the girl I loveIâ€™m 20 but I love this girl the problem is she hates me we were good friends for six years but I havenâ€™t seen her in two years and I fucked up and told her I loved her but now she hates me and she wonâ€™t talk to me and she doesnâ€™t even think of me anymore. I miss her so much and cry every day but I know sheâ€™ll never talk to me again and I Iâ€™ve just been coping with it by drinking heavily and eating a lot so I figure Iâ€™ll either die from liver failure or a heart attack so why not just kill myself now?
