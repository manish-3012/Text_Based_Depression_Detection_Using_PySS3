Im so done with life.Not only am I literally so unlucky to the point where I defy statistics with unluckiness but every fucking day of my life Iâ€™m tired. I got bloodwork done, completely normal which means its fucking psychological which means I would need to do a sleep study which they wonâ€™t do for people my age because theres for some reason a stereotype that all teenagers are tired and teenagers cant have sleep issues. Im fucking done. My life is so bland and the only things that give me enjoyment are dried out. I just cant fucking do it.
