If the The Purge was real, would you still want it?I think I would action my life off to the highest bidders for the next year round. You pay up front at the end of the current years rounds. I would sign over I life insurance policy to the winners in witch should I die before or during the games the winner is the collector. The high bidder being the one that gets to end my life. 
But there is a twist, I canâ€™t suffer. Or the police wonâ€™t pay out.
