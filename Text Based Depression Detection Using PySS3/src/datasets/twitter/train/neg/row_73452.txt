I don't even know why I even exist.I'm *never* happy. Sure, sometimes my mood lifts but, at this point, I've become so used to feeling depressed that it feels abnormal when I'm happy. I've felt happy in the past, I used to be happy, keyword: used, but even then, there was this voice inside of me that kept telling me that I would be better off dead.
I think you deserve an explanation: I suffer from Purely Obsessional Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and I've had it for pretty much my whole life, and there are simply some thoughts that just won't go away. I remember crying myself to sleep when I was 6 because I couldn't stop thinking about death, and I also remember these thoughts about suicide starting to pop up inside of me when I was about 8, and from that point on, I started hiding my emotions from everybody else, keeping them all in, putting on a facade of happiness for everybody's sake, I became extremely loquacious, I kept talking and talking and playing and being to hide the emptiness that was inside of me, there have been a few periods of pure happiness in my life, but they were pretty few and far between, most of the time I'm sad, and when I'm *really* sad, I'm depressed, there isn't a day where I don't think about taking my own life, I have tried to do that several times, but can never muster up enough courage to actually do so, or always find something that cheers me up, but it's only a "temporary high" that doesn't last very long.
I seriously don't know what to do anymore, I've begun wondering if I suffer from dysthymia caused by my OCD, but even if I had it, I don't know if my parents would let me take medication, or even if the latter would help, no matter what, I can't be happy for as long as a day.
