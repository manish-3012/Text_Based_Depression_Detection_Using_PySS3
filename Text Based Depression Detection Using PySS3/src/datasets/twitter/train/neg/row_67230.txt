I triedI may not have had the hardest life but I definitely never had it easy.

I was basically born into a life that would lead to depression.

I have endured enough.

I have had parents who were physically and emotionally abusive, I have been molested and raped by people in and out of my family.

I grew up only to be hit on and cheated on by multiple partners.

I started coping negatively. Got into some trouble in the public.

I owned it and then began to repair myself, I went to therapy. I educated myself on maladaptive coping.

I went back to graduate school. I graduated.

But the public will not let this go. 

The demon on my back that will never stop haunting me.

I have NO ONE with a genuine connection.

I am alone.

All the work I put in to recover from past traumas is now out the window as I feel depression coming on a midnight train from nowhere.


I was depressed from 13 for over 10 years. I cannot and will not leave to go through that again.

What did I do to deserve this? 

I give up.
