Why bother?Today I thought to myself that thereâ€™s nothing stopping me from going outside, numbing myself with the snow, and slitting my wrists. Humans are constructions of physical phenomena, our minds delude us and our eyes blind us. The only reason we love is because emotional is a useful survival tool for the pack animal. The few things that make us half-decent are tainted, hollow, corrupt. We canâ€™t see that the handful of impressive accomplishments will wither like a trillion planets before and after us. The world is a comedy to those who think and a tragedy to those who feel, and i have the great fucking fortune of being both. Iâ€™m sick of my religious family, my broken school system, my country, my planet, my species.
