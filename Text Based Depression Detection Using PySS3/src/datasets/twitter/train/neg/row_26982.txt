How do you tell someone that youâ€™re in serious trouble if you arenâ€™t supposed to be around anyone?Iâ€™m in trouble, and I donâ€™t know what to do.

I donâ€™t have COVID symptoms, but I could still be a carrier.

I canâ€™t go near anyone, and I think a hospital would be dangerous as well.

All of those germs...

But fuck, Iâ€™m not well.
