I feel an urge to kill myselfFor the past 7 years I have been struggling with suicide thoughts, that started off with me being forced to perform oral sex on another guy as he blackmailed me (I had smoked weed and he threatened to tell the police, he was around 17 and I 12). After the incident, I felt like the loneliest guy in the world, and the only person I told it to spread a rumour that I was gay and wanted it. Because of different reasons connected to how I didn't want the secret to come out, I lost almost all of my friends. I wanted to kill myself, but I didn't do any suicide attempts. It was not until I started Gymnasium (High School equivalent in my country, starting around the age of 15-16) that I started to become happy again and my suicide thoughts began to emerge.

However, I still struggle with suicide thoughts coming back. I still hear voices in my head that I need to die, and they don't seem to disappear. It has even gone so far that I have started making decisions that I now are dangerous for me. A couple of nights ago I ate lots of aspirin and mixed it with wine, and a couple of months ago I went to a rave where I consciously took too much drugs and hoped to overdose. Obviously, I survived, even though I felt like sh** afterwards.

I simply lack a will to survive and I'm starting to believe that I make choices which brings me closer to death. At the time of writing this, I am very aware of the dangers I put myself into, and I know that I want to live. I just moved to a new city to study, and I've gathered a couple of new friends that I've started to love. My mom is only going to live for a few more years and I love my family. I have many friends who love me, and I can't find a legitimate reason for me to die. But still, these thoughts keep popping up.

What do I do? Should I be looking for help, even though I don't seem to have an 'actual' problem?
