I'm seeing black eyed children and I hear them screaming for helpI have really severe depression,last night I almost hanged myself. I feel miserable and suicidal. I don't want  to die,but I also want to. I tried to play some relaxing and fun games to forget about my depression. It doesn't help. I get bullied a lot because of my accent and voice. I sound like a 5 year old on helium. Please.Help me
