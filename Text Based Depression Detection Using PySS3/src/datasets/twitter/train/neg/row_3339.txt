i dont know what do to anymoreusing a new reddit account since im known on a few redidt's

im diagnosed Bi-polar with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder)
i feel alone all the time, and need someone to love. people say im "funny and amazing to be around" but it's honestly just me trying to not show how i feel, i honestly feel empty 90% of the time and get often manic episodes where i just feel like crying and screaming. and a constant feeling like im going to explode. this causes me to be unable to work. i do nothing. i play shitty weeaboo video games and code almost all day, ive recently been partnered with Discord (woohoo!) but i still feel empty even though as of now i have hundreds of "friends" around me, altho i dont feel connected to them at all, and im at the point of wondering if it would be better, if i just didnt exist anymore, if it would be better if  just ended it, no more pain, no more suffering, im kinda just at wit's end and i feel like thats the only option i have at this point, i just dont know what to do anymore

TL;DR depressed cunt who wants to not exist anymore
