I can feel my life coming to a closemy life right now feels like the last few pages of a book and honestly Iâ€™m done trying to hold it off. Tried to kill myself on Christmas Eve, didnâ€™t work, thought itâ€™d at least give me hope, it didnâ€™t. I have zero friends, major social anxiety, Aspergers, and canâ€™t even fucking decide what gender I am. My face is covered in acne scars and the rest of my body is covered in razor bumps and self harm scars. I felt literally nothing when I tried to kill myself, didnâ€™t even cry. The next time will probably be the same. Hopefully it fucking works. Maybe then people might acknowledge my existence. Probably not, though.
