I keep getting kicked while I'm downI've had a lot of terrible and disappointing things happen to me over the course of this entire year. This summer was much worse, I would self-harm and lay in my bed for the majority of the day. Being in college and feeling isolated is the worst. I struggle with meeting new people and being comfortable in my own skin. I feel like I'm in a perpetual state of unhappiness and I don't know how to fix it anymore. Tried therapy, helped temporarily but I'm right back to where I've been for the past year. I'm afraid to go home for the break because going home and doing nothing might exacerbate all my negative feelings and I might do something. It feels like people just don't give a shit about me and keep letting me down and I'm just so fucking tired of it. Why am I always the one that gets the short end of the stick? Why do I have to feel so unwelcome to everything and by everyone? Why can't I just be happy?
