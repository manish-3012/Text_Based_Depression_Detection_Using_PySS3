I'm Fucking Done and I'm Not Even SorryI'm done with two and a half decades of being a Goddamn disappointment to everyone I know.

I'm done with group therapy that accomplishes nothing. 

I'm done with pills that only work half of the time. 

I'm done with this half-dead bullshit Rustbelt town.

I'm done with waking up every morning, disappointed with not dying the night before. 

I'm done with not having the balls to finally just fucking kill myself already.

I'm done with being angry and dejected every waking moment of the day.

I'm done with sparing myself for the sake of others. 

I'm done with not cutting my wrists. 

I'm done with bad luck. 

I'm done with not just putting my rifle under my chin and pulling the fucking trigger. 

I'm done with helplessness. 

I'm done with not drowning myself in the bath. 

I'm done with being an autistic half-nigger tranny piece of trash with an unbreakable victim complex. 

I'm done with vodka being the only thing that makes me feel better. 

I'm done with not walking out into traffic. 

I'm done with being alive. 

I'm. Just. Fucking. Done.
