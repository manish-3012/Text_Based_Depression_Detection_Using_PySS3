I love everything about myself except my looksAmazing how much the course of your life is affected by simply not being ugly. Its not superficial because it affects social status, mental health, relationships, and overall happiness. I see many people claiming they're ugly when they're just overweight or dress poorly or whatever, things they can change. Even then, they're not bad looking, at worst average with insecurity issues. Then there are people who are genuinely ugly by most standards. Its extremely hard not to let this get to you but when you're constantly reminded by others it's impossible not to feel like shit. Most people just don't understand.
