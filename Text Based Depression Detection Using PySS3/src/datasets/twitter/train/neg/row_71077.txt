More of a â€˜goodbyeâ€™I donâ€™t even know anymore blah blah, I canâ€™t talk to anyone and Iâ€™ve done some horrible things. I deserve worse than death to be honest. Everyone is against me and would probably throw a party when I die. Thanks for reading I guess itâ€™s a last stitch effort to talk to someone but then again whatâ€™s the point. Dying at 15 sounds fun anyway ;)
