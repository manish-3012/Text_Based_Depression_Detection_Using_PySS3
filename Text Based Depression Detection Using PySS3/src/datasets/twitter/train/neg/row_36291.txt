So, I can't tell if I actually need help or not. Thoughts?Already just typing this makes me feel pathetic. I'm usually one of those independent types that refuses to admit anythings wrong, and always tries to hide any negative emotion. My friends think I'm one of the happiest people out there. And yes, I do have friends, a social life, great siblings, and a 3.9 GPA with all honors courses. Also, I'm an athlete. On paper, it probably sounds like I have it great.

But, I'm still depressed. Often times it's for no reason, or something petty, and then I become more upset for being so upset at something trivial. It's a downward spiral. Also, I'd never talk about my suicidal thoughts to my friends or family. That'd be like admitting the weakness. 

I think my first contemplation of suicide was 4 or 5 years ago. Ever since then, I've been considering it on and off. I've come up with endless justifications for it in my mind. I've read up on different methods, and finally deciding jumping would be the most effective (relatively quick death, extremely low chance of survival). I've gotten close to trying other things (pills,cutting,alcohol or a combo), but never have just because I'm so afraid of getting caught. If I do it, I'd want it to be foolproof.

Onto the actual issue of why I want to: Well, honestly, why the fuck not? I'm *not* important. Speaking in terms of the universe and galaxies, I have about the impact of a speck of dust. And sure, my friends and family would be sad for a while. Days, maybe years, but they'd forget. Overall, I'm completely forgettable, and my life is just as unimportant as an ant's.
