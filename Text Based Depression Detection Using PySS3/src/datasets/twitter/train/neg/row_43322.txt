tired of lifeeveryday I'm so stressed out the only thing I think about is death. I've tried killing myself when I was younger and failed, which isn't surprising because I'm a failure. I wish I would've been aborted or just died when I was a baby, life is so shit there's no point in living. I buss tables and barely make ends meet. between my car note insurance and whatever I pay my parents for rent I barely have left over. they're asking for me to pay more of the mortgage but I don't have the money. to top it off I got into an accident the other day and it's my fault so now I have to pay my deductible and my rates will go up. I can't afford school and don't have the time because I work 6 days a week and work side jobs whenever I can. what is the point in life is all you do is work and then get screwed over. I wish I could just kill myself. I don't know why I can't just do it. it's probably because I'm a failure I can't do anything.
