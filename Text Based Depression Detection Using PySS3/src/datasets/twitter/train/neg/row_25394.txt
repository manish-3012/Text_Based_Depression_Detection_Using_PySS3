Just die alreadySo tired of this all. Thoughts in my need to stop. I'm almost 30 and they've been here since I was in my early teens. I'm on meds they make me feel blank except the thoughts. The thoughts are always there.

I'm unhappy in my living situation but I can't change it I have nowhere to go. I love my fiance I just hate that hes poly and has a wife and girlfriend.

I hate this house we have roaches they're terrible and no one helps clean.

I hate the memories of all the sexual abuse and trauma I went through.

I hate every therapist who focuses on my now instead of my past to help me get through that shit.

I'm tired of being alive.

I hate my fiance keeps my pills locked away so I cant take them.

Just let me die already dammit.
