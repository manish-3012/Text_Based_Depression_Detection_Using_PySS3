Emotions in wordsLife for me has become a race against time it feels right now as if my world is crashing around me I'm trying to save myself with every fabric of my being, but pride has consumed me I am too afraid to ask for help so I vocalize my depression in unhealthy ways that pushes everyone I have away from me. My coping mechanism aren't the best I'm trying I really am but it's never enough I can never satisfy my own happiness or lack thereof so I do the same things day in day out I pour my soul into my work which ultimately leaves me with this empty hollow feeling inside, it seems as if everything that I have ever done has been in vain against myself my mind craves the idea of suicide yet it hangs on why, I don't understand whom or what I have to live for?
