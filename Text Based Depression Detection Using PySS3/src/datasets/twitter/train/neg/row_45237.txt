Visiting my sister at the beachAnd I want to badly just to float away. I want it to look accidental. Im so embarrassed and ashamed at what Iâ€™ve turned into. I am a leech and I have no one. Iâ€™ve never been more ready in my life. I dont believe in change, I dont believe this will â€œget betterâ€ because no matter how much Iâ€™ve tried, I still cant get there. I cant even get to contentment. I am miserable and Iâ€™m looking for reasons to live and canâ€™t find any.
