I am an assholeI may be overreacting but I'm feeling really guilty for a thing that I have done and it only hurt me thankfully, but coming back and seeing the responses it is clear that it's all my fault, and sometimes I think about the future and how I'm a failure at everything I do, and I can see I will never succeed at anything, no one takes me seriously and I'll I want is to be dead. I wish I could have the strength to end it all already, but I'm pretty sure the courage I need isn't too far. I'm sorry if this is messy, I'm not really in a good place right now
