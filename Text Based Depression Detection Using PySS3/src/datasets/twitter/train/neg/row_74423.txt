I can't.I am suicidal constantly, and I can't deal with it anymore. My mom hates me, my dad is dead and her new boyfriend is an asshole. She doesn't believe the doctors when they say I have clinical depression and thinks it's an act. What's worse is when I was admitted for making and attempt on my life, she said it was a ploy just to get out of school for a week. She is isolating me from all of my friends and everything she promised me she doesn't come through on. She lies to me constantly and I am stuck here. I know it sounds like I'm just panning the blame off to someone else and I'm not this is just the reality of what I live in. Two states were called in to investigate her, one for neglect the other for mental and emotional abuse and they said to just try to make it till your 18. (I'm 17 for reference) I know it's not that far away and I should just get over it but if I would I could. I'm honestly scared of myself and what I might do. Every time I try to get away from her she takes it away from me as well.
