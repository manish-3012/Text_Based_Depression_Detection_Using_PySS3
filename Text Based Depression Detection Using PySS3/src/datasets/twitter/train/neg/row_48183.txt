I think Iâ€™m really doneIâ€™ve made a couple posts here before, I think my first was 2 years ago. Iâ€™m 19 and heavily addicted to gambling. Iâ€™m currently living in the Walmart parking lot in my car, with about 40 miles left worth of gas, in 90 degree heat. I havenâ€™t eaten in 2 days, and I have $0 to my name, both of my bank accounts are overdrawn. I owe $3000 to my sister whoâ€™s currently deployed in the middle of the ocean. My aunt stole $4200 from me off a lease agreement. I donâ€™t have anyone to blame, I put myself in this parking lot. 

My check posted at 3:32 pm, and I had it deposited into ethereum, and lost it ($908) by 3:55 pm. I donâ€™t have any family to go to, Iâ€™m burning up in my car (itâ€™s 90 degrees currently), my stomach is in pain, and Iâ€™m done. 

Yes, I know this particular situation will get better, I know this is only temporary blah blah blah. But I also know that Iâ€™ll have these feelings again, probably tomorrow, probably the day after that, and probably next weekend as well. If I survive this day, how many more can I take? Whatâ€™s the point? I know you guys see a lot of emotional, in the moment posts; but Iâ€™m not sad or mad or anything. Iâ€™m just empty. I felt sad when I was 12-13 etc. I donâ€™t feel anything anymore, I havenâ€™t felt â€œaliveâ€ or â€œawakeâ€ in 2 or 3 years now. I feel so alien, so disconnected. I just want it all to go away.
