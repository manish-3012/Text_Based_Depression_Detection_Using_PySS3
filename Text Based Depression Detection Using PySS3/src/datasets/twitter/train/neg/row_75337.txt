Don't want to face sexualityMy sister is out now, and I'm so proud of her, but I've been hiding this forever and I wanted to just keep on hiding it forever. But I get all weird when I talk about her. I don't want people to think I don't accept her, because I do. I just don't accept myself. I don't want to. I don't want to come to terms with it. I honestly just want to die. I would rather die than deal with this.
