I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m aliveI feel like I donâ€™t have a purpose anymore. Iâ€™m a 16 yr old female in high school. Iâ€™m failing like four classes and Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m gonna get held back and idk what Iâ€™m gonna do with my life. I lost my virginity a few days ago and it was really disappointing and made me hate myself. I feel like I was just brought on this earth to have sex and make children and die. I feel like a sex object. Iâ€™m not passionate about anything and Iâ€™m feel like a failure in life. Iâ€™m dating a guy thatâ€™s way too old for me and heâ€™s like the only person I have as a support system right now and I feel like I canâ€™t even talk to him. My mom hates me and my friends donâ€™t really care about me. This world is scary and Iâ€™m tired of being alive just getting out of bed is hard for me and Iâ€™m overwhelmed.
