i really want a cat so i can live for something .so like iâ€™ve been wanting a pet for so long . literally since i was really really young but my apartment doesnâ€™t allow dogs . as i grew older , my mental
health issues started getting worse so i got a psychiatrist and i had the decision to get a therapy dog because my apartment allows therapy dogs . but at the last moment , i decided i wanted a cat instead because 1, they match my energy more and 2, itâ€™s less stress with my apartment building staff . i really want a kitten because iâ€™m very suicidal nowadays and i just need something to live for . problem is , first of all , kittens are so expensive and my parents donâ€™t have that type of money (1.5k-3k) . second of all, my dad is now saying no because apparently thereâ€™s â€œno room in the apartmentâ€ when there clearly is . and heâ€™s complaining about fur being left around WHEN IM LITERALLY GOING TO CLEAN IT . he doesnâ€™t clean the house AT ALL and my mom has to, so why is he so concerned? i donâ€™t think im going to be able to get a cat and im really really upset and iâ€™m crying right now. does anyone have any advice they could give me ? iâ€™m really desperate :(
