Unsure if I'm suicidal or asking for helpI constantly have suicidal thoughts that drive me insane. I've been depressed for years but have never tried to kill myself before. Now feels worse than ever before and the idea of Christmas and new year fills me with dread. I have a vague plan of how I might attempt suicide soon, but the thought strikes me that I'm not sure I 100% want to die (though I definitely do to some extent), I also think an attempt would get me more help. The conflict over what I am planning,cand why I might do it, is confusing....anyone else relate?
