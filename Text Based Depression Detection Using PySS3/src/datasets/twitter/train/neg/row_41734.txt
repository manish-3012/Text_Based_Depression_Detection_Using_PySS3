They won't tell you that it just gets worseYou get older, fatter, uglier - stuffed to the brim with uselessness and nihilism like an overcrowded graveyard. You end up unable to do anything but scroll through the empty screen, clicking twice on people who will always be better than you, going through the weekend cycle of deleting the app then downloading it again then deleting it then... it doesn't make a difference. Why doesn't it make a difference? Why can't I feel anything but the empty hunger inside my mind? Why can I feel everything all at once, all the time? This existence is painful. I live in this body like a malignant tumour; feeding off the good around me - worthless and evil. This existence is painful.
