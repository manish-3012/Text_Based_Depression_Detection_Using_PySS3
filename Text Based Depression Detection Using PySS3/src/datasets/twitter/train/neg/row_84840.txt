Mood fluctuation and falling apartI didn't realize how badly I've been slipping into the pattern of fluctuating between extreme highs and extreme lows in the past few months. As of late whenever I get the chance to speak to my friends or family I feel really happy and satisfied with my life, I know everything will be ok, but as soon as I get by myself or have an interaction that comes off as awkward it all falls apart. 

I was prescribed medication today to help prevent these fluctuations but due to insurance not being able to confirm the prescription before end of day I'm not going to be able to get it until tomorrow. Since then I've had my regular shifts as the pattern follows, I had one serious breakdown during the day but was able to be brought out of it by speaking to family, but now since it's the middle of the night and no one is available I have fallen into a pit.

There are 5 hours before I have to wake up for work and I want to end my life.
