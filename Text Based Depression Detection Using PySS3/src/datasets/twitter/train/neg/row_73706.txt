Accepting that this is how itâ€™ll end and that itâ€™s just a matter of time.I had a manic episode yesterday which hasnâ€™t happened in a really long time, though I think about killing myself everyday. I donâ€™t like who I am, the things Iâ€™ve done and said. Nothing makes me happy anymore and I spend all of my time alone. I feel existentially homeless, New York City is eating me alive and I just wanna flip the switch. I canâ€™t stop thinking about how fucked up our world is, the irreversible damage weâ€™ve done to the environment, the corruption and greed, the atrocities committed every day. I stole a pair of fabric scissors from work about a year ago, no particular reason other than they were there and the weight of them was oddly comforting. Theyâ€™ve been hidden in my dresser until yesterday, I crawled out of bed and sat on the floor, sobbing and squeezing them, adjusting my grip every few seconds. I have this thing where sometimes Iâ€™ll be falling asleep and I feel like I want to stab myself in the chest, or right below my rib cage, with what Iâ€™d imagine to be those scissors. Not every night and usually after something off mightâ€™ve happened, but intrusive nonetheless. I was at a mall recently and looked down over the ledge of the 4th floor and immediately envisioned jumping off of it, all while having a lighthearted conversation with a coworker.  I feel so much shame for things that Iâ€™ve done, things that people have done to me. I didnâ€™t ask for life, I didnâ€™t ask for any of this. I know I need to see a psychologist and should probably be medicated. I just donâ€™t see the point in it anymore. None of this is real and my life is meaningless in a world of billions of people in an infinite universe, this is all so fucking dumb I canâ€™t even articulate it anymore. Not killing myself tonight but god damn did I come close to it yesterday.
