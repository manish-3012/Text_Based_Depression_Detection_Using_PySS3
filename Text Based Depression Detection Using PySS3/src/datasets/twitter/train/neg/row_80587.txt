Tired.I cant believe my classmates are being petty and rude at me just because I arrive late at class or because I miss some classes. I never talk to them or acknowledge them and somehow they have an issue with me. WTF. Iâ€™m literally minding my business. And  I be having suicidal thoughts everyday now, every minute, and I canâ€™t fucking sleep and Iâ€™m fucking stressed but these dummies are acting all weird with me just because. Iâ€™m disappointed in people and honestly whatâ€™s the point of living if I gotta by idiots like that? 

I canâ€™t talk about my feelings in general because people will just assume the worst, that I am immature, that Im faking it, that I want attention, that Iâ€™m doing the victim, that Iâ€™m dramatic. I am sick and tired of being surrounded by negative, vile people like that who are no good for me. I know I am responsible for my own happiness however itâ€™s really hard going forward when you are extremely alone and lonely, when like 95% of people that met you either resent you or donâ€™t care about you. It hurts. I am hurting and itâ€™s valid. I am hurting and no one knows, and even if they know, they wonâ€™t help me. Because people like me donâ€™t deserve to be helped, right? I just wanna start over and move on but I canâ€™t. 

I feel like giving up
