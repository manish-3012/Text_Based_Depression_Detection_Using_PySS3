Hi. I'm new here.I'm new to reddit, at least as a member. I signed up because I read about this sub. I don't know if I'm any different from anyone else who posts here. I don't really have a lot to complain about is the truth.

I'm a reasonably successful professional. I've been doing it for over 20 years now. I've got a house, I've got a business (not a hugely successful one, but that's nothing unusual), I've got a wife, and I'm in pretty good health. And I'm numb.

It came on a couple of years ago. It was this creeping malaise, at first, though the truth is that it's been with me since I was a teenager. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was about 19 years old, but it's never been anything I've acted on. Never made a serious attempt.

Imagine the first time you ever ate ice cream. It was the best thing that ever was. Or maybe the first time you ever sledded down a hillside. Or threw a perfect curve ball. Whatever. Imagine that thing that was the best ever, the first time it happened. Now, imagine that thing having no effect on you, at all, years later. All the ice cream, all the sledding, all those perfect curve balls--they all leave you empty.  The ice cream tastes like nothing; the sled barely seems to move, and the curve ball just doesn't matter, anymore. That's where I'm at.

I know I'm not supposed to look at external stuff for validation, but I don't think I'm doing that. But, I look inside and see an empty vessel. The truth is that I just don't care anymore. It's not that dying sounds particularly good to me, but living doesn't have much appeal, at all. I'm starting toward high-risk behaviors (don't ask), and I have to wonder if it's just because I'm trying to feel something.

Before you say "go get counseling," I actually tried that.  I figure my symptoms are fairly classic for depression, but I actually had a psychologist tell me that I'm normal. If this is normal, I don't want to be normal. If this is normal, I don't know that I want to be.
