After 3.5 years of headaches I'm pretty much done3.5 years ago, at age 18, I had eye surgery, which didn't go according to plan, ever since then I got chronic headaches. Which completely fucked up my life. The normal level of headaches I normally have, are bordering on painfull and distracting. Making it difficult to pay attention to lectures at uni or conversations. Doing anything remotely busy, like reading, computer work, or crowds makes the headaches much worse, to the point where i am just crying of pain. This has only become worse over the last year and im reaching my ending point. Even typing this my head pains me. I have already given up on doing anything for uni and pretend to my parents im busy. Ive already  been shutting out friends, a couple know im not doing well but i doubt they know just how bad it is. 

Coming wednesday i have an appointment at a pain clinic but im doubtfull if that will do anything. So for the last month ive been debating to just end it. The only thing just stopping me is that appointment and the enormous sadness i will cause to my parents and grandmother. I already got a few ways figured out, but am hesitant. 

I am just tired and want to get away from headaches
