I wish my anxiety was gone and I was happy againI was still extremely anxious as a little kid, but I was never depressed to the point where I wanted to kill myself. 

I wish that one day I could just be happy again. I fucking wish that depression didnâ€™t exist. Feeling depressed, suicidal, and anxious at the same time is a living nightmare that I would never wish on my worst enemy.
