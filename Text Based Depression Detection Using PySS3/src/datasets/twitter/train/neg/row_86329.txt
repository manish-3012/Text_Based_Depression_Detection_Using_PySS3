I attempted suicide and no one caredIt didnâ€™t work. I tried so hard and pushed down on that belt with as much force as I had in me, but I just wouldnâ€™t pass out. Partial suspension hanging is supposed to be easy, yet Iâ€™m so incapable I couldnâ€™t even kill myself right.
Nevertheless, I was found, with my head pressed hard into the noose. And nothing happened. No police, no ambulance- nothing. A call was made to my therapist, on the emergency line, and all that was said is that I should be kept an eye on- and that was it. 
Above all Iâ€™m just so angry that Iâ€™m not dead. Thatâ€™s all I want and I canâ€™t have it now. Everythingâ€™s been taken away: my blades, my belt, my necktie I had made into a noose. I canâ€™t escape anymore and I hate it. Iâ€™m being monitored 24/7 so I know now that thereâ€™s no way out. All I want is to die. Iâ€™ve never felt this terrible before. And worst of all- no one cares.
