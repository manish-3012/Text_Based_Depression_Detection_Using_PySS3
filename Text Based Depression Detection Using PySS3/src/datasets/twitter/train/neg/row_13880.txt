Thoughts of Killing myself... I lay here in the dark contemplating death. My SO is on the couch because she's mad at me for watching a porno today.
After she caught me she started to accuse me of cheating and then she left. A meltdown ensued, I've got bipolar disorder type 2 and I've had  major depression for the last 5/6 years. I struggle with it every day, I take meds everyday for it and sometimes it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. She called me "the problem" today and it just hit really close to home I guess....I wanted to slit my wrists earlier but I didn't because I'm a pussy which only makes me feel more worthless... idk if any of this makes sense anymore I just really don't know what to do and suicide is starting to looking like a really good choice again... please help me...
