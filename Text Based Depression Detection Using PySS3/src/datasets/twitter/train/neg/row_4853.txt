I keep doing self destructive shit, and it keeps working.Just tell me you're struggling too. That even though I'm here, sitting alone in the dark, that I'm not alone. You're sitting somewhere too. Fighting. 


I push and I push and I push and I end up with nothing. I'm trying my best. I'm doing everything I can. But it's never enough. My depression is affecting my relationships. I'm miserable to be around so no one chooses to be around me. I'm so lonely. I want desperately to die.


I don't want to keep trying. Every effort I make towards a healthy life exhausts me further. I have no purpose. I have no will. I'm living purely on my obligation to family. Only breathing because they told me they don't want me to kill myself.  But they don't know how to help me. They don't know how to fix me, or how to make me feel better. How to make me feel like living.


At some point, shouldn't they understand how much pain I'm in and allow me to die? To set me free?
