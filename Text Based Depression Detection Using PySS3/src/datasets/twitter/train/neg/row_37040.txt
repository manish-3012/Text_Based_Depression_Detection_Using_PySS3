I'm just so aloneI have no real friends to speak of.  I went to a co-worker's house today and he and his friends all got drunk and talked about stuff and laughed.  I can't drink because I throw up after 2 drinks.  

I'm already a quiet dude and alcohol which could have helped me socialize more is unavailable to me.  It's a fucking cruel joke.

One topic they talked about were girls that they've fucked before, and from the sounds of it they have plenty of sex.  I haven't been laid in fucking months and the last time I got laid was just one time to an equally desperate girl.

Apparently one of my co-worker's friends has a huge dick.  That got brought up in conversation.  I'm fucking below average myself.

Just going over and hanging out made me realize how shitty and alone my life really is.  I don't have girls who are just down to fuck, I don't have a huge dick, I can't drink and laugh and have a good time.  I'm tired as shit all the time.

I'm not having fun in life, I don't enjoy anything really.  I just work to survive and survive to work.  There's no point in a shitty existence like that.
