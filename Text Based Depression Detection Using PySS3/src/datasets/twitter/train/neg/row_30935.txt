What a jokeIâ€™m a 19M. I called the hotline. I worked up the courage after not telling anyone. Nobody has known about how Iâ€™ve felt since 6th grade. I never wanted to burden anyone with my own problems and emotions. My first thoughts were even before 6th grade. Thatâ€™s just when it really started to hit. I called the hotline and nobody even answered for an hour and I just gave up. This is a new low. I havenâ€™t cut in some time but damn it felt good tonight. Long sleeves for work tomorrow I guess.
