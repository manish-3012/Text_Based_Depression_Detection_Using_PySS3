Why live tho?I travel all over the country and work 60+ hours a week to make a couple of old men rich so they can brag about it. 

I was raised to be totally dependent on the rest of society (just like everyone else), so the money I have left after the government taxes me is used to pay rent (over half my paycheck) and to barely scrape by. I can't believe how much money my health insurance costs.

I have no friends. My mom actually said she'd be OK if I killed myself. I have no other family that cares.

All I do is work, and then I go to Walmart because that's the only groceries I can afford and I watch ladies with 5 kids use food stamps to pay for more groceries than I could eat in 3 months.

The harder you work, the less you get. I fucking hate all of this shit. Is that all life is? Bust your ass to pay for other people's laziness?

I'm so tired all the time. I just want to be done. Fuck this world. Goodbye.
