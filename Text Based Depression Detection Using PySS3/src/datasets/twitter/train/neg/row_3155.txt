Captain goes down with the ship.I had a major fuckup at work today. I caught a power line with a dump truck and caused fire. I jumped from the truck once it caught on fire, but ,for a moment, I considered staying in the truck to let myself get engulfed in flames instead of fleeing like a coward. Everyone says that they are glad that I'm ok, but I'm not glad. Like a captain, I'm ultimately responsible for what happens, and if not for the fire department showing up on time, I would have destroyed the business that I was dumping at, and the jobs there. I have no dignity left. I'm a fucking dolt and a walking hazard it seems, and I feel hard pressed to continue my life.
