How many of you are atheists/theists? And how does it shape your views on suicide?I just wanted to know. I was a very religious person (Muslim) but decided to leave and not having religion at all. Now I'm an atheist and it made my views on death and life rather nihilistic. But on top of that it brought relief to my fear of eternal punishment in the afterlife. I must say that changing my beliefs did not make anything better nor did it make it worse. This is not an attempt to change one's belief, but I'm curious in how debates on suicide go within the group of people with beliefs and no beliefs.
