I am only alive for my parents, brother, cat and dog. Iâ€™m pathetic.Who else is only hanging on so they donâ€™t cause other people pain? I do not want to be alive anymore. But if I kill myself, it would destroy my mom and I canâ€™t imagine inflicting that kind of pain onto her. My dad thinks Iâ€™m a huge fuck up, but he would be sad I think. My brother would be sad. My dog and my cat wouldnâ€™t understand and would miss me, and it makes me sad just thinking about them being like that. My boyfriend would probably be relieved that Iâ€™m gone.... he wouldnâ€™t have to listen to all of my problems anymore. And everyone else simply wouldnâ€™t notice at all.
