How do I tell a suicidal person i cannot be around them anymore?I've been friends with a girl for a couple of months and she's been in the hospital for multiple suicide attempts. Before you start calling me a bad person, I was diagnosed with depression about a year ago and I feel like I can't take care of both of us at the same time. Whenever I'm starting to feel slightly better, she reminds me of how shit life can be and even though she's a great person, I can't be around her any longer. It's unhealthy for both her and me but I have no idea how to tell her.
