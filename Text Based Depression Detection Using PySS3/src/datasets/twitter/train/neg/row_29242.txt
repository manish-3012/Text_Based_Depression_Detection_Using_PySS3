I don't know if you can, but I need helpI have been struggling with depression for some time and I am at the end of my rope. I can't do it anymore. I feel completely worthless, alone, and unlovable. I have nothing to look forward to in my life, and every time I try to reach out, all I get is "Get a grip, you're a grown woman". There is no one I can turn to and I don't see the point anymore. I can't do it another day...
