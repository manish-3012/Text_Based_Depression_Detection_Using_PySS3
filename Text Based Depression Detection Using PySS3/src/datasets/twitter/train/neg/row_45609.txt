Accepting death?I've posted on here a few times (see [my previous posts](http://www.reddit.com/user/unsoothedsoul/submitted/)).  I quit my job almost 10 months ago.  When I did, I basically had the intention of blowing all my money and then killing myself.  I didn't go on a massive spending spree, but it still applies.  I never had any intention on applying for another job.  I don't think I will, either.

I'm on two medications right now.  One that's a mood stabilizer (Lamictal) ; it doesn't seem to be doing anything.  The other (Vyvanse) is to treat ADD.  The first few days I was on the latter, I got energy and felt focused.  I even was somewhat productive.  It didn't last.  I don't think any medication will help me.  I've just come to the conclusion that it's me.

I keep thinking about how I should just accept death.  Since I quit my job, I've used up 2/3 of my savings.  I know I don't have much money left, but I don't think I have any intention for getting a job.  I realize I did this to myself.  I'm not even sure why I'm writing this.  I keep going over these thoughts.  With no work, I can't live.  That's what it comes down to.  I have no intention on working, so I don't have any options left.  I'm starting to get chills from writing this, so I guess I'll end here.
