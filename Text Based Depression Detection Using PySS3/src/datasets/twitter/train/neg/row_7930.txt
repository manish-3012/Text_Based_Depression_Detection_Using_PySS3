Is there any international free service for counselling/someone to talk to?Life has been quite bad lately. But I don't want to keep complaining/whining to people around me. Some of them have complained about it too.

A quick search showed no such free service in my country. Its not that I'm not willing to pay but....I kinda don't want to get tracked down
