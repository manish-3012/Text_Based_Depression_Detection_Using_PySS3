I'm scared I'll kill myselfI've been living with depression for five years and it's getting worse. I've talked to my therapist and she thinks it would be best if I went to a psych ward.
She doesn't want to talk about my suicidal thoughts (although I've told her that I'm very afraid of them) and told me that it's beyond her abilities to help me.

I've been committed to a psych ward twice and it did not help me. They just gave me meds that made me feel like a zombie and treated me like a guinea pig. I won't repeat that.

Everyday feels like there's less and less hope and I'm really scared. I don't have close friends with whom I can talk nor family.
