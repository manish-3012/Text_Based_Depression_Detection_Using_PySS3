all I want is it to be dead. that is all Iâ€™ve been wanting for years. I just want it to end. I am so god damn tired.I just want to die. death seems like the only achievable thing. I literally just want to die. I want to die. I wish someone would rape me so I would have to do it. I wish someone would just fucking shoot me in the head. Iâ€™m so goddamn tired. Iâ€™m so tired. Words canâ€™t explain how fucking tired I am. I just want to be killed for the love of god. I want to be killed. Is that so much to be asked for? being alive is tortures to me. I donâ€™t want to be face another day. I donâ€™t want to wake up tomorrow. I donâ€™t want to wake up tomorrow . I donâ€™t wanna do this anymore. make it fucking stop. someone please end it for me.
