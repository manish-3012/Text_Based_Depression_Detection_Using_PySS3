The Indian lifestyle makes me feel stuck or trappedFor me, itâ€™s specific to parenting.


I feel like the community aspect of my culture has been taken to such an extreme hat I have been deemed nothing more than a poster child. A trophy for my parents to show off to other families like itâ€™s some kindergarten show and tell.

â€œOh my kid got the presidents awardâ€ or â€œmy kid got a 1600 on SAT and 32 on ACTâ€ â€œmy kid did 4000 hours of volunteer service and got accepted into Princeton!â€ â€œOh yeah? My kid is getting a bioengineering degree at Harvard!â€

Of course Iâ€™m exaggerating to an extent but you get the point. Such behavior leads to many parents setting high (and I mean high) expectations for their kids such as achieving a near-perfect report card as a high schooler taking college-level classes. To achieve this, parents attack verbally when failing to meet these expectations, or they constantly compare you to your peers and ask â€œwhy canâ€™t you be like them???â€ Which only leads to a resentment towards that peer, or they try to distance you from a social life and divert all the time in the world into studies and books and education and tests and college stuff. Just to name a few.

Itâ€™s been difficult to explain to my American friends this unique situation and I still feel like they donâ€™t get it. The only advice Iâ€™ve ever gotten is to â€œjust waitâ€ to move out and go to college and you can go NC or LC. Iâ€™m doing that rn but God it just gets harder and harder the more I try to put up with this. 


My parents are also completely dismissive of mental health problems like depression or anxiety, as â€œoh your problems are all rooted to that phone of yours and constantly talking to your friends when you could be studying insteadâ€ or â€œyou just need to put in the work to succeed and then youâ€™ll be happyâ€ and itâ€™s like yeah that sounds great but I want to get a therapist. 


It feels like abuse but not to the extent that it is reportable. I donâ€™t feel good about myself and I donâ€™t think a parent-child relationship should be like this. I get respecting your elders but not to the detriment of my own needs. I get that my parents house and feed me and stuff but this should be a two-way street and Iâ€™ve been trying for years and years to please my parents but to no avail. Rather, it feels hopeless and like Iâ€™m walking on eggshells. My grades are slipping and I donâ€™t know what to do.
