I don't know.I know that I'm young and I have so much to live for and all that shit that they tell you, but in all honesty I will probably end up living a terrible mundane life in some sort of office, and my contribution to anything in this world will be minimal. I am so tired of waking up each morning an plastering on this fake smile each day and making everyone else happy. I am sick and tired of having to be alive and having the stress of high school and depression. I have considered suicide and do contemplate it everyday, even fantasies about it and how lovely it would be to just go to sleep and not have to wake up ever again. I don't know really what to do any more.
