No futureIâ€™m 22, living off of family at the moment because I flunked out of college due to mental health shit. Itâ€™s ironic I guess, because I used to get straight Aâ€™s in high school. They set such a high bar for me. Now Iâ€™ve disappointed everybody. 

Iâ€™m scared to even be around people for long periods of time, partly because Iâ€™m socially inept, partly because I just canâ€™t concentrate and start daydreaming and making weird expressions to myself after ~5 minutes. Not to mention I keep having thoughts that people are conspiring against me, trying to poison me etc.

Iâ€™m not afraid of work, but I am afraid of having to be observed for hours on-end. Iâ€™m scared of people. The only thing worse than the place I currently am would be an institution, and I can say from experience they treat you like cattle and you come out even more hopeless. 

I honestly think thereâ€™s no use for me and I should work up the fucking courage to kill myself. I just donâ€™t know how without the possibility of failure or being in extreme physical pain.
