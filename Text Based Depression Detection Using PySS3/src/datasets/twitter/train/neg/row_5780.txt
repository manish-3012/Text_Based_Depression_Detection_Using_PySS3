Could use someone to talk to.27m here, I've posted in the sun before but I'm an Army and Army reserve vet who deployed to Afghanistan about 6 years ago. That's definitely the reason for my PTSD which I'm okay with and thankfully know good coping skills, but lately I've just been so depressed. It's so fucking draining and I keep coming to the point in my mind where suicide is the answer just to make it stop. In the past it was hard for me to cry but now I cry almost every night. I still have close friends where I'm originally from and still live, but now I don't know what to think. It makes me feel like I'm toxic. It seems like I'll either try and make plans and people can't or don't want too, or when I am. Invited to do something, it's going out to the bars. Which I enjoy, I just know I shouldn't drink at this time, it just makes me feel worse. J normally love being social, but lately I could care less. This has effected my appetite, sleep and social life and I am just so fucking done with all of it. Despite all of that, I really love this sub because of how comforting It is to be able to relate. Yeah I'm also in therapy and on meds, but sometimes just talking to someone who gets it feels.. well really helpful.
