Held on too longI've thought that after 40 years things would get better. The reality is they don't. Ive come to my witts end and I'm finally ready to let go. Ive lived this life long enough to see that things just get worse. Ive lost family and friends, those that remain I've pushed away. I havent had one successful or normal friendship or relationship in my life. Ive loved and never been loved back. Ive lost my kids my family my friends the love of my life . Im empty and alone. I wake up in pain every day. Emotional and physical pain. I just feel like ive had enough.
