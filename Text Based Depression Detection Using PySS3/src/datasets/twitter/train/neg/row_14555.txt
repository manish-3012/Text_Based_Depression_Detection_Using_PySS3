I feel like I can't take it anymoreThis year has been the worst year of my life, everything has completely fallen apart. I can't find work, my fiance has left me and the hours of therapy I have done have barely helped.

My ex fiance messaged me on the day before Christmas to tell me she was seeing someone, she says it was out of respect but I don't know how. Now she has unfriended me and cut communication.

This year has broken me and I have been fighting the urge to cry almost constantly. I've cried so many tears.

It just feels like it's the end of my rope, and I'm currently at a place where my family won't come across my body, which was one of my biggest fears. I don't know if I'm strong enough to keep fighting
