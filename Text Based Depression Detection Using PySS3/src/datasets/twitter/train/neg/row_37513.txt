I don't understand why I hate myself so muchI seem to have 0 self esteem and I'm just like that always. People feel like it's easy to use me and I feel paranoid about relationships because of past negative experiences regarding people. I don't know if I can go on like this. In situations like these, I feel like it's easier to just disappear.
