Hello! Iâ€™m doing it today. Salutations. My name is Rosy, and Iâ€™m 13 years old. I have been on this sub many times. I have a knife, and I know basic anatomy. I havenâ€™t done all the things Iâ€™ve wanted to do on my bucket list, but at this point I donâ€™t care.

 I have OCD and Iâ€™m on the autism spectrum. Thereâ€™s no hope for me with completely recovering from OCD. I canâ€™t stop the intrusive thoughts in this life, so I hope that I donâ€™t have them in Heaven. Iâ€™m a horror writer that was working on a book, but Iâ€™ll never be able to finish my book now. I love telling and writing stories! But I wonâ€™t be able to do that when Iâ€™m dead. This is my goodbye.  

 To my parents, Iâ€™m so sorry. Iâ€™m so fucking sorry. I love you both so much. Iâ€™m sorry Mommy. Iâ€™m so sorry that I did this. I love you so much. Iâ€™ll make sure to tell your brother you said hi for you. Iâ€™ll be looking out for you in Heaven, if there is an afterlife. Youâ€™re the most, strongest person Iâ€™ve ever known. You been through so much, yet youâ€™re still here. I love you, and please stay strong. If not for you, please do it for me. 

 Iâ€™m so sorry Daddy. I love you and Im grateful for everything you did for me and Rico. Iâ€™m so sorry for being such a fucking brat when I was little. Iâ€™m so sorry for giving you such a hard time. I love you. 

 To Rico, youâ€™re the best big brother anyone could ever ask for. Iâ€™m so sorry that I did this. I love you so much. Iâ€™m sorry for being annoying sometimes. Iâ€™m so sorry for doing this. I love you.

 To my pets Doozer, Blueberry and Neru. I love you all. Iâ€™m sorry that I couldnâ€™t pet you as much as I did when I was little, Doozer. Contamination OCD wouldnâ€™t let me. I know that isnâ€™t an excuse, but itâ€™s a reason. Blueberry, youâ€™re the best bird anyone could ask for. Iâ€™m sorry. And Neru, I know I didnâ€™t have you for very long, but Iâ€™m sorry. Youâ€™re a good hamster, and youâ€™re very sweet. Iâ€™m sorry. I love you all. 

 To my characters in my unfinished book, Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t get to finish your story. Even though I was the one that wrote you all into existence, you taught me so much. Hell, even the villain, Dr. Green taught me a few things. Iâ€™m so sorry your story will stay unfinished forever. 

I wish I could write one last poem or story, but I donâ€™t even have the motivation to do that. Iâ€™m probably going to do this either this evening or tonight. I havenâ€™t decided yet.

 Hereâ€™s my will. 

 I want almost everything that can be donated to go to charity. This includes clothes, old toys, books, etc. I want my handmade dolls to go to Mommy, Daddy, and Rico. I want my notebook full of poems to go to Mommy. I wish to be dressed in my short dark blue dress for my funeral with my hair in a bun. I would like everyone to wear what they like at my funeral, even if itâ€™s not black. If it is possible, please read one of my more happier stories or poems at my funeral. I donâ€™t have the motivation to write another story or poem, but I wish to tell one more story even when Iâ€™m gone. If itâ€™s possible, please read my stories to kids at the local library or something. Like I said, I still wish to tell stories even when Iâ€™m dead. Even if theyâ€™re my old stories.  

 Goodbye and thank you for everything youâ€™ve done for me. Iâ€™m truly grateful. 

 Sincerely, 

 Rosy.
