I feel like my will to live is very fragile and dependentI should preface by saying I am not depressed, and this year marked some of my happiest months in recent memory.

However, there's problems. My dream is to be a professional artist/musician, and it's one of the 2/3 things that keep me going. If my day is going crappy or if something frustrating/depressing happens, I always say to myself at least I have my dream and passion to rely on and look for happiness in. This, to me, is extremely dangerous, because when something happens, I do often get in a really dark and suicidal place. The music and the dream always pulls me out of it. And if my dream were ever to be taken from me in any way shape or form, or if I fail at my dream, then my reasons/will to live are pretty much completely gone and that crutch is taken from me. I still have some other things I might want to live for - starting a family, truly falling in love, developing my connection to my religion even further - but those would be completely overwhelmed by the grief and loss I think I would feel should my dreams fail. Even though there are some more realistic things I could get into if my music dreams don't work out, I really don't know if I would be able to live with myself at that point.
