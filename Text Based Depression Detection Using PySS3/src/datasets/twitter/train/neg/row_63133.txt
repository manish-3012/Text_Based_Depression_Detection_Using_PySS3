I want to die..I think nearly every day about it, I wouldn't do it, my mother is everything to me, if I cry she does. She doesn't know about it. She think I got better w my anxiety.. I'm so sad rn, thinking about an old friend.
My dad.. I hate him. Touching me like I was his wife. Disgusting. I hate my thights. I hate them whit my whole heart and then, he makes me hating them even more. I can't wear what I want in my proper house. I hate wearing short clothes bc of him. I hate myself. I want to self-harm,sometimes really bad. I just can think about it, I can't do it.. I can't.. I don't know what to do..
