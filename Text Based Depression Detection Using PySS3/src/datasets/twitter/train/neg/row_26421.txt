I want out.I've tried to get better. I've quit smoking, I started exercising and I really did take ahold of my life. I got promoted at work and did everything a happy person would do. I have straight A's in college. The meds don't work and exercising only works as a cover up. I'm extremely healthy but that hasn't helped. 

I'm done. I want out this week. Even days when I'm happy I still feel depression lurking in the back. I'm pissed I was born into so many different bullshit mental disorders.
