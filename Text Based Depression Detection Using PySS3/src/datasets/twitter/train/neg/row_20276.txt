I plan on doing it the first of JuneBy then, I'll have enough medication stored up to be able to be successful.

I'm done with all of this. I work in fast food, can't get into fucking college, I'm miserable at home and can't move out. I'm transgender and yet I'm never going to be able to transition because of my shitty situation, and most of all, my friends just don't give a DAMN about me.

I am counting down the days. So close. I can't wait.
