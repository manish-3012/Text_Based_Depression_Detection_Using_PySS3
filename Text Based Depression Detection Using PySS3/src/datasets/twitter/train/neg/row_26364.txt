How many here know that eventually theyâ€™ll end up killing themselves, and that it wonâ€™t be some passion of the moment thing.Taking an objective look at my life, my values, and where Iâ€™m placed in whatever the hell this society is, I have to ask myself a few questions.

Do I even want to participate in society?

Is there even meaning to any of this?

If who I truly am as a person is not compatible or accepting in the world I live in, then why?

Yeah, I get depressed and feel intense pain from time to time, have been diagnosed with god knows how many mental disorders, but even in moments of not feeling like utter shit, moments of emotional stability, I still look around and think â€˜really?â€™ This is what I have to look forward to day to day, week to week, month to month, year to year?

Iâ€™m 32yrs old, Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was a teenager. Iâ€™ve been told it gets better for well over a decade, but what the hell is even â€˜betterâ€™ and why the fuck am I aimlessly waiting for it when it never comes?

My life isnâ€™t the worst, but itâ€™s not what I want, attempts at me trying to find the life I want never materialize or never meets expectations. Iâ€™m tapped, why keep trying for something that never comes?

So, an objective analysis tells me that Iâ€™m inevitably going to kill myself one day, and wonâ€™t be based just on a heat of the moment despair and impulse. Itâ€™ll be calculated to by weighing the pros and cons, and determining whatâ€™s best for me.

Wonâ€™t be tmrw, wonâ€™t be next week, but eventually itâ€™ll most likely come and itâ€™ll truly have been my decision.
