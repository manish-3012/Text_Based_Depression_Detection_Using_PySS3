I feel like Iâ€™m dying everyday without even dying. Every time I try to bring myself back up I fall back down even further. New year worse self.My past posts speak for themselves. Back here again after multiple failed suicide attempts. I have enough energy to put myself down everyday, but not enough to put myself away. Iâ€™m too much of a coward and I donâ€™t know how to get myself out.
