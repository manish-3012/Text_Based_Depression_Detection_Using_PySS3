Friends pushing me.Im going through a rough patch, I told some friends about it and their urging me to kill myself. Why? I don't know. I never even mentioned wanting to die, besides just being miserable, and now they're all chiming in telling me to just do it to start some drama and shit between them because they have nothing better to do with themselves. I've been feeling so worthless, I've been having chronic pain, and everything is piling on top of one another. I mean, I know I wont do it. But why are they saying this? Are they saying it because they know I wont? Idk. Just really strange and "triggering" if I must.
