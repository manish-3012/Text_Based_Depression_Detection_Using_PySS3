I'm not any goodI don't know why people say these things about me. That I have plenty of skills to be able to find a meaningful place to be, and my kindness has helped them feel better. I don't know what they're taking about. I am useless. I do not posses the ability to make a difference in anyone's life and beyond. I don't have any friends anymore since I've drove them all away with my sadness. So what's the point of continuing on? I am useless. There is nothing left for me. Nobody to talk to. Nothing to do but die. Sorry for making you read this and wasting your time.
