Every time I think suicidal thoughts this little moth thing appears... Kind of feels like a (positive) sign...K so I'm probably just nuts, but there's this rogue fly/moth thing that appears and seems to be living in my house all by itself. There's only one, but every time I'm at my limit and I start realizing how much of a writeoff I am, I notice it. It's happened several times before, but today I was having these thought twice and it flew into my forehead *both times*...like a wake up jolt from a guardian angel saying "*hey, I'm here*!"... I dunno, it brought me out of my own head long enough to write this, so it's got to be a good thing. At least I know that little bug didn't abandon me...
