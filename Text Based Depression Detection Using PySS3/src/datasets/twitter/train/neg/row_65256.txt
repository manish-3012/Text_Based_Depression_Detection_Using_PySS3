I want to jumpIt's never going to end. I'm a worthless fool. No matter how hard I try my friends and family still treat me like I'm being dramatic, lying, manipulating, over exaggerating, they just never take me seriously. I'm talked over all the time. I have to interrupt people just to get a fucking word in and when I do it's just like a "yeah" and "oh cool" /s. I hate myself. I'm annoying, fat, stupid, and a huge fucking tool. Any attempt to speak about is met with try harder or just be more positive and even just flat out ignoring me. All those websites that tell you what to do if you want to die always mention call someone close to you and all that's ever done is push people away. The hotline makes me feel degraded, like I'll be picked up by a squad car and placed in a mental ward where they'll bank riot me and drug me into a coma. I just want support. I just want to feel loved. The police make me feel unsafe. No one cares. I don't blame them, considering I don't care either. I'm sitting alone on the balcony. I want to jump. I want to feel the air past though my hair as I plummet to sweet release. But I'm too courteous. The trauma that would inflict on others, is too much for me to do it. I'm basically alive at this point as a comfort to others. I'm a shell. An empty shell. Waiting to die. Fighting the urges like I'm fighting a wild animal for my life. I want to die.
