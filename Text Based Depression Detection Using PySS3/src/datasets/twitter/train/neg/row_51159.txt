Having a breakdown right now because I can't kill myselfPretty much the title. Can't kill myself because I know it would be selfish to leave my dead body in this fucking room and when they're going to try selling this fucking shit hole of a place no one will fucking buy it because some fucking suicidal person killed themselves in it.

I can't fucking live like this anymore. Everyone hates me, leaves me after they get tired of me. They just use me and throw me away. I don't blame them. I'm a fucking asshole. It'll be better when I'm gone. I can't keep fucking relive my trauma everyday along with the trauma I caused to someone else. Everytime It fucking comes up in my head I want to fucking puke my guts up.
Anyway I got no one.

I'm just crying so bad right now, I'm in so much mental pain. I'm really wishing my previous attempts worked. It's just too painful to live right now. And I'm causing pain to people by just existing too.

Fuck, I hate it here.
