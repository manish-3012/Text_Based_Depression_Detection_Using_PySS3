Slowly losing reasons not toI've been suicidal since I was nine or 10 and I'm now 21. The more time passes I've noticed how peoples suicides progressively hurt people less. I think I'm going to do something after I've been moved out for a few months and I'm less involved in my friends' and family's lives.
