Hey you wanna talk commentsIs it just me or do these comments bother anyone else? I know theyre well intended! But, im thinking people who are having trouble wanting to stay alive that come to a forum like this, obviously do want to talk, or they wouldnt post their troubles. I know its nit picky of me to even mention it but why not instead of asking, just go ahead and start conversation? Ok sorry just had to get that off my chest.
