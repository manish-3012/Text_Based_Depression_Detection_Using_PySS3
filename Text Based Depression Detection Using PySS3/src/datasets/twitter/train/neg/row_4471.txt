I donâ€™t know what to doI lost my dad two years ago, suddenly, I still cry about it most nights. I feel like I canâ€™t carry on living without him.

Iâ€™m an only child, and ending my life would break my mum... to lose her partner and her child

Iâ€™m so torn, upset, scared, confused

I donâ€™t know what my options are, I canâ€™t keep feeling like this.
