I've tried to get better for over 10 years, but I think that'll all end tonight.I'm not gonna give you my life story. I already gave it here and if you're curious, it's still there to read.

Long story short, I'm done. I have everything set up. I don't really know what else to say. I don't know why im posting this here. I don't know why I continue to live in a world that isn't meant for me. I hate myself for trying to pass some of this weight onto random strangers. It's my time and that's that.
