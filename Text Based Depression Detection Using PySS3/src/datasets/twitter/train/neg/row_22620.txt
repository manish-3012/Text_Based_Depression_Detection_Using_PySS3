I don't have insurance, if I went to the hospital I fear I would have a huge medical bill I would have to pay, and if I took meds I worry I won't have the energy to kill myself if I really wanted to.I haven't had insurance for awhile since my mom stopped paying for it. I thought about applying for Medicaid or insurance through my work but don't know if I would be approved for medicaid or if I could afford insurance. I don't want to have a huge medical bill that I would have to pay that would make me more suicidal and couldn't afford the things I wanted. 

What is going to a hospital or psychiatric unit like? I have been watching videos on YouTube and they tell me that they strip you or they have to watch you shower. Are the people I would have to interact with nice? I don't think it's necessary for me to go but I worry I will be forced to go at some point even though I am a legal adult. 

I worry if I went to the hospital and/or started taking meds then I won't have a lot of energy to do the things I want or to kill myself because I know I will still want to do that since they won't do anything to fix my life.
