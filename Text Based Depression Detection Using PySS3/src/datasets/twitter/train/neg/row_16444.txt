Waiting for my birthdayNever really posted anything like this, but here goes nothing.

From the earliest parts of my life, I was sexually abused by a family member, for years. Growing up with that has broken my brain in a way that nothing I have tried has ever worked. Medication, therapy, nothing. Since the first day it started, my life has felt like a living nightmare. Every day, I wake up, and think about how much nicer it would be to myself to stop my suffering, once and for all.

I have a lot of mental health problems. Relationships of any kind have been hard. All my life, I told myself that when I graduated highschool, I would let myself die. I hadn't had any plans for my future after that, never had any sort of passions in life that would lead me to any sort of career. I was really close to my end date, when I met the love of my life. We were together for years, and I told myself I would hold off on killing myself, to see where this ended up. But the love of my life just broke up with me because he feels differently now. I don't blame him at all, and I don't want him to blame himself for what will happen.

I don't have anything that makes me truly happy. I don't have anything that makes me feel like those years and years of trauma can be worked through. I can't even function on my own, I can't eat anymore, I can't sleep. I can't do it.

My birthday is coming up soon. I wanted to spend my last day with my family, just to give them one last memory of me. I feel like there's more I could say in this, but I guess it doesn't really matter. It almost makes you feel calm, knowing that this nightmare is going to end soon. At least it will end with a nice day.
