Wanting to do it butMy roommate is out of town for work and I am unable to find work after I was in a car accident in April that nearly took my life. A brain injury has been tormenting me for months since. I can't make use of my thoughts or ideas in the ways I could before, and every thought seems like a dead end. I stumble on words constantly and lose track of everyday items (keys, wallet, etc). I'm incredibly anxious all the time and recently my doctor has been prescribing a mild antidepressant to see how it works. Just the thought of needing a pill to feel normal has made me go berserk and I just don't feel competent anymore. I really really cannot afford anything and I don't know what to do. I have a method and it is violent but I cannot go through with it because I have to take care of my roommates dog and chinchillas while he's gone. Idk if anyone reads this but I just need help
