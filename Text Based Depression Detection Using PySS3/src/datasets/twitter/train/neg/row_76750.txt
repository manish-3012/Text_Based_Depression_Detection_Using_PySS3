Fuck people. I want to die.I have a razor and lots of whiskey and can't wait to open up my arteries and dive into the ice cold lake tonight. I don't even know why I'm posting because I don't know how I could be persuaded. But I just feel so empty knowing I'll go without saying anything. Idk I might not go, I might get too drunk and pass out like I often do. But god I wish it were easier to die. It takes so much effort too kill yourself.
