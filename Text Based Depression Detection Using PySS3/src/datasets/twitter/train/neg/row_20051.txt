im not scared anymoreim not scared to die anymore, and if anything im ready to, i cant even see a future for myself. i dont want to see a future for myself, no matter what i do or say ill always feel useless because everyone is tired of me not being happy, being sad for â€˜no reasonâ€™ and yeah maybe its annoying that i doubt peoples love, but im a hard person to love, i just need someone to relate to me, i want to feel at ease again and im scared that there is no other way i can because im always failing people and i cant take the self doubt, it just hurts so much. i dont want to be here, i never do,i just need a purpose in life other than my boyfriend who i know doesnt need this because he is way more worthy and deserving than me and how i am, i hate being me, and i hate anyone who would want to be me, because even if i act happy or say im fine, i know im not, i just wish i was and i wish i was perfect for everyone, because even if there was something i could do to make me feel better, id still choose to make everyone apart from myself to feel better and i hate myself for that, i hate myself for everything, why do i have to be so awkward and embarrassing no one can tell me ill ever be good enough, no one ever has and never will. because im not.
