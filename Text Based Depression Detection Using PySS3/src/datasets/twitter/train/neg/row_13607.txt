I have absolutely no will, want, or need to continue, so I think this is probably it.I'm no stranger to depression or attempting suicide, but most times I either failed and got an artificially spark of life to keep pressing on like a caffeine shot or I stuck around to not put my friends and family through that kind of emotional turmoil. These days, however, I'm finding it very, very difficult to care about that, or much of anything. I've progressively lost all the will to live and am only doing so out of some kind obligation I have to loved ones that I only promised to myself. It's gotten to a point where each passing day I'm still around just becomes more frustrating, and I'm passed the point of apathy and am now just increasingly pissed off that I'm not dead yet, even though it's completely within my own control. So with that said, I need to do this now, or at least before sunrise. I sincerely hope all of you manage to get help and find peace; you all deserve it, trust me. I really hope I can just do it and I'm not around to update this.
