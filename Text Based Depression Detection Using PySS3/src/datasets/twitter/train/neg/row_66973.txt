How do I make sure someone comes and cleans up my body?Donâ€™t have anyone that will care if Iâ€™m missing indefinitely so no one will come looking for me. So I was wondering how I go about making sure my body isnâ€™t just left to rot - not that Iâ€™ll care, but for the neighbours. Do I contact the police beforehand or someone else?
