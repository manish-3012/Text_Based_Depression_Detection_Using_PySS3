Why is being trans have to be so fucking hard?I just want it over... I can't transition and I can't not. If I transition I will never pass and spend a life being mocked and cast out. No non-passing trans person will ever be welcome in society. Not without being the punching bag. Our lives are a joke. Noone takes us seriously. Why am I still here? I've been begging for death for well over ten years, and yet I still breath. Our perception of time is supposed to speed up as we get older, and yet every day just slugs on by. My parents should have aborted me. What cruel psychopathic monsters bring me into a world to be despised, mocked, and suffer a lifetime of distress? Sorry, I just wanted to rant. Guess, I am just off my hormones for too long.
