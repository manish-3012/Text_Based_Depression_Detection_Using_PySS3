The only thing keeping me alive is my son.Before I met my wife, I tried to kill myself twice. I never sought help. Once by hanging myself and the branch snapped, once by shooting myself with a shotgun (the firing pin was broken). I kind of had a revelation at that point in my life and a week after I met my wife who was my savior. 6 years, 2 deployments, 2 major surgeries for her, and a son later, I think I caught her having an affair and I now want it all to end. 

I think about suicide all the time, I still haven't acted on it since 2012. I'm waiting for her to get home and we can talk about what she did. I wrote her a letter explaining why I know she's having an affair with this guy she met from work and that I want to work it out. If she lies to me, I'm leaving with my bags and I dont know what will happen after that. The only thing stopping me from blowing my brains out is my son. I know what having divorced parents did to me, I dont want that for my son. But I want my son to have a father. 

I left the military in September and I have no idea wtf I'm doing anymore. I've been in school full time, and I finally found a job during the winter break where I could make some money to pay the bills. Without my money coming in, my son would have a miserable life. I cant do that to him but if i dont have my wife, I dont know what I'm going to do. She's the one that saved me from myself. I am the one that's with him the most and I love him so much. Please, someone help.
