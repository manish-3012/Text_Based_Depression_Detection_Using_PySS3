I just want to be free..I feel so alone. I just found out that I'm most likely going to be kicked out of college for not maintaining a good enough gpa. It's been so hard, I struggle with depression and self harm. I've been sexually assaulted less than a year ago. All I  want is to be free. 
I'm a failure in so many people's eyes...
