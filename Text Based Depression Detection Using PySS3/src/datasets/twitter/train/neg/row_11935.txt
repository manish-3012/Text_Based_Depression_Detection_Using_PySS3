I think I'm done with life.My depression has been raging over the last few months and I hinged everything on a doctor's appointment that I had today.

I've had unsightly chest/back acne since I was 14. And I've been to doctors tons of times for treatment. oral antibiotics and a myriad of topical gels. Of course here I am 18 years later and not a single one of those treatments helped. In january I decided that I'd make one last bid for treatment. I'd go to my doctor and insist on accutane. 

Despite the side effects, It seems to have a high success rate for treatment resistant acne. And I'd rather have 6 months of pure hell with an outcome where I can look in a mirror and not hate myself than live even another day as I am now knowing that I'll always be self conscious about my body, and hate myself everytime I look in a mirror.

Now of course because I'm an American(And our healthcare system fucking blows), I couldn't actually see a doctor for this until a month and half later. Where I show the Dr. my skin, explain how long I've been suffering, and how miserable I feel looking at it. I express my desire to go on Accutane. And of course he immediately shuts that down. Instead deciding in his infinite ignorance, that the solution was to give me a combination of two topical gels. Ones I had already tried separately with no fucking improvement.

This of course tanks my mood to the point of basically shutting down communication. All I can think of is how I want to die and this fuckwad doctor wants to jerk me around with a worthless treatment. He then prods me about why I'm suddenly so morose and I lose my shit, tell him how my bad skin is one of the confidence destroying things in my life, that I fucking hate myself and break down in the room. But instead of being helpful, he uses it as a reason to start trying to throw psych meds at me.

This is what I get for trying to improve my life. So why the fuck should I even bother living anymore.
