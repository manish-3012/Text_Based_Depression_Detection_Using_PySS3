Idk what to do anymoreOk im typing this on phone so sry for any typos. I(13 m)
Am at this point not sure what to do, a month ago my mom(49) catched me while I was jerking off and since then she stopped talking to me. Since the only other person in the house is my mom I don't have anybody to talk to. I don't know what to do and at this point am even thinking of suicide my mom just ignores me all the time and i also don't have my phone for over 20 minutes a day, so I also don't have much contact with my friends. At this point I really don't know what to do
