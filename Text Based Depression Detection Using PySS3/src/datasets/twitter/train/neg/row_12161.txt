The only thing I genuinely want in my life is to die.I just can't take it anymore. I'm so tired of being upset and regretting everything about my life. 

My anxiety pushed away the best person who's ever been in my life and I just hate myself so much because of it. There's no possibility of us reconnecting she's out of my life for good and it's all my fault. My thoughts are just constantly pushing the idea of dying and these days it's sounding more and more like a good idea. I just don't want to kill myself, but I wish something would end my misery. I don't even know how I would kill myself, but I'm starting to think of ways to do it. If it wasn't for my mother I think I'd have killed myself long ago these days though, I'm edging closer to the idea of ending it myself since nothing else seems to want to take me out of my misery, if you want something done you gotta do it yourself right?

I'm not okay. I don't know what to do anymore.
