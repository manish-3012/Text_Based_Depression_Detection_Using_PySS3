Please help me finally make a decisionDear friends,

I am not sure if this kind of post breaks the subreddit rules and I apologize profoundly if it does. I am a 21 year old male who is unsure of everything. I am so tired of always doubting myself. I can not even finally decide to kill myself. All my life I have worked towards my goals and I usually almost achieve them. I say almost because every fucking time something happens that it out of my control and my dreams are crushed right before me. I got admitted to my dream school for undergrad but because of a revolution in my home country, I couldnâ€™t attend. Now I got into my dream PhD programs, but because of Corona and the shitiness of my home country I will probably be drafted and will not be able to achieve this goal too. All this along, I did not have friends(every single one of them betrayed me when I needed them most) and the only thing keeping me were my goals. 

I want to die but I do not want to hurt those around me. I am sick and tired of everything, but do not want to hurt my parents. 

How can I stage my suicide to look like an accident? Or what can I do?

Thank you and I am sorry if I am breaking the rules(please remove my post if it does)! 

Best regards,
Suicidial Shit
