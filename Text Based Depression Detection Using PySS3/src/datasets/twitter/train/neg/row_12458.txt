A Letter From The Grave - a poem that was written as a suicide note. I was lucky enough to survive, but sharing this hoping someone will realize theyâ€™re not a lone in what theyâ€™re feeling. If youâ€™ve lost someone to suicide, this might help you understand how depression affects perception ðŸ’”ðŸ’•Letter from the grave.

To everyone who matters,

Iâ€™m sorry I wasnâ€™t enough. 

Iâ€™m sorry if I loved you too hard but hated myself. 

I wish I was a better person, but Iâ€™m not. 

I am rootless yet grounded by the weight of who I am, or who Iâ€™ve become. 

I donâ€™t understand why. I cried, I prayed, I went to  doctors, I went to the gym, I let you in, I inhaled exhaled, and I numbed the pain. 

Nothing works Iâ€™m still the same.

I hope your lives prosper in my many ways, but Iâ€™ll see you all in our graves.

Maybe I acted strong because I was weak, and my silences was your queue to speak.

Oh well now my memories are yours to keep.

Mama Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t accept your love in the ways you showed it, because I know you did. 

Maybe youâ€™ve always been right and Iâ€™m an ungrateful bitch. 

Maybe I ruined your life even before I was born, 20 with a naughty sick baby must have been a storm. 

I loved you so much I slept to the smell of your scarfs from your closet many nights when I needed a hug. I donâ€™t know why I never came to you, I felt angry and not enough.

The more it went on the deeper it set, I am so wrong I am choosing to reset.

I have so much love for all of you my heart sometimes feels like its going to burst. Its not a cute look being 22 and acting like you need something to nurse.

Sister I am sorry you always lived in my shadow, but trust me it saved you from being burnt. 
You are beautiful and smart and a sister I never deserved. 

You should have been the first born, take care of our family. Be a real one for once. 

Maybe our parents donâ€™t know how, but you do know how to love. Have family close because friendships get tainted like the blood on my latex gloves.

Daddy Iâ€™m sorry I failed you as a daughter, I am sorry your life has been so hard, and you do it all for our futures. 

I know it is selfish of me to put you through more loss, but you should know yourself that this world can be harsh. I just hope you forgive me because its all too much. 

For those who stayed thanks for every moment that we shared, I wouldnâ€™t have made it this far without you there.

For those who didnâ€™t, thanks for trying to tell me that you were there. I understand, I would leave me too. 

Im sorry for everything I put you through.

The reality is none of you need me.

 I mean really need me. 

Think of  moments when I was the one to save the day, scarce arenâ€™t they? 

I am the storm that needs to blow away. 

It hurts too much to love in this broken way.

I promise youâ€™ll forget about me one day.

We might see each other in heaven or hell, or in a dream. If that day comes then maybe we might say what we actually mean.


I hope I see Kumari and Nana when I go to sleep. I hope theyâ€™ve seen every secret I have been trying to keep. I hope their love heals me and I am free, to forget what it feels like to weep.

I made my bed and now I lay in it deep. 

Iâ€™m going to sleep.
