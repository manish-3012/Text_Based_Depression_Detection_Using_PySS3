If I died, my parents would celebrateIâ€™m doing everything right, driving without a seatbelt, smoking constantly, drinking almost to the point of blackout every night. According to my doctor I should be dying, yet nothing is happening. I remain healthy despite all this shit. Iâ€™m too good of a driver to ever get involved in an accident thatâ€™s my fault, and I canâ€™t bet on someone else hitting me. My parents would be sad in front of their friends and family, but deep down they would just be relieved that they donâ€™t have to pretend to care about me anymore. Theyâ€™ll finally be able to focus on the kid that actually makes them proud, my brother who is better than me in every conceivable way. All Iâ€™ve ever done is disappoint them and let them down. I can barely keep a job, the only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because it would scar my roommate for life if he came home to my corpse hanging from the doorway.
