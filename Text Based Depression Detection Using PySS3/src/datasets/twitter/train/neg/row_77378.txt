I feel terribleI don't know what to do. Uni has just started this week and I'm already skipping all my classes. It's my third year. And in the two years I've been here, I haven't made a single friend. Literally, not a single one. 

And the two, three friends I have/had a home are getting more and more distant. Right now, my "best" friend should have been here with me, but she canceled her visit suddeny. And I understand that she's busy because she has a life and I don't, but it just always happens. I haven't seen her in two years. 

Not a day passes during which I don't think about just ending it. I'm headed absolutely nowhere. Everything just feels pointless. I feel like I'm just a burden on my family. My friends don't need me. 

I've been to a doctor, I've been prescribed antidepressants, but they didn't help. I'm bulimic, I'm a trichotillomaniac, I'm depressed and I cut myself. 

Every day, it's just getting worse and worse. I don't know what to do anymore.
