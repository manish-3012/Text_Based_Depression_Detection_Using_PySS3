Not long left nowI'm sick of life being a goal or a game. I can't live up to the perfect expectations, I sometimes don't see the point in it all. I try to help everyone but everything I say is wrong. 

I have a set date now for approximately, 2030 or something. Sounds a long way away, but I can't see myself living past 30, that would be a sin. =)

I wish I could be asleep forever, that it would never wake me up again. I'm tired of studying. I'm tired of trying to fit in and not understand the language of the country I live in. I'm sick of politics, I'm sick of the virus. I want it all over with. 

I think I accidentally upset people without thinking, but I try to be as kind as I can. I love to give advice. But I'm done with it all
