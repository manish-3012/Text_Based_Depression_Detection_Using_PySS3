I literally have no reason to want to kill myself but I still doI just finished high school, next week I'm going on a trip to europe which should be great, I have a girlfriend, a family that loves me, I have no responsibilities or stressfull things in my life, but I still want to fucking kill myself.

I was feeling like shit last month because I had to pass a bunch of subject to actually finish school, and when I did, I actually felt great, I'd finished and I had no more problems, but now, just a few days later I'm back to feeling like shit for absolutely no reason

It just doesn't get fucking better. I mean when I didn't have a girlfriend I always thought "Well, when I manage to get a girlfriend I won't feel bad". Then I got one and nothing changed. Then it was "I feel bad because I'm stressed out from school, when I finish everything I'll feel better". But a few days later and I'm back in square one. 

I'm not depressed, I can go about my day normally without even thinking about suicide, but all it takes is a sad song, a sad post, some guy being worse off than I am, some guy being better off than I am or just sitting in bed thinking about my life to make me lie in bed and be sad the rest of the day

I've been taking pills for about half a year now, and while they have helped a bit they didn't get rid of anything

I don't know what the fuck is this post, the paragraphs don't make any sense, I just vomited all the things in my head onto a reddit post, but whatever, I just wanted to say that, I don't even know what I want to get from this or what anyone can say in the comments to help, but whatever
