I live every day hoping I'll get hit by a trucki go door to door for a living and i stopped looking both ways before crossing the street a long time ago. This job ends in 2 weeks and I haven't been killed yet, this is bullshit. Soon I won't have a job and I'll just have to think about how to tie a noose again.
