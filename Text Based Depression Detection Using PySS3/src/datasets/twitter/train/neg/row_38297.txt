To be released 2018I apologize if my reasoning sounds light-hearted, but please understand my sincerity. 

I haven't seen much reason for going on with life aside from a certain game I've wanted to play. It's as if the devs knew of this and has kept the game away from my reach for years on end; forcing me to continue living life. Alas, I now know the game will release next year with the following year making me 30. 

I've had many years to think about this, and I've a few options in mind. Look, I've chosen to continue living these years to see if my outlook on life would change, and it certainly hasn't. This is despite the fact that my life has improved. I've just no interest in living the rest of it. 30 years in this world is more than enough for me. 

So yeah, the game I've awaited for next year, and my 30th birthday the following year. Looks like I've got two more years to go until I call it a life.
