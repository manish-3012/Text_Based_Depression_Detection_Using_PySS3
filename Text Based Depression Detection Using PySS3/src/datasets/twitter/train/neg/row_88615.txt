I turned 25 at midnight.Todayâ€™s my birthday, Iâ€™m 25 today. I recently started dating the most incredible person Iâ€™ve ever met in my life. But there is a screw loose in my head. For the last 6 months I have been dangerously self destructive . This is actually the first thing I havenâ€™t completely ruined with my actions. I really donâ€™t know what it is about me, No matter what I feel empty in life. Iâ€™m noticing my personality changing , Iâ€™m becoming more aggressive whereas I used to be more passive with people and would try to diffuse people when they get upset or get an attitude. You see, Iâ€™m a bartender, and lately I donâ€™t care about any customers feelings, if someone is rude I will be rude, and my specialty is belittling people when they feel entitled to things. But I see this destructive behavior coming to the forte front all the time . I was in a car accident a few months ago, I was drunk that night , well I guess morning. I use drinking as a happy pill, and no Iâ€™m not an alcoholic , this is the first stint in my life where Iâ€™ve been so desperate for sleep that I started drinking to get a slight buzz to feel tired. But on that night, I seen a car, but something flashed in my head, and I sped up to purposely hit the object. I hoped it would just be over , but it wasnâ€™t. It just created a whole new set of problems. Iâ€™m scared that I donâ€™t care about anything anymore , I find myself fantasizing about death. The sweet release of the worry I feel drifting away along with my negative thoughts about myself that tell me Iâ€™m unlovable , unteachable, and unreachable . I think Iâ€™m too far gone, I think I just let go at some point and have been trying my hardest to see it all end. Iâ€™ve become a useless human being, In so many ways. Iâ€™ve stopped taking care of my body, my personal space is messy, I never used to be like this. I dont even know what happened , but the last 2-3 years have taken such a toll on my mind that I canâ€™t ever sleep for more than 2 hours. My mind is destroying itself, and my body. I think that Iâ€™m just to the point where one more bad thing will thrust me over the edge and Iâ€™ll finally just grab that extension cord and walk off into the woods looking for the perfect tree like Iâ€™m a lumberjack.
