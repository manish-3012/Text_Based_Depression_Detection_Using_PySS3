Having Asperger's syndrome feels like I'm trapped in a cage all aloneI have no friends and I'm so depressed. Treatment did not work for me. I've been on meds &amp; doing therapy for 3 years now. I can't attend college because I have no motivation to even leave my bed. I want to die but I live with my mom and I have no access to reliable lethal means. I already failed at killing myself once and I'm scared to try again because I might end up mutilated.
