I just want to give my loved ones one last happy memory of me before I kill myself.Iâ€™ve always felt like a stranger in my own head. Iâ€™m always lost trying to understand things in the trade Iâ€™m in and it only gets more complex the further I get into my apprenticeship. My relationship with my family is rocky at best and my dog and fiancÃ© are the only things that seem to bring me any joy at all anymore and even that is fleeting. Iâ€™m saving to buy a house but everything in my area is either out of my price range or in a dangerous section of town. 

Iâ€™ll have one good day where I feel normal and six days of feeling exhausted and tired of living. I just need to pull the trigger already but Iâ€™m a coward that canâ€™t follow through. My struggles will be over and everyone will only have a short period of grief before they move on and forget me. My life doesnâ€™t matter and I know it. 

I feel like if I give everyone just one last memory of me and make it a happy one for them and maybe for me then I can finally go through with it.
