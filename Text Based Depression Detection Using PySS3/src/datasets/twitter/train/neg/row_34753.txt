My life is ruined.My mom is leaving. She wants nothing to do with my dad and I. A doctor performed additional surgery on me without my consent so I may be in serious debt. I don't have anyone. I can't be happy. My chest is heavy and hurts. There's nothing here for me. I want to die. I don't want to be here anymore. I just need to die.
