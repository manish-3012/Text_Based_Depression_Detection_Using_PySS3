I just wanna cry but I can'tI made a post about how I said I like being numb but screw that now. I fucking hate it. I just want to feel something. I can't feel anything because I'm on meds.

A lot of people will say crying is a form of weakness but it's not for me. I find crying as a weird coping mechanism. I'll cry for 5-10 minutes, after that I'll get up and continue life. I feel better after crying. Can't sleep? I'll just cry till I sleep. But now it's hard to sleep cause everything is on my mind. Like a very detail scenario of what will happened after I kill myself.

The fact that I can't feel anything sucks. All I do is sleep. I only find comfort in the dreams I have cause when I wake up everything will eat me up from guilt to anxiety. And I hate it so much.
