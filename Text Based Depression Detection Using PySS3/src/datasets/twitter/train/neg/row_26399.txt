I just will never amount to anythingI have been coping with depression for 10 years now and I think this year it just might win the long battle. So far my bed has been my best friend this year. I am 24 I have few friends and I feel they don't even enjoy my company anymore I mean who the fuck would I don't even enjoy my company anymore. I still don't have a job but it is because I am afraid to leave my house. I can't stand in public places for more than 5 minutes without hearing people what I believe to be making fun of me. I was bullied for being different I used to ebrace it but now I just feel I can't relate to anyone. I have no personality whatsoever everthing I loved to do was stripped from me during this battle and it will never come back no matter how much I miss it I lose focus as quick as I started. I mean it seems my only logical way is to just no longer be here in this world and just take the "pussy" way out. The one thing I have against that statement is if they were in my mind the torment would have got to them a long time ago. I have been institutionalized and that led to more people just mocking me I mean the cops even tell people not to hang out with me because I am bad for people. I can't get out of my parents house and I would not want to end it all where they could possibly find my body and be scarred. I do not know what to do there are so many options. the only one I don't have is the ability to buy a gun which pisses me off it is the fastest way out and I do not get the choice to buy one. I have no desire to live anymore I am ugly uneducated and will never find a companion the last one I was with and I fucked up now I live with the consequences every day. I just wish there was someone in my life that I didn't dissapoint all the time I just love fucking up apparently.
