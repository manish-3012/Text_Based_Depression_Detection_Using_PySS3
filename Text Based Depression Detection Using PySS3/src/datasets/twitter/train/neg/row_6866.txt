I just canâ€™t get it out of my headItâ€™s all been going downhill, and the only thing I can think of is someone bashing my head with a bat, just beating me to a pulp, maybe dropping some weights or a hammer or something on my head. I just really canâ€™t anymore. Just thought of dropping on the subway, as itâ€™s been quite popular as of late round here, but what about the remains? What do they do with that? What about making it look accidental, going to a bad neighborhood, taunting people, trying to get yourself shot... thatâ€™d work right?

I donâ€™t know, I know I wonâ€™t do it, but I still think about stabbing my arm or hand, cutting a finger maybe, putting a knife though my head or eyes does seem tempting from time to time. I donâ€™t know.
