I feel NumbI am a 22 year old guy that is feeling numb after thinking about how meaningless life is I guess. I never thought of that and so my mind is in a weird place where I feel like shit pretty much and I have lost my passion about anything overnight. I have no friends to talk to due to being around pieces of shit and I only have acquaintances that I met by going out alone.

I am not sure what to do right now. I really want this to stop. Before this, I would enjoy life by staying on my computer 24/7 and then I would work out here and there even although I dropped that for a while.
