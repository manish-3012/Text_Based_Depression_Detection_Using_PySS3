Physically sick from depression the past few days. Do not want to be conscious.......I believe I have suffered from depression and anxiety for about 6 years now, never got an actual diagnosis, no insurance and can't afford to blow $200 per visit + medication on a psychiatrist.  

I go through these long periods of stability, then severe depression every couple months.  When I reach this hole, like I have since this past Friday, I've just been more sick than ever before.  This time I feel completely nauseous, I wake up crying, go to sleep crying, I have to keep myself from crying in class, I can't wait to get in my car so I can cry.  I wake up with diarrhea if I eat anything.  My head feels like its 3 times its weight from all this crying.  I'm so mean to people who love me, my family, I just don't even want to look at them or be in their company.  Every single thing I see makes me sad.  I bite my nails and I pull out my own hair to give myself a sense of relief.  I'm really not sure how I can stand feeling like this for the next couple weeks, it's physically taking a toll on me.  I'm just sad and hopeless and disgusted at myself and with life...anyone ever feel this sort of way from depression?
