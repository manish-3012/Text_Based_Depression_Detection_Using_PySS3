someone did something great for me and i almost got them firedthey told me what they did and i basically said loudly "thank you for doing (prohibited activity)" and then felt like complete shit. im an ingrate with no verbal filter and no volume control. this simple fact has caused me more than this specific headache, but this one has been bothering me recently. im so mad at myself for being so cringeworthy
