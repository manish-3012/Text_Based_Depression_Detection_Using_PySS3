Am I even considered suicidal?I am making this post mostly because for the 1st time ever somebody has called the police on me reporting that I was suicidal.

I often times hit a point to where I am broke every month and I talk about wishing I could just leave earth painlessly and times where I just randomly break down because I am sick of having almost no human interaction and at the age of 30 I haven't even had so much as a girlfriend. So I am constantly questioning my worth and life based on that alone.

But the cops came by my house just a couple of minutes ago and asked if I felt suicidal, and I told them no, because honestly right now I feel "fine". Fine in the sense that I feel I can function normally and at least for the rest of the day and probably just stay in my room and read or play random computer games.

So I ask, am I even considered suicidal? While I do constantly think about what would be the repercussions of killing myself(My family kind of depends on me financially atm) I have never actually made the attempt to kill myself(Honestly just too scared I think). I'm really just curious on if I am considered suicidal or if I just need to find out how to not be a piece of shit at life.
