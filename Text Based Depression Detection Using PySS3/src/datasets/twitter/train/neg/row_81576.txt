No one noticedI am extremely low at the moment and told myself I will deactivate from social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, partly to see if anyone would notice my absence and partly to see if it would help me. I am aware I've posted some worrying stuff online over the past couple of days that has been commented on but nothing more than "speak to someone" 

I reached out to a few people, the ones who said I could talk to them and I only have people I know in real life on there, and got no response. 

I then set myself a challenge, if someone contacted me by the end of the day to see where I am and how I am I won't kill myself tomorrow

I've had no contact from anyone. No one has noticed.

I'm a no one. Literally a no one.
