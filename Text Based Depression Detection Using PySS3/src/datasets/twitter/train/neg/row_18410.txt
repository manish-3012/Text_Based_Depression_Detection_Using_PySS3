I'm done trying. I want this to be over.I've attempted twice since last May. I can't keep up this faÃ§ade that everything is okay anymore... No one cares, they say they do but no one is there when I needed them. No one answers the phone or texts me back. They just keep me around as a number; just one more person they can say they know. I'm not into being part of the popularity contest anymore. I just want to die. I want it to be over.
