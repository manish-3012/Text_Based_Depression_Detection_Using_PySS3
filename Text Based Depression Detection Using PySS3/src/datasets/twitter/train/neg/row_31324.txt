i see no point in livingim probably going to delete this soon. but my family hate me, im failing school, im constantly in fear, to the point I can barely go outside without panicking about being murdered. like I dont want to die, i just dont want to live. a year ago i started feeling like this. i sometimes randomly injure or scratch myself for no reason. i dont know what to do.
