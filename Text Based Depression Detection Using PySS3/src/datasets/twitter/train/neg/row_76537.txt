Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s nextI walked out of my job after a panic attack. Didnâ€™t even stop to talk to anyone for a second. My coworker friends yelled at my supervisor after I left and my bf talked me into going to the hospital.  

That was a mistake. There was no help there just humiliation and after a little while my mother. 

I am now home. Unable to get in contact with my therapist. Never got started on meds and resisting the urge to run away at the slightest opportunity. 

They locked the garage so I canâ€™t get in there. Took away the pills Iâ€™d have swallowed, not that I canâ€™t go buy more.... 

Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m posting. I just want someone to know I am here for now. And I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do next. But honestly itâ€™s the pity looks and visits Iâ€™ve been getting that hurt the most.
