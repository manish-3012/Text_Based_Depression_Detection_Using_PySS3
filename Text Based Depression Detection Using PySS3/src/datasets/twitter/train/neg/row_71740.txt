Drinking again. Wanna dieIt was never the quarantine. 

Slowly becoming a recluse regardless. Always have high standards for what makes me happyâ€”nothingâ€™s ever good enough.

Imagine social distancing but for the past several years of your life. Not just from friends but from everything around you as well. Nothingâ€™s ever good enough.

Writingâ€™s not good enough; movieâ€™s arenâ€™t good enough; exerciseâ€™s not good enough; gameâ€™s arenâ€™t good enough.

Could go to sleep but the nightmares wonâ€™t stop. A drink could helpâ€”chase it down with a Xanax: alprazolam (what a funny word).

Maybe tomorrow Iâ€™ll try again. Getting hard to do though. 

Guinness is good for you.
