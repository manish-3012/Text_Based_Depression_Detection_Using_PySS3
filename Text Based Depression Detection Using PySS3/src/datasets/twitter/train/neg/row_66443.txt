Maybe itâ€™s time.Iâ€™m 23 about to be 24, in the past year I have allowed my life to be consumed by my sadness and mistakes. I have recently lost my girlfriend of three years and basically lost my job of four years. Iâ€™ve turned to drinking as my main point of â€œhappinessâ€ yet it doesnâ€™t help and makes things worse. I attempted to commit suicide when I was 19 and basically going down the same road. I donâ€™t know how I got out of my dark spot in that point in my life, but now I feel empty inside. No love, no happiness, nothing other then my sorrow for how my life has become. Thoughts of ending it all are coming back and are currently my favorite thoughts. 

Maybe Iâ€™m here posting my last cry for help, thank you for allowing me to vent, who knows where I will be tomorrow.
