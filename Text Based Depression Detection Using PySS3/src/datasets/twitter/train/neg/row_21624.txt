Well, I guess I have nothing better to do!All I've been doing these last few days is browse this subreddit and post threads about how much of a failure that I am, I feel like I'm annoying people on here with my posts, I'm sorry if it does. 

But I have nothing else to do but be preoccupied by my thoughts about killing myself! I've lost all passion for everything I do and now, I'm just wasting away doing nothing but crying and realises how much of a failure I am to this world! 

I'm sorry if I'm annoying with my posts, but I have nothing better to do, if I don't do this, I may as well be dead.
