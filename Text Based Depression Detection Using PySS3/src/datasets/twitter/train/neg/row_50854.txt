EverydayI've got this noose set up in my room. Every day I look at it. When I wake up in the morning it's the first thing I see. When I go to bed at night it's the last thing I see. It's a reinforcement of sorts, like "don't forget to kill yourself"

I don't know why I even feel the need to say this but I do. To me death is the most purest thing in life. It's what we all share. Mick Jagger might fuck 50,000 women but he'll die just like I will die and we'll both just evaporate. 

So I'm no good to people. No good to women especially, I don't want to live until I'm 70 all alone. I've got no future, nothing to look forward to and nobody to share anything with. Life is pointless enough as it is without having to be a pathetic piece of shit in a judgemental world 

I'm really torn between dying early or living as long as possible but by deforming myself (I chose my face but the scars faded) on the one hand I want to slide out the back door of life unnoticed, on the other hand I want to shred my face up and tell the world to suck my dick. 

I really don't want to see my next birthday, that's my target date. I think that being in control of your death is the ultimate in power. 

I'm going back to my original plan. It costs a bit of money I don't have but it's worth the effort.
