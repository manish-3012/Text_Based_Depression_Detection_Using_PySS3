wish i didnt carewish i didnt care about my parents. wish i didnt care about my best friend. wish i didnt care about the people who would clean up the mess. wish i didnt care about what the future might hold. wish i didnt care about what might come after. wish i didnt care at all, but the truth is i care so so much, i care about everyone. i even care about myself to an extent, ig thats why im in so much pain. i just dont wanna burden or hurt anyone else. sometimes i feel like death is the only way to do that. maybe its the only way to find peace.
