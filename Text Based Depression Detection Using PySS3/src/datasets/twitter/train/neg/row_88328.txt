Am I insane?Hey there.
Not sure where to begin, so I'll give an extremely brief backstory:
I was severely depressed for four years, self-harming, and completely suicidal, attempting it twice before stopping at the last minute and keeping it as a serious life option for the past 6 years.

So there's that. Then I met a great friend (whom I have never told any of this to), became obsessed with self-improvement, and pulled myself out of it. Two years later and I look at myself and see a good-looking, intelligent, fit, and sociable man... who wants to die.

I'm not depressed. For some reason, I just like the idea of dying. To me, it's not an escape or release... just something I seriously consider many times every day. I actively want to die, but stop myself almost regretfully with a shake of my head, reminding myself that I shouldn't think that. 

Some careful reflection on this has led to the idea that I can't trust myself and that everything I am is a lie. Which has led to intermittent bursts of hopelessness and contempt for everything between my overall contentment. These bursts feel the same as the occasional strong emotion I would get during my four years of depression, and I'm concerned that this self-reflection will make me depressed again.

What's your advice? I've thought it through a lot. It seems like I can either:

a. Just die

b. Think about the problem of constant suicidal thoughts and risk falling back into depression

or

c. Try not to think about it, and just live with the fact that I wish to die

I'm a bit concerned for my own sanity. Any help is greatly appreciated, preferably through message form.
