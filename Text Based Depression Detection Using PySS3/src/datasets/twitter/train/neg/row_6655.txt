Makes me sadder than I already. Im so numb right now, I wouldnt care if I suddenly just died for all of eternity, unaware of anything but nothingness itselfI do drugs like magic mushrooms and marijuana to feel any kind of happiness. When on neither on these, I am a hollow shell of a human. Empty, numb; and tired of everything. Including eating and breathing. So much effort, so much tedious activities just to stay alive for another dayâ€”week etc. When really, I know deep down inside, that I will just die some day, without an afterlife or reincarnation of any kind to redeem or console me. Just utter oblivion. Devoid of all my senses, memories and even consciousness. 

It doesnâ€™t help that when I feel good. I feel really dramatically good. At ease. Comfortable and oh so aliveâ€”just to plummet back into despair and depression. I am quite sick of this sickening cycle. Maybe thereâ€™s something to this sick game/charade of life and constant effort. Something that hasnâ€™t clicked yet. And thatâ€™s my main reason for not offing myself; I want to figure out this mess. To find a reason to stay alive. Sure itâ€™s got to be more than just drugs and dreams.
