Shutting downIt feels like something is wrong with my body. I could probably stay on the floor or in bed until I starve and die. I've lost my appetite completely, and I can't taste anything anymore. My body feels extremely heavy, like I'm on a shit tonne of seroquel (I'm not) and it keeps flipping between not sleeping or not being able to stay awake.

The only thing I have is metal, but I don't even deserve it. I should crawl out to the middle of fucking nowhere and starve and dehydrate and rot.

I don't mean anything to anyone. Then again I guess that's a lie. People definitely hate me. Guess I'm just giving them what they want.
