I'm Done.I am poor, Not a big deal, I am hungry, No problem! My dad's a bully, My brother's a bully, My mom's a bully, My cousin's a bully (He lives in my house).
Well, lets put that all in the box of "not a big deal"
At least I am a human being and I can do whatever I want to, Well, I wanted to though, But not now, Life's shit, I hate everything, I'm gonna finish this right here.
I used to be a nice guy (as they say it, people) 
But now I am not, They all hate me, You'll too, But don't reply or try to stop me, Because the comments or you "reply" is not gonna stop me anyway, So don't waste your time and Yeah no more being that 14 year old stupid ass kid.
PEACE.
