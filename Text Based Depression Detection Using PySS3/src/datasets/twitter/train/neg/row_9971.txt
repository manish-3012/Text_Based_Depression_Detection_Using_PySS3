I'm almost there.I'm a 22 yo Male, Australia. I've been suffering from depression for a while now which I fought I had beaten. Two years ago, I started suffering from deep depression in which I had a suicide attempt but soon after recovered with the help of counselling and medication. I came out of with the thought that I had finally defeated it. 
Now I just realised that it was just locked up deep down within me and has now  has reared it's ugly face again and I'm not sure if if I can defeat it this time as I know that it will be far worse from my first. Lately I've been getting thoughts of suicide and have started self-harm. I've been crying a lot lately but has now since stopped.
I've decided on the method of how I will go and am in the process of collecting the resources. I'm in the process planning which include the research of a funereal, as well as deciding on whether or not to make a will, the date, which I have a rough guide and the location of my death. I'm also deciding on whether to have two contingency plan in which my plan fails, and the other being to simply run away and start a new life if I do not have the courage to go through with it.

While I do understand that suicide can be deeply traumatic to those around the victim, I've also decided to leave a journal/memoirs/notes/or whatever you would call them to try a mitigate the emotional damage this will cause. I rarely confide in anyone (including family), and have tried my best in keeping this hidden from almost everyone I know. I feel like that with everyone I talk to, I have to put on a mask so that others can not see this side of me. I have only done so to one person in which I fear that this may cause a lot of pain for her.

I guess the only reason that is stopping me from being 100% committed to going through this is that the trauma I will cause as well as people seeing me as selfish for doing something like this.
