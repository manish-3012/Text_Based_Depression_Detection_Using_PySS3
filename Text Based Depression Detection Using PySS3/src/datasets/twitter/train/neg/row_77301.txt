When will the thoughts disappear?About 4 months ago my girlfriend broke up with me rather sudden after 4Â½ years together. She has complete removed me from her life, and to this day I still don't know why...

Well, that's not the issue I wanna disgus. I've gone into a harsh depression that has only gone worse as time progesses and is starting to think about suicide. Not that I am planing on doing it. But I've been playing with the thought on how things would be, if I did it, or at least attempted it. As well as how it would be, if I were to be in a big car crash.

But my question is, does anyone know when, if ever, these thoughts will disapsper? It's been so long, but things is just getting worse I think. I've thinking about consulting my doctor, if things doesn't improve soon.

I know this is due to the breakup I have the depression and I've tried meeting other women as well as going out as often as I can with friends, to keep me in good company. But 4, almost 5 months is a long time. According to the internet \(which obviously is the most reliable place for information\), the first month after a breakup should be the worst. But not the case for me, apparently. And I know it's a bit cliche to be all depressed and suicidal after a breakup.

Any thoughts?

Ps. Sorry if my writing is a little messy.
