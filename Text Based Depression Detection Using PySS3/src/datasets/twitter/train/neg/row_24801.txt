In all honesty, Would you keep living if you were me?TL;DR : 21M with permanent sexual dysfunction, Cognitive impairment, Debilitating social and general anxiety, Failing medical school, Never held a job and never will, Never had a partner and never will.

Hi, So yes let me start with the worst, I gave myself permanent sexual dysfunction and that alone is enough of a reason to let myself rot in the deepest pit and not do anything to get myself out of it, What's the point? I'll never be happily in love with anyone.

Since being anywhere in public is too much stress for my socially anxious brain, And being anywhere outside of bed is too much work for my ever demotivated, Ever depressed self, I took up whatever filled my solitude with any hit of dopamine, This meant games, Internet, And of course, Pornography.

I eventually got into substance use (and abuse) when all the years of depression built upon each other and became enough to break my 'no-drug' rule. Long story short, Years later I start using this widely available, Powerful hallucinogen. It's uncontrolled due to it's very unpleasant nature, But it made my solitary habit feel so much better, I didn't know that a one year all day binge later, Going on hours long sessions daily, I'll have developed permanent sexual dysfunction.

What else? I also have some cognitive impairment which I'm not getting into, I also see static all over my vision and after images -HPPD- and my case is bad.

Being with friends absolutely drains me, Despite them being pretty good friends. Work and school are just not for me. Why am I alive? Life isn't even neutral, Everyday is painful.

So please be honest, Would you keep going if you were me?
