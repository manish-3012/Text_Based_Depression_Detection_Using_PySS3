HelpIt has been some time since I posted something on this app but I need to get it off my chest. My bf is toxic and I can't get away from him. Heâ€˜s aggressive, manipulative. He's always pissed, he makes me feel terrible. I almost lost all of my friends because of him, because he tells me to leave them. He forces me to leave them. I don't want to live like this...he told me he'd kill me if I cheated on him. I never did and never would but I'm afraid of leaving him because of it. He would hurt me. I want to die...I am dealing with depression and it gets worse everyday. I don't know why I love this manipulative, disgusting asshole
