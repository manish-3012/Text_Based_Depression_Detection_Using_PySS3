1 moment changed my lifeit all started when i fractured my penis. now my penis is numb. it sucks to wake up. im scared to get a girlfriend. im a virgin at 25. plus to top it all off i have no job. my parents are extremely judgmental. i have no car and i have 1 friend. i wasn't always like this. i was a happy guy even though my parent gave me shit since the day i was born. im seriously thinking about committing suicide. whats the point? i cant enjoy sex. i cant barely feel my penis anymore. iv been to several urologist. my urologist even said theirs nothing he can do. i even did a mri ,but nothing showed up =(.
 im going to get my doppler ultrasound and if no plaque or scar tissue can be found im gonna kill myself. even when i was younger my parents spent more time at churhc then with their own child. i believe in god ,but am so pissed and frustrated to why god would let this happen to me. iv recieved alot of racism in my past and had this feeling to always want to be accepted somewhere.
