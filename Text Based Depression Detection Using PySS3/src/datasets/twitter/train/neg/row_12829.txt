My life sucks.I've been meaning to commit suicide for a while now. Everything has gone downhill for me. But just yesterday I found out my girlfriend left me for another guy. My self esteem is depleted and I have nothing now. I'm broke, and the only person who made my life worth living left me for someone else. 2 years of a relationship with no problems, up in thin air. Anyways, I have a gun and am thinking of killing myself soon. I have nothing to live for, and I'm a few drinks in already, so I'm ready. I have my note written, and none of this will matter soon. It's crazy that I worked so hard throughout my life and now I'm broke and my soon-to-be wife left my ass. I hope she reads my suicide note, I hope it haunts her.
