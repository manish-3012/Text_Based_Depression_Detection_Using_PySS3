My life is so pathetic I haven't had any toilet paper for 3 daysI am poor. Not the "oh I can only buy 15 starbucks instead of 20" kind of fake poor, actually poor.

I have no food, I ran out of toilet paper 3 days ago (I've been using and bleaching cloths when I've had to go at all) and I have 50p to last me until 1st July.

I'm outta work cos I quit my job to care for my abusive parents who died last year, since then I've been searching to no avail.

I haven't two pennies to rub together and bills to pay, no food or supplies and I am tired. I'm so fucking tired. I've gone from Reddit Sub to forum to FB group, everywhere I can trying to find assistance but people all call me a scam artist. Fair enough I suppose, they don't know me.

I don't live near a food bank, can't even afford bus fare.

I am so tired of being poor. People think that being able to scrape your contractual bills means you're not poor. They're wrong.

I just want to die what kind of shameful, pathetic existence is this.
