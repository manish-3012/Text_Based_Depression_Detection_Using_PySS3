Wrecked life at age 27 smh.So like every patriotic American, I decided to join the military. I served in the Marine Corps for four and a half years and had a great time. Fast forward a few years later my mental decided to just shatter. I found out I deployed with a broken back and it had healed wrong so I was in immense pain. I started taking pain killers started off at two and ended at 60 a day.

My sister takes her own life and thatâ€™s when I found out that Xanax can make the thoughts go away. But shortly after starting them I was using an excess of Xanax. No mind you I was in college and had a full time job so I could afford my habit. However, affording my habit would only last so long once I got a house on my own. I had 2 vehicles and a motorcycle. 

My mental issues that stem from the military and finding my sister have caused me to be reaching for the reaper. I started blacking out while driving and waking up in jail and having vehicles be totaled. I however was still addicted and just wanted the mental anguish and depression to go away. Iâ€™ve been clean a year and a half. My depression still stays. Matter of fact I tried committing suicide this year 7 or 8 times and my latest attempt was slashing my carotid artery.

Iâ€™ve been so low and I know once you hit rock bottom the only way to go is up from there. I just know though that I still have one more in me that I can finish and fade away. Has anyone had any similar experiences that can help me negate the situation? I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m jobless, not a student anymore, racked up a bunch of legal issues and constantly thinking about ways to end my story.  Any advice would be nice! If not Iâ€™ll probably just end up painting my ceiling red.
