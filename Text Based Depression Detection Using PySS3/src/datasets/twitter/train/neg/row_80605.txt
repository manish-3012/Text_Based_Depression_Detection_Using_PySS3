Suicidal thoughts just don't go awayI don't even know if I want to kill myself anymore but I think about suicide multiple times a day and have done for years. If I get a moment's spare time to think it's nearly always about suicide. I have my reasons for not going through with it but it really does seem like the best possible option and I'm almost certain it's how I'll die, just a matter of when.
