Feel like Iâ€™m being tortured.The last 3 days Iâ€™ve really been suffering. For the record, I have BPD, depression, anxiety and Iâ€™m mostly isolated due to not having a vehicle. I am currently going through a lot of life changes at the moment and I canâ€™t deal. Today was particularly awful and everyone turned on me. My â€œbest friendâ€ turned on me, my dad got pissed off at me, my partner left me and turned off his phone (after leaving me the night before, while I was crying on the floor). Anyone I reach out to is ignoring me. I have been having a breakdown in my closet floor for the last several hours. Sobbing, chest pain, screaming, full blown tantrums. I feel like Iâ€™m losing my mind and I just want the fucking pain to stop. I canâ€™t take it anymore.
