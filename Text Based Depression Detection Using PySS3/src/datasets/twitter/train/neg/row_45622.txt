Carry onI don't know if I should carry on I feel like everything is crumbling I don't know if there's a point I always try to be optimistic and have hope but there's so much negativity being thrown at me .
On my suicide letter I want it to be the biggest fuck you to the person that caused this, my mom 
I want everything she did to me to just emanate inside her mind  when she knows that she caused it.
