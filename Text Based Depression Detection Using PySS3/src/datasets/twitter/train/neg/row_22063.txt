I'm done with all thisMy life has been absolutely fucked for the last year. You can say what you want, that things will get better, I need to ride it out.. But its just not going to happen. I have been trying so hard for so long to move on with my life and get out of this funk, but I'm sick of crying myself to sleep, sick of smiling when I'm not happy, and I'm sick of writing suicide notes like other people write diary entries. Its only a matter of time before I get drunk and swallow all those pills that will rid me of this shitty existence. I don't know why I'm writing this to be honest. This is my 11th hour, my last minute... Give me some hope reddit
