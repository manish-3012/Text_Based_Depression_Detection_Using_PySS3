Need help planning?I was at a point where I wanted to commit suicide, and I failed. But ironically it was the biggest rush I had in my life when the gun fired instead of killing me. I wanted to chase this feeling. I've done it numerous times after this incident but the thrill is kind of gone. 

I want to plan how to do it for real this time, and actually try to kill myself to get that thrill back from the first time. Was wondering if there's a best MO to doing this? 

Like What's the easiest and most painless way to kill yourself?

Please don't try to talk me down, I'm already going through with it for sure just want to ask everybody what the cleanest, most pain-free way of going about it is. Overdose? Gun? Hanging?
