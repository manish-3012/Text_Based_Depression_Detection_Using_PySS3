Overwhelming feeling that I need to kill myself.It feels as if my existence is a massive mistake. I know this feeling is not logical, and contradicts my belief that no one exists for any discernable reason (I consider myself an absurdist), but it persists to haunt me regardless.

 I can't shake the feeling that I need to kill myself. Any drive for self-preservation is becoming almost non-existent. I struggle to complete even the most mundane of tasks. 

How can I expect therapy to address anxieties that are existential in nature? The things that I want to change, I can't. 

I've been on effexor and vistaril for a few months now and both worked pretty well in the beginning, but they're slowly losing their potency, which I should have anticipated. It's pathetic that I've come to use them as an emotional crutch much the same way as I did with marijuana and adderall. 

I can't say I pose any danger to myself at the moment; my desire to die is rather passive, STRONG, but passive nonetheless. I have an idea of how I'll "finish the job". 

Yet, I know how devestated my family and friends might be with me gone...especially my older brother, who has also made two seperate attempts before, so for their sakes', I'll try to keep going for as long as I can muster the energy to.
