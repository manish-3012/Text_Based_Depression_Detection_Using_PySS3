Girlfriend has a plan to kill herselfSheâ€™s been talking about it for days. She came up to see me as her last thing to do before she kills herself. I tried to talk her out of it, and sheâ€™s been to multiple hospitals before. She refuses to take her meds, she has Bipolar 1 disorder. She keeps saying itâ€™s not her fault if I am severely depressed when / if she kills herself. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide multiple times, and if she does succeed I will most likely try again. Is this Gods way of telling me that I need to back out of this relationship? Iâ€™ve done everything I can to help, but nothing works
