Dealing with constant abuse and feeling suicidal because of itNo matter what I do to change my situation or work towards it, there is no end in sight for me. For a long time. I'm suffering so badly and today is the first time I've felt suicidal in a while. Also feeling urges to SI...which I havent felt in a long time either. 

My situation is bleak. I'm living with abusive family members. I've been here since May because of the pandemic. Nothing has worked out for alternative housing options and I'm too low income to qualify for most apartments. 

I've contacted every agency etc. I've worked really hard at trying to get out of here. But due to my income it likely wont happen soon. 

I'm being buried in suffering and if not for my animal I'm not sure I'd be here right now.
