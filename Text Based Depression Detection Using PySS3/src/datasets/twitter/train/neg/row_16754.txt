Getting older sucks.I hate how after I have an attempt, I have to face my family. I hate hearing how â€œitâ€™s all for attentionâ€ or that Iâ€™m just being dramatic. Or that I need to grow up. Itâ€™s none of that, I truly wish I had the means for a better method.

Since my mom passed away when I was 20, Iâ€™ve been my dadâ€™s caretaker. Which meant I was getting government paychecks while caring for him, I was doing pretty well financially until recently. Iâ€™m 26 now, and my dad decided that he wanted to to into a assisted living home 2 months ago. I would have been fine with his decision if he would have given me some notice, but he didnâ€™t and basically ripped the carpet right out from under me. I canâ€™t afford almost all of my bills anymore and every job Iâ€™ve applied to has has rejected my application because of my lack of experience. But why would they accept me? Iâ€™m 26 with almost no experience anywhere (besides a fucking haunted house, no one takes that seriously) because I was stuck taking care of my father for years.

Job application rejection after rejection, I just feel like giving up. The bills are piling up, extensions are being denied, I canâ€™t get my kidâ€™s school pictures, canâ€™t afford to do laundry so she has clean clothes for school.. just a bunch of shit. I just feel like once Iâ€™m gone, someone would be able to make a gofundme or something and sheâ€™d be better off with that. 

It seems like as you get older, life sucks.
