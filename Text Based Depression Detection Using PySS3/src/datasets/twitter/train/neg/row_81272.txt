I want to dieI want to disappear into nothing. Go to sleep and never wake up. Iâ€™m stuck in a place I hate, with literally no way out. I have no money, no car, no prospects, no skills, nothing. I have nobody that can support me or help me get started with my life. My mom is in debt, and I havenâ€™t spoken to my abusive father in years. 

My siblings are living happy lives and enjoying life, which just sounds crazy to me. I donâ€™t understand how people can be happy. This world is unfair, itâ€™s beautiful for some, and for others like me itâ€™s the fucking saddest. 

Iâ€™m at my end. Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression since I was 15. Iâ€™m 22 now and itâ€™s only gotten worse. No amount of therapy has helped. 

Iâ€™ve tried too many medications (and yes I have given them time to take effect) and none of them has worked. 

At this point Iâ€™m considering buying heroin so I can at least go out in a numb bliss. 

I have no hope for my future, no ideas of what I want to do with my life, no drive for my old passions. I barely have enough energy to get out of bed, let alone do the shit that I have to that makes me even more depressed. Iâ€™m literally trapped in a place I hate with no way out. 

I see no point in living anymore, and death sounds like the sweet escape I need. Maybe enough heroin could make me feel something other than nothing until I pass out and stop breathing from it.
