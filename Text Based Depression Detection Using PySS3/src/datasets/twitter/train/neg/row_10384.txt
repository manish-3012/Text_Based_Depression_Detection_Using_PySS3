Two more monthsI'm thinking before Christmas would be great. But at least before New Years. Go somewhere far away where no one knows me. Cut off all contact. Then do it. 
I'm not sure how yet. One method I've heard of seems the safest bet but I don't know if I'll be able to get that together wherever I go. 
I guess I'll need to save up money. Not a lot of time left. 
In the meantime I need to be quiet about it, but honestly, not that quiet. I'm always worried someone will find out or check up on me. It never happens. I think it will be easy. 
People leave me or forget about me anyway. It won't be any different.
