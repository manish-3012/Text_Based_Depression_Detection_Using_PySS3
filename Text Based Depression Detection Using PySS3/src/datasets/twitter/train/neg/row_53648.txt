I am sad to say that today is my last day in this worldI am 23 years old. I have tried everything to improve myself. Nevertheless, it didn't work on me at all. I still am an asocial loser guy. I am not an empathetic person. I ignore people's feelings. I am not writing this to take attention and such. I am nihilist and pessimist. I neither had friendships nor did I have relationships. I didn't become someone's preference either in friendships or in relationships. I am good at my lectures, but this never made me happy. I always tried to sugarcoat my social failures with my academic successes. But guess what? DÄ°dn't work either. I just don't know if it will make sense if I decide to keep living just because I will be hanging onto some little hope piece. I just want to take alcohol until I black out, and then find a rope and hang myself. I know that after I suicide, there will only be a huge balnk. Darkness. Whatever it is. But isn't it where we all came from since the very beginning? We all came from the nothingness. So shall we end up in the nothingness. I think that's all I want to say to you, folks. Take care.
