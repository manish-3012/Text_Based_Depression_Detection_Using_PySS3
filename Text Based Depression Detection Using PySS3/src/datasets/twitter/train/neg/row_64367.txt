The home stretchI will be leaving in January... I've given up, and will be more or less just coasting through the holiday season.

My parents think I'm going to be going back to school for accounting for the spring semester... I'll sign up for everything, as if I'm starting over... I might even get a shitty job if they push hard enough...

I won't do any more than I need to though... Just enough to make it seem like I'm at least trying.

I'm almost there though... I'm almost done. All the colors are starting to change, and I feel like I can finally be comfortable in letting everything go...
