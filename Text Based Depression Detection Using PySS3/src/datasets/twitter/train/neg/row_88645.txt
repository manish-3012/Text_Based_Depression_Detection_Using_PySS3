Inner thoughtsI(20f) donâ€™t know what to do. Since I was young I believe Iâ€™ve had depression. But Iâ€™ve never talked to anyone ( other then my ex-best friend) I also have anxiety and struggle to talk to strangers and to be in an unfamiliar environment. Coming from a traditional Hispanic family they donâ€™t believe in anxiety or depression. Even when I once put myself in the hospital everyone of my family members thought I was crazy or did it because of a guy. Not once they ask about my emotional state. They lectured me about that every minute after. Itâ€™s been four years since then and each day is a battle. Each time I get older I struggle to keep living. I never wanted to be a functioning adult in society. I never expected to be alive. I feel like I canâ€™t do anything most adults my age can do. I am afraid to get a job. I struggle talking to strangers. I have real bad anxiety when it comes to change. I just want to end it all, but canâ€™t. Iâ€™m not looking for professional help. I just want to know Iâ€™m not alone. Or what I struggle with is normal?
