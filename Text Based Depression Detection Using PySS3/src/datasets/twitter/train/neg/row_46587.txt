April 7, 2017Im ending things. I want everything to stop hurting. Im worried about my family. They would not even have seen this coming. I feel selfish for not being there for when they get old and sick, to take care of them, but I cant do this anymore. I feel like theyd understand, eventually. Im not happy. I never will be. Ive been hurt too much that I cannot trust people. I used to be happy. Now, I cant even make eye contact with people. I avoid friends because Im afraid to break down in front of them. I keep a front that Im a strong person but I am so weak. My ex broke up with me saying that we're different people and he did not want to disappoint me anymore than he did. I begged to have him back but he cant. I dont trust people easily but he pursued me and I let him in. And just like that, he let me go. He doesnt know how much I had to go through to let him in and he never will. And I never will. I cant let myself hurt this much again. I cant even let friends in anymore. Im shutting down. Im scared for the future. A life without connections.. is not life.
