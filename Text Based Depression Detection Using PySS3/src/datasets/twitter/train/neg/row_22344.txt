I'm actually so bored with everything that i feel like i want to kill myself.It always ends up like this, i find things all day to distract myself from this feeling but then when i'm tired and want to sleep i can't. I start imagining myself dying in different ways or i go and fantasize about a girl or some other thought to keep myself from even trying. It always seems to end up this way but, i wish it didn't anyone have any words?
