I keep sinking deeper and deeperI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. Iâ€™ve lost complete motivation in everything and Iâ€™m constantly ridiculed for being lazy/fat by everyone I know. I hate going to school and putting on a fake smile. I hate having to act like the friendly, funny guy and having to strike up conversations with everyone. I canâ€™t handle it anymore. I just want to be free. I want to let go. I want out of this life.
