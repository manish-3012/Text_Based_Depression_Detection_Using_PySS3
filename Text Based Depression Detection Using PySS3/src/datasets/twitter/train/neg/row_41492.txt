Anyone listening, I am suicidal as well, but there are small ways you can help yourself...If it's loneliness... invite anyone you'd even slightly want to talk to, to join you at a coffee shop or somewhere else with wifi. Then it's super low stress and easy for both of you to spend time with another person with the added benefit of hot drinks, food, and playing on your laptop. There are plenty of people that would love to just do that.

Boredom.... join a volunteer program. You're never obligated to stay and you get new experiences and meet helpful people. Or if you want to travel go to WWOOF. net and live almost anywhere in the world for free in exchange for helping on a farm.

Toxic people in your life... Don't give those people the time of day or if that's not possible, then a little as you can by keeping yourself busy. Sometimes it's hard, but the answer may be that you just need a change of scenery away from those people. Moving can be one of the most stressful things, but it will work itself out once you get settled.
