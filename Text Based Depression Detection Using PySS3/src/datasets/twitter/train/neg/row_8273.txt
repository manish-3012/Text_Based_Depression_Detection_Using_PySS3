I dont want to dieI am 14, and I make my family's life miserable. My teachers, friends, and others love me, but I just can't make the right decision when it comes to my family. My mother is leaving on a business trip on Monday and we were going to do something special tomorrow, but I ruined it. I make my 9yo sister's life miserable. I put video games ahead of family. I dont want to die. I want to exist. I just dont want to have people around me to let down. I feel like all i am destined to do is hurt people. i have come to a point where i have no money, no will to do work, and no self respect.
