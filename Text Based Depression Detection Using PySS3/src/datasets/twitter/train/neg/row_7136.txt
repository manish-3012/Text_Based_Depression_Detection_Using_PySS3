University makes me suicidalI obsess with studying to the point I have no personality, and I've been this way ever since my second to last year of school. I don't think I have any worth besides my grades. I used to enjoy studying quite a lot and education is the number one priority in my "life".             
Ever since I moved to another country I have fallen into moderate-level depression due to utter disappointment (with myself and this place). Many of my professors suck at their job of teaching and I have to waste 4x more time outside of class to understand concepts that I should have learned during class. This happens specially with calculus since I am not a math genius unfortunately, and although I can teach myself science, I cannot do so with maths. Therefore I am left with very little time to do anything other than studying and feel immense guilt when I am not being productive.                               
I am not sure what is the point of living when there's nothing I enjoy doing any more and nothing I do feels like it's worth it.
