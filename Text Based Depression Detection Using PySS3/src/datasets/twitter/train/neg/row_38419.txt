Light Getting Darker, Anxiety Getting WorseIâ€™m fucking up in everything. Iâ€™m damn near failing all my classes. I trashed my car. Burning all my money away. Iâ€™m a damn burden and thatâ€™s all I can see. Itâ€™s a damn cycle I keep falling in. Iâ€™m done with myself I shouldâ€™ve thrown myself out a while ago but I thought it might hurt too many people. But shit me being dead wonâ€™t hurt their pockets than me being here now. I know theyâ€™ll miss me but most of it probably just a romanticized version in their head anyway. Iâ€™m not who they want or need me to be anyway. But hopefully this is how things meant to be, then Iâ€™ll have a reason for being here to start. And hopefully by the end of the month maybe Iâ€™ll finally give some people peace.
