I asked you guys for help yesterday.i posted yesterday but there was no response
so i deleted it

i tried accessing a chat site from your resources
didn't work

i couldn't call bc i'm constantly around ppl

i am done. 
i have just one question - how many pills does it take for me to reach a point of no return?

i've got hydrocodone, methylphenadate, bupropion, tylenol.... which ones?
