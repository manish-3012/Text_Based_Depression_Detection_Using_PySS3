Reaching the end of my rope for the sixth time :'(I lost my mother ten years ago to suicide. Afterwards I started following her example; I began cutting myself and that eventually led my first attempt several years ago. Since then I've tried four more times, been hospitalized twice, and lost many friends. I'm currently in Canada visiting a friend and the feelings of emptiness and despair are reaching catastrophic levels and I don't think I can talk to my friend anymore about it. She has been dealing with so much and she pretty much told me she doesn't know how to help me and I can just tell she's so exhausted because of me. I can't call the suicide hotline because my phone has no service in this country. I'm scared and shaking and don't know what to do :'(
