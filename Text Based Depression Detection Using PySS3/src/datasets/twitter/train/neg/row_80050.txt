Life meaningIf the meaning of life is supposedly to leave behind a tale or story of yourself, what really is the point if everyone is eventually going to meet the fate of many people already. We're all going to eventually die and forget everything that's happened (I am very pessimistic) My parents say that I should enjoy the life that I have been given, yet I always reply "We're all gonna die &amp; forget everything that'll have happened". I honestly think that dying earlier would be better instead of dying a slow and painful death. But I can't find it with in myself too commit suicide, is it just human instinct or what's going on?
