I constantly think about taking my own lifeIâ€™m 20 years old and I have nothing but online â€œfriendsâ€ who donâ€™t pay attention to me. 

I get so irritated all the time. No one ever wants to talk to me or show me they love me. Iâ€™m never the favorite.

Iâ€™m not the favorite at home either.

Iâ€™m a loser and a nobody. I always think about ending it all.

One day, when Iâ€™m not scared, Iâ€™ll do it. 27 years old.
