It feels like the past few years have just been building me up to finally do itThe past 7 years have been rough, every year more stuff goes wrong more frequently. I've had my ups and downs but lately I've just felt done with it so to speak.

Slowly my life has been crumbling apart to where I'm only able to live where I am because they pity me, an adult who cant even look after himself any more. My jobs slowly pushing me out and my family and I have pretty much cut all ties. My friend group got smaller every week until now there's no one.

Just me and my dog now, I want to end it without anyone I know finding out. Maybe pretend to go on holiday and just drive out into the bush and find somewhere secluded to do it. I dont know, but I'm  definitely nearing the end of my wits. I've tried so hard but there's only so much I can handle.
