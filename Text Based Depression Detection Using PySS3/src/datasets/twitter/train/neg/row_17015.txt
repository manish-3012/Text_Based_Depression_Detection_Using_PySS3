I wonâ€™t make it to my 29th, let alone my 30th birthday. Iâ€™m sorry. Forgive me.Suppose I never really realized it until today, but Iâ€™m all alone. Every day Iâ€™ve been struggling to think Iâ€™ll have one more good day, just one, and that would be all I need to give me the courage to keep fighting.. but I canâ€™t anymore. I had so many plans; I was going to go back to California, visit my best friends in Canada for my 30th birthday next year, and travel abroad.. but now, none of it matters.

I donâ€™t deserve to live. I have tried so many times to make things work in my life, and it never happened. No one ever cares about how hard I try. They only care when Iâ€™ve failed. Then they ridicule me, point out all my flaws, tell me I canâ€™t do better, and theyâ€™re right. I wonâ€™t ever. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™ve ever bothered anyone at all. Soon I wonâ€™t be such a burden at all. Forgive me, I just canâ€™t hang on anymore. Itâ€™s not worth it when I donâ€™t have a reason to live now.
