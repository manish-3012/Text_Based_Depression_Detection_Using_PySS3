iâ€™m so tiredi want to join my mom wherever she is. maybe thatâ€™s somewhere, maybe itâ€™s no where but wherever that is i wanna be there too. iâ€™m so tired iâ€™m running out of comfort in this world. my therapist says i canâ€™t keep saying that i wonâ€™t do it because people will miss me. i guess sheâ€™s right but thatâ€™s the point. i donâ€™t wanna keep going on forever, i donâ€™t even want to turn 20. i have 58 days until then and i donâ€™t think i can make it, nor do i even want to to be honest. iâ€™m tired of burdening people, iâ€™m an inconvenience and i know i am. itâ€™s not a matter of opinion, i am a burden to those around me and this world is a burden on me. i just want to close my eyes and not wake up, i donâ€™t have the courage right now to end it, but i really, truly wish i did.
