How to help someone who doesnt want help in this pandemicHow the hell am I supposed to support someone when I cant see them in person and when they wont respond to texts or avoid the subject? When they bring up the fact that they are suicidal and claim they are fine the next second? I can keep doing what they want and pretending everything is normal. But if i wake up one day and find that theyre gone i would never forgive myself for not trying harder to get them a resource, especially since someone else I know tried it and none of us saw it coming. So what should I be doing?
