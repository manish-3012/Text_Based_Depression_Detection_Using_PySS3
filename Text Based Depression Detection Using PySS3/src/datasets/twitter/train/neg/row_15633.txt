Suicide is not an optionIf you think taking out your life makes it easier for you to go to heaven, then u're wrong.

We don't easily go up there and suicide is not the end of your suffering. That's the beginning. If you say "it can't be helped, depressed people can't think straight", well, yeah they can't but what makes them won't listen is this kind of depressing stuffs that's gone viral, making other people think that they're the same (bandwagon)  
Stop spreading sad things in the internet instead. Depressed people need something to brighten up their life and not making their mood even worse.
