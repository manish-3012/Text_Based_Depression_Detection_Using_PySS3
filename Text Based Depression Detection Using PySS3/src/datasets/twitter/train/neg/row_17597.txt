I wrote this here 153 days ago and today it feels even more true than when I first wrote itWhen I was younger I never really considered suicide because I couldn't do that to my mother.  I could always imagine her reaction to finding out, and I could see her sobbing face, and I could hear her wailing, and I knew she would blame herself, so I never really came close to doing it. But recently that relationship has evaporated and we no longer speak after she stole money from me.  So now instead of my mom being a reason not to kill myself, now parts of me (ok, most of me) want to do it just as a huge middle finger to her.  "Enjoy spending that money, Mom! Buy yourself something nice.  It's on me!"
