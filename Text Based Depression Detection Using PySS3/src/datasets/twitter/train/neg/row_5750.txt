One thing to do before I'm gone?It's down to the wire. I have 15 opened bottles of Lysol right besides me here in my bathroom, and I'm ready for a few hours of agonizing pain to culminate into a blissful silencing of the constant ups and downs of this cruel consciousness. Before I leave, tell me one thing about this world that is worth my conscious time to experience.

EDIT: gonna provide some context: I'm in 10th grade, my grades sucks, my parents have consistently told me I'm "ruining the family", I have a keen interest in getting inebriated, I'm an anorexic guy for fuck's sake, and I haven't really hung with friends much in about 6 months since I was caught with an ounce of hasheesh and a few tabs of LSD. My family moved to Shanghai, China. My life is a laundry list of shit.
