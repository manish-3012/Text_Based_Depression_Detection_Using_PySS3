Itâ€™s over. For real.i feel like some people literally wait for you to fuck up so they can have something bad to talk about in regards to you

like families pick a scapegoat and gaslight them until they screw up and the ostracize them for that one mistake, like, â€œyeah! i told you so! this person not as great as you think, hereâ€™s their dark secret. there terrible!â€

its even worse when itâ€™s your own parent. we all start out this world innocent, it seems life is just seeing what fucked up shit gets added to your rap sheet. and if your parents are not trying to protect you? if theyâ€™re narcissistic and secretly hate you?

its only a matter of time before than blemish on your life becomes a stain that you are judged by for the rest of your life.

tell me, then, whats the point of even being alive? i donâ€™t want to be here anymore if iâ€™m going to be judge by a mistake i made as a pre-teen. my entire family hates me. at this point, 

only death offers the answers i seek. im gonna be gone before the summer is over. i can never come back from this..

sorry for sharing these dark thoughts
