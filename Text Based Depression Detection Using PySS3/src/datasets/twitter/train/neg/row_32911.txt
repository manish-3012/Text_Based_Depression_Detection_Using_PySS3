Please, I just don't want to suffer anymoreMy mom is dying of cancer and I just can't take it anymore. Soon she will be in hospice and I'm just supposed to go on like "oh well, it's a part of life." I don't give a fuck if it happens to everyone and we all die and blah blah blah. My mom is not just some random person, she's my mom. I can't handle it anymore. I've had enough of the suffering. I don't care if it makes me selfish. I'm done with this. I'm glad I have a gun.
