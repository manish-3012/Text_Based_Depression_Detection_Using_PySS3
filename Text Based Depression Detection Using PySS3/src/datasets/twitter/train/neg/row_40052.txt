I'm going to commit suicide soon.I held on for so long, kept trying in hopes that I would want to live again or I would find someone who cares. But all I've found is the realization that no one cares about me and I shouldn't live. I never should have been born. All my life people have reminded me of that. 

I frequently get bullied wherever I go. Maybe its my personality? I'm pretty quiet and keep to myself a lot.Â I guess I just look weak too, as the bullying would always start immediately. Adulthood has not been great either. Lost my job, no friends, no SO. My attempts to get friends usually fail. I have no reason to live. 

I've tried to reach out a lot lately, but no one ever cares. My dad just gives out generic advice and tells me to forget about it, my mom keeps giving me herbs. No one I try to talk to online or offline gives me the time of day. I don't see it getting any better, so I've just decided to kill myself after Christmas. Not spending another birthday alone. Here's hoping my attempt works. Sorry I'm unlikeable.
