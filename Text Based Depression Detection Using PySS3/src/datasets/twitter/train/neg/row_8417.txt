Trying to understand...Recently, the consequences of cyber-bullying have been shoved at me, again. 

That's my biggest problem, the word "again".  Its not a one-off, its not a problem that's diminished (obviously). And its an evolution of a problem that I faced most of my life. -_-++ Now, I was lucky; I had the ability and mentality to fight back. Every fight I've been in, I made them regret coming after me. But that was all face-to-face. Jerks would start trouble on messenger, but I'd see them the next day at school. I could look them in the eyes within hours of them trolling.

Today is a different day. Coward bullies can hide behind screens, and spit their venom half a world away. I WISH these cowards, or as we call them now 'trolls', would dare step up in person again. Its not cool, or funny, or incidental. A connected world means you're not anonymous anymore, your words and actions have always had consequences, they now just reach further..

So, Trolls, are you proud? Are you happy that people are quitting because of your words? That you are Literally responsible for their deaths??

To the victims, remember, these are Cowards attacking you. People that don't have the slightest clue as to what you face, people that have to spit their venom before it eats them inside, people that have to make you lower to raise their standings.. Don't let them. Don't let anyone rise above you, unless they're working as hard as you. And since no one else can walk your path, they'll never know the work you put in to live. Stand up, call them out, and if they won't face you, they're not worth a second of thought. Don't let anyone stop you from being the best You. 

Never give up, never surrender, scream against the universe if you have to. But remember, if you weren't needed, you wouldn't be alive now!
