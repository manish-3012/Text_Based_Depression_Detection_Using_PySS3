I fight an existential crisis on the reg.I find that I am utterly hopeless in life - depressed, scared for the future, regretful of my past. Iâ€™m a shell, devoid of all ambition. What is the point of being stuck in this miserable space, if we are all going to die? If everyone who we knows will all die? Is it truly worth it to live, for the 3 people that care about me, when I think about suicide so often, itâ€™s all consuming.

Iâ€™ve had happy times, Iâ€™ve even felt euphoria, but I am quite certain that it is not anything Iâ€™ll feel again. Whatâ€™s the point?

Iâ€™m not normal, i donâ€™t want to own a house, i donâ€™t want to have kids and i donâ€™t want to work my ass off just to live in a space just to pay rent and grow old and depressed. 

I hate this feeling, I hate society, I hate being trapped and having to push myself to get a meaningless job, just so I can survive. Certainly the government and society wants me alive so I can pay taxes, pay therapy, pay for meds.... but itâ€™s nothing that I want. I feel closer to the edge every day. It doesnâ€™t scare me, Iâ€™d get to be with my mom again.
