How did you find happiness?I'm only 26 and overall I have a nice life, but I feel deeply unhappy and have felt that way for a few years now. There's darkness inside my head. The world looks colorless. I panic and feel anxious just thinking about the future (which is what I do all the time). I dislike my job, it's unfulfilling and shallow, and I'm not doing a good job at it either. 

I used to be an excellent student all my life, but the corporate world drains me and all the dreams I once had. I feel pressured to live up to my parents' expectations (even though they don't explicitly ask anything of me). I feel like I have to prove to them that putting me through college in the U.S. and raising me was worth it, and the only way I can do it is by being successful, living the American Dream, and buying them a nice house, which I can't do because I'm stuck doing a job I hate and I feel stuck in life. I stopped having friends a while ago and haven't been in a relationship since I broke up with my first love, almost 5 years ago. 

I know my life is far from tragic. I know I'm lucky because of the opportunities I've had, and I've also worked hard for them. I know there's people in worse situations who still manage to be happy. I want that. I feel numb inside and the only thing that stops me from doing anything stupid is thinking about how much it would hurt my family. I'm too young to be feeling this dead on the inside. If there's anyone who's been through this and managed to be happy again, can you offer some advice?
