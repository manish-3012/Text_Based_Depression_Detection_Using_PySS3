I just want to sleep...My gran recently died and an ex of mine tried to commit suicide, we broke up when I was in a hospital for trying to commit suicide myself. I feel so guilty, I've been an awful friend to him, I wasn't there for him at all, I'm so selfish I don't deserve to live and take up space here... On top of this I missed a 1/3 of a school year because I was in the hospital and we have exams in two weeks which I'm not going to do well on. Every day my teachers tell me how disappointed they are... I've been having nightmares every night and only get about 5 hours of sleep. I just want to be done...
