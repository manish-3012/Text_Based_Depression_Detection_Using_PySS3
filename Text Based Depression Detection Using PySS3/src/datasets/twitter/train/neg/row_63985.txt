Suicide by wreckless decisionsLife has finally broken me. Lost my job due to COVID, unemployment has run out, canâ€™t find any job opportunities, car broke down so I canâ€™t even do my side delivery gig. Hundreds of dollars in the hole in my bank account and no longer able to pay bills. Most days I donâ€™t get to eat because Iâ€™ve cleaned my cupboards out and donâ€™t have money to get anything. To top everything off, my girlfriend whom I loved to death left me and moved out. The girl I gave my life to and sacrificed everything I had to ensure she was fed and taken care of regardless of me and my condition just up and left out of nowhere. I just have zero support system besides her, who is now gone. Iâ€™m now in the state where Iâ€™m too afraid to kill myself but have truly zero interest in continuing on. I drank near to the point of black out tonight and went driving on back roads hoping Iâ€™d slip off the edge into the trees. Currently drinking more kinda hoping for alcohol poisoning. Idk, just canâ€™t take it anymore
