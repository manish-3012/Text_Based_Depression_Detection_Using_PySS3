"The next truck looks good to.." Afraid of my own thoughts, help me!It started months ago, I was in stationary therapy... all went better, I got to work again, my scars were healing...

And now, it's back.
Thoughts about ending my worthless life... why I am here?
I have no task in this life. I nursed my (narcissistic) mom, but I moved out in my own flat.
New cuts are there, deeper and deeper... Thoughts about jumping onto the street and to end all shit.

I have a binge-eating disorder espacially at night, wake up every two hours, and when I get some sleep, I have so terrible nightmares because of my medication, that I wake up sweating and having panicattacks.
My flat looks like shit, dirty... my cats living her own life, they are sometimes annoying me.

I should end this. Everytime it gets worse... I can't always stand up and fight. My power is gone...
