Nothing seems real anymore... starting to plan my suicide.I have never had any specific plans, but I have started formulating it now. I used to drive along in my car and imagine crashing into a wall or just closing my eyes and not stopping... but that was a sudden thing, over quick and spontaneously. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I have hit a new low. The people around me just take take take and it's all anyone ever does. I got a divorce at 26 years old and then spent the last year in an abusive relationship. I am chronically ill, in pain all day long, no job or income, no car... all I ever do these days is journal my heart out in an attempt to keep myself from unraveling. 

&amp;#x200B;

My abusive mother finally apologized for some super nasty things she said last year. (I hadn't talked to her since) and she sent me 200$ for clothes. I bought some t-shirts and some new boots and cold weather stuff. (been freezing my toes off) and so I sent pictures of what I got to my two best friends and they saw it and didn't even reply... 

&amp;#x200B;

No one really cares about me as a person, just what I can do for them... and as a huge techie and DIYer, with lots of random hobbies and knowledge... I'm just a tool for people to use. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I am going to write out letters to everyone in my life and just address stuff and say bye... leave my journal with them for anyone who cares to read. They will truly see how horrible my mental state was... how crazy I am inside... 

&amp;#x200B;

and due to having 4 teeth ripped out last week, and more dental stuff later, I have plenty of meds to off myself... so idk.
