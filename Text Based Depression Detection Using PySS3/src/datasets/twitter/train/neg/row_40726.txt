I have a plan now. Enough is enough.Iâ€™m 36, and been dealing with depression for years now. Iâ€™ve been spiraling down for a while now and I donâ€™t see a way out anymore. I work a job I hate that I have to stay late at every night. It pays shit and Iâ€™m overqualified for it. But this is the best Iâ€™ve been able to do here. My girlfriend sees me come home every night, miserable and angry. I try not to bring it home, she doesnâ€™t deserve that. But I see the stress it puts on her. Christ, I canâ€™t even help her with rent, thatâ€™s how little I get paid. 

Iâ€™ve tried suicide a few times in the past. Something always kept me here. My mom would say something to me and Iâ€™d try to pull it together for her. I donâ€™t want to do it because of what it would do to my girlfriend and my family. But my mom passed away about a month ago. And my girlfriend is suggesting that I go back to my home state and try to get my career back on track. Iâ€™m pretty sure at this point that my old job wouldnâ€™t take me back, even after being there a few years. And I donâ€™t want to be 500 miles from her. She means too much.

I canâ€™t afford therapy. Meds do nothing. So thereâ€™s no other option. My girlfriend is going to be out of town this weekend for a wedding I canâ€™t attend, because money. I have a bottle of Target-brand Aleve at home. Iâ€™m going to buy a nice bottle of Scotch, drive to a random trail (I donâ€™t want her to come home to it), and just get lost. Itâ€™s not how I want to go out, but Iâ€™ll be out. If any of them see this, I hope one day they understand that none of it is their fault. They were the reason Iâ€™ve even lasted this long.
