I don't know what to doUgh, I just didn't go to work today because I could not. I'm gonna quit tomorrow if I'm not fired, I don't know what to do now. I'm obviously not functioning super well anymore. I could talk to a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but I would 100% be hospitalized were I to tell the full truth. Should I? I don't agree with them, no matter how bad I'm doing I'm not gonna kill myself, so I don't think hospitalization is the right course for me. But what else should I do, tell partial truths and try medicines and stuff that might help? IDK anymore. Maybe I should tell the truth and be hospitalized. I would lose my girlfriend, which would be bad...
