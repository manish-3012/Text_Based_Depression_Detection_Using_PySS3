I don't know how much longer I can hold on.All my life, I have been dealing with so much shit and I'm at my breaking point. Everyone keeps telling me that it gets better, but after 11 years of hearing it and things only getting worse, I have no more will to live.

This week, I have been daydreaming of just ending my life. I've tried to get better. I've tried getting help over the years. I've tried so much. I'm just done. 

I can't be honest with anyone about how I'm feeling or what it's like inside my brain. Therapy hasn't ever helped me. Years of being on and off different meds hasn't helped me. I don't see what the point of staying alive is when I'm so miserable. 

I keep trying to hold on for my mum. But, I just don't know how much longer I can. I don't want to be alive.
