dealing with relapseso two years ago I tried to kill myself, couldn't go through with it(too painful, guess I didn't want to die enough). I was in the hospital for three or four days before they let me out, then I did partial hospitalization for a while. My attitude improved, I took medication, got a therapist, and it seemed pretty good.  But actual life wise everything was the same, still had no friends, no real career, stuck wasting money struggling through school.  Now two years later I feel worse than ever. I drove out to the place where I tried to kill myself before, but couldn't really move, couldn't really do anything.  I really want to not be around anymore, but there's something invisible that keeps me from doing it. Maybe it's fear of death or whatever. But I feel like the same invisible thing makes me afraid of asking for help. I feel so afraid of everything. I don't want to go back to the hospital. I feel like shit all the time and I really just want to end it, but for some reason I can't.
