im just terrible at everythingim 17 and have literally no value to my life
ive had my 3 actual passions for things completely thrown away and now i just feel like complete void

ive been creating music for years but every time i try improving i get so damned upset and dissapointed with myself

ive always wanted to be an artist, but  every time i try to draw it looks horrendous when everyone else i know just seems to get it

the only difficult thing i felt even somewhat skilled at which is playing mordhau every single day i somehow am still completely garbage at with no point in improving

i failed school due to depression and i have a feeling that when it starts back up in two weeks im just going to off myself
