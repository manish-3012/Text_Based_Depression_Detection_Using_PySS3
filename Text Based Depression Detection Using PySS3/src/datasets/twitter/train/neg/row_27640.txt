I need help. Kind of tried it today and I think I'm trying it againIt's one of the shittiest days in my life. I just climbed up the fence in my boyfriend's rooftop even knowing that it could fall (very light metal). He managed to take me out of there. I'm in a 3 person literal triangle (serious relationship) and I took a peek in his facebook to see one message with their ex that I deeply hate. Saw something I didn't want to and made a fuss about it, they both broke up with me because they can't trust me no more (I checked my gf's email once and also told her). They still think I'm just trying to kill myself because I want to hurt them.  

I'm in my apartment now and I live in the 12th floor, and I can stop thinking that I'll hang myself or jump because they were the only real thing in my life. I hate my college, I hate my job, I don't have any friends anymore because of the triangle way of living. I have a lot of exams this week and important things at work and I think I won't manage to do anything like this. I just want to end my life so I don't suffer anymore, because I destroy everything. Edit: fuck I can type properly like this
