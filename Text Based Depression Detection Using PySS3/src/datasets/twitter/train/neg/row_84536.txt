I'm going to kill myself next month.I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia, depression, dyslexia and nobody has tried to help me, I've tried to fix my life and get on the right path but I don't see the point in continuing what am I ever going to accomplish? I'm a worthless wreak.

I can't even form a proper sentence, thats how worthless I am.

I'm going to smoke a few cigs then I'll shoot myself in the head, I'll spend the day in melbourne then I'll kill myself at a hotel. some might consider this selfish, but my family never cared about me anyway.

I'm not posting this for sympathy, I just want to get my story out there.

(sorry about my spelling/grammer)
