I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with meEvery few days I will just be hit with the overwhelming bout of sadness and when it happens i just want to fucking die and I canâ€™t help it I just want to die but I donâ€™t know if I will ever go through with it but other days itâ€™s almost as if nothing is wrong but I still have this thing in the back of my head wanting me to just end it but not to the same extent as others and I just donâ€™t know how long I can cope with it anymore
