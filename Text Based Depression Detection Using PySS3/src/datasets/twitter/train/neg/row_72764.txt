Unfortunately still here.Sad. I'm still here. Well my mental health is still just as bad and its affected my work so badly I'm about to get fired. I feel like I dont belong on this planet. No matter what I try, no matter what I do, no matter who I talk to I still just want to take a one step shortcut from the top floor to the ground. There is nothing in this world for me. How much suffering does one have to go through before suicide is no longer selfish and becomes selfless?
