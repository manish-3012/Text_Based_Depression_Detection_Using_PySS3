Basically, "telling someone" is a fantastic way to lose friendsSorry for the negativity, but having struggled a few times over the years, I can say with confidence that "telling someone" has been a terrible mistake.  First time, the friend basically said, "me too". The fact that I was thinking about it probably pushed her over the edge. She was dead six months later. Second time, the friend told me his mother committed suicide and he was still angry about it. Lost the friend. Third time, I don't know what happened because the friend never spoke to me again, won't respond to messages. 

That's three. I am never going to tell anyone again.
