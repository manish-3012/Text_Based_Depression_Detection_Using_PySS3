The is no escape from my views on life. (Possible trigger and things you should probably not read)All my life I have struggled with OCD My OCD has taken various forms over the years but my latest obsession I have been dealing with has destroyed my happiness and will to live. Questions constantly pop into my mind like "what is the point of living, what is living, why do we want to live, why do we do the things we do." I was able to deal with these questions for a while but now a new thought has introduced itself to me and now I feel I can't unsee it. Why do we feel. What are emotions? What is happiness? What is sadness? Why are they good and bad? And when these thoughts entered my mind my world died. I now try to suppress all emotion because they are nonsensical in my mind. Everytime I try to feel something my mind ask "why" I can't do anything without questioning it now. I can't get these thoughts out of my head. The only reason why I have not killed myself yet is because even though I can not understand why these feelings exist I don't want to hurt my family by dying. But I don't want to live like this for the rest of my life. Even now I am questioning why I am even fighting this. It is in my mind 24/7 I fear there is no escape from what I think is reality. I am constantly analyzing and obsessing over these thoughts now. I just don't know what to do or why I want to do anything. Nothing makes sense anymore. I wish I can just rewind time and stop myself from having these thoughts or force myself to forget them. I just want to forget so much.
