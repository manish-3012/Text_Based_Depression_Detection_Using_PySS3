Itâ€™s been 8 years with panic disorder and extreme depression. I canâ€™t enjoy a single thing. After a few attempts, this will be my last.I feel, and I have felt too aware of things. I have a great family. I have a few great friends. Iâ€™ve seen a psychologist and psychiatrist for the last six years. Iâ€™m going to quit my job. Iâ€™m going to turn my back to those who have attempted to help. Iâ€™m going to risk trying to find pain killers or even something stronger. I want to feel a high, and put a bullet in my head. At this very moment Iâ€™m crying. Iâ€™m organizing my things. Iâ€™m writing my goodbye notes...again. I want to go back to where I came from. The place I was before I was born.

This isnâ€™t random. It isnâ€™t spontaneous. Itâ€™s been 7 years of sleepless nights, unending panic, terrible physical pain. The worst part about it is that through this entire time I have tried to remain hopeful. Hopeful that I can find peace. Whether through not giving a shit, whether though spending more time with my family, even having my best friend Save me the last time I tried this. 

Itâ€™s a state of mind. And I have come to this conclusion through yeArs and years of dread and pain. Even when good things happen I dwell on when or how the next bad thing will happen. Iâ€™m not a kid anymore, Iâ€™ve lived long enough to make my impact. And I hope that the people close to me u derstand I tried. I tried for 7 years. And in that time the pain Iâ€™ve felt is unprecedented. 

I donâ€™t even know why I found this sub or why Iâ€™m ever writing this. Maybe someone will find it and gain some clarity. For those of you who are struggling I do suggest going to a psychologist. It WILL help you process information better. Unfortunately for me Iâ€™m done with that song and dance. If for any reason someone I know reads this, please know I tried. I tried for much longer than I ever thought I could. 

Money, fame, power, girls etc. it all falls desperately short of equaling happiness. Itâ€™s simply a state of mind at the end of the day. And I canâ€™t find it. I lost it when I was around 18. 

I think Iâ€™m going to leave my notes behind and take a drive somewhere. Find a nice place to view the world. To see what Iâ€™ll leave behind. And hopefully I can die in some form of comfort. 

I have always said this to myself... at the end, I may lose the war. But I have won plenty of battles since. I have seen life and what it has to offer. But itâ€™s not for me. 

For what itâ€™s worth. If I could do this all again,I think I would. And maybe the next go around I could save myself before all of it came crashing down. 

For the rest of us I leave behind. The ones who love life, the ones who canâ€™t stand it. Just know that this past 7 years genuinely given me a new perspective on life. When you are ready to die you actually have no problem identifying the things that truly truly matter. A new perspective on what is important. Hopefully after I am gone my family and friend take initiative to help struggling people like me. Hopefully they realize that the most important thing a human can do... is help another human. After all of this I truly believe that is what all of of us are here for.
