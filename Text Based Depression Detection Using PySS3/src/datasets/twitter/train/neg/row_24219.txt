Just signed off on my life.August 11, 2019

If I can't manage to make something of myself or find direction, that's when it's gonna be, by immolation. It's sort of like a contract with existence. 

Can't see any damn future from here or what ive done with myself. Life is such a bother. Such a damn pain. 

I think im too lazy to live. I don't wanna deal with the effort of it anymore. Too tired to try and fix myself or even do what's right. 

My best guess for finding *something* to exist for is to get horribly addicted. I dont want to get on any psych meds because i can't give up getting high. On nothing specific, just whatever I can get my hands on. 

Fuck it man im angry at every dumb piece of shit that ever told me this was all worth anything. Life is such a fucked up game. We all scratch and claw at each other in the mud to make something out of it. But no matter what you do and how hard you struggle it's just mud.
