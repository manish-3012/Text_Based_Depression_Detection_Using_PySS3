Writing to RelaxI happen to write things down every once in a while, part diary, part fiction, often in order to relax when I am very tense. And it does calm me down almost instantly, although the writings are not always very coherent as they are put down during extremely emotional moments.

So I decided to post one of these a this one comes off as better than usual to me:

"As much as the sense of self-worth, dictated by nature, entails a will to exist, the actualization of worthlessness, a state of being an object, a pile of flesh without actual reason, entails an immediate yearning for destruction, for the structure to break apart. This is a core of the concept of self harm, not necessarily a dysfunctional anger turned towards one's self out of desperation but a pause in the constant process of only one element of nature's near ceaseless control, that is mouth-fed self-worth."

And yes, I wrote this right after I gave myself a big bump on the head but I ran cold water over it and it is already getting better.
