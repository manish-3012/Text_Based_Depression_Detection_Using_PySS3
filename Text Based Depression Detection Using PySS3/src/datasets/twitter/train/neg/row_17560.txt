i don't know how to title thisthis whole last year has been a complete blur. i just feel like i'm trapped, and even though i'm aware of it there's nothing i can do to get out of it. everyone i know has started their lives and they're making something of themselves and i'm rotting here by myself. me being alive has no effect on anyone i know, because it's almost like i'm not even here at all. a day doesn't go by where i'm not thinking about killing myself. i've been getting into these states more often where my mind is racing, like everything is just white, i don't know how else to describe it. like i'm completely zoned out and i feel like i'm half dead. i can't make out a single thought in my head, it's all noise. sometimes it feels like a weight has been taken off my shoulders and it's like i've just accepted that the only way i'm going to escape is by taking my own life. i think it makes any anxiety about the future go away because there's always that escape. i dunno. i've been feeling that way a lot lately. i need someone to talk to.
