Any advice is appreciatedThings have been slowly going downhill for some years, it got faster since 2018 and the last few months have been even harder. I already wasn't doing so well and this week several events happened that completely crushed what little self confidence I had left. I'm with my father today to spend father's day with him and my throat is extremely sore from trying not to burst into tears. I have no friends, and I'm a failure for my family. I'm not writing this to get these off my chest, I figured that doesn't really help anyway. I just need any kind of advice that could be even slightly helpful. Thanks
