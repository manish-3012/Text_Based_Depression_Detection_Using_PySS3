I can't fucking stand this house anymore. My whole fucking family keeps trying to shove their opinions down my throat just so ill be just like them. They all literally fall for the dumbest shit and act as if I'm supposed to drink their goddamn bullshit Kool-Aid. I have literally nobody to talk to to the point where I'm posting on a fucking subreddit instead of speaking to someone. 

I can't have opinions anymore, because even if I say I believe something I don't, they'll always get pissed at me just to get their fucking power fix. They don't want a kid, they want a clone. They act like I'm Satan himself just for being trans. It's not just them disagreeing, they constantly tell me I'm going to hell, they hate me, god hates me, nobody will love me if I so much as change my damn appearance.

the worst fucking part about it is that they don't even know I'm trans. I heard so much of "I'd disown my kid if they \_\_\_\_\_." to the point where I don't feel like I'm allowed to be a human anymore. I feel like a fucking accessory or decoration in their home, they complain about having to fucking feed me and constantly make fun of my weight but then deny they've belittled me about that shit for years.

I can't fucking take this, I don't think this will even fucking help.
