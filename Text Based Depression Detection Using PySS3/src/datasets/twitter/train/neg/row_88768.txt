Losing everythingI am alone, and honesty, I dont see the point. During this summer, I found out my dad had cancer. I dropped everything and went to take care of him. When I finally got him back on his feet, I was told to leave. I was abandoned by my own dad. I went 3 weeks homeless cause my parents decided to disown me before college. 
I'm in college now, and well, its just made things worse. My friends from high school just laugh at me. I cant talk to anyone. No confort, just a constant reminder to the sad things in my life.
I posted here because I just give up. I want some reminder that I excisted. But in the end it'll seem to end the way things always end. One last mocker to my insufficent life
