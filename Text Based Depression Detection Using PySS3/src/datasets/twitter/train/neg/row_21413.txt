I don't know what to do anymore..So my entire life has been fucked up. I grew up abused and now married into abuse. I'm alone and every friend I ever had betrayed me. I feel as though I'm imprisoned living with husband and his shitty family. The few family I have live in another state and I don't have a car to escape. I'm pregnant with a child I don't want, keeping me trapped in my hell. The only time I get to leave the house is when I go to work where I'm also bullied.
 I prayed for death since I was 10 years old. I always puss out scared that there might actually be hell, but I can't take it anymore.
