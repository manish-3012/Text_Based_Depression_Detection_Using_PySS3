Growing Up With No FatherAs a 17 year old growing up with no father or male roll in my life it makes me angry like it would anyone else. Initially I don't think about suicide to make my problems go away, but i do think about death constantly, i think about how different people around me would take it, how it would happen but i don't think i would ever have it in me to end it all. I recently have went through a break up with a cheating girlfriend that i blindly loved for a whole year. I have a pretty good relationship with my mother and sometimes it frustrates me that she tries to over comfort me or feels bad when things like this happen. As a man i feel like that's the opposite of what i need and it angers me that i didn't have a father figure to teach me how to be strong and how to be an ACTUAL man.
