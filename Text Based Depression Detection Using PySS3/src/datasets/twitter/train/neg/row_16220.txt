I donâ€™t feel anything anymore.I posted earlier and then deleted it, but now Iâ€™m back. I just want someone to tell me what to do. Iâ€™ve always thought about killing myself, but I would find hope in small things...even when it seemed like there wasnâ€™t any. Lately, I just keep getting knocked down. All of the hope I had is gone, and I donâ€™t even know where to start looking. Iâ€™m not sure how to keep going and Iâ€™m not sure I want to. I just feel empty and I want this life to be over.
