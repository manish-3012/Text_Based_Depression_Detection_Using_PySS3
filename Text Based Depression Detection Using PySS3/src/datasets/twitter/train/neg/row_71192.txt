One last cry for helphi,  I don't reach out much. I am 22 m. 

2 suicide attempts,  one by hanging from my attic ceiling 8 months ago,  the other by fentanyl OD 4 months ago.  each time someone found me,  because I wanted them to.  I wish they hadn't. 

I threw away my scholarships,  my degree,  my relationships,  all through drugs and driven by my sick mind. 

I've been in the ward twice,  through php,  countless therapists,  psychiatrists,  and meds. I am just so tired. 

Lately the longing for oblivion through suicide has outweighed the work it would take to repair myself.  So much god damn work...I feel I've wrung out my resources.  I took people's advice.  I got help. I even took my own advice but I've only gotten worse. 

There are some train tracks in my town that run on a strict schedule.  I have loud headphones.  I can't stop thinking about that. Suicide hotlines sometimes help me through to the next day,  but the next day is always the same, the sadness and pain I see never go away. 

I gave up drugs.  I gave up sex.  I gave up everything I thought was holding me down. I found music.  I thought I found myself.  Every day I lose it all over again.  I wanted to change the world but it's not looking like I will be able to. 

sorry if I come across as an attention whore, maybe that's all I am. 

This is my final cry for help.  Please , anyone,  if you can help me,  help me find peace.
