I don't want to die, I just want to not exist for a while.I just feel overwhelmed with sadness, hopelessness. I feel like I can't keep up with my graduate school work, or my housework.  I have a 2-year-old who is really good, but they all throw tantrums and scream at you for part of the day.  My husband is also depressed at the moment, so I can't talk to him for fear of making him feel worse.  I have an appointment with a therapist, but she couldn't see new patients until May 1st (I made the appointment a month ago).  I've been binge eating the last week or two, hoping that food will fill the emptiness.  I don't want to die, I just want to take a break from consciousness for a while.
