{NSFW} I just want everything to stop.I am 14 years old, my dad is a complete asshole, he donâ€™t care for nothing, I have been in 14 states and in 25 cityâ€™s almost 6 months each city,(not gonna tell the country for privacy) so I would go to school to school when I started to make friends, I would go to another city, I am depressed, have rectal prolapse since I was 11, which is very very rare, I have anxiety and take medicine for it, have cut myself, tried suicide 3 times, I just havenâ€™t killed myself yet because I am afraid of death and the experiences I will not have,i am little sociopath and psychopath.

I love animals, I have two dogs and 3 cockatiels, I love they so much I wouldnâ€™t imagine my life without them.

but 1 month ago, my family adopted a kitten, she was 1,5 month old, and I loved her, but with time i begin to have anger of her for no reason like a instinct, but I still loved her, but I begin to suffocate her, I didnâ€™t know why and I would stop immediately, then I begin punch myself and the wall of anger because I was hurting a animal that I loved, this have repeated 5 times but In the 6 time my parents have left and I suffocated her so much that she pissed herself and almost died, I leaved the room immediately after that, disgusted with myself, I checked her 20 minutes later she was okay but 1 hour later my parents returned and I checked her to give food she have passed minutes before, I panicked and I know it was my fault, I run to my mother with her in my arms and tell her maybe one of our dogs killed her trying to play, but I know it was me.

We buried her a week ago and I feel disturbed, but if it was a normal person that person would be completely destroyed I am just disturbed.

 today I tried to kill myself again.

 I was with the knife in my throat I felled the knife cutting my skin but I suddenly stoped, I donâ€™t know why but I still want to kill myself but I am afraid of death I donâ€™t know what to do, I feel like a pain in my body, I just want everything to stop.
