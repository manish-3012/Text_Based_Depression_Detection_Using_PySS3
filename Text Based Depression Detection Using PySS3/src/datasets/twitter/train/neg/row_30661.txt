Everyday is getting harderI donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep going. Iâ€™m so burnt out and every thing I have to do on a daily basis just keeps wearing at me. Iâ€™m a shitty boyfriend, Iâ€™m having a rough spell at work, and bipolar disorder has twisted and tainted my view on reality. I am holding on by the strings of sanity and can feel them snap one by one.
