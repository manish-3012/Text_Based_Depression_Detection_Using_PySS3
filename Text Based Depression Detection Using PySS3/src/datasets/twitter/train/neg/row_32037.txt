Just meI was physically and mentally abused by my step dad I was starved at some points my real dad was accused of something he didn't do when I was young so I couldn't actually be with him at the time I was constantly manipulated by "best friend" my entire life he would use me for everything I had and make me really belive he was my friend when I was 11 I found a dead person on my family's property on east river mountain  and I didnt know he was dead I thought they were just trying to scare me because it was literally Halloween that night and had really bad nightmares that led to major sleeping problems when I was 17 my first girlfriend who I planned everything with for our future was turned into a drug head then I realized that my best friend since childhood was actually a fucking manipulative douchebag and alot of minor stuff in between then and now and early this year the ex i still loved alot shot herself and all these people pretending to care about her bothered me because they all had a hand in it my mom isn't in my life much because she's a piece of shit im not religious so like a previous post I wanna go into that nothingness that isn't anything I always hated myself and I hate alot of the people around me too every direction I look makes me not wanna keep going more and more everyone I knew are now on meth and other things to cope with life and they'd stab you in the back for more of it i seen 12 year old girls doing this shit and its become normal to see this stuff life sucks until the day it ends im 20 and already everything about life sucks I've turned away from everything and stay in my room i don't ever even wanna go out I spend my days reading and playing video games every 2 or 3 days I'll exercise i wanna be loved as well but noones gonna love someone like me who doesn't wanna even get a job because of the fear of people I've started to develop im not gonna kill myself but eventually I'm probably going to pain for a limited time doesn't seem as bad as living
