What's wrong with death?Every day I yearn for it. An end to suffering. There's nothing I want to do in life but die.

No matter what I do, I'm miserable. I haven't missed a workout in six months, but that just gives me a slight high for a couple hours, then it runs out. I eat healthy foods and take a multivitamin and fish oil every day. I have good times with friends. I have tried numerous drugs, and even the most effective ones just delay the suffering then intensify it. Not using drugs is even worse.

 I was unemployed so I got a good job, but the positive emotions I got from that wore off completely within weeks. I built a dream gaming system, but the enjoyment I got from that wore off even faster. I try new games and buy new things. Absolutely none of it helps, and just ends up making me feel worse.

I've been severely depressed for 10 years. When I was in junior high, people said wait until you're in high school. When I was a virgin, people said wait until you have sex. Then I did, and it didn't help anything. When I was in high school, people said wait until you get into college. When I got a full ride to college people said wait until you're 22 and you graduate. Well I'm 22, graduated, and have a good job, but none of it helps. None of it matters. Nothing is appealing but a drug which doesn't have a come down. A sleep that doesn't have an end.

So the question is, what is wrong with death?  I did not ask for life. Why should I continue to helplessly struggle against my suffering? What is there to gain by putting off death? How is life better than death? Once dead, one consumes no more resources, endures no more pain and misery, bothers no one or thing.
