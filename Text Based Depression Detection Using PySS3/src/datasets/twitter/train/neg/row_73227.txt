Follow up: I told herSome of you might have seen my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i4vf9n/how_i_fucked_up_my_plan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I told my girl tonight. She initially took it well saying it was ok &amp; that I probably didnâ€™t catch anything and that weâ€™d be ok.

Sheâ€™s since taken it badly, which honestly I canâ€™t blame her for but it is of course really hurting me.

I can only blame myself, of course- and I feel so sick &amp; ashamed at what Iâ€™ve done. Not sure how Iâ€™ll face her family or my own family about this if they find out. Iâ€™m not particularly good at hiding things unless Iâ€™m just fully numb day dreaming about ending my life. 

Gonna try my best to let the dust settle for a couple of days. 

Hope more than anything she forgives me &amp; we can continue working towards our future together. 

If not then I donâ€™t know what way to turn, other then a long drive to the coast. 

So it goes.
