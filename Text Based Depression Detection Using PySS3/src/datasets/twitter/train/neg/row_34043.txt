Once upon a time I could take anything.Long time redditor, second time poster. I need help. 
I'll try to keep this short. I've done a lot of shit that got me into a lot of trouble. I've been kicked out of both my parents houses (they're divorced) and most of my family hates me, which I'm mostly okay with. My step-mom abused me both mentally and physically until I tried to take my life last year, where when she found out she promptly kicked my ass to the curb. I stayed with a boyfriend and his family for a month until he cheated on me and kicked me out. Then I found a permanent house until I got evicted because my roomate was a theif and a dumbass.
So now I'm staying with my new boyfriend of three months. He's very good to me, but I feel that I'm a burden to him and to everybody around me and I hate it.
I just want to curl up in a ball and die just so I would stop dissapointing people.
