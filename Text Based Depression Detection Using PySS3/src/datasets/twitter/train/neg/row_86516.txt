I've been feeling different dince I was in fourth gradesince I was in fourth grade I liked to wear boyish clothes and I started to refuse wearing dresses and such things, and I HATED pink. and also I'd be having more guy friends and play more with them, but coming from a Muslim middle eastern family my mom didn't notice nor talked about it she just yelled at me for doing such things and ignored it. she'd guilt trip me into wearing girly clothes and wearing makeup nowadays and I'm really getting more and more uncomfortable with it. I'm 17 years old now and I don't think I can take it anymore, to be honest. now my hair is short and sometimes I wear binders behind her back, but now with my hair growing taller, I don't think I'll be able to keep on. it hurts thinking about how I'll be and how I'll look in a few months. and I just don't know what to do anymore.
