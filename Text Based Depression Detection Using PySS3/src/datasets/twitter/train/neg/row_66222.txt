I wish i could trade places with my cousinShe died of cancer and she had everything going for her, a cool job, a family of her own. All snatched away.

My life is godawful, i've been mob bullied, people think I'm an easy target, they also think I'm stupid and lazy. I'm unemployed, it's too hard to find work, I also have a disabled sibling and an alcoholic dad who I'm forced to like (I hate them both they ruined my childhood and most of my adult life, even up until now, bullying and violence all round) All my friends are basically gone, everyone has moved on. I spend days alone because I can't afford to move to a better place.

I should be the dead one not her.
