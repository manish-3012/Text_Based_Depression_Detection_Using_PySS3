Where's the rainbow after the storm.First post on reddit (whoop whoop go me!) so bear with me. I'd like to think of myself as a half decent person try my best to do well to other (karma and what not) but just seems like I keep getting shafted in life progressively more and more so. Was a drug addict and homeless for three years before I met my wife and I can 100% say she saved my life. We've been together 5 years now and have a beautiful son together with a daughter on the way. In the past two years my bodys started taking a toll from a combination of poor choices as a teen, smoking, and my line of work. I'm 23 already have had two heart attacks and going broke trying to fix my heart and my lungs so I can keep working in a field thats destroying my body. My muscles in my knees and back are deteriorating and I'm in constant pain almost 24/7/365 and it just seems to get worse every day. I was always taught by my parents growing up (at the time I thought they didn't know shit and were full of it) that there's always a rainbow at the end of the storm and you just have yo wait it out. Just feels like this is a long and storm both physically and mentally thats never going to end. I've lost my two closest friend, my grandparents, and my physical health has turned for the worst in just the past 5 months. I keep holding on for both my present and future kids and my wife but feel as if I'm just delaying the inevitable. I feel each and every day like all I want to do is relapse to old habits just to take the pain away weather its temporary or permanently. All I want to know is where is this God damn rainbow because it sure as hell feels like it ain't ever coming.
