I'm So Tired of Living.And I feel like I've never even really lived. I've never loved anyone, no one loved me, never had any friends, no one needs me, I won't be missed, I have nothing to contribute, I don't have what it takes to accomplish my arbitrary goals, I have no family, I can't connect to anyone, or be honest with anyone, and I'm always alone. 

I wish I had the stones to kill myself because I certainly have the means.

Not a day has gone by since I was a child that I didn't think of suicide to some degree. My fantasy is that I'll develop pancreatic cancer with a short prognosis just to take it out of my hands and I can fade away. I feel like I've been fading away my whole life.
