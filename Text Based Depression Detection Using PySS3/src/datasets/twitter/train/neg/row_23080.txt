Debating right now whether itâ€™s really worth it continuing into 2021 and furtherHonestly, I have no idea if itâ€™ll be worth it continuing into 2021 and going on further and further into life. Iâ€™ve genuinely been considering taking my life shortly before the new year so a scumbag like me can be left to rot in a shitty year. 

Because I like to think of it this way;
1. Iâ€™m a burden on everyone already,
2. Nobody would really miss me that much, most people see me as an inconvenience and a piece of shit which is mostly my fault, not theirs,
3. Iâ€™m already miserable enough and am incredibly depressed and itâ€™s not like itâ€™s going to get better it only gets worse even on Christmas thereâ€™s so much negativity because well Iâ€™m making this post on Christmas,
4. Iâ€™ll probably be blind in 2021 if an eye doctor fucks up a surgery where theyâ€™re cutting my eye open to correct a muscle so Iâ€™d rather be dead than blind,
5. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™ll contribute to society, Iâ€™ll just be the average 9-5 loser joe,
6. Society is going to shit anyways and at this rate Iâ€™d rather die on my own terms than deal with a rushed vaccine and commit social suicide which Iâ€™ve probably already half committed at the rate Iâ€™m going,

So you see folks? Thatâ€™s six GREAT reasons to commit suicide. Now, for reasons I shouldnâ€™t commit suicide, there arenâ€™t many. I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m gonna do it yet, Iâ€™m probably going to decide a bit and see if I feel as shitty as I do tomorrow. I just hate life.
