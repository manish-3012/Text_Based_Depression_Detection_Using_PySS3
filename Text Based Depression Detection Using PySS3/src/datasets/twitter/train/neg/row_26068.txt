Feeling THAT way... Talk to me?Hi. I'm a little frazzled right now, so, forgive me for any typos or poor grammar. I just had the *final* fight with my girl. We were together for over a year, then broke up for 8 months, after which I gave her a "second chance". I'm the not-biological "father" of an 18 month y/o little girl, so there's a kid that I'm very much in love with that I have no legal standing to ever see again. My (now) ex was so emotionally abusive, after two go-arounds with her, I'm just broken. I'll probably never get to see my daughter again, and I'm not seeing much reason to continue. What do I do?
