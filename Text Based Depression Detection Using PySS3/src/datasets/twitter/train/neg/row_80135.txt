Let's be real, most people stop giving a shit after a few weeks (if they ever even care at all)Suicide is a deeply personal thing. I've had two acquaintances kill themselves in the last two years. I hardly ever think about them. 

I don't want to kill myself. Im too scared to, and I dont want to be in pain. but some switch has flipped in my brain and my brain wants me to die. every day I have such strong suicidal thoughts. im running out of gas 

I wish my brain didnt want to kill me so much. I've been literally beating the shit out of myself lately. close fist punching myself in the face. Ive lost control. My forehead and knuckles are covered in visible bruises. I want to stop being in pain. I've saved up a lot of money for my funeral costs. for years I've been distancing myself from loved ones because i want to reduce the footprint of my suicide. It's inevitable I hurt my family. I wish i could make it look like an accident but that would only hurt them more i think. 

I still care about people and I want to LIVE. I'm trying SO HARD TO LIVE. I'm scared
