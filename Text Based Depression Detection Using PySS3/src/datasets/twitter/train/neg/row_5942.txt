Starting to think I should just set up a shop here.What is this now? The 5th time I've been here? 7th? Lost count.

It largely hasn't gone well. Hit a dip, start to question the point of my continued existence in the face of endless suffering, and get patronized, or accused of being selfish, or - one of my favorites - browbeaten while hiding behind the guise of being "helpful". That pretty well sums up how one human being sees the worth of another.

That's the thing though. We're all wrapped up in our own little worlds, our own problems. Why exactly do my problems matter? They don't. To any other person, they are background noise, a mark on the sheet that notes a person being alive, and little else. No one really stops to think, "My life is a rich tapestry of experiences, feelings, and relationships. So is that person." More often, the other person is just rolled into their narrative.

I'm not exempt from this, obviously. This tangent pretty well shows that. Being aware of it only heightens the irony.

I've said all I've ever wanted to say dozens of times. People with my kind of disorders don't get help, because that's not how this country works. I fight it alone, and that's just my problem. Not going to write that wall of text again.
