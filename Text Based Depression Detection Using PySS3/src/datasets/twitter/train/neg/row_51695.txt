My Dad is ripping our family up, piece by piece.First up, this is not about suicide, but I could not think of a better subreddit to post this in.



Our Dad recently has been messing the family up and destroying the roots of our family. My dad and mom always argue, leaving my mom in tears, and he does not even have any consequence in it. He once yelled at my sister; Get out of my fucking life, I don't fucking need you. My sister is usually left in trauma for the rest of the day and the day after. He makes us all miserable. I have a feeling this family won't stay together for long.





Please tell me, so we don't go ballistic.
