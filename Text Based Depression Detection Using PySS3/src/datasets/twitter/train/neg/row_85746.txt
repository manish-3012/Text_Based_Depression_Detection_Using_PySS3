Hi, I'm StuartI don't know.. I was flicking my pocket knife while smoking and had some pretty shitty thoughts hit all at once. I don't really want to go down that road again, and I don't want to sound like I'm whining because I know people have it worse than me, but I just feel so .. tired you know? Ive been not okay before. That's no big deal but this time I don't feel like Ill BE okay. . And it scares the crap out of me.

I'm 20 years old. White american but I'm in japan. Stationed here actually. I like video games and music.. pretty standard, eh? I don't know.. just, hi. 

It would make my day so better if I could just talk to someone. Not complain, cry to, or seek help from.. just talk. Have someone who likes me and cares how my day went. So, if any of you have time or want to just meet someone. I'm Stuart. How are you?
