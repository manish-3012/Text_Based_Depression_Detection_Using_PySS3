Good Houston resources?Just had a breakup with my girlfriend a few months ago. I cared very much about her and planned on spending my life with her. She broke up with me before she went to college and I was handling it pretty okay until I saw she has started dating someone else already. 

Iâ€™ve never even thought about suicide in my life before. Every waking hour of every day all I feel is the urge to kill my self and I donâ€™t know who to reach out to. 

My family I feel ill completely over react and try to get me admitted. 

Iâ€™m going to the military soon and I feel like I would be disqualified if they found out about this.

Where can I reach out to for help thatâ€™s anonymous?
