I feel so bad posting here I just want to kill my self so badlyI donâ€™t need help or anyone to talk me out of it or anything I donâ€™t have a plan I just need to vent about the fact that all I want to do is kill myself right now. I donâ€™t need anyone to waste their time helping me when there are many people more in danger I just really had to get it off my chest as all I can think about it escaping myself right now. The shame and longing and humiliation and lack of impulse control and the fact that itâ€™s all my fault no one elseâ€™s and Iâ€™m complete scum and unwilling to change I canâ€™t bear being myself anymore. I need to escape my own consciousness. Iâ€™ve thought about it and these thoughts arenâ€™t irrational. They are real. Iâ€™m self aware as ever and unwilling/unable to change. I bring nothing and if it werenâ€™t for any destruction I would cause to others I would completely be willing to kill myself. 

I am really a hopeless case. Some people have grit and goodness. Iâ€™m never going to get better and the worst part is I donâ€™t even want to. My poor parents. They had no idea they were creating a selfish evil little ball of blackness...
