Suicide is amazing. I don't care what anyone says.LOL I know nobody is gonna read this but w/e

My car insurance got cancelled because I was 9 days too late. Now I owe on the whole policy. And my new policy is going to cost $600 a month.

So I did some research, and I've found the perfect suicide method. No, I won't share it. If you truly want to die, you will find it.

After my last attempt I vowed to never try it again. All my therapy worked, and I could no longer attempt to kill myself. But that didn't make the pain go away.

All that happened is it made me feel like I was trapped, and there was nowhere to escape to. And that leads me to do extremely self destructive things. Last year, I almost caught a felony charge over the things I said on the suicide hotline.

A couple weeks ago, I started to snowball, so I tried drinking it away. My dad found me, and threw out the bottle. So I beat the shit out of him and choked him out. 

So yeah, suicide is back baby. Ever since I've discovered this method, I've felt free.
