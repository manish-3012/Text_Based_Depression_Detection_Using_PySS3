I shouldnâ€™t feel this way but I do and I feel so badMy parents love me, Iâ€™m in a relationship where my partner loves me, I switched my major in university to doing something that Iâ€™m interested in, my grades arenâ€™t complete shit, I have a lot of reasons to not want to kill myself so why do I feel like itâ€™s the only way I can actually be happy? 

Iâ€™m in this constant state of anxiety about my future and just I feel so alone? And isolated. And I feel like no matter what I do in my life, Iâ€™ll never be good enough for my parents or for anyone. I couldnâ€™t meet anyoneâ€™s expectations because I knew doing what others wanted me to do wouldnâ€™t make me happy. I started doing the things I wanted to do and it turns out... Iâ€™m still not happy.
