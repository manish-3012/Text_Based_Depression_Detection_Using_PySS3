Goodnight.Not sure how to start this. So a little bit about me, I'm a kid who had to grow up early and realize that his life isn't like the ones of people around him. I grew up with my single, ignorant mother and an older brother who hated me to the bone for things my father did to him while I was not even born. Currently I'm 17 and my life is a mess in which I see no light shining inside, I have lost everyone around me, only a few friends that I text from time to time who have moved on. Which leaves me here, writing into the abyss that is Reddit. I am just tired, goodnight.
