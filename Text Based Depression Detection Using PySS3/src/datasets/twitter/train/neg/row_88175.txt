I feel numb.I just donâ€™t know anymore. Iâ€™m done with hospitals and Iâ€™m done with inpatient. Iâ€™m done with life. I donâ€™t understand why whenever my life goes good shit just gets worse a day after. I can never be happy. I just wanna run away. I want to be gone. 

Iâ€™m trying to grow up but my parents say no. Iâ€™m 15. Yes Iâ€™m young but I canâ€™t live my age I need to grow up ASAP so I can get my life together and just be responsible. I guess Iâ€™m not meant for the life I need. I try to get HRT and my parents wonâ€™t even try until a fucking therapist at PHP requires an appointment before I can discharge. That was a month ago+. I donâ€™t know if I can make it. Iâ€™m in prisoned in this body. This horrible female body. Iâ€™m meant to be a guy but everyone is against me. I donâ€™t know what to do. I think Iâ€™m going to start planning... maybe thatâ€™s a start to happiness.
