when's my turning moment?when i google "i want to kill myself" all i get is articles written by people who have tried and suddenly, in their near death, changed their minds and realised that life is beautiful and how could they ever be so selfish to want to die? and then some miracle happens and a jogger with a bunch of narcan shows up or they hit a trampoline falling off a building or something. I've tried to kill myself more times than I can remember and I've never had this moment. every time i fuck it up somehow i just want to die more. i don't have any reason to stay, everyone hates me. i'm sure any funeral i'm given will be more party than ceremony. but nobody will notice i'm gone. i'm here and all i fucking do is hurt. i'm in so much fucking pain and there's been no redemption to make it worth it. i just wanna die or have my moment but i can't get either because i fuck everything up
