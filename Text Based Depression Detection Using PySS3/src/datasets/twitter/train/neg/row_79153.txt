Iâ€™m running out of ways to distract myself from these thoughtsI lost my job months ago and have nothing to do all day and am losing interest in all the things I enjoy. When my mind rests all of these thoughts start coming in about how this must be the end of the road for me and thereâ€™s no point continuing anymore. I donâ€™t have a purpose. I donâ€™t have something that gets me out of bed in the morning. I canâ€™t take being trapped like this anymore. 

Everything going on in the world is too much and I feel like I am contributing nothing by continuing to exist. I had such a good life and had so many privileges but Iâ€™ve wasted all of it. I canâ€™t see any kind of future for myself where Iâ€™m happy, but also I donâ€™t think my happiness matters in the grand scheme of things. I had always thought of myself as someone who can rise to the challenge of a difficult time in life but now I see that isnâ€™t true. I canâ€™t handle it anymore. I want out. 

But I donâ€™t know how I would even go about ending my life in a way that doesnâ€™t put my partner in danger. Heâ€™s in a vulnerable group to covid so I would hate for him to have to have contact with more people than necessary. The other people in my life donâ€™t feel real. Theyâ€™re just faces on a screen. I donâ€™t interact with anyone in person because of my partnerâ€™s health and Iâ€™m starting to feel like i donâ€™t exist either. 

Iâ€™m always in search of the shiny new thing that will distract me from the dark thoughts even momentarily. Buying things I donâ€™t need with money I donâ€™t have. Finding some kind of food or game that sounds good and my mind kind of goes blank while I make it or play it. But it doesnâ€™t last. I get tired of everything so quickly these days. I am trying to get a job, but I canâ€™t imagine being able to be mentally present enough to work right now. 

I want to tell my partner that Iâ€™m barely functioning but I canâ€™t have the only person I ever interact with be looking at me like Iâ€™m some kind of glass vase thatâ€™s about to break. I already regret telling him about my anxiety. I just want to feel normal for one fucking second.
