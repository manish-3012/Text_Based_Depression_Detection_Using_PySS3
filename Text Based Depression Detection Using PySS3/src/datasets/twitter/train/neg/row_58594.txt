i can't keep doing this to myselfeveryone has left or will leave me im a burden to all of them i can tell. ive had one suicide attempt already but pussied out last minute. I've started to self harm again, quarantine gives me to much alone time to do this. i have scars on my wrists and legs and my parents see them and don't say anything, I've tried to convince them to take me to see a therapist maybe and it makes me embarrassed to ask. but they refuse or say that im putting myself in this situation. ive tried ive tried to keep people and try to be there for them but they take advantage of me or they just get bored of me and leave. i really have no one to talk to, no one who will listen, no one i can go to for help. i just dont think it's fair to myself to stay here and feel like this year after year. im so tired of myself and this world, i just want to bleed out and sleep forever.
