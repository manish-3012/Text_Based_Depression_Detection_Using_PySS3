I will like to die and be with my mum, I am ready, but howfor weeks i have been wondering random graveyards and just sitting in them wishing i was dead. I have had enough of life. I am done. I want to be with my mother. 
I have nobody who will miss me besides my cats. 
So question is which is the least painful and least embarrassing? 
I am think crashing my car but i do not want to hurt anyone else in the process, which is why i am in two minds about it.
