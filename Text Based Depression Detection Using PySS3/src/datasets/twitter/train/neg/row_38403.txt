I'm feeling suicidal...Hey it's me again,
I'm in my 2nd year of apprenticeship, 2 girls cheated on me, i hate my dad, my ex best friends made jokes about me so i don't really know when my current friends make jokes if they are against me or not.

I've been doing sports (like going to gym, or running around) since one year but in the last 2 or 3 weeks i lost my motivation, because my depression got worse and worse again. I cut myself too.

I snapped with a girl (i really liked her), but i stopped snapping with her cause i felt so depressed again and now im scared if i start snapping again i will disturb her.
