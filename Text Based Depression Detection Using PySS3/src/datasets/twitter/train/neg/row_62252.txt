18, sexual orientation induced homelessness, no money, depressed,  etc...So I got kicked out of my parent's house for a multitude of reasons. There was some physical abuse. And emotional abuse. I tried killing myself twice and had a well-established plan on making sure it would work the third time. Alas.

I graduated highschool and my parents suggested I stay back a year from university to earn money. I was accepted into three of the top universities I applied to. I took an online course. My father would routinely disconnect my internet, scream at me, and my mother would hit me on occasion. On top of this great stuff, I kind of had the troubling realization that I'm gay which is just fucking wonderful. 

I've pretty much been contemplating suicide daily, cutting my arms dangerously close to my wrists, etc.

So I'm crazy.

Well I've been staying with my boyfriend for the past few months, and am at a standstill:

- I have tapered (entirely) off of Cymbalta which was causing me to be horrendously suicidal.
- I cannot afford my Vyvanse due to my total lack of money.
- I lost my wallet with all of my I.D.
- I am ridiculously skinny.
- I know no one in the city I'm at.

So is taking fifty 50mg Tramadol a good way to off myself? Or could anyone suggest an alternative to suicide?
