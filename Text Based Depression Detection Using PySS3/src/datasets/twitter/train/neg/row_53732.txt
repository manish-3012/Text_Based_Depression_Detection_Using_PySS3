I'm embarrassed to consider myself a suicide survivorI "survived" because I'm a dumbass, I survived because I was crying and couldn't see the rope wasn't tied correctly, I didn't get injured, and I didn't pass out.

I hung myself, fell on my arse stood up and got drunk, I don't deserve help because I'm a failure.
