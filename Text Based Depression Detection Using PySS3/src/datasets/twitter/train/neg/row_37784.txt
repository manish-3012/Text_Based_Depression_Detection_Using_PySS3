Iâ€™ve never been this disappointed in my life.Iâ€™m sitting here thinking about how I donâ€™t want to be alive next year so Iâ€™m trying to make a plan to follow and Iâ€™m just disappointed. I have no energy to even think about how Iâ€™m going to end my life. And Iâ€™m angry that I was even born in the first place. Iâ€™ve been let down by everyone in my life and now I have no one. Itâ€™s the same day on repeat for years. Does anyone feel like they donâ€™t deserve this? Im just so incredibly angry and disappointed.
