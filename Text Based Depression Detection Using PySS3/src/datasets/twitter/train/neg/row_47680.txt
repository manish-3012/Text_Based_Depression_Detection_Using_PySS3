Serious Suicidal Thoughts Make Me Feel Like I don't hate life.. I guessToday I woke up thinking that tomorrow I'm going to buy a gun and kill myself.  I looked up the closest place to get a gun and went to work fully convinced that tomorrow I'm going to buy a gun.  This initially put me in a fairly good mood.  

Then, during my lunch break at work when I was doing some suicide related searches I started feeling sad and got some tears... so I figured that I'm not ready &amp; I must like life enough to feel kind of sad at the prospect of dying.
