I'm slipping, and I think I'm going to fallHi. I've been depressed for awhile now and I feel like everything that has happened so far in my life is hitting me at once. I'm in pain, emotionally and physically. I'm tired of this feeling and i don't know what to do... I don't know how to fix this and if I even can. I am just hoping someone can help.
