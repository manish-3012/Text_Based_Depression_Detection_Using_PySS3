Ä° am losing my mind...Ä° dont know how i can endure this bullshit ...  
Ä°am 21 and suffered almost every stage of my life , things are not going on my way , worst thing is everyone hates me even my family too . They think iam a failure.
Ä°am an university student but my grades like an  rotten apple on the tree... i have no motivation or energy. And dont have a girlfriend still virgin . Why i should keep up for nothing ?,  for more suffer ? or more failure ?
Ä° just want peace , love and some money...
Ä° know there is still some hope but i tired keep fighting it is pointless , i hate it i just want some victory . Ä° am looking for a gun but it is hard to access on my country . Ä° just dont want hurt anymore... it is enough.  Ä°f people interested in motivational videos please watch 
(Why we choose suicide Mark Henic) it relaxed me one bit . Ä° need your prays too
