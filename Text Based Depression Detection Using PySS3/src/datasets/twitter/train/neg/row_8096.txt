I'm beginning to hate everyone around meI have somehow convinced myself that people don't really give a rat's ass if I were to kill myself. I feel like they only seem to be concerned out of obligation. Any time my mother asks me about anything, the memory of her telling me she'd hate to clean up my body if I kill myself replays in my head and it just sets the tone for everything anyone says to me now. I hate that they pretend to care, I don't need it
