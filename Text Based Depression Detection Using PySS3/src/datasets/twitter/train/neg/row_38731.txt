I just don't understand life at allSo apparently I'm immortal. I just spent the last 2 weeks solely on perfecting my suicide attempt to the point where I quit my job and spent money ridiculously. First I tried drinking an abundance of everclear and coming from a non drinker I swore that would off me but nope. Then I tried the charcoal and did soooo much research and no matter how many times I tried, NOTHING. I feel like I can literally feel the carbon monoxide in my body but for some reason I just won't die.

At this point I'm gonna have to just hang myself or buy a gun and get over the pain because I can't live like this. I don't know any drug dealers so no fentanyl for me. I just need someone's help, can someone dm or just comment on ways they can help me better my attempts
