Death is the only release. I'm sick of no advancement in life. I'm 38 and am homeless. I've never owned a car or had a girlfriend. I've never been able to afford a doctor visit. I'm just an obstacle in the way of progress for everyone around me. I can't afford to go to school and my health won't let me join the military. Volunteer work does not put food on the table. If I could afford a table. I'm supposed to be searching for a job on this computer right now. There's nothing out there I'm qualified for that would allow me to earn enough money to pay rent. 

Since I can't have anything in life and I'm doomed to keep being woken up by sprinklers or some cop telling me to move along, I'm going to kill myself. There is no way that enough could be fixed fast enough for me to give a shit about living life anymore. I'm a complete failure and since all of my family is dead I'm going to join them in death.
