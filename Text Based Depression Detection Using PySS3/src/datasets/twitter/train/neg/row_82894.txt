Can I ask school not to inform my death to classm?Not just classmates actually. It would be the best if teachers and friends don't know. There was a person in school who kill herself and it was on the news. School told every student what happened as to provide emotion support if needed. I don't want that.

I know most of them truly care about me. And some of them can be too curel to themselves. I don't want them to think it ia their faults that I kill myself. Especially my teachers. They don't deserve this. I don't want to scar them for life.

As for my classmates, they are all preparing for the entrance exam. It is terrible enough to be a teenager and dealing with a nonsense exam. I don't want to affect them or anything.

Could I leave a note for whoever find my body not to inform school? Simply tell them I moved or I leave the country or tell the principal to keep the secret?
