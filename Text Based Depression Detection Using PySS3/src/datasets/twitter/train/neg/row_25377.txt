I don't want to get better or be better anymore. And I feel so guilty for that. I just want it to be overknowing my life is perfect and that i could choose to try and be okay or be functioning and do things doesn't matter to me. and choosing to die or want to die in spite of that, when i feel fine for the moment, makes me feel really guilty.

 i wish i could drop dead. but even thinking and wanting that makes me feel even more  guilt.
