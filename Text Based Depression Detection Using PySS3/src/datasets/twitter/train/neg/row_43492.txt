Why am I a cowardI keep on trying to kill myself but I just can't do it.  I always lose my nerve at the last second.  I hate myself so much, and these failed attempts make me hate myself more, because it seems I'm only doing them for attention.  I don't even know if I'm suicidal and I'm doing this for attention.  I just hate myself so much, and want to talk to anyone
