very very long rant about what a worthless little shit i amNo one In my real life knows I'm this depressed they all think I'm just moody. It all started when I left home to go to college. That was when I relized I had no motivation at all and my grades started to take a nose dive. By the end of the semester I was looking at random objects and wondering how they could kill me. I prayed every night that God would take cancer from someone who wanted to live and give it to me. It got worse when I moved back to my parents house. Everyday my mom told me that between her mother in Africa and my attitude we were all stressing her out. She wanted me to go school and be like my twin sister who has all the scholarships not to mention she's skinner that I am eats whatever she wants and still has an 6 pack and perfect theeth. I need braces and 8 theeth removed. I'm over weight and have a sugar addiction. In the 19 years I've been alive no man has ever told me i look beautiful which adds on to the self hatred. When I told my friend I've never kissed anyone they laughed at me and said that was embarrassing. I feel worthless, lonely and an overall disgusting human being who doesn't deserve to live. And why should I when everyday I wake up my heart physically hurts from all the emotions I keep inside. My mom asks me what I see myself doing in the future. I say I don't see myself doing anything. She thinks that means I don't know what I want to do. It actually means I'll be dead by my own hand. At the end of the month my mother will come back I have a better chance of not surving if she's not there.
