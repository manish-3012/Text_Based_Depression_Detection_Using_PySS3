I don't want this anymoreIt hurts too fucking much. What's the point in trying and trying? It's like I'm drifting in this immense ocean while hundreds of hands are trying to pull be down and while desperately reaching for something, anything to stay afloat, but everytime I do, more weight is added pushing me ever further down. I just want to give up and drown in that sweet nothing. There's nothing left for me here, but pain and more pain. And to what end? Another day? Another week? Another month? Let it stop, please let it stop
