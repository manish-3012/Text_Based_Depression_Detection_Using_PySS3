with every day that passes, i get more comfortable with the thought of slitting my throatmy parents aren't here for me. they couldn't give two shits about my mental state or about raising me like real parents would. i wouldn't mind strict if i at least had a mom that held me and told me she loved me and that i could come to her with anything. but no. i have a monster for a mother and a two-faced father.

i don't want to live to 18. i'm content with dying right now. i won't do it but every day i spend on this Earth i gradually get more reasons to do it.
