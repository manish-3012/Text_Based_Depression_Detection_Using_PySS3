Just don't like life much at allI'm not good at anything, I have no positive traits, bad shit happens to me, people fuck me over, people hate and are embarrassed by my uselessness. I'm not delusional, sure it would make people sad, but it could honestly no bullshit be good for everyone in the end. One less person to feel sorry for, one less mouth to feed, no more worrying. 

I'm not even terribly upset writing this, I pretty matter of factly think If I were just to be deleted it would be best. I have nothing that truly makes me happy. 


Maybe it's narcissism, maybe I can't accept that I am shit. I'm sure if I were talented  or liked it would be better. Its not depression that a therapist could help with. I just don't  like my place in this world and give up. I have absolutely no answers.
