Please HelpUnmotivated to do anything. I want to be moral but I canâ€™t. Catholicism has ruined me. Every time I see a church I long to have the feeling of bliss I had when I was devout but I know itâ€™s all bullshit. 

I was supposed to go to therapy soon but the wait time is too long and I donâ€™t want to do it over the phone. 

Iâ€™m not moral. I have voyeur fetish and I canâ€™t get rid of it. Guilt is immense. 

Pm me and help me please
