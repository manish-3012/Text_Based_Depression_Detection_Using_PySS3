I have no idea how to handle thisSo, I'm not at all suicidal myself. Unfortunately, my girlfriend is. We're both 16 years old and have been dating for a year and a half. I lost everything from my first kiss to my virginity with her. Our relationship is very close.

She's had bad depression and anxiety issues for awhile. Over the summer I convinced her to get a psychologist because of that. Despite that her depression has just continued to worsen. She's told me she can't tell her psychologist how bad it really is, like there's a mental block stopping her.

One of her friends died about a week ago. Since then she's been telling me that she wants to kill herself. I didn't take it seriously enough at first, because she made it sound like she kind of wanted to but wouldn't really do it. But I'm starting to get frightened now that she's told me she has to fight off the urge to every night. I also caught her looking up suicide methods online the other day. I'm 100% sure she's not the kind of person who would pull this kind of stuff for attention or some ridiculous reason.

 I'm the only one who knows this, she won't even tell her psychologist because she's afraid she'll be forced to stay at a mental hospital. I'm just a 16 year old kid, I don't know what the fuck to do. Should I tell her family? I don't know them very well, but I assume they would flip shit and my girlfriend's life would be messed up for awhile. What kinds of things can I tell her to reassure her or prevent her from doing something stupid? I really don't want to be the one responsible for her death. 

Oh, and she's not scheduled to visit her psychologist again for another week or two, I think.

Thanks for reading this. Apologies for any weird grammar, it's past my bedtime.
