I wish I knew what I was supposed to be doing(Please donâ€™t reply to this, I just have no one to talk to and need a place to vent) I donâ€™t know. I canâ€™t think anymore. I wish I knew what I was supposed to be doing so I could stop thinking all the time. I wish every day didnâ€™t feel like a tragedy. I wish I didnâ€™t hate myself. I wish I was someone else. Wish, wish, wish. Itâ€™s all I do, just like thinking. I just sit and think and do nothing until my brain is so fried I canâ€™t think anymore. I just donâ€™t know. My brain is jelly. I wish I could sleep more. I wish I wouldnâ€™t wake up so I could stop doing this. I wish I could have one day where I feel ok. If I could just remember what being ok feels like I think I could stand everything. I donâ€™t know anything except that I hate myself, itâ€™s the only thought I can hold on to. Iâ€™m tired.
