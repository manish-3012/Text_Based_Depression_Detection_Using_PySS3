I'm giving this one last chanceI am reaching out to every person and community i have talked  to, and i am giving you all one chance to change my mind. I have accepted the fact that i will be hurting a lot of people, but ripping off the bandage now is better than me being the lazy depressed shit that i am until everyone hates me. To my family and friends i say sorry, i hope you understand this is what i wanted. I am convinced i will never feel better. No therapy or medication has done anything for me, and i am so early on in my life that i don't have ground to stand on, i rely on other people so much, and that makes me a burden, no matter what anybody says. If i were gone, people would be sad, yeah, but they wouldn't have to deal with me anymore. I am a parasite, one that leeches resources off of other people while also managing to drag their mood down with me. My only regret is that i didn't die to the illness i should have as a child. Sorry about the incoherent block of text.

TL;DR:I'm reaching out one last time, i thoroughly believe i am a burden and a parasite, and that i will never ever feel better. I invite you to speak your mind, thank you for reading.
