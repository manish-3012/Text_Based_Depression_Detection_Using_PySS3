How to make my death the least painful it could be for my girlfriendHey, this post is pretty straight forward, I have a Long-Distance girlfriend which I love a lot. I'm gathering the stuff I need to commit suicide I think it'll take me a few weeks, I think life is just not meant for some people, and if you've ticked enough boxes of trying like (going to therapy, getting medication, new hobbies, talking about it with other people, giving it time etc etc...), than you can go with a mind more at ease.  


 Anyhow, my girlfriend is very important for me and her mental health isn't the best, she has a high functioning autism and I don't know how it'll make her deal with it differently than a "normal" person would?  
 If that makes any sense, just giving some more information, if you want to know more, I'd gladly share in the comments. Thanks  


I know each case is to it's own, but are there any universal things one could do in order to ease the pain of their SO?
