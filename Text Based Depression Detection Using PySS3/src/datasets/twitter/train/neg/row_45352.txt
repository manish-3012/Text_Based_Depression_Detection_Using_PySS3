Drugs are really coolSedatives don't really have too much of an affect on me, be it oxyz, Percs, or any form of narcotic. Even weed, I guess I have a high tolerance. But amphetamines are good. I just graduated highschool not too long ago, so I don't have constant contact with my dealer as much as I did before. I don't have a car, I have a bike, and by bike he lives about an hour away. There's this really dangerous intersection I would have to cross in order to get to his place. I'm thinking I could bike through there with my eyes closed while the red light is on, since getting hit with a car in that highway going that speed will likely kill me. If I get hit and it doesn't kill me, I'll at least feel something. And if I don't get hit at all, then I score some speed which is currently the only thing I know that'll make my life feel worth while, even if it's only for a little bit. Seems like a win-win-win to me.
