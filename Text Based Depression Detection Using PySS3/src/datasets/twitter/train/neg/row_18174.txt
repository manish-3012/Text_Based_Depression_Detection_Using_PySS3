I donâ€™t understand my own head.The thought comes and goes. I have a method, time, and date. Every week, I feel the tipping point. My parents took away my depression pills (I use Zoloft) and I feel the effects going away.

They keep telling me to keep myself busy, but there are some day I can barely get out of bed.
