Probably the worst Monday ever that has put me on edgeIâ€™ve posted on this subreddit a handful of times, which is really saying something. 

But right now, in this exact moment, I mentally feel brain dead. Completely exhausted. No drive, no determination to make it to tomorrow. 
My new job hasnâ€™t paid me yet, my manager is not helping me what so ever and neither are the numbers everyone is giving me. 
My old job LE-FUCKING-GIT forgot to put my LAST NAME on the check they mailed me (I moved to a different state) and I canâ€™t cash it, which I really needed that money. 
The truck my Dad is letting me drive is so shit and more of a hassle than it is a blessing. Plus, he has some weird obsession with it. 
My Grandma (My Dads Mom) isnâ€™t my Grandma and I wasnâ€™t raised with her so me moving here has been new to everyone, and my Grandma hasnâ€™t been nice to me. Everyone keeps telling me is just her age. 

I moved here, to a new state because I had nowhere to go. I feel unwanted. I feel insignificant. I am so over living and my bad fucking luck.
