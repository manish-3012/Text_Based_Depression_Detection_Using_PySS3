So closeI've written a suicide note and I decided to wait a week to see how I felt. Yeah that was a week ago. I still feel just as bad. It is like I have more problems than answers. I've put the gun in my mouth to see how it felt, but it was never loaded. I feel hopeless. There is literally nothing that makes me happy. I feel like my only relief from constantly feeling like this is to end my life. I feel like it would make me at peace. I almost smile at the thought of pulling the trigger. I want to do it. I don't know why I'm even talking about it. I just want someone to know that I am probably going to do it.

Edit: After some consideration and things only getting worse for the last two years I am about 99% sure I am going to go ahead and get it over with.
