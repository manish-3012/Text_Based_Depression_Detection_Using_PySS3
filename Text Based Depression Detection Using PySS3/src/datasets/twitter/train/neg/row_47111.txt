I wish I would die but I donâ€™t want to kill myself.Iâ€™m totally miserable and I donâ€™t want to be alive but I just donâ€™t want to hurt the people close to me by suicide. If something else kills me itâ€™s a tragedy and they donâ€™t place blame on themselves but if I kill my self itâ€™s a lot easier for them to think they couldâ€™ve done done more. I wish I wanted to live but I just donâ€™t I want this all to just be over
