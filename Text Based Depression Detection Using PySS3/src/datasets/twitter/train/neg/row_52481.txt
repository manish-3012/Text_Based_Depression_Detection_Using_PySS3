"The Day After..."...

Ow.

Serves me right. Oh man. Ow. I feel like shit (physically AND emotionally) so what did getting fall-down drunk do for me? Nothing but make me so sick I can barely move...and make my head feel like there is broken glass in it. The suicidal thoughts are actually STRONGER now but I am REALLY not motivated to do anything stupid.

Well...I would like to say I will be killing myself today, and if ever I had a good time to do it...end the suffering right now...literally.

I promised a friend I wouldn't today, and I don't think I will be able to do much today except lay here and moan (even typing this is painful...) and feel like I am going to hurl at any moment.

Hangovers suck.

I will say it again: serves me right. I deserve to hurt. Ow.

I need to...*huuurk* go now.
