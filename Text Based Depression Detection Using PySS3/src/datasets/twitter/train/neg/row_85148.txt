Jan 1st is probably the day I'll goI'm sorry guys.. I don't see my life as something inherently "good". Its a pain. I think that this world truthfully is unsustainable. Our society is embedded and relies upon minerals like lithium that is deplatable. Furthermore, we're destroying our eco-system with neo classical economics. Which basically means that enviromental damage doesnt have a price in cold hard cash. Our society seems schizophrenic, or at least the media, depicting bitcoins as valuable and report Climate change as the next item. 

These aren't just words. They're words backed up by climate science that's as old as the 18th century. Politicians like Carter did foresee a change in our welfare habits necessary, but voters didn't like it. Moreover, it seems like our education actually interferes with actual education. Nobody sees the inertia. For more than sixty years.

Even when we see the failure of our political system so clearly in the newly appointed president, we point the blame to the president, not the system.

This is just an observation I wanted to share with any reader I would hold dearly. For a long time I've thought about preparing for imminent war or disaster, but it seems pointless. These things don't happen overnight though they seem to the last few years. Interpersonally I'm pretty much socially isolated, FYI. I've been raised with the notation "it's OK to be gay" which I think quite frankly made me fall in love with one of my friends. This caused interpersonal destruction. Maybe it's a gift since I don't think I would have observed the world in a neutral way if I didn't have nothing to lose. 

Anyway, I'm dieing soon. I'm just going to do it and be done with.
