'The norm'The original plan was to end my life on the morning of the 9th of March. Ive gotten into an argument with someone who is important to me and they said they dont care about me anymore they wrote me a note last year and the note stated for me to go and kill myself. last year i tried a few times to kill myself obviously didn't work out as im still here i feel like ive let people down I know im not well ive never denied it its just when i asked for help and i tried to explain what i was thinking and feeling they said they would help me my god they even promised. I understand not everyone can fully understand what im feeling and how i believe suicide is the way to help. But to promise someone who is ill that you will help them and then you fail to comply its hurts so much more then before. Why would soneone do that? Make me think i was even worth helping and then nothing comes of it. Im so tired of being miserable and crying everyday. I have absolutely no one i can talk to that knows me about these suicidal thoughts. I dont speak to anyone anymore im completely isolated I even keep my phone off for days at a time Ive deleted all social media last year kept in no contact with anyone accept one person and after this person told me he doesn't care about me i think it was my last straw. Im still crying im just preparing the house and getting things ready for my death. Cleaning the house top to bottom painting my nails i might sound so silly but its important to me that i look okay when i die. I dont know why it just is. Isit 'normal' to accept death and even be looking forward to it? There are some rotten people in this world and i will never be able to understand how they sleep at night knowing what they have done...
