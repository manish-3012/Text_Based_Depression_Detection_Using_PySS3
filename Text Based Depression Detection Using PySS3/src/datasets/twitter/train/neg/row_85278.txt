If it mattersI or another person that believes that I was raped are being emotionally and intellectually raped from who we are. By people that donâ€™t have true intentions at heart. This person is someone that Iâ€™ve cared for a lot and I dated in high school. I only had one relationship in high school and was molested over it being something that people didnâ€™t and still donâ€™t want to credit. Sarah was something to me that they were jealous of and same for me. I know that Iâ€™m going to die cause they all want it to be my fault instead of their prejudice. I hope you all have a blessed life and know your intentions. In who you were to people on the actual real and in the fact of everything thatâ€™s real and has happened.
