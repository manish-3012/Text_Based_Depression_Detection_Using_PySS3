What do I do when I've lost all hope for the future?I don't think I'm going to live much longer, I'll never accomplish anything. I have no plans for the future. I'm okay with living forever in poverty and not doing anything. There's no way for me to get help, no one wants to help me, I have nothing.
Is there anything I can do?
