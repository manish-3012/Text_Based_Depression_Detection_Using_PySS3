Failed at ODing , 23 and nothing going for me.I've been so depressed for the last 10 years of my life. It's gotten worse these last few years, along with my anxiety and paranoid thoughts . I have a whole slew of health problems arising from stress and now I've been taken off insurance so I can't even get medical treatment. I am stressed all the time from not being able to sleep and stay asleep . I can feel myself slowly getting more and more sleep deprived by the day . My memory is awful now, I wake up after a few hours after I try to lay down (which it takes forever for me to fall asleep anyway) and it is slowly killing me. I live in an apartment complex with 2 other guys with alternating sleep schedules, on top of our upstairs neighbors stomping everywhere its just become an awful environment for me to live in. I'm confused all the time and don't even know where I'm going or what to do half the time with myself. No matter what I try to do before bed I always wake up! I need sleep so bad, and tried to OD about 3 weeks ago with fail and a trip to psych. No family, no job, just wish I could die but I'm too scared to do anything like jumping a bridge or slitting my wrists. I just feel more and more dumb each day, and just want to go. Life is nothing but downs lately, and I can't break this cycle. Just going to probably jump soon.
