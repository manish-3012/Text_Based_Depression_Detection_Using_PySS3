Two days ago if I hadnâ€™t had the right conversation:In five minutes, I couldnâ€™t have backed out.

In eight minutes I would have gone unconscious.

At thirteen minutes, I would never have been able to recover.

At eighteen minutes I would have been dead.

In 10 hours my dad wouldâ€™ve come into my room and saw me.

It may happen again. Iâ€™m very very afraid of myself.
