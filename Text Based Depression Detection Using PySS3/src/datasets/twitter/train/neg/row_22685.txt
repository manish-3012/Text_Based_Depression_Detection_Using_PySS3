I don't know what to doI think about killing myself a lot, it's not that I don't have friends, cause I do, my family is not abusive, I don't have a hard life at all really. However I still want to die, and I am only 14, which is what scares me because if I am like this at this age chances are I'll be dead by like 20. Part of me wants to hold on and the other just wants it all to end. Only like 5 people know, 4 are my closest friends I told when I was drunk which I kinda regret and the other is a girl I think I'm falling in love with, I only told her recently because she said she tells me everything while I barely tell her anything. She's stopped me from killing myself before, that was before I told her that I'm like this and I don't think she knew. Last night I was about to go through with it, but all the good memories I have stopped me. I don't hate my life, I just hate myself so much. One of the things she said to me was "as long as you're alive, I'm alive" that scared me because I think about killing myself all the time. I don't want to hurt her, my friends, or my family. I just feel like this is all so pointless. I want to be happy, I want to have that whole family life and I want to spend my life with those I love, but I just feel like I can't with how my mind is. I know this probably doesn't make any sense cause it's just stupid rambling coming from me and maybe no one will even read this, but oh well. I'm sorry for making this so long, have a nice day.
