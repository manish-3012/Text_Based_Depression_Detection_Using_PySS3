WelpDon't think I've ever hit this point this hard. I've had depression for long but I've got the point where I just fuckn can't. My medication has been upped, seeing a therapist and shits just getting worse.

Honestly life is shit and I don't fuckin want this anymore. I just want to end it. I've said this in he past but fuckit I really mean it. Existence is tiring,it's draining,it hurts.

I just want to die and be at peace
