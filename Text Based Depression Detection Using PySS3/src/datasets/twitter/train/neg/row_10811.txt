The world clearly doesn't want meTo start things off, I was born 4 months premature. My parents always talked about how I almost didn't make it. I really wish I hadn't then. 21 years later and I'm an anxiety ridden pathetic mess. Clearly the world didn't want me from the very get-go. Pretty much all of my friends from college have ghosted me. I don't know why I study so hard there either. When I tell people my major (journalism) they just kinda pause and say "Well good luck with that." It's almost like they want to say "lol good luck getting a job with that." I applied for a bunch of retail jobs, but it's been weeks and I haven't heard anything. I used to love my hobbies, writing short stories and screenplays but it's not like they're ever going to be worth a damn. They're more draining than fun now. I tried telling my mother about how I was feeling via text but she just belittled me. She just told me to "snap the fuck out of it and grow up." She said "People are dying everywhere, sorry I can't be there to wipe your nose right the fuck now."

 I really don't see myself getting out of my 20's. I always wanted a wife and kids, a good job, maybe one where I could use my writing but I just feel like those options are not in the cards. They'll just be tortuous *what-if's* for the older version of me to dwell upon. I just want to check out painlessly, like in my sleep. If I live to see the weather get cold again, or if I can stand to wait that long, I plan on drinking a bunch and going out in the woods at night and freezing to death. Sorry if I sound like some impotent crybaby, and It's long I know. I just needed to vent.
