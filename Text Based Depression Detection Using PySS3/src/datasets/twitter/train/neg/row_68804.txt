I don't think I can take it anymoreI just don't want to live anymore, I feel like there is no point to life. I feel that I would be better off dead. I'm always stressed out and always thinking of killing myself, I've been having suicidal thoughts for over 2 months now. I feel like my Long distance girlfriend doesn't love me the way she says she does, I feel like I'm just getting used. But I don't want to leave her because I love her so much, Everytime I think about life without her I think about killing myself. I want to be loved, I don't want to be alone anymore. I've been alone my whole life :(. I just dont think I can take this anymore. I've been trying to find the best way to kill myself. I just can't take it anymore...
