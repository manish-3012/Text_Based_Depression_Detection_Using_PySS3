What should I do?Hey, 

A bit weird that this is my first post I've been browsing reddit for yonks and well it's just gotten to the point where I need to ask you guys advice. Back in October there my dad died of a thing called Hepatocellular Carcinoma its a type of cancer. I thought I was dealing with everything really well since to be completely honest I didn't feel much. I cried a little bit and like my dad pretty much just kept a stiff upper lip about the situation you know get on with things and concentrate on the things I can change now. Well anyway I thought I was fine but lately I've been getting sad and lonely and feeling very unsure of myself or my future. Then the other day I did a very dumb thing. I infringed my boyfriends privacy and it was a total dick move on my part i'm really not that sort of person at all but i just had this sudden horrible wave of pain and fear that i'm not good enough and everyone is going to leave me. even typing it now i know it sounds stupid but at the time it felt so real and so horrible. I told him right away and rightly so he was mad at me I apologised profusely and have been punishing myself ever since. He forgave me and told me he wouldn't be able to trust me the same way again for a while which is fair enough but he's still being weird with me. I just wan't him to feel better I don't care about me feeling depressed anymore but I feel shitty that I made a person I love so much feel crappy too and well I wanted your guys advice. 

Sorry for the big rant
