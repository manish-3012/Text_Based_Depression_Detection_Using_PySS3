i want to put me out of this misery..
i've currently been going since may the 12th to a psychologist 
i live in europe so my english won't be great

i've moved away from my mother's house because it was hell , i was yelled at 24/7 she always gave her anger over to me and my little sister i have a stephdad , he's a alcoholist , he threw chairs at my mother ,has cheated on her and yet she still stayed with him , i was in pain i felt so sad , and couldn't get happy anymore..


i moved to my dad , i have a stephmom and she has 2 kids , one of them is a boy and we had to sleep in the same bed , he then sort of went where he shouldn't go... had to go on for 2 months i felt horrible , used , i felt like a dirty paper , i can't do this anymore
no1 wants me and i will never be loved , i can't do this i'm done , i cry myself every night to sleep , i feel pain , i don't eat anymore , i feel horrible , i'm crying right now bringing up the memories , why ...


i've cutten myself but my psychologist saw it and i'm being checked now , i want to hurt myself because the pain takes all my thoughts away for that time , i don't want to do this , i can't , i'm to weak

no-one will ever like me and i cant seem to be happy anymore
i'm ready to die.
