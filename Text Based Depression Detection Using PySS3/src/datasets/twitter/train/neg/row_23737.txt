I've been there. DM is always openI have never tried but have come close to doing it. Have had the plan, the equipment and left alone just thinking "today is the day." Aleays backed out cause of family. I'm doing better these days and just wanted to tell you, it does get better. Feel free to send a DM if you just want a friend to talk to.
