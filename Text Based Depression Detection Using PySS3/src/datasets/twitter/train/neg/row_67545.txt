I'm sixteen. I'm done. I've been done.I know I am young. And I have been told I am not old enough to know what it is like to live yet. I've had a taste, and it's fowl. I understand this is rediculous, because so many people have it worse than I do. I have no one. Everyone that claims they are there for me really isn't. I've been told I was loved. If I was loved, then why Am I alone? Why would I be lied to by the specific individuals that claim they love me? The ones that claim they love me only hurt me more. I started cutting in the second grade. No one was there. After a two years of cutting, I told my mom. She told me I was being dramatic. So I kept quiet. My family started dieing in sixth grade. Five close relatives died within three years. No one at school wanted to talk to me, and all of my friends left me. My family didn't show Concern. I stopped talking. No one cared enough to notice.  My thighs and stomach are covered in scars. I tried to stop. Some times it's too hard. I've attempted suicide four times. Not even death wants me. This time, I'm completely finished. I figured if I am unsuccessful this time, I'm just going to keep taking sleeping pills every time I wake up. My dreams can keep me happy. I don't cry as much when I sleep. I suppose I really came here to say good bye in a way. I don't want to tell my family, because they say suicide is for the weak. I wish I was stronger. And I tried. It never worked.
