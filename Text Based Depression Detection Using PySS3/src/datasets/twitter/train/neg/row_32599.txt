Fuck it allI know i could probably do something. Bother finding a job or whatever. And that is everything the people surrounding me do. But i dont plan on living past the next month, so why does it even matter? 
I could study and maybe pass my finals, but that also doesnt matter anymore. But yet deep down i still partially care, which makes me want to die even sooner. Life is misery
