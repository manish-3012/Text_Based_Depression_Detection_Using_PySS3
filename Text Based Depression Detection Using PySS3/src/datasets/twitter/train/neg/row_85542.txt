My heart is so broken inside.. whats the point?The only girl in my life that I cared for, is gone.. she doesnt want to have a relationship.. and i want her to be happy, but what if it isnt fair for me? what if i wanted to be happy too.. i care for her happiness, but i want that need as well.. i've been cooped up in my room for the past 3 days, with an asthma attack and I don't know what to do. She was the only one who could keep me up and keep me going.. with her i can't do any fucking thing. I've tried. She was the only thing in my life that drove me forward. i dont know what to do anymore. ending my life seems like the best option.
