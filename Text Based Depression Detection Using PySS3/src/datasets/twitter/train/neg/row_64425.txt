Iâ€™m still alive because Iâ€™m still alive. That is all.The suicidal thoughts were worst years back. I probably just have suicidal ideation now. But it doesnâ€™t sound like an improvement if I donâ€™t want to die but Iâ€™m tired of living as well; hence, Iâ€™m still alive because Iâ€™m still alive. I will just be alive until I die.
