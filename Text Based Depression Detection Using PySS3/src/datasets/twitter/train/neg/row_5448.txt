I want to be dead but I'm so so scared of suicide.I don't expect ANYONE to answer this but what genuinely is the best way to kill yourself? I really don't know what to do.

I don't want to bore anybody with why, but i really have no desire to live anymore. I don't see myself ever being happy. Depression and social anxiety make me dread leaving my house most days and i fucked it up with the only person i loved. I have no purpose or direction in life.

I'm terrified of killing myself. I'd probably fuck that up and live the rest of my life with a serve disability or brain damage. I don't want to put people close to me through any bereavement either.

I have no fucking clue why I'm on reddit. It's coming up to midnight and I've spent my whole friday in my room, crying on and off and watching random shit on youtube and netflix.

Fuck calling a suicide hotline, speaking to a near-lifeless person over the phone in silence makes me feel even worse. idk what i'm doing right now.

Honestly, how do i end it or put a stop to this?
