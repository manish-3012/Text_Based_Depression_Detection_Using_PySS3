12/26/2020If I died today, nobody would notice. Not a single one. When they do find out that I died they may be sad for a minute or think â€œyah she was niceâ€ but thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m just a distant memory for most. I feel this intense sense of loneliness. Not just because I am alone but nobody in my life knows whatâ€™s up with me. I talk a lot of shit about and make myself seem confident but Iâ€™m not. I think of taking my life even when I tell my sister â€œof course I love myselfâ€ when she says Iâ€™m selfish when I tell her she has to pay me back. I just want to never wake up. I have work in 6 hours and I still havenâ€™t fell asleep.
