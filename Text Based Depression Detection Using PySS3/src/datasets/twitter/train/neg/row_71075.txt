Been 30 daysA difficult 30 days have gone by. Mother had a stroke and is in recovery at home. I did consider suicide: couldnâ€™t muster the courage, my familyâ€™s been through a lot already. I am trying to keep going, but everything has been bogging me down: stressful shifts at work, exam crunch, taking care of the family as much as I can. I feel like I am spreading myself thin. Feeling trapped.
