Is it wrong.. Is it wrong that I just want to fight with someone, have someone beat the shit out of me to make myself feel better? 

I just want to feel pain and without doing it myself I want to be able to fight someone and have them cause me pain, plus fighting I can hit back maybe get some anger out, I don't know why, I just want to be beaten up while hitting someone at the same time

No I don't want to do boxing, I want a full bare nuckle fight, I can't stop looking for one, just waiting for someone to 'start' on me so I have an excuse for a fight. 

Maybe get a friend to fight me and just stay friends after it, or look online, where could I organise a fight? Craigslist? 

Once again, sorry if I shouldn't post this here I don't really know where to post things..
