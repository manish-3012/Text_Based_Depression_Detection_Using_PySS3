Will someone please push me over the edge?Pretty please with sprinkles on top? Please? I've been wanting to die and thinking about it almost daily for sixteen years now. I haven't been touched in a pleasurable fashion in sixteen years and that's all i want or care about in life. No one has explained why this is, and it appears to be such an insurmountable obstacle that quality of life will always be dismal. Dignitas requires extensive documentation so no go there yet but maybe over time for my sibling's sake.

Will someone please push me over the edge? I haven't had pleasure or a good day in so long, and people love more than anything to taunt people for this specifically and as such dying is very logical but I am too much of a coward. I don't understand why I am not good enough to be a real person in the real sense of living as a real actualized human, but I am just barely intelligent enough to grasp how pathetic this is and it hurts too much to do anything but squint.

Will someone please push me over the edge?  Explain why I'm not as good as something like 90%+ of the population and why I'm never good enough.  Will you just say what needs to be said so i can finally snap and end it? Please?  For mercy's sake.  Like shooting a wounded horse. Let me be worm food. Please help me reach my goal, for *everyone's* sake. Clearly, this is what we as a collective want, so help me actualize that reality for everyone.
