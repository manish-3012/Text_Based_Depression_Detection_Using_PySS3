The thoughts just won't leave me aloneI'm sick of school. I'm sick of worrying about college and working after it. I'm sick of having to deal with my eating disorder that leaves me physically exhausted and overly emotional. I'm sick of not being able to get help for my depression and eating disorder. I'm sick of the people around me judging me 24/7. I'm sick of stupid winter and seasonal depression and possibly getting the flu. I want to be happy, healthy and alive, but it just seems hopeless and I can't stop thinking about suicide.
