LonelinessI just wanted to ask does anyone know how to stop feeling so lonely? Like I have friends and family who care but I still just feel so God damn lonely, like honestly it's been a long ass time since I was last happy. All I can remember is having this void inside me and I hate it so much, there's nights where I can't sleep and I just start crying for no reason cause I genuinely don't know if I'll be happy again. I used to be suicidal and thankfully I'm not anymore which is a good thing I guess, but there's just so much stress built up and honestly it breaks me. 

I always slap a fake smile and I'm known as the funny friend but as soon as I get home or when I'm alone in a room, that's when all my lonesome thoughts just start to dwell. Honestly I've been feeling like this since I was a kid and I'm talking 8 years old and I'm 18  now.

I just feel like ranting online cause I can't do it to others, plus this lockdown is fucking me up even more.
