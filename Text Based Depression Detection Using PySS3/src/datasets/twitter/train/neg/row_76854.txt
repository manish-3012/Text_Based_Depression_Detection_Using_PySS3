Tonight is the night IÂ´ll finally find peaceSitting here with a bottle of drain cleaner that is supposed to be highly toxic and leads to certain death if untreated.

Been battling depression for around 6 years now, I cut myself when I was younger to cope with the sadness and pain. 

I am adopted, I was born addicted to heroin because my mother was a drug addcited during her pregnancy. Verbally and physically abused by my foster parents.

I am madly in love and my self destructing behaviour does not allow me to get over with her, even tho she only uses me and I very well know that. My life sucks, even tho I am a really likeable guy I have no real friends, my family thinks I am a dissapointment and whatever I do, everything is false.

So here I am, shitty job I hate and no one to talk to about my problems. I was in therapy but that didnt help either.

I read that the drain cleaner is supposed to be fucked up painful but I dont care at this point, 2 cup of that shit will leave me laying on the ground grasping for air, blood and foam everywhere. Could take some time until I finally die but guess what, I dont give a damn. I want peace, I dont want to feel all the pain inside me anymore. My heart is heavy stoned and I dont want to do that any longer.

Spend the last minutes with me guys, give me someone to talk to atleast one last time.
