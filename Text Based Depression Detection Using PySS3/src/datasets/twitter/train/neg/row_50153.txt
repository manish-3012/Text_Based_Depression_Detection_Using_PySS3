*dissatisfied sigh*Thatâ€™s really all I got.  All I can think about is suicide, but I donâ€™t have the motivation to do it.  Iâ€™m 17, about to go into senior year, I have a full life ahead of me but just... do I want it?  My ex made a full year and a half of my life miserable and itâ€™s still going on, and sheâ€™s living life totally happily despite ruining someone elseâ€™s.  She ruined my confidence, mental stability, I was put in a hospital for 2 weeks, made my passion miserable, and turned some of my friends against me.  My dogs wouldnâ€™t understand, my parents would probably blame themselves.  When I go back to school Iâ€™m going to have to deal with my exâ€™s friends, most of which ignore me but one of them is *hellbent* on getting me in trouble and making the one thing I enjoy (music) kinda hellish.  Speaking of band, this will be my 4th and final year in HS band but my only year marching percussion and Iâ€™m probably gonna suck at it.  I donâ€™t believe in aliens (I believe they can exist, but they donâ€™t yet, itâ€™s the most plausible theory) and I just wish I could be abducted.  Maybe get an aneurysm, if they can be self-induced.  Donâ€™t want to commit suicide, but I ***really*** want to stop everything in life.
