Gee, world, so fucking sorry i wasn't born correctly.so fucking sorry I was born male.  i didn't have a choice, society, it just happened to me.  So fucking sorry the inequalities between men and women piss me off.  So fucking sorry I get depressed because I'm not allowed to be the gender I want to be.  So fucking sorry for bringing up valid points about the benefits women have over men in our society.  Yup, just keep telling me how much of a piece of shit I am and continue to kill me just because I have a penis.  Yeah I should just "man up" to please you.

Fuck you world.  Just fuck you.  I'm leaving this place.  My only regret is that i can't take every one of you fuckers with me.
