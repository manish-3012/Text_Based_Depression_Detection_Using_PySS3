I think it's my timeRaped for years as a child. Successful high school career , but ruined college to drugs.  Jail and fines for years, finally have time clean (2+ years) and return to school. Had too many financial obligations and poor prior grades and fail out. Girlfriend cheats on me . I just feel there's no point anymore I'll be in a debt hole for years to work a shit job I'll be stuck at. Sad how fast things get irreparably broken. I just don't think I have the heart for another battle left in me, it has been that way for the past few years. The sweet moments almost make it worse, I recall them, but remember only how distant they are. Oh well, it is scary how as attractive the transit train's horn now sounds.
