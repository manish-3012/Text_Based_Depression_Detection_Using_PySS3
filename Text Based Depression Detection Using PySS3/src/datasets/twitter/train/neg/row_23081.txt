Suicide for me isn't about my pain, it's about my need for CONTROLI'm a control freak. Plain and simple. If I can't control it, or at least have a good idea of the outcome, I can't handle it. I hate surprises. Blah blah blah.

While I am in great mental turmoil, and have been for the past 6 years, my reason for me killing my self is not because of me being mentally ill. It's because each day that passes by, the risk of me not controlling the way I leave earth rises. I can't deal with that. I hate wondering, will it be painful? What's going to happen? When? How?

I have to do this for myself, and escaping the mental pain is only a plus.
