Can someone help enlighten me from my ignorance I donâ€™t my understand my families suicidal thoughts?Ok guys so this is not a shit post I personally feel like Iâ€™ve had a very very hard life Iâ€™ve experienced shit people couldnâ€™t imagine uprooting everything from one country and come to another. I was the oldest sibling who dealt with everything alone. Me my mother and my father tried to shield my siblings from Ostracization of being labeled as our â€œAnchor babiesâ€ as far as I could tell they have had a great â€œregular Americanâ€ life compared to me and my parents. But recently I found out my sister was suicidal and now I found out my brother is suicidal and also that my mother use to be suicidal. I really donâ€™t understand what makes someone get so low that it seems like the only answer. I have gone relationships  that tore my heart apart with ought ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. Iâ€™ve been discriminated against just for my race Iâ€™ve basically cried tears of blood compared to the things theyâ€™ve gone through. I just donâ€™t understand why only me and my father havenâ€™t had thoughts like that. How can I become more understanding to my siblings? I love them to death but I am not proud to admit that it makes me a little mad on the inside when they tell me those things. I know itâ€™s my ignorance but I just never felt like that so I can help to understand it. My parents are no help theyâ€™re old fashioned first generation immigrants so they donâ€™t believe in something like that although my mother says she was before.
