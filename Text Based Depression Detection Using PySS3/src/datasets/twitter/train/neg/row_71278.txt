I feel inescapably aloneNo one has the time or energy to help me right now. I wanna hurt myself but my parents and boyfriend will lose it with me if I start that tonight. They always think my freakouts are to be dramatic. But I just took panic attack medicine and I still can't stop the panic. I can't stop the feeling of loneliness. My boyfriend is sick and told me that he can't handle this panic attack of mine right now. I don't have anyone else I can contact. I've been rocking myself back and forth trying to comfort myself. I feel like everyone is better out without the burden of trying to be there for me

At the end of the day, do I really have to stay alive for anyone but me? No one wants me alive. they want me to be healthy but I don't think they have the energy to help me get there. Maybe they're trying all they can and I'm too far gone. Sometimes I seem fine but then one strong wave of pain comes and I just want to run outside the front door and run away and end it
