Still here but struggling...Ugh. I can't stand myself.

My drinking is out of control. I have been pretty much smashed or close to it for the past 3 days.

I haven't cut again (positive) but my thoughts have turned morbid again. I don't want to live like this...I am struggling so hard to hold on. My kids keep me grounded...I barely can make it through the day. I drink to forget. The next mornings suck...but it helps me make It.

Ty for reading. I don't want to be here on this sub (no offense) but I have nowhere else to vent.

:(
