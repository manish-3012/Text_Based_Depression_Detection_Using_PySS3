My son tried committing suicide last nightMy son tried to commit suicide last night. He took a box cutter and sliced deep four or five times on one arm and three or four times on the other. Then he laid down in a bathtub full of water but then got out and went to his bedroom where he passed out.

He'd made an odd call to his sister that worried her, so before she called 911, she called me, and I rushed home from work as she called 911 and dealt with them.

When I got home, there was an ambulance and a fire engine and several police cars. My daughter saved his life. Now he's in the hospital and will be transferred to a psych unit for awhile to deal with the deep depression he was under and that he hid but it all came out last night as I sat by his hospital bed and thanked God that my son was alive.

I lost my second daughter as an infant when she was just seven months old. I cannot take this again.

I have no idea what to do now. I have to be strong for my kids but all I can do from now on is worry any time I don't know that he's being watched. 

I have to go into work now and tell my boss what happened and that I probably have to work from home once my son is released.

When I got home from the hospital last night I had to clean up all the blood that was all over the house. Anything his blood touched I  threw away. I scrubbed the bathroom and his bedroom. I threw away the boxcutter he used. I will never be able to forget the sight of his blood everywhere.
