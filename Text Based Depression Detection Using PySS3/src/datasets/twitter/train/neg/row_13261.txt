I wish I could kill myself.Iâ€™m not afraid of leaving my life behind. My life has already been taken away from me. I lost my job, my husband is divorcing me. Iâ€™m stuck at home with my parents at 25 after being out on my own. 

I just donâ€™t have the courage to do a thing but self harm. I hate myself. I hate my life. I want to end it. But I donâ€™t know how. Iâ€™ve been abandoned on so many levels. Because Iâ€™m garbage. 

I donâ€™t wanna live anymore. No one knows. People would care though. I guess thatâ€™s part of it. 

I wish I could die. It would be perfect if I contracted some disease. Iâ€™m so angry. Iâ€™m so abandoned.
