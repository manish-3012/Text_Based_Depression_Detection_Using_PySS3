I dont knowHere's a few basic things before I vent a little, my name is Syd, I'm a freshman in highschool and I've been self harming for three years.

Actually, I don't know if it counts. I don't cut or that. I bite and scratch my arms until all I can see are the marks.


I've been clean for a few weeks (which I'm really proud of), but I've been going through triggering tags on here and Tumblr. 

Usually I just listen to music and hope for the urge to pass but it's extremely strong right now and I don't know what to do

I don't want to not do it, but if I do it'll take me forever to recover what little progress I have again..

Thanks for listening
