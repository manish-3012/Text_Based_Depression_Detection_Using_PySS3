Why canâ€™t I just be fucking happy?I donâ€™t even know where this stupid fucking depression comes from. Iâ€™ve had to deal with it my entire life and Iâ€™m OVER IT.

Iâ€™ve had such bad anxiety the last few days and all I can think about is taking my sleeping pills and never waking the fuck up. Iâ€™m not going to. I tried last year and I took around 100 pills and I donâ€™t have anything even close to that now, so it would just be another failed attempt. Plus, I live with family now and I wouldnâ€™t want them to find me.

Iâ€™m just fucking SICK of it. Iâ€™m almost 30. I thought I would be happy by now. I just keep getting sadder and sadder. Iâ€™m intentionally destroying myself in hopes that Iâ€™ll die and that just makes me even sadder. I just donâ€™t have a will to live and I donâ€™t even know where to begin to work in taking steps to being happy.
