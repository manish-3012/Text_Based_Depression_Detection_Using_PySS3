Everything is fucking against me and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth it anymoreSorry for the poor grammar and formatting, iâ€™m on mobile. 

Iâ€™m 14 years old. Iâ€™m currently in therapy and on antidepressants and a stimulant. I got put on meds in late june and started therapy a few weeks ago but Iâ€™ve only had two appointments. Iâ€™m in therapy because iâ€™ve been struggling for a very long time. In fourth grade my grandma died and I never got over it. I also got teased a lot in fourth grade and was very lonely. This was the first time I expressed suicidal thoughts. I told my mom I wanted to jump out of my window. She didnâ€™t even fucking remember. I havenâ€™t talked to my dad since september because he was a manipulative bastard yet I didnâ€™t realize it for a long time. I had to move in 2017 and again in december of last year. I only really have one friend who I talk to regularly. Everyone i meet online gets boring after a little bit. Everything seems to be against me now. My mom, the one person i had didnâ€™t even fucking remember i told her i was suicidal. iâ€™ve been fucking suicidal since fourth grade, i fucking told her i was suicidal yet she didnâ€™t even remember. i was too much of a pussy to kill myself and now the only reason i havenâ€™t is because of my chinchilla and turtle. everything is against me and iâ€™m so tired of trying to get better. suicides the easy way out and it makes no sense to not take it. i ainâ€™t religious, i believe that when someone dies they just donâ€™t think. itâ€™s just nothing. iâ€™ve gone through so much fucking suffering and iâ€™ve only been on this dumb world for 14 years. i donâ€™t want to leave my friend or my pets but iâ€™m starting to get to the point of not caring. i donâ€™t have another therapy appointment for two weeks and i donâ€™t want to be stuck in a mental hospital. my step sister had to go to one and she told me about it. that fucking hospital would make someone suicidal. i donâ€™t know what to do anymore. i just want all of the bad things to go away. i canâ€™t even talk to my mom. sorry for the rambling and i know i didnâ€™t use proper grammar.
