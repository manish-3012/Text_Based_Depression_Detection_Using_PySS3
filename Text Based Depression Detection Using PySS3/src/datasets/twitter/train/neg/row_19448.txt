it didn't workSo last night i did it, i took some pills, i reached that point of ending it all, but it didn't work. People say after surviving suicide they have a new sense of life, they regret it, but i don't. now im just the failure that couldn't even kill themselves. did i not take enough? not the right thing? is it just 'not my time' ? i reached out to people and they say 'they don't need this' 'i'm stressed enough' 'now you just made me worry' im such a burden it hurts. i still feel exactly the same as before i did it. i just don't want to be here. you may think im attention seeking or looking for sympathy, but i don't know who else may just listen to me without judgement other than the internet
