I have a lot of justifications to kill myself.**Fear of death:** I'm so afraid of death, that I want to kill myself before it gets to me first.

**Revenge:** I have been so hurt and betrayed by everyone, that I'd kill myself to make them feel the same way they made me feel. Betrayed and abandoned. 

**Trapped:** Believe me when I say life is nothing. I want to escape the truth and the reality that is in all of us.
