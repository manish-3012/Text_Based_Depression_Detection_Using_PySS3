BastardsWhen I want to talk about realistic things I just get ignored. I want to talk about how mk ultra was real or how recent jfk docs are released. I get called paranoid because I'm curious about how people use their power? I'm curious because history states how people with power can control a situation? I'm told to sit back because that's just life? No, that's called power. 

I'm tired of putting on a mask even though the information is in our faces. If something is too powerful we just have to submit to it. People don't even want to speak about what happens behind the scenes because It's "negative". History is filled with these "negative" facts. But we document them because it's reality. 

IT'S STILL REAL IT STILL HAPPENS. JUST BECAUSE A LION EATING A DEER IS BRUTAL DOESN'T MAKE IT "NEGATIVE" THAT'S JUST LIFE. APPERENTLY LIFE HAS TO FIT A CERTAIN STATUS QUO. One that is all posotive and all bullshit.
