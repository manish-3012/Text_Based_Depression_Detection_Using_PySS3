Consolidating being a horrible person and forgiving myselfSo I am an insane person who has said horrible things to my exes and done terrible things to myself. I don't really know how I can forgive myself for being a lunatic especially when I am not going to change  myself because I believe that part of me to be part of me and would be depressed to be able to be me even the parts of me I hate.

Its wielding my depression like a weapon (trying to make someone responsible for helping me with my suicidal thoughts{Though i don't think that was my intent]) that i find really unforgivable.  And I haven't done that for a long time now, but I know if you recreated the circumstances, I am too greedy and believing in imaginary romantics to know that I would not do the same horrible crap as I did before.

How can I forgive myself for something that I know I'll do again? Do I just accept that I'm horrible and being horrible isn't that bad? Do I commit to change myself in a way that will make me unhappy because I'm fucked in the head? Or do I forgo my right to talk about it if I can't be motivated one way or another to decide so it obivously can't be that important to me?

I'm not suicidal by the way(at the moment) I just don't really know where to put this text.
