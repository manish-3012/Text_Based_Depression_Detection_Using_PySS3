i cant stop thinking about everything bad i cant stop wishing for that moment before deathi just want to fucking die i cant fucking do this its constant it never goes away i dont care that ill never get to transition into a guy i dont care that ill never own a home or a dog or try real maple syrup or go to paris or swim in the ocean or get high on dmt

i dont care about anything i just want to fucking die i hate this so much i feel so empty and horrible its like the feeling you get when someone dies except no one has died im jsut constantly in so much pain i hate this i hate myself i hate everything that came together to create me

why the fuck was i made i dont deserve this life i hate this life im so fucking sad all the time

i cant fucking brreathe
i dont deserve life i know exactly how id kill myself i know exactly what i need 

all i need is the half mile walk to the store and a couple bottles of pretty pink pills and a glass of half-and-half iced tea and then i can lay on that stupid fucking deflated beanbag in my room and wait for the seizures because by then ill be asleep

i want to sleep forever

ive always been happier in my dreams. maybe its happier there
