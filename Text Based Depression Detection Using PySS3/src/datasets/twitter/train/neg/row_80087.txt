anyone feel too tired to continue?i've had such a hard time putting this question into words, even as simple as it is. i just feel so tired. i'm failing my summer class (only one fucking class) because when i open my textbook to read i'm just too tired. i'm not even physically tired, maybe mentally tired, i just don't want to do it. i don't want to do anything. i need to register for new classes and i'm just too tired. i'm too tired to deal with life. what's funny is i'm not tired... i just don't know how to explain it. like, i just don't want to do anything. i don't care. i just kinda want to die but then there are moments at 2 am when i'm driving down the street with my best friend in her open-top jeep playing our favorite music and singing, that i feel absolutely great. it seems like i can only bother existing if i'm on some sort of euphoric high. i just want to die. i hate reality. i hate these grown-up responsibilites. i just want to write my poetry and fall in love and i don't know... be happy? it's just a fucking mess of feelings. nothing i know i should do ever feels worth doing. like... i go to school to pass a class to graduate college only to be in debt and work at some job i don't love, i'd so much rather be dead.
