A good plan to end it allI fell for a guy quite a while ago, he was French, I'm in a nearby European country.

I remember being quite obsessed with France and his city in particular, I was obsessed with studying there cause of the beauty. I fell in love with French literature and I looked into ways of getting myself 

I am 20, I don't study cause of depression, I got bullied for 6 years and my family is very insecure narcissistic people who told me to go ahead and do it. A person assaulted me when I was 13.

It sucks.


I planned to go there, in this town, not for him but because it's a very dreamy place. It's covered by the Mediterranean sea, full of sun and natural beauty, good wine and happy people. Great history, lots of monuments and beautiful beaches. I'd listen to lana del rey and think of this place. 

I had planned this before, to go end my life there. Maybe soon.
Stay there for a month, enjoy life and then do it.
