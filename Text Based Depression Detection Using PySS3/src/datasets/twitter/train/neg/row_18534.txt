Iâ€™m losing everything including my mind.After finding my sister to suicide I lost myself. I now suffer from extreme PTSD anxiety depression and Iâ€™m no longer myself. Iâ€™ve tried 3 attempts. 1. With my wrists 2. Overdosing 3. Overdosing again on what ever stuff I could find in the cabinets. I know what itâ€™s like to find someone from it and the pain afterwards but I just canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m tired and just feel nothingness. Iâ€™ve tried to be normal like I was before my sister but I just canâ€™t. I wanna be with her and let this pain end.
