im always getting worseI just sat with a method. I thought I was just mimeing it again. It took a lot to stop myself this time.

I thought last year that when I was out of the dorms then I'd have time to myself and be able to be friends with someone. This semester I withdrew from a class because it requied people to interact. Every language class requires interaction, I need 3 semesters of a language, so I'll never be able to graduate anyway. I stopped going to my other classes because someone looked at me. I'll never be able to have friends like this. I hadn't talked to anyone but my therapist for 5 months. I feel terrible when people are around when I walk on the sidewalk or drive. 

Since thanksgiving I've had old food in my apartment. It's rotting and so am I and I can't stop it. I've tried to clear it out but I can't .
