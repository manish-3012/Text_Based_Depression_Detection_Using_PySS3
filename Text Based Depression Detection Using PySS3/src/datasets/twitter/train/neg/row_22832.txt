I really want to kill myself.I recently had to get rid of my closest best friend, and at least it was mutual. But I feel so empty and void now. I just want to die. Nobody understands me, and nobody wants to help. I'm just an insufferable bastard. Im on antidepressants, I've been through counseling, and I'm still in it. None of it has ever helped. People are telling me to try psychedelics but fuck that. I don't want to. I just want to die now. Life only ever gets worse and people tell me "it gets better" IT FUCKING HASNT. IT NEVER WILL. THATS A SHIT ARGUMENT. I have no irl friends. I'm losing all my online ones. I have a bf, but that's online too. I just want help. I want someone to save me. But nobody will. Nobody can. I'm alone.
