Friend Said They Don't Have the Energy to Deal With my Being SuicidalI messaged my old friend, probably my best friend even though I'm not theirs, that (a month of not talking since everyone abandoned me when I moved out-of-state for University, and I do mean literally every friend) I've been feeling more suicidal than before (and they know I spent many full nights holding a loaded shotgun in the basement when I was younger) and after 5 hours, they just texted they didn't really have the energy to deal with me. No support. No asking how I was. Just that they're not really in the mood to deal with me.

I don't really know why I get my heart involved anymore. It always ends up being a mistake. Sometimes I wonder if those Calvinists were right: God created some people knowing they were damned to always suffer. I think I'm one of them, and no matter how much I study or I volunteer or I meditate or I write or I try to be kind, my lot is cast and that's that.
