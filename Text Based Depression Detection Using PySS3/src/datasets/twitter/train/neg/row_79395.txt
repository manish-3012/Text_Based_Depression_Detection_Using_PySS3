BurnoutI'm doing everything right. I'm using coping skills. I'm going out with friends and talking. I'm adressing issues at work.

But it's like nothing helps. I keep feeling more and more exhausted. I'm at a point where I just... don't feel. I'm empty. Nothing makes me overly happy or overly sad.

I have random bouts of crying so I still feel human. But nothing lasts. I've been having suicidal thoughts again. I haven't told anyone. These thoughts are not welcome. I do not want to take my life.

But I feel myself slipping, and I'm scared. It's so hard. I don't want to die. But I don't have the drive to live either.
