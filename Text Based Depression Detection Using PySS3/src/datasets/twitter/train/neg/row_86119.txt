It's been a month since I miscarried. Three weeks since I got dumped.I am in so much pain

Last night I had to drive home drunk because my ex wouldn't let me stay and sober up

I'm recovering from cocaine addiction 

I'm probably going to get fired

I'm going to aa but I'm too depressed to talk to anyone in person 

I think I killed my baby because I did coke before I knew I was pregnant.

I just cant do it anymore, um in so much pain and I've been numb every day for a month. I just want it to stop and I want to be dead
