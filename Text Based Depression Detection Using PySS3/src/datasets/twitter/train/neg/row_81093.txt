There is no light at the end. The world is broken and there's no fixing it, nor is there any fixing me.Hi. I'm not entirely sure why I'm posting here. I guess just looking to feel less alone. Suicide is kind of always in the back of my mind. I know my life, and most people's lives, don't matter. I don't really want to be here anymore, and I don't want to talk about why. Anyone else feel like that?
