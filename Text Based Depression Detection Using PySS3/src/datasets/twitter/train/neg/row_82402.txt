My Constant Yearning For DeathI'm not gonna kill myself, at least tonight. I'd hurt too many people. But I cannot express how badly I want my painful existence to end. My parents tried raising me like a fucking dog, beating me and telling me things in attempt to create a being worthy of their presence. They've failed and I cannot seem to experience true joy. I cannot stand any sort of socialization with anyone my age (18) because of the stubborn and strongly opinionated people I used to associate myself with. So as I sit in my room by myself with my thoughts for hours on end I grow lonely but any attempt at socialization further confirms my hate for it. Though it's not as though I don't do anything other than that, I have a full time job as a maintenance man at an apartment complex, decent pay, good hours. I don't hate it as much as I used too but I don't see an enjoyable future working all day just to go to work the next day. I'm bored of writing this now, I'll go back to sitting for 10 mins then crying for 5. Hope I die in my sleep, tell them I wanted to die so they can experience the Internal pain they put me through.
