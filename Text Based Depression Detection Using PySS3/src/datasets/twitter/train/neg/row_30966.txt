Everything is ok. I'm fine. Help people who need help first.I am fine. I have a perfect life, but sometimes I have suicidal thoughts. They pass and go. Most of the time they are not strong. But a good part of the days, they are in my mind. Sometimes for a few minutes, sometimes for hours, sometimes for a whole day... They come to my mind almost whenever I have a bit of free time. Actually sometimes I am the one that calls them. It feels like home. It's more like: "Does life really worth living?" And my answer is no. I have them for 3 years. 

The thing is I am no depressed. Well... It's more a "why to live?" question I ask to myself everyday. And truth be told, there are chances that life to have no meaning. I am not interested in money, love and my hobbies aren't enough to motivate myself. I am feeling empty. I don't like the society. I am disappointed by humans in general. And I can't find a reason to go on. Of course I love my family but I have moments when I feel like I don't want to continue living. But I have to... 

My dark thoughts and lack of motivation starts to affect my productivity. I have moments when I just want to do nothing and when I just want to die. I had days when I thought I wouldn't live after X day. And sometimes feelings are pretty strong. But it not happens too often. I can't imagine myself being able to do something which would hurt me. I can manage this thoughts and I am pretty stable person.

I am sorry... I'm just a bit confused about what I'm feeling for years. 
I don't even know if it's the right sub to write this. 

Thanks for reading.
