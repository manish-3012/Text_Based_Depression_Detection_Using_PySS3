NOT BEING DEPRESSED TO KILL YOURSELFAlright so Iâ€™m 19, never though Iâ€™d let myself get to this point but here I am. Thereâ€™s always this misconception that people kill themselves because they are depressed and donâ€™t have options, what if youâ€™re fucking bored. the only thing that would keep me going is my dream of music but at the same time I donâ€™t care at times 
because Iâ€™ve never enjoyed life Iâ€™m so numb I donâ€™t even think I get sad anymore Iâ€™m soooo numb whatâ€™s the point in living if you donâ€™t know how to live and even if I because the musician I wanted to be I wouldnâ€™t want to live past 25 at most!!! I donâ€™t know wtf is the point of being here if Iâ€™m gonna think this way if there is a higher power, an I suppose to work with this mentality and find a love for life or something, the typical life your suppose to have is something I detest idkkkk, wtf is the point
