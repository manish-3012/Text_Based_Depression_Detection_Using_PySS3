I think I need helpI have not lived a good life. I'm manic depressive. I was born to a monster of a father. He is an alcoholic that got me drinking to justify his own selfish addictions. I was a pharmaceutical test patient at the age of 6. I was force fed Ritalin and afterward a mix of drugs to make up for the side effects of Ritalin. I was sexually assaulted as a child by the same sex. Now I don't know if I'm homosexual or I'm trying feel something I felt when I was a child. I quit drinking and doing drugs 2 1/2 years ago thinking that would make the suicidal thoughts and depression go away. For a while I thought it worked but I slowly notice myself slipping into a downward spiral of dark thoughts. Only this time without drugs the thoughts of suicide were clear and without emotion. Now I catch myself reading tutorials on painless suicide methods. I've even saved up money to afford the method I want and pay for my funeral. I've reached out to my friends and family but they all give me that rehearsed BS about how life gets better or suicide isn't the answer. I understand though. I've been suicidal for most of my life and they've had to tolerate me saying the same thing over and over. I don't know what I should do. Due to the poor mental health treatment in my youth I have severe anxiety about going to a doctor. The last time I went to a therapist I had a mental breakdown that lasted almost a month. I've also posted here in suicide watch a few years ago right before I quit drinking. No one responded which led to my third suicide attempt. I quit drinking after that attempt. I had gotten really drunk and became manic. I took a knife and cut my arm deep enough to need stitches and put the knife to my throat and started cutting. It took 3 grown men to stop me. I'm pretty sure I was gonna cut my own throat. I don't know why I'm even posting any of this really. I'm scared of myself and getting tired of fighting. I don't wanna die. I don't think I have a choice though.
