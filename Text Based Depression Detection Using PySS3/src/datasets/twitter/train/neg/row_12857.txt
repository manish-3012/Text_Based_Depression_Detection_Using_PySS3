My death would be a good thingBecause if a bad person dies is always a good thing. And you know how I know I'm a bad person? Because I don't even care about my happiness, I just care about other people's sadness. I want a world of despair, a world of broken hearts and insecure people: I want a world as bitter and envious as me, I want a sad world full of sad person so I can feel relieved by not being able to find happiness.
