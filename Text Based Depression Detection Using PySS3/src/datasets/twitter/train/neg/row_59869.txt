Iâ€™m contemplating it right nowLong story short. Marriage has ended. Fucked things up with my best friend... to the point that she no longer wants to talk to me. Work is kicking my ass. I just feel so empty. Not one thing has set me off on feeling this way, itâ€™s just everything is so overwhelming all together.

I have enough pills (Ativan, morphine to slow my breathing... tiazac to crash my blood pressure... and enough insulin to put me in a diabetic coma for a month) to do this with nobody finding me.
