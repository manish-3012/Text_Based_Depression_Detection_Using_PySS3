Is there any reason to keep it going?Only time i don't have thoughts to end myself is when i'm drunk/on drugs. Yesterday when i wanted to talk to my best friend, she told me that she is busy and she hasn't replied since. I fucked up relationship with girl i love twice already. I can't even find strenght to get up. I don't feel anything but sadness. And now i feel like attention whore. There is no sense in living.
