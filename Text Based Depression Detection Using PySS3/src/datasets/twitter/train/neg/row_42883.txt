Why even bother living if I'll never be who I want to be?I'm a 19 year old closeted trans girl who's a disgusting pile of shit. I just spent all day crying at my job in a grocery store because every time a pretty girl walks by I just wish I could be them but I'm 5'11 so I'll never look like they do. I hate everything about myself and honestly I don't see a point in keeping at this
