Whatâ€™s life for?The only reason Iâ€™m still alive is so I donâ€™t make my parents feel extremely sad, but does it even matter Iâ€™ve been called a disappointment, lazy, unmotivated p.o.s by them anyway I donâ€™t see the point in living anymore there is nothing I can get from life anymore I wake up every day at 5:55am just to go to fucking school so I can get yelled at my parents for not have good enough grades and all thatâ€™s so I can go to college get $100,000 in debt so I can get a shit job so I can stress myself out with bullshit taxes,bills, etc. Iâ€™ve been suicidal ever since 5th grade, once I finally get my license Iâ€™m going to get in a â€œcar crashâ€ so my parents feel the pain of having a suicidal failure of a son. Iâ€™ve tried reaching out before but everyone thinks Iâ€™m joking so I donâ€™t bother anymore. This is my last resort Iâ€™ve never remember being truly happy or knowing why Iâ€™m here?

TL:BR  whatâ€™s the point in life Iâ€™ve been suffering everyday of my life and donâ€™t know what to live for every-time I try opening up to someone they think Iâ€™m joking or an attention whore
