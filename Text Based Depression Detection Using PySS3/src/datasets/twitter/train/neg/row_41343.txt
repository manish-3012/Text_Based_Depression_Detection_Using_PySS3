just need tips/helpmy sister tried to overdose today and my parents are very worried about her. My parents are not entirely sure what caused her to do this but the nurse kinda gave them the reasoning? Basically they said that my sister feels trapped in the house, sheâ€™s going through a breakup and that she doesnâ€™t get along with her sister aka me. Something that weâ€™re struggling with is that we all want to help her but she doesnâ€™t want to speak to my parents about it at all and i totally understand her. Itâ€™s just very hard right now bc my parents are both mentally ill, especially my mom so they are coping in a not so great way. My dad who had quit smoking a few years ago started to smoke again. I just need some help
-What are some things that my parents and I can do to help my sister? 
- My parents already discussed that they will let her explain herself when sheâ€™s ready but what if she never tells us? Then what?
- I know she currently feels very trapped in the house and feels like she doesnâ€™t get to experience much freedom but during times of the pandemic itâ€™s hard to let her out to hangout with friends, so what should we do? 

something more personal:
I have really bad anxiety and I am also an extremely sensitive person. I canâ€™t help but feel that I am an awful sister. This whole time I thought things were fine between us, I spoil my sister sm and I always think about her. However recently sheâ€™s been emotionally unstable causing her to lash out a lot towards me and me being a super sensitive person, caused me to do the same back. I knew she was having a tough time recently due to her breakup but I didnâ€™t know she was this depressed about everything and now I feel like I shouldâ€™ve been more understanding and kind towards her. I feel like I shouldâ€™ve been the bigger person and just allowed her to react like that. I shouldâ€™ve been more caring, but instead I was selfish and didnâ€™t think my actions through. I have spent most of today trying to suppress my anxiety so that I could comfort my parents but I failed and had 2 panic attacks already. Iâ€™m scared that I might freak out again when I visit my sister tomorrow, what should i do? am i being selfish for being upset at myself? what are some ways to suppress anxiety?
