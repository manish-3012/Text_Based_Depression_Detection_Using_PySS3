dilemmai'm transgender. i'm on hormones right now. i know the hormones are why i'm feeling sad, but the pressures of puberty combined with the pressures of being in my last semster of college and looking for a job is getting too much.

heres the kicker though

one of the reasons i hate myself is i'm so unassertive and indecisive.  i can't do anything unless i know exactly how it will turn out. that means i could never hurt myself. but if i learned to take action in my life, then that buffer would be gone.
