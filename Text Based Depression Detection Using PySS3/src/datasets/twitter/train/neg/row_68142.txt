I think I'm ready to sign out.I think other people look at me and think I have it together. Money, Car, whatever... That just seems to make it worse.

Nonfunctional adult is an understatement, I've been contemplating suicide for 15+ years off an on. Now that I'm debt free and actually have more saving than I ever had in my life, I don't even want to spend the money, I want to put it all in a giant pile, and burn it and then go OD in my sleep.

So tired of this shit, why suffer on?

If family tells me to just push through it or whatever, or go seek outside help for my suffering, why is it selfish to ask the same of them for their sadness if I decide sign out?
