Please not again...I'm scared that it could be happening again.

I think I've found somebody new. She seems perfect. Like almost too good to be true. I'm falling, falling hard. I haven't said it to her yet, but I already love her. I'm so glad I found her, or that she found me.

But I'm afraid. This could be dÃ©jÃ  vu. This is how things started last time. I gave love a shot, and when things crashed and burned, I almost didn't make it. I was so close to ending me, many times, because the pain of heartbreak hurt so.

I eventually made it beyond that, but I don't know how. I think I was too scared and lazy to do it.

But finally the pain of loneliness has finally overcome my pain tolerance, and fear of heartbreak. Loneliness doesn't hurt as much as heartbreak, but it's incessant.

I'm afraid of things not working out. I'm worried about if I'll make it out alive. I just want to be loved. That's all.
