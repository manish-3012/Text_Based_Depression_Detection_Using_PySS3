The end of Junediagnosed anxiety/ depression

I wrote on here before, but I kind of have a separate question now. 

So, I know that some people in this situation have no one. I kind of do. I don't have a good relationship with my mom/ dad. My mom is alright. My 2 cousins are the best. I have a circle of old friends/ acquaintances who I feel 99% like they are my family. Here's the issue.

I feel like the burden of my death will be less of a burden than me alive. They will get over my death and then remember the good times. I feel like a financial burden on my parents. I feel like my non-life threatening chronic health issues are a burden on me. I'm starting to feel like a burden on friends too. I did confide to some people about these thoughts. I'm starting to wonder if any friends would remember me. I hope so.

I fucked up because I faked feeling better so no one would worry. I feel like I can't tell people about my true intentions. I'm planning on enduring until late June. A friend of mine has a once a year serious exam, I want to kill myself after his exam is done, and my lease is set to renew June 1st. I want to end my life like 10 days before eviction. I don't want to leave any debts.

I feel like a burden if I talk to trusted people about feeling like a burden. I'm not sure of what to do here. How do I approach cousins/ friends about this? I feel lost right now.
