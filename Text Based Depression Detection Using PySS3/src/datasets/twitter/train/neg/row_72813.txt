Any advice?I'm 18 years old and I felt my life was finally going right. A few days ago I was still happily gaming with my best friend and my girlfriend. After I came back from eating dinner my friend started talking about some fight we had ages ago. 

After that my girlfriend and bes friend didn't want to talk with me anymore. Yesterday I tried to talk about it with them. They kept ignoring me and eventually my best friend messaged me saying he didn't want to speak with me ever again. Turns out my best friend is now probably together with my former girlfriend After that he and my former gf immediately blocked me everywhere. 
He was my best friend for over 3 years so I just didn't know what I should do. I tied a noose and tried to hang myself in the bathroom. 
It didn't work and didn't know what to do. I called another friend and the only thing I could do was crying. We went for a long walk after that and talked about it. We've been friends for so long and we shared everything with each other I really don't know how to move on, I'm still not 100% sure suicide isn't the right way. Everything I do reminds me of him and everything in my room brings back memories we had. I would do anything if it would mean we could start over

I'm not sure how I can ever trust or love someone again.  I just need my friend back. I'm sorry for everything I ever did that hurt them
