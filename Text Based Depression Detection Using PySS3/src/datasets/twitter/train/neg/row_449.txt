Goodbye, maybe.Hi. Iâ€™m a British born North American. I donâ€™t have an accent. Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for upwards of 2 years. Iâ€™m a liar, a cheat, and a horrible son.

Iâ€™ve cut myself, Iâ€™ve tried to hang myself, and Iâ€™m a recovering alcoholic. Iâ€™ve almost stabbed someone intentionally. I have intense anxiety, and Iâ€™ve missed maybe 7 months of school last year because of it.

Iâ€™m afraid of the dark, I like horror flicks and books but they give me nightmares. I like to write, draw, play videogames, and exercise. I really love my 2 dogs. I love my dad and I just texted him for the first time in maybe 2 months. He has tried his best and Iâ€™m about to (maybe) throw it all away. 

I canâ€™t go on like this.

So either I change, or end it.

Iâ€™m scared to end it, and scared to change.

I love you all. I do.

Goodbye, maybe.
