Canâ€™t take anymoreFirst time poster (under a throwaway account for anonymity) but been viewing this page for some time. 

I have been struggling with the way I am feeling for many years, however the pandemic and lockdowns have exacerbated this in the last few months. I am a frontline worker and Iâ€™m sick of constantly â€œworking to liveâ€ and not having access to my usual coping strategies, such as seeing my friends and hobbies, which give my life some purpose. 

I started speaking to this girl online at the start of the year, and over the last few months we have got to know each other well. This has gave me some hope, but feel like the social contact restrictions have got in the way massively, as we cannot meet. I felt this was a real opportunity for me, after years of peer pressure from my friends and family. But with no end in sight with the social contact restrictions, I feel like my life is on hold and no longer worth living, particularly if this is expected to go on beyond 2021. 

I have slowly habituated myself to the prospect of ending my own life. In effect, I am socially isolated and withdrawn, which affects my duties at work but life outside of it. I have taken two overdoses of paracetamol recently and have written letters to myself. I am worried due to having a close family around me, who give me the strength to carry on, however itâ€™s the only way I can picture these feelings and views I have about myself going away. I do wish this isnâ€™t an option that i would consider, but canâ€™t picture the situation we find ourselves in to be any better anytime soon...
