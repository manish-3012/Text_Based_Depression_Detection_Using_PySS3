KMS NAWDefinitely want to right now. I have no good thoughts left. Its a high morning. Third 430a shift in a row. The only part that's hard is that it's CONSISTENT. mostly anyway. Imagine that. The one thing that I've wanted out of a job for the last 5 year and now it's given to me. IT'S TOO LATE! I've adjusted to inconsistency lol Now doing a this is fucking me up all over the place. I can't say I'm in physical pain, actually I can I have a caffeine head ache. I'm going back to school soon so these states of a misty minds won't happen as often as long as I lay more attention to my brain and swimming grey matter that is developing my cognition and behavior.
