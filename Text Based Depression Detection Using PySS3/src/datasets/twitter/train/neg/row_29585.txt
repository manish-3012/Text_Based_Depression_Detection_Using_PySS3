help.This is the third time I have been here in so many months and sometimes I feel like I am wearing my welcome thin. Things have gotten a bit better and some things have gotten a lot worse. The frequency of the urge to kill myself has been waning but at the same time it has gotten more real. I envision myself taking great lung fulls of water till my body is a chlorine mess. I look at my razor and imagine drawing a red bath. I imagine going to the gun range (since I don't own one) and just spraying the back of my head against the wall. The only thing that has really held me back is knowing that there are people out there who will be affected negatively by this decision. At some point I wonder if my selfishness will finally get the better of me and I will wind up with a stomach full of bleach. I don't know how to make things better. I have seen a therapist for 2 months now but my insurance ran out and honestly it didn't feel like it was helping. People I have talked to have all gone through similar tragedies and none of them have come out unscathed. I have heard everyone's variations of "it will get better" but, I just don't see how. My eyes have been red far too often these days and I just want a reason to live. Can someone please help me?
