I feel like I'm at the end.Truly, I do.

I can't get any professional help at all. My parents won't put me therapy. I can't call hotlines because I'm afraid they'd track me and get me. My school counselor has tried referring me to therapists that do minor's consent, but I can't afford a ride and my parents would freak out if I left on my own. My school counselor has also tried going to (not sure if state/county?) board officials to try getting me help, but they said they could only help if I was in danger. 

Well, here I am. Writing on a subreddit about suicide and actively thinking about jumping off the bridge close to me. I've tried it in the past. Got stopped by a police officer, or a lady asking if the church was open, or the car was going too slow. 

Not a single person cares about me now. I left the school the previous counselor was at. None of my family nor friends cared from the start. It's just me on the bridge railing watching the traffic and the rising sun. 

I don't think I can do this anymore. I'm at my limit. I think this is really it.
