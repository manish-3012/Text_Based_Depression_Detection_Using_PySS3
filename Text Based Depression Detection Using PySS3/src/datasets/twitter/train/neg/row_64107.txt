I donâ€™t understand lifePeople tell me to enjoy the little things but how can you enjoy the little things when youâ€™re not going anywhere thatâ€™s the right direction and when you canâ€™t a see a future for yourself. I genuinely donâ€™t understand that logic and Iâ€™m trying to but I canâ€™t. I know Iâ€™m not trying hard enough to get better and Iâ€™m screwing myself over more and more and itâ€™s all my fault.
