The bums always lose, Lebowski!Iâ€™m still unemployed and suicidal and my student loan bills are due in a couple weeks. I have $56 to feed myself with and need to come up with $90 by the bill due date. I live with my mom and most days I can barely shower or eat let alone apply to work anywhere, and I canâ€™t drive and I live in the middle of nowhere. Sure people have suggestions on what to do but Iâ€™ve thought about every alternative already. Iâ€™m spending the week in the city with a friend and I might get a $5 psychic reading.

I am literally financially a burden to my family and nobody wants a deadbeat child, yet here I am. My mom is too busy to take me to a therapist, but before this I had been seeing one for years with no improvement, only steady decline and 6 different types of medication that showed no change. Eventually my mom Iâ€™m a stunted 23 year old child who is absolutely powerless. A pathetic spoiled NEET.

What am I even supposed to do? Live a miserable life just for others? Iâ€™ve been doing that this whole time and itâ€™s worn me away.

I have about three whole bottles of effexor which isnâ€™t ideal but itâ€™s better than accidentally killing whoever finds me holed up in the garage trying to get carbon monoxide poisoning. And I canâ€™t afford a gun even though I could probably get one at a shop easily. 

What are you gonna do, just spend your whole life a burden?
