Iâ€™m slowly losing the last thing that I thought might be worth living for.I was planning on ending it in a few months but I just want to do it right now. I wonâ€™t I stand by my promise of my last year. I wonâ€™t hit 10 years of being suicidal no matter what. Only a few more months and Iâ€™ll finally be free. Iâ€™m thinking either gun or just driving 100mph into something.
