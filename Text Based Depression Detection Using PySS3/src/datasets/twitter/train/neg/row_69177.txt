I just don't know what to doI just need to let it out. I dunno what to do. My current relationship is falling apart. All of my relationships have fallen apart. I mess everything up because I hate myself, and it just makes me hate myself more. No one can love someone who is like that, I get it. I really don't think I'm good enough to ever get myself together, I'm too weak and let things get to me and fall into being a useless burden over and over. 

I've been like this forever, I tell myself I'm gonna try harder and it never happens. I was depressed before I ever had real reason to be, and then life has come in and kicked me around, like everyone else, which I'm pretty sure has made me worse. I know everything I could do to make things better, I just don't. I need help and I know no one else can do it for me, but I just don't have the energy to do anything about it. 

 I moved from my hometown to be with my current BF, his whole family lives here. They are nice but I don't know who to talk to. I have no real friends here, just acquaintances. I don't think any of these people need to hear about the problems my BF and I are having. I hate dragging other people down. I just wish I could make him happy, but I get depressed and screw up. Last time we fought he told me to kill myself and just get it over with. I said mean things too. He apologized and said he didn't mean it. But I really think he's right. 

He's not home, because he hasn't been alot lately. I don't want him to come home and find me dead cause that's an awful thing to do to someone, but at the same time, I kind of do. :(

Edit: and see this is my problem, because as soon as I post this, I immediately feel guilty for making anyone read my whining. How do I stop feeling so guilty for existing all the time?
