I'm not going to do it,but I would if I knew my family would be okay, and that the girl I love wouldn't blame herself.

I've wanted to die for the past fifteen years.  I've accomplished a lot, but it hasn't been worth it.  I hate this place.  I hate myself.  My life looks great from the outside.  I have no idea how people who have it worse than me are able to go on, except that I know that I'm weak.  I have no will.

I think if I were a better writer, I'd have been dead long ago, for I'd have been able to properly convey my feelings and convince everyone that my death was for the best.

I don't want to get into the specifics of my misery.  Actually, all I wanted to say was I FUCKING HATE MYSELF.
