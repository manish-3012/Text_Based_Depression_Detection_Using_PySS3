Incoherent Thoughts Of A Suicidal TeenIâ€™m 16 and been contemplating since I was about 12 ish. I always told myself that I shouldnâ€™t do it because next year will be better and then it never was. I have nothing to attach me to this world anymore. My own mother admitted that she never loved me and wants to kick me out. My father wants nothing to do with me and no one else in my family acknowledges my existence. My girlfriend stopped talking to me after I confessed that Iâ€™ve been feeling suicidal and wanted someone to talk to. Those were my 3 reasons to live and I lost all of them. I canâ€™t even seek help because my family believes that Iâ€™m just childish for feeling suicidal and that I should just be happy. Iâ€™m sorry if this doesnâ€™t make sense Iâ€™m just ranting
