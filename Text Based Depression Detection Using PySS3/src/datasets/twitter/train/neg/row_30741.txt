Please help me RedditOne day sweet death will come and i pray that it wonâ€™t hurt too much but it most likely will but at least i will be free of this terrible pain that gnaws at the heart and wonâ€™t let me  be. 

I have my children in the next room. Iâ€™m so ashamed. They are watching tv while I sit in my shitty bedroom crying.  

When I was a child my father used to beat me and rape me and starve me. Now heâ€™s dead but Iâ€™m still alive. I have to somehow go on day after day just wondering when Iâ€™m going to be set free. 

I have been working for the last year and a half on a business. I was an idiot and put all my money into it. Now the council has rejected my application over the parking. I havenâ€™t got a lot of inner resources and this is making me unbearably sad. 

What am I going to do for money? My children rely on me and I ducked it all up.
