There has to be more to life than this...So its been 10 years since my last suicide attempt. And honestly, I just wish that attempt had been successful. Im turning 30 soon and I have been single for 10 years, and i have no kids. My entire life is nothing but going to work and paying bills so I can continue to go to work and pay bills. I am fucking miserable. All the time. Ive tried everything over these last 10 years to try and create a better life for my self. Ive tried seeing 4 different therapists, ive tried changing jobs / careers 4 times, tried dating and going out on the weekends to try and experience the things that actually make life worth living. Over these past 10 years, i thought that if worked hard enough, or I just kept at it long enough, things would eventually get better. But no matter what, at the end of the day, Im always alone, always fucking miserable, always fucking unhappy. I cant keep doing this anymore. There should have been more my to life than this. 

Anyways, Just posting here in the extremely unlikely event someone here can offer some advice that I havnt already heard a million times before and/or inspire me to have hope again; so that way I can honestly say I did everything I possibly could before attempting to check out early again.
