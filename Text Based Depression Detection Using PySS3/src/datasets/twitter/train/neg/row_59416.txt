Give me a reason to keep trying1- I have 23k in debt
2- I make 600 a week
3- I am undocumented in US, that says a lot
4- Canâ€™t go back to where I came from; donâ€™t know how to live there since Iâ€™m here all my adult life
5- Iâ€™m a single woman, 36 years old, single. No solid friendship either.
6- Iâ€™m tired of being the help, I want to grow professionally, but canâ€™t. Read #3. 
7- Iâ€™m scared of walking in the streets, also because of #3. 

I have nothing to live for. All could be easily fixed with that piece of paper called green card, which my only chance would be by getting married. But because Iâ€™m just a nanny, people look down on me. I canâ€™t win. And Iâ€™m so very tired.
