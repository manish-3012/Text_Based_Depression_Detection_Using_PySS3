I'm trapped between my best friend and my ex girlfriend and I can't talk to anyoneMy ex girlfriend and I split up a few years ago due to some issues she was having due to her abusive mother. She's since moved out and gotten counseling and is doing better. But when we were together she was emotionally abusive.

All I want to do is give it a try again, see if she's changed, but my best friend in the whole fucking world refuses to talk to me as long as I'm talking to my ex. I don't know what to do.
