I literally don't know how to be happy alone.I wish I were dead all the time and I think a big part of not is being single. I have been single for 3 years, had some hook ups here and there, but no sign of love or that I I'll find anyone that likes me. Almost everyone I know is in some sort of relationship, and I honestly don't know how to love myself. I just hate myself and wish I could die. 21 in college not a lot of time here left. I don't even know how to go about dating or even if I am capable. I need help or something.
