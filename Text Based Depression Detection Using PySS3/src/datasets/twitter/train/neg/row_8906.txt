I feel like I'm going to kill myself soonI don't know how to expand on the title. When things are going okay I can't deal with them. Then I ruin everything and it becomes even more impossible. And I'm tired of trying. I don't want to tell this to people I know so I'm posting it here I guess. 

I wish I'd just die already. I'm a piece of shit.
