Thought about it today.A lot, my dog was extra cuddly and she hardly ever is. I havenâ€™t been sleeping much lately and I think itâ€™s adding to my feeling down. Today my dog gets all the credit in the world. Sheâ€™s keeping me here. Iâ€™ll be seeing a dr about it in the morning. Iâ€™m so emotional about it, I hate admitting something is wrong.
