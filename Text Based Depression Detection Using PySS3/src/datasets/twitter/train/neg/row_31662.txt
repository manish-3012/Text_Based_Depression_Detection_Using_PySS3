My abusive brother has pushed me to the edge before, hereâ€™s how to protect yourself from someone like him.My brother was mostly fine when I was a young child. After a while he would begin hurting me sometimes â€œit was a joke Luke! Calm down wuss.â€ It may not seem like much right? Yeah. It Was. I would realize that this was nothing light, scars all around my body from his punch and pushing me against walls. I would become scared of him, even now I flinch when he comes near me. He would constantly take gifts even though they were â€œoursâ€ constantly harass me for my skinny short appearance (Iâ€™m a 65lb 13 year old) and even making fun of me for having trans friends and a black girlfriend. I tried to end my life purely because of that psychopath. I had  the noose around  my neck, but I realized I just couldnâ€™t take him up on his bullshit anymore. I spoke out against him and it saved my life, I hope it can save you too.
