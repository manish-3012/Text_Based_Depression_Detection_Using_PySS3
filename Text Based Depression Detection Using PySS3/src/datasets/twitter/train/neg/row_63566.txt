the hourglass of my life is running out of sandok this might be a little long but I will try to make it as short as possible...

Basically I have been diagnosed with chronic depression few years ago maybe when I was 11/12? And my 16th birthday is next month but I don't think I want to live until I see the day because the week after my birthday the most important person in my life passed away my grandpa and he was the nicest person on earth and honestly the most humble human being on earth he was the only person in my whole family I could trust 100% and he promised me he would watch me grow up and become an amazing adult but I guess he won't and ever since he passed away my life became even worse than ever before because long story short my Mom, step-douche and bio dad all hate me ever since I came out of the closet as gay all three of them stopped treating me like a normal human being my mother, not letting me hang out with boys, forcing me to dress as masculine as possible and is on the verge of beating me whenever she finds out I buy anything pink and my step-douche always making jokes about me and how I dress, act etc then my stepfather who once I came out stopped talking to me for a few years and now everytime my mom forces me to see him he is always trying to convert me to Christianity and It's disgusting whenever any of them have the chance they always try to make my life a living hell I am not exaggerating at all and my grandfather used to be the only human being that ever defended me from them but now that he is gone I am basically open season for all 3 of those bigoted assholes I just want to die so hopefully if there is an afterlife he will be there waiting for me with open arms I can't wait for 2 more years until I leave this prison my mother calls a home I know I am fortunate, have food on the table and a roof over my head but what goes on under the roof is what nobody should have to go through my mother constantly says she is going to get me into therapy again but she denies I have any mental illness and says no matter what she is never going to medicate me because she believes "it doesn't work it's just a band-aid." and that my fucked up brain can be healed by myself well maybe it could be if my family didn't treat me like a fucking animal in all honesty I don't think I will have anywhere to go when i'm 18 I want to become a photographer but all of my 800 tumblr followers who love my work are obviously never getting me anywhere... I wish my mom would let me spend time with my friends but since all the ones I have left are male she will think I will just be fucking all of them and obiously won't let me hang out with any of them... I need a social life but my mom thinks trapping me in my house screaming at me for being "Too gay." is all I need in life
