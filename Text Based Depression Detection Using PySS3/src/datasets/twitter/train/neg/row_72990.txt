Help please. please.I literally have no out in this world except suicide. my own family abuses me so much , have abused me from the very beginning, bcz obviously I am the unwanted twin. 

I was getting so much better from last year, when i was literally a hands breath away from committing suicide. I had preparations too. except I don't have any now. thye have again driven me against the wall. broke my stuff, beat the shit out of me and telling me to die. 

Its not that i dont want to die,  I do. i just want to make it permanent. knowing what i know as a med student i know not many ways easily accessible is actually permanent.I think i will just start self harming. I dont like it. it draws to much attention. i dont know what to do. i would drop off the building if mine wasnt so low. I cant go out of house. I dont have anything to distract my mind. help please. distract me somehow
