i have so many things wrong with me its hard to see a reason to keep going.i have so much wrong with me i dont even know where to begin. i have severe anxiety, aspergers, adhd, been battling depression for years. i recently got diagnosed with a autoimmune thyroid disease, not only has it made me feel like shit for months and severe muscle and joint pain but it has also caused my hair to fall out and now its extremely thin and wirey, its caused me to get a fucking goiter on my neck from where my thyroid has enlarged that keeps growing every day, i also have pretty bad acne and scars on my face and i brush my teeth and wash my face in the dark so i dont have to look at myself, speaking of teeth i have bruxism and have worn them down to nubs because of teeth grinding and my jaw allways hurts. im poor and dont have a job, nobody will hire me because i cant even look people in the eye and have no skills and cant drive, i have only 1 friend who i never see because she lives hours away from me, i have no pets, the only people i even speak is my mum and dad, im 24 but feel like im mentally not developed like other girls my age and i feel like every day i get left behind more. i have no easy way to kill myself so i probably wont do it, just needed to vent, i know so many people have it so much worse than me and my problems are trivial in comparioson, but im just finding it hard to see the positives right now.
