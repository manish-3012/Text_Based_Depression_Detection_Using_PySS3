New Year Same ShitThis has probably been the worst year of my life, and this will definitely be the loneliest New Years Iâ€™ve ever had. Iâ€™m so alone, and frankly I deserve it. To put it eloquently, I suck. I donâ€™t deserve kindness or love, but I crave connection so much. Oh well. Canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m going to be alive in 2020, it feels very surreal. Hereâ€™s to an uncertain and probably very negative future for humanity. And for me in particular. 

To all you beautiful people out there struggling, you deserve to have a great future. I believe in you and wish the best for all of you. But Iâ€™m an asshole and I deserve to keep sinking.
