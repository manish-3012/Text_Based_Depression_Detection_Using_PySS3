Is it just an eventuality?Hey guys,

I'm really struggling. I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop staring at beautiful couples all laughing and enjoying themselves. Working or conversing or just having LIVES with other people.

No one wants me. I got fired two weeks ago, and every interview I go on is just kind of a dud. Same with dating. I've been single for over five years now. I'm almost 29, unemployed, balding, no real friends, the phone never rings, no one texts, tinder and other online dating sites yield zero results. I'm burning through my savings. I just, I just can't get a grip. I feel like I shouldn't exist in the world.

I feel like I failed. I feel like I've lost. Life, happiness, sex, relationships, longevity, health... they're all meant for other people. Why put the inevitable off anymore? I'm going to die broke and alone, why not just end it now. I literally can't think of anyone besides my father that would miss me.

I need someone to help me. Desperately. I'm in Columbus, Ohio and i feel like I'm just going to drive my car 120 MPH into a tree or something. Just end it. I feel like it's inevitable.
