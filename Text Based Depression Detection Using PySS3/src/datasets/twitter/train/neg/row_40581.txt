I am the biggest loser I know.Life used to be glamourous, I have appeared in newspapers, magazines, invited to be keynote and panel speakers at worldwide events. After getting laid off from my last job, I can't even find a job anymore. I have been unemployed for over a year and life has been cruel. The best job I can find is a barista job at a coffee shop downstairs at where I used to work and I can tell my wife is extremely disappointed. The way she looked at me is different now. She is no longer interested in listen to me and I can feel she now looks down on me. 

I am not afraid that she will leave me. in fact, I would leave myself if I were her. I am a fucking loser, 7 years of education still not employable skill. I want to humiliate myself before ending it. I wrote a book that documented everything I have learned since graduation. If I die I know I won't be missed.
