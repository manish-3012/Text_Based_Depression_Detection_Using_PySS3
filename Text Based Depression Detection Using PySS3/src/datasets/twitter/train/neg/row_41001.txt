Hello
Hey there. I hope youâ€™re doing well. Iâ€™m not going through such a good time. Iâ€™m suffering from extreme depression over something honestly pathetic but I just need someone to talk to.  Iâ€™m having a lot of suicidal thoughts and I am crying a lot. I honestly really need a friend. Like a real friend. Iâ€™m just not sure if Iâ€™m capable of having any.
