I changed my mind, well for now...Since I can't stand being here in this house anymore, I'm deciding to move to my grandma and aunts house on Saturday. They told me that if I was ever feeling sad or I felt lonely at my house, then I could move in with them. They even said that they would love it if I moved in with them.  However I still don't know if I'm gonna go over there on Saturday. The last time I slept over at their house was almost 5 years ago. 5 years ago I used to go there on Saturday mornings and come back to my house on Sunday night. I only did this for about 9 months and then never slept over at their house again. I did visit them several times a month on Saturdays. When my mom got sick of cancer in October 2009, I had moved over there since I had no one to take care of me here at my house. I moved back to my house in June 2011. So I haven't lived there since I was 8 years old. I'm worried that I'm gonna get home sick or something. If I do move over there I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do when I start school in August. I don't wanna go to school over there. The schools over there are awful. I used to go to school over there when I lived there. If I change my mind and kill myself instead, I don't know what my grandma and aunt are gonna think. They care about me so much. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life anymore and feel like I'm losing my mind here. If I go over there I feel like I'm still gonna be depressed but not as bad. I sometimes find myself crying at random points during the day. I don't know how I'm gonna hide my depression if I do go over there. 


You guys think I should move over there or stay here and kill myself? Cause I'm fucking losing my mind in this terrible house and I'm at my wits!
