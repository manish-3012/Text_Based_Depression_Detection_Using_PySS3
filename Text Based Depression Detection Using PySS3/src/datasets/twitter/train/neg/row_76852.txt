A redditor has made it very clear what must happen.I made a huge mistake a few months ago. Huge. Life altering. I am fucked in the head from it and decided to post about the mistake. This redditor took it upon himself to dig and find any/all personal info and told me he was basically going to make sure I suffer even more from my mistake. My daughter will be put into foster care. My family will be homeless and even more helpless. I will be put away for a very long time. Yes, I realize what happened and what I did was wrong and awful and disgustingly terrible but it wasn't on purpose and the people experiencing the results of my actions have forgiven me. But thanks to my big mouth and lack of thinking and this redditor, everything in my life will be taken, ruined, and lost.

So, in short, I feel as though I must give up. I simply cannot live through to see this happen.

In the next few days I will make the arrangements, since I'm pretty sure this guy is serious about what he wants to do.

Goodbye reddit, you were mainly all assholes, but a few of you were alright.
