FrustratingIt's so frustrating when people say suicide is never an option. Should society do everything it can to stop people from killing themselves impulsively or because of strong emotions? Absolutely. But it is very different when someone has wanted to die for years and that feeling has never changed. 

I'm in so much pain all the time that life isn't worth it. I don't enjoy anything anymore. It's hard to enjoy anything when you're in pain and know it could get worse any minute. But if I ever express the fact that the only thing I want is to die, I get told that I can't.

I can't kill myself because it would hurt the people who love me. But what about me? I'm hurting right now. Obviously I care that it would hurt them, but I can only hope they would understand that the pain I was in was too much for me to bear. Also, the people who truly love me must be hurting already seeing me like this, wouldn't my death be a relief?

If your dog was hurting all the time and it was never going to get better, you would do the right thing and have it put down painlessly. This isn't because you want it dead, but because you love it and don't want it to suffer. The only difference here is that unlike a dog, I can tell you how bad my pain is and tell you that I want to die but I am refused that option. 

I have seen therapists and tried meds and nothing has worked. My pain is never going to go away, so for me this isn't a "permanent solution to a temporary problem". Permanent problems require permanent solutions.
