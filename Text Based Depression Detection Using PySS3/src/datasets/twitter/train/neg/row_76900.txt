why cant i do iti'm failing out of college and i'm probably going to be kicked out the house soon. my life had been going great for a long time and my anxiety and depression wasn't all gone but it was managable and i was somewhat content.

now i've gone back to the place i was about a year ago. tonight's been the first time in two years that i took a knife to my legs and started cutting. i barely felt anything from it, if there was any relief at all it was from being distracted by the pain i inflicted onto myself.

i've felt this mental anguish before and have been in pysch hospitals but i've never fully committed to killing myself as there was always some glimmer of hope. but now i don't want to wait any longer. i have no use to society and nothing is going to change that. if i had a gun i'd put it to my head immediately but unfortunately i don't have access to one.

i tried hanging myself tonight but couldn't last more than 10 seconds. what do i have to do to tell myself to stop being a fucking failure and a waste of life so i can finally find the strength to end my life. i figure my only option is to numb myself with opiates and alcohol before i end it. any ideas would be appreciated, i don't want to get better i want to die
