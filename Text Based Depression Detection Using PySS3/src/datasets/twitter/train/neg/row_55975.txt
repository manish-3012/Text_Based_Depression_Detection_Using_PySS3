I don't need to experience anymore of lifeMy affinity for life is very low. It's not that life is hard, it's actually pretty easy. It's just that I have come to understand the ideas of free will and progress are delusions. I don't feel like explaining these things because I'm not interested in hearing from people who hold these delusions.

So what do I have left? 
I have mindfulness, being in the present moment. I have a constant thought to kill myself that arises from no particular emotion. I don't listen to it because everyone always says it's wrong because of certain reasons. When I analyze these reasons I find they don't apply to me. 

"Live for pleasure." I don't care much for pleasure and I already do the most I can to live a pleasurable life. "Live to find a meaning." I am very nihilistic, that is out of my control. "This is your one chance at life, why throw it away?" Going back to my title, I don't need to experience anymore things, I don't know why but that's how I feel. I am not afraid of death because death is not the end, there is only consciousness. There is no end of consciousness because you don't experience time before your birth or after death, you can only experience consciousness.
