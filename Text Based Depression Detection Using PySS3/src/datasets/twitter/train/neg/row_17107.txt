Tried killing myself last night and failed. Like everything else I attempt.Drank a bottle of vodka and swallowed two bottles of pain killer  tablets. I ended up vomiting up all the pills and passed out. When I woke up this  morning I cleaned the mess before anyone in the house could see it, and carried on as if nothing had happened. Now I feel guilty and am crying. I just needed to tell someone.
