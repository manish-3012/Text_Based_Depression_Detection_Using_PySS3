People who say a relationship isnt the key are full of shitThese past 2.5 years have been the happiest I've ever been in my life. When I found my girlfriend I finally felt that void inside me being filled. I finally wasnt alone on the world anymore. I had someone to get up for in the morning, someone who could hold me whenever I felt depressed or suicidal. I did therapy and medication, and they helped too, but nothing like my girlfriend did.


And now it's probably over. She says she doesnt feel that in love anymore and that it's different from previous times.


All I want to do right now is just get it over with and finally kill myself. I'm so alone, afraid and hurt. In one conversation I turned into my past self again. I'm just done, guys. I dont want to anymore. I want to collect the courage I have and finally end it. Please talk me out of it.
