Read my old suicide note tonightRead my old suicide note tonight

A while back (couple months ago, so not too long ago) when my mental state was particularly bad I wrote out a suicide note. I didnâ€™t have anything to say to my parents or any of my friends except one. I donâ€™t feel like I need to give an explanation, Iâ€™d rather my issues die with me rather than existing in other peopleâ€™s heads. I wrote the letter to the only friend who Iâ€™ve fully opened up to, and I was prepared to do it. Instead, I went to sleep. Iâ€™ve been struggling lately so I went back and read that note and got this strange sense of comfort. It made me feel so relaxed, maybe it was the idea that if Iâ€™d gotten that close to killing myself before and hadnâ€™t, I could do it again.
