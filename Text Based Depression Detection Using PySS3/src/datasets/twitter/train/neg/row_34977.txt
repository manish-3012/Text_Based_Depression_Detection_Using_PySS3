I only wanted to be happyMy only wish was to be satisfied with the life I live. But due to external factors and things I canâ€™t change, I wonâ€™t ever be happy. 

My life for the past month is my lowest point mentally. I talk to people, I desperately ask for support and advice, but nothing seems to help me. 

For all the efforts Iâ€™ve made to improve my life in the last 3 years I have nothing to show for it. Iâ€™m in the same exact position I was since 15yo. 

The effects of not having a father or a male role model are becoming more and more apparent, more than Iâ€™d like to admit. 

This past month I spent a lot of time contemplating life at every waking hour, and I realized that my life is repeating itself in a vicious cycle of torment and injustice. Each new semester I yielded the same lonely failure life, devoid of any social interaction. Itâ€™s as if thereâ€™s a curse of misfortune placed upon me. I wonder whatâ€™s the point of starting a new life. Iâ€™ve done the same thing in years, how horrible it would be if I try and fail again, when I am at my lowest? I canâ€™t even imagine how much of an epic defeat that would be.
