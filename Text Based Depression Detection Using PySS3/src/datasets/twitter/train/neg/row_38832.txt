God I wasted so much lifeMan if I knew 2020 was gonna be like this I would have tried to do more shit in 2019. Now I'm such an irreparable fucking mess I don't think it'll ever go away. I'm fat as hell, in a bigger hole than usual, and I wasted all last year thinking that depressive spout would end and 2020 would be better because of a trip I'd planned.

I'm not gonna fucking bother anymore. Life is shit. I can't wait to just have the strength to end it.
