Relationship in limbo, unhappy, I'm out. So, two days ago, she asked me to move out.  We were living at her parents house (which is disgraceful in and of itself... I'm 27 ffs) and it feels like there was no warning.  She said that I take up too much room in her bedroom, that she just needed space, but that we would still do things, would still see each other.  And now, she won't take my calls, she doesn't answer texts... So, I'm out... Gonna lay on the train tracks, neck on the track and let the express train do its thing in the morning.  Life without her isn't worth living.
