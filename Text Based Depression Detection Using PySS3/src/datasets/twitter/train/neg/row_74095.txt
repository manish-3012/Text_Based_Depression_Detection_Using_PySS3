I fucking hate every aspect of my lifeYou can call this some sort of rant don't know anywhere else to put this in, but I really just want to get it off my chest and get back to shitting on myself

As the title says not gonna repeat, I thought about taking my own life multiple times and literally the only thing holding me back is my religion, I live in a place(rather not say where) where I'm basically that one kid that everyone hates but nobody knows, I'll get everything out of the way now, I'm a Muslim, half a Palestinian, got a terrible English accent, lives in a place where everyone is the opposite of me,and don't live a single day without staring at the wall for half of the day repeating every insult thrown at me over and over," Palestine didn't even exist you stupid immigrant" "go and blow stuff up somewhere else" "maybe you shouldn't speak if you don't have the brains to", and for the record I never tell anything about me to anyone except for the 3 fucktards that i thought are my "friends" and they decided to ruin my relationship with everyone else in the area, some didn't bother hearing them but the vast majority were on me since they knew who I am, I'm not here to work, I'm here to study, and my grades have been slowly going down hill, thank God for my amazing teachers that helped me get back on track,(and I guess you could say red dead redemption 2 helped me calm down a little)

Tldr; everything in life is total shit and my teachers are trying to motivate me
