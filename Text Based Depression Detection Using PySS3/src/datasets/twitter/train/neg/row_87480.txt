Friend tried to commit suicide a few nights ago and just told me, what the fuck do I do?So I'm 17 and so is the friend I'm talking about. I was with a few other friends during new years and get a text from my friend around 1. He tells me not to tell anyone what he's about to say, so I agree. He then tells me he doesn't want to live anymore, and then reveals he took about 6 oxys a few nights ago (he weighs 270).

After he revealed that I was just in shock. I kept telling him not to do anything, I love him, he's my brother. His mind was definitely on killing himself tonight. I kept repeating what I said and told him we'll go to a local wildlife refuge and talk about it tomorrow. He stopped texting me for a bit so I called another close friend of mine and his and was about to speed to his place, but my friend then answered me and told me he was good.

What the hell do I do now, because I told him I wouldn't tell anyone. I want to make sure my friend is safe.
