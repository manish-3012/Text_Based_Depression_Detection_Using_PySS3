Life fell apart because of hospitalization. Feels like I've lost control of my mind.I think I mostly just need to vent. I feel like I don't have control over my brain anymore. I feel scared and helpless and I lack the ambition I used to have. I cry all the time, sometimes for no reason. 

Sometimes I think about death and suicide, but I think I'm too scared to actually do it. More often I think about how my life is useless and everything is unattainable. I use sleep to escape. 

I was in the hospital for blood clots in my leg and lung. I feel like now that I'm out I'm a weak person. When I first got out, I kept going back to the emergency room trying to be readmitted. Still not completely sure why. 

Everything seems unreachable, and I'm too tired to try. I have anxiety attacks, sometimes without provocation. I obsess over things that scare me. I can't ever concentrate, especially at school. 

I'm afraid that I am becoming mentally insane like the rest of my family. I'm afraid that nothing is going to get better and I'll have to learn to "live" with this. 

I have eating issues. I have drug issues. I had a bad childhood. 

My psychiatrist thinks I have PTSD from being in the hospital. I was convinced that I was there because I was waiting to die, and the staff treated me poorly. 

I want to find my ambition again. I used to be a great student and a hard worker. I used to feel like anything was possible and I was full of confidence. Now I feel the exact opposite. 

I'm on Prozac and tegretol. I'm seeing a psychologist for the first time tomorrow. I just thought I should let it all out here because suicide is something I've been thinking more and more about daily.
