Ruined another chance.Every girl I talk to, I always end up talking too much and they never talk to me again. I've been single for 3 years now... 3 years. I've talked to a few girls between then and now and nothing has fulfilled anything inside of me. I'm completely fucking dead inside. I've been suicidal since I was 7 years old, and I'm 22 now. I'm fucking worthless. This social anxiety is my enemy and it's fucking defeating me.
