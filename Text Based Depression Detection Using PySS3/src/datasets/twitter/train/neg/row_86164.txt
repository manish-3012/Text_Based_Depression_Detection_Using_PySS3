WhyWhy do I always fuck everything up. Im always the one that gets upset at small things. I always lash out over it. I can't control myself bro. I simply can't. So I'm honestly kinda wanting to give up. Anger mixed with depression and suicidal tendencies is always recipe to fuck things up. I want to change, but no one will tell me how or even attempt to help me. Even if they did I wouldn't listen cause it'd probably involve changing my entire persona. 

I guess it doesn't help to get in a relationship with someone who says they like you than they break up with you the same fucking day then fucking lead you on after that to make you think that they still like you, but that they had problems. Constantly flirting. Than at the end of all of it they tell you "i don't think it's a good idea for us to get together" yeah k. Fuck you. No one here will even read this so it doesn't really matter and if anyone does read this they won't give a single fuck. Just a bunch of suicidal people trying to make suicidal people feel better. 

Idek why I'm here.
