Life, society, joke.Life is a poorly designed mess. Society is a joke, it's like some idiots decided that unless you are the ideal person, life will be miserable for you. Don't agree? too bad. I'm so pissed, so now like many I'm stuck between the "I can make it better" and the "Imma just end it all". Fuck this.
