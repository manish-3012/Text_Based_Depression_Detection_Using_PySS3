Why not?Why shouldn't I kill myself?

I've failed at everything I've ever attempted. If something isn't fast and easy, I avoid it. I'm lazy, weak, selfish, and just unpleasant to be around. I look at myself in the mirror and just cringe and look away quickly. I am socially retarded, never had a relationship of any kind. I look at my life, and I think that there's no saving it. Even if things got better, just the memory of how much I've already failed will crush me for the rest of my life. I'm tired of it all, tired of how much more of this I still have to go through before something kills me, and the more I think about ending it all the better that sounds.

So why not? Why not just end it here?

Give me a reason to stay. Please.
