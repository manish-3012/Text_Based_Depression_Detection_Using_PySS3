I tried to kill myself tonight but didn't heres my notebasically I might have lost my close friends tonight.  heres some of the note rest is a bit to private and emotional.   



"Im sorry I canâ€™t do this anymore I have upset the people that I care about to much Iâ€™ve had these thoughts too often and now that I have seen what kind of person that I am itâ€™s horrible  please no one blame themselves for this its what it has come to understand that it is my choice I can take it anymore Iâ€™ve fucked up everything with people  I try my hardest with people but I always push them a way goodbye"

Still don't like who I am but i'm hopefully I can fix it and repair the relationships. I called a help line and they are so amazing putting things into context.  I keep unintentionally hurting those I care about even though I have the best of intentions.
