Iâ€™ve lost everyoneMy grandparents parents brother have all passed (Iâ€™m 28) I threw away the girl of my dreams in lockdown we split 7 weeks ago and Iâ€™m scared sheâ€™s gone forever. My mental health nosedived being alone 24/7 and I refused to acknowledge this until she dumped me. I have really good friends and my dads passing left me very comfortable financially but everyday is a struggle. Iâ€™m in therapy now every Tuesday and Friday to deal with the grief over my family that I locked away but I still feel hopeless and aimless without my ex. I feel like I have noone in the world to love and no one in the world lives me. I wish this pain and grief would leave me. I just donâ€™t see a future without her
