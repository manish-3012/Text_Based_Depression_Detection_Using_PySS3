i've grown bitterthe oast 6 years, since 14 i've experienced nothing but misfortune. im not happy, meds dont make me happy. i feel like i physically cant be happy. and if by some miracle i can be happy, i cant hold onto it for long. 

seeing others happy makes jealousy swell within and i feel a sense of hate. like a fire has been lit in me that cant be extinguished. but it's self-hate. i hate who i am, who i've become, who i continue to be. 

i dont know what to do anymore. i've been on the edge of the cliff for too long.. staring into the abyss. i've been in the dark for far too long and im afraid this is where i'll stay. not by choice, but because life made me this way. 

i wish i could change. i really do. 

help me.
