words of encouragement, sort ofOkay a little background first (very little). Basicly my life has been a colossal fuck up since, well, ever. Lately though it has been on a downward spiral and I have stopped taking care of myself and stopped hoping. Here comes the good part, I think I've hit bottom. I no longer give a shit what the people who care about me (figuratively) think. I don't feel like I owe anybody an explanation. I'm depressed, period. I can accept my lack of motivation and just do nothing for now. I have come to terms with my fears of being alone and being viewed as a weak man, with the possibility of not finding love and never doing anything that will inspire anyone, with not having any impact on the world. I've been going through my life pretending not to care but now I truly don't. The difference is huge, surprisingly so, and it feels... good. :)
