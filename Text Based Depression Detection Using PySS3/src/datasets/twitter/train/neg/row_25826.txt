My greatest wish in life is to truly not give a fuck.If there is a God and he does exist, please grant me the gift of not giving a single fuck what *anybody* thinks about me. To be truly and utterly disconnected and free from the judgments of my peers and my family. 

There are so many things I want to do in life, but I never will be able to unless this great anxiety is lifted. Take it away, lord. It's the **only** thing stopping me. Take it away.
