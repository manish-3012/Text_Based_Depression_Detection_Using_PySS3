I'm about to end my lifeMy name is Molly I'm 16 I have had a hell of a teenage years I missed out of every second of them I have extreme depression and suicidal thoughts I have attempted suicide twice once when I was 12 and when I was 14 I have suffered mental torture for many years stuff if I went into too I would break down I have many mental health conditions and struggle to leave my bed most days I havnt been to school since I was 13 I should be in college but I can't even think about that I have planned my suicide and I most likely won't make it too christmas not a day goes by I don't think about ending the pain of my daily life and yes I have had help yet it hasn't changed and I don't want to be sectioned so I won't speak on how I feel I wanna live I wanna be somebody yet my mental state is extremely bad and I can't take this much longer I have no friends I'm alone I want out
