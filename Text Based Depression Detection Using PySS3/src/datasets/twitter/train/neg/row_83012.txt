I feel so useless and incompetent with everything I doIf anyone has some constructive advice for me maybe....

It feels like everything I do fails... I'm 23, I've done nothing with my life. Spent 4 years as a stripper cause that's all I have ever been good for, the only thing really I was a little bit good at but I was still shit cause I wasn't as good as the other girls...I'm trying to better myself by doing an automotive collision repair course/training but I feel so useless and I'm sure my tutor thinks I'm just a dumb bimbo, even though I really am trying. Everything I try to do, I ruin and I've had enough...I live in a garage and haven't lived in a house for over a year, I have no money, no friends...no life..I'm sad all the time and constantly imagine all the ways I could take my own life. I was a self harmer in the past and everything in me is screaming to get drunk and cut my throat open and just end it...but a small part of me doesn't want to give up. I feel like I'm going nowhere...I feel like nothing...I'm a nobody. The last time I made an attempt on my life it failed and left me with a bit of a heart murmur...I can't even kill myself properly..just want to roll over and die...
