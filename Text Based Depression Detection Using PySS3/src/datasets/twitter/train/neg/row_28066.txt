I donâ€™t want to die but I just canâ€™t find a purpose for myselfRecently Iâ€™ve been having some issues with depression. Itâ€™s weird because everything is going right in my life (accepted to my dream college, great friends, etc.). I just canâ€™t escape this overwhelming feeling of boredom and loneliness and pointlessness. I get really jealous of people who can enjoy their normal lives and accept that itâ€™s all for nothing. I really donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking for with this post but I just would like to know that Iâ€™m not the only one like this. I just feel like thereâ€™s something wrong. I started cutting myself here and there about 2 months ago and it just feels like Iâ€™m letting all of the tension in my brain out. I just need some help. Thanks
