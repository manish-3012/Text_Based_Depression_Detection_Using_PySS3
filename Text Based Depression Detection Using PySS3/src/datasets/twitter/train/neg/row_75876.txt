Academic pressure's causing my cousin to consider suicide.I wasnt even expecting her to be this way, but she just confessed to me about it just a few weeks ago, shes better now since shes finally taking a break from college soon and her mother/my guardian bought her a copy of Resident Evil 2, one of the games shes been wanting to play on her ps4.

But still its kinda bothering me, i mean, looking at how much work she has to put in her projects only for her professor to spend less than a minute to check it, isnt that so much?

She has spent day and night, writing everything, solving each questions or lie given numbers, she is studying to become a civil engineer. And here in the philippines, the education system is shit. Like yeah sure when u graduate from the K-12 curriculum, you'd have skills enough for you to get a decent job, but 2 more years to go through highschool, with teachers who would make things harder for their students because of course thats what they have gone through, they studied hard to become a teacher....

And all those hundreds of papers, with handwritten plans/ideas plates and whatever terms they use to describe engineer stuff. Only to discover that the professor allowed printed ones, i could only imagine how much anger she had after all those hand aches or pains shes been feeling, and besides the professor didnt even announce it, she just saw her classmates bringing in printed ones and the professor checking them.

She's had anxiety attacks, and when she asks for support from her family or like dropping hints, her family would question why she would suddenly be like that, and say stuff like "are you making a drama again?"

I want to know what i could do the next time i hear her say, in a joking manner (but i could feel her seriousness) "I want to jump."
