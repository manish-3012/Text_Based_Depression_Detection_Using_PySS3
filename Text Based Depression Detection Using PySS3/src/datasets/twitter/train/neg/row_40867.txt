What is it *exactly that's making you depressed, anxious, antisocial, introverted, empty and suicidal?The feeling of depression, anxiety and guilt.. Is that the reason you claim to *want* to end it? Do you *actually* want to end it, or do you want something else, but ending it is the only option you can see for now?

Regardless of what your life is like.. Would you still think about ending it, if you felt happy/okay, excited and somewhat motivated ? (Or if you didn't have all those bad feelings basically)

Isn't **feeling** empty and depressed what's making you keep thinking about all the negative things about life, and thus making you suicidal? (and not the other way around)

It's not because your life sucks or so.. it's the bad feelings that keep making you think about ending it, right?

If that's the case then the question is the title. Otherwise I want to understand where and why I'm wrong.

Aren't the bad feelings what's making many of you take medications? If those work, why are you still depressed? Or if they don't fix your depression, then what are you taking them for exactly?
