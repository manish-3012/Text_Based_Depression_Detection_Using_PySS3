Everywhere i turn, depression is always thereI find it so depressing that we are living in a world where people are more depressed than ever. I've been depressed since I was 15 and over the last few years, the world has changed and people are becoming more and more depressed and suicidal. 

Some of my friends from high school who were the life of the party as now, two of them committed suicide, one has overdosed and another is in an mental asylum. 

I've attempted to kill myself many times, but they have failed, but I also want to help people out and make the world seem better.
