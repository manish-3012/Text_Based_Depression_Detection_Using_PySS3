Update from last postWell I'm doing better now than I was since the last time I posted. I'm not going to say too much on this post, but all I want to say is thank you to the people who reached out to me (you know who you are :) and if you are someone that needs help you can talk to me too if you need a friend. Just remember that depression is temporary, not permanent. Hope that everyone in this group has a great day :)
