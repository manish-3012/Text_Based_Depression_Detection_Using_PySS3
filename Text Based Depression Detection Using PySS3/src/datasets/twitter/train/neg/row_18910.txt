I'm just tiredThe only dream I have ever had was to find someone to spend my life with, give them all the love I have, and make their life brighter.  I only wanted what all those Disney films programmed in me to want from my childhood.

I've fallen for so many and after the last one, I just don't want to feel any more pain.

All I ever wanted was to be happy.
