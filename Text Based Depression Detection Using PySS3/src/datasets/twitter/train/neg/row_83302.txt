Why does everything have to take so much effort?Life is hard. Everyone knows this, people say it all the time. I'm 19, I have barely experienced it yet and I damn well know it's hard.

Life is pain and struggle and suffering and hard work. I just don't have what it takes. Everything is a chore. I can barely do the basic minimum of staying alive. I am genuinely angry that I have to eat several times a day, every day. I have to get out of bed every day, brush my teeth every day, shower every day, go to school and just sit there hating myself every day. I get home and kill time watching my stupid shows and I go to bed every day. Sleep is the one thing I like and still I stay up way too late cause I know I'm just gonna wake up in what feels like two seconds and have to do everything all over again. 

I've never had a job, dread the future of it every day. Never driven a car, terrified of 'em. Haven't studied at all in like a year and barely the year before that because I don't give a shit about computers or how they work, so I probably won't be able to graduate this summer. I'm just a lazy pathetic asshole who's pissed off that I have to do things.

I don't see the point. I don't want life. I don't want to join the rat race. Work to survive so I can work. Why? I wish I was never born so I wouldn't have to overcome every hardwired survival instinct in my body and experience death just to escape this trap that is existence.

I feel like I'm nearing the end of a rope though, so to speak. Maybe I'll soon find that courage. I don't see any other way.
