Why, why can't society just kill me?I'm honestly at the end of my rope, I don't know what to do anymore. I have ASPD, I cannot relate to others or feel empathy for them, I have a long history of violence, multiple felonies on my record, I used to beat the fuck out of my mom when I was a kid just for the hell of it, or when she wouldn't buy me something. I'm sick in the head, and I cannot afford nor do I want to get treatment.

I have a GED but because of my extensive criminal record getting a job seems to be an impossibility, and honestly, with my depression and lack of money I seriously doubt I can get out of this hole I'm in. I live with my elderly mom who resents me, she acts nice but I can tell that deep down she's incredibly disappointed in me and herself. I wouldn't care that much, but the thing is, she's gonna die soon and I'll need a place to stay, and without a job this looks completely hopeless.

My question is, why can't society just give people like me a way out? I'm not going to contribute anything to the world, I'm a violent, manipulative sociopath who has used and abused people his whole life. It would be less expensive to kill me than to keep me alive, as I take more than I give back, so why the fuck can't it just be done?

I'm sick of the "it gets better" trope I hear all too often, I don't like to talk to people because all they do is repeat the same bullshit over and over, people tell me I can change and I can get better but how the fuck can they expect me to do that when I can't even bother to clean up after myself?
