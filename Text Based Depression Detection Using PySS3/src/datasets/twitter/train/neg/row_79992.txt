It all just comes to this...Well here I am, my whole 14 year old gay self, wide awake, eyes are wet with tears as I cry in memory of the guy I love. (he's not dead, he just happens to hate me and I'm now separated from him, ultimately stopping me from getting to be with him.) I've lost all hope. I don't want to live anymore. So you probably wondered, why am I still here, still alive? I've attempted suicide for more than twice now and I've been stopped because I told my friends and they told my parents and now I'm under 24/7 guard by my family. I've told them what's wrong in my life, that all I want is to be with him, that I don't wantto go to school without him. I don't need gadgets and shit to make me happy, that I need him. And after more that 4 months, they've done nothing. So I'm here and I'm ready to kill myself, once they put their guard down I'm going for it and I won't let anyone stop me by telling them before I do it.


I don't really know why I'm telling you guys this, but I also wanted to tell you how awesome you guys are, and that I'm sorry for not being able to do anything to contribute to reddit's epicness. (I've thought of making so many rage comics lately but my lazy-ass stop me. (which I also wante to make a rage comic about.))

anyways I want to **thank** **you** guys for making a part of my life worthwhile.
