Used bullying as motivation. Iâ€™m no suicidal!Rip to all victims of suicide, and prayers to those struggling with the thought to do so. You are not alone, please reach out. 

One of my fondest memories from junior high was when a few of the â€œpopularâ€ older girls walked behind me in the hallway yelling, â€œSuicidal! Suicidal!â€ Yes it bothered me mentally but with proper help, I was able to use their bullying as motivation to prove their strong statements wrong and be a better individual by treating all with kindness. I understand they did not understand my situation nor cared to help heal my pain. When alone, I devised a system of no more negatives. When someone said something negative, id instantly think of something positive about it. For example, Iâ€™m stupid? Well, Iâ€™m sure glad there are teachers to teach me and test to measure my progress. I made it this far so Iâ€™m obviously not too stupid, but always room to continue learning. 

I was very active in High School and stayed motivated. I became the popular girl just by being nice. I went on to college and graduated with a degree. Today we are adults. I do occasionally have bad days, but I am still alive, winning! Letâ€™s pray those bullies teach their children to treat others with kindness so that all can pursue their lifetime dreams with mental stability.
