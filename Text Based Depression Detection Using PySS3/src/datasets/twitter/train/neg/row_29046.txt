I'm really trying...I'm out of spoons. Just came home from therapy, took the rest of the day off of work, been crying since.

It's been a long and slow decline. How I'm here is just too hard and emotional for me to explain right now.

Someone. Please. Tell me I'm going to get through this. I don't know if I should go to the hospital. I harmed myself an hour ago and I've had some impulsive suicidal thoughts a few times this week.

My therapist is keeping close eye on me today, but I just don't know how to get through this weekend. My heart hurts so much, the pain is so real and raw. It's been a couple years of this now.... I don't know if I can take any more of this.
