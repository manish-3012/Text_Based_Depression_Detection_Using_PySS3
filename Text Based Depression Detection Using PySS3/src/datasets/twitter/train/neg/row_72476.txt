i'm dropping out of university.I feel like such a failure, I'm too stupid and i can't concentrate because of ADD and mental illness .  I moved across the county to study and now i will leave everyone i have met, people i care about, people i don't want to be without.  

if it wasn't for the fact that mom is alive i would kill myself without a doubt. i will never accomplish anything with my life. I have never been good at school and i was just so proud to be accepted to a university and study something i enjoy. everyone in my family was so proud over me and i have let everyone down, i have even let society down so much tax money wasted on me. Oh god just let me die in my sleep
