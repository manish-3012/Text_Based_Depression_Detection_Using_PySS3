I can't keep the thoughts out.120mg cymbalta. 1mg clozapine. Diagnosed with MDD, PTSD (sexual violence), panic disorder. I also have PCOS and Endometriosis. Both cause severe pain. Both contribute to my suicidal tendencies due to lack of progesterone production.

I spend at least five hours a day contemplating taking my own life. I have a plan. I have a back up plan. And I have my preferred plan. I know how I'll obtain supplies for each h or already have what I need in my home.

I'm a social worker gone mental. My health started to spiral and so did my mental health. I think about institutionalizing myself daily, but my pride is too big. I'm too embarrassed.

This is my first post and it's because I had one of my worst episodes tonight. Pulling my hair out. Taking a razor to my arms to stop the voice telling me to go die. Hitting my head against the wall like something had been knocked lose and if I can hit the wall hard enough it will stop.

The tears won't stop. I'm not sure how to keep going.

My grandfather hung himself

Two of my cousins shot themselves in the head.

Maybe it's my turn. 

An ugly, lonely, investing curse.
