Why the fuck do I want to die on Christmas Eve I have a good life apparently, I have friends and a girlfriend. However, My family hates me and wants me to die, or leave, and I just can't stop remembering the past. I have no idea if it will kill me or not but I have a month's worth of Wellbutrin and a month's worth of seroquel that I want to take and just end it all. My past is fucking haunting me and I just can't get over it. I just don't know what to do anymore.
