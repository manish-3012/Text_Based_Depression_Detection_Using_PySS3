How do I tell my mom all I can think about is killing myself?How do I tell my mom all I can think about is killing myself? What is the next step after I tell her? Whatâ€™s the best and worst case scenario? Iâ€™m already in therapy and taking meds but nothing is getting better. Is there even anything besides therapy and meds that would help? I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel like suicide is inevitable for me.
