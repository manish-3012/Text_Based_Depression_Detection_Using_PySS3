2.5 months till life insurance covers suicideI posted a couple days ago and I realized that my life insurance policy will cover everything in 2.5 months. Its a long time away and I don't know if I can go that long, but I will try to. The money would give someone special the surgeries they have always wanted but never believed they would have anytime soon. So, I guess I will see if I can make it to then, for them.
