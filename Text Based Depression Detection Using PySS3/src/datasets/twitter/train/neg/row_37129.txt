Trying not to worry my fellow club membersSo I'm a 2nd year MS student in CS, and getting completely overwhelmed by the workload.  I've started getting incredibly low scores on midterms and assignments, and between the stress of that, and research/trying to get into a PhD program, I'm starting to feel more and more like life will just be downhill from here.  Every time that I do well on one thing, there's something else I fail at.  I'll be that kid that everyone thought was so smart and going to do so well in life but then talk about how my potential was wasted, so I might as well just end it right now.  I'm also a board member for a club that's all undergrads (it's the only hobby I have right now), and they're all 3-6 years younger than me.  I feel like telling them what I'm going through/dealing with would be inappropriate given the age difference, and I'm trying not to worry them, but I feel like they're starting to catch on. 

tl;dr Grad school makes me feel like I'll be a failure in life and I'm trying not to let a bunch of 18-21 year olds know that I want to die
