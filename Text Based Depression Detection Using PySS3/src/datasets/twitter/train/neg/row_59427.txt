I feel if I can't beat my parents in terms of age at death then they have somehow beat me. Meaning I have to go on for decades to not let them win.Does that make sense or am I just being an arsehole. People die every day and they don't beat their parents in terms of age, but still it kills me to think they'd win one more victory if I check out now at this time in history. 

On the other hand I hate my life and scream night and day so yeah maybe they'd still win if I don't die. 

It just feels wrong to let them win but fuck I don't want to get to their ages either. Son of a bitch.
