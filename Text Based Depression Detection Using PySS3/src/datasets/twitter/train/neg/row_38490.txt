My friend's friend attempted suicide. She's feeling pretty down...First of all, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but /r/suicide isn't really active so I thought I'd try here.

I just found out today that one of my friend's good friends attempted suicide. She texted me the news when I asked her to hang out with me and some other friends, and she also said that she didn't feel like making much human contact this [winter] break because of it. 

The way she seems to be dealing with it doesn't sound very healthy to me.  I don't know if I should respect her decision and just leave her alone or if I should try to get her to go out and not isolate herself.
