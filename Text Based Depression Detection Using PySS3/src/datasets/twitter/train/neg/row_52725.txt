Can't think of a title for thisEver since I was little, I felt that I'm supposed to be this perfect little kid who pleases all the adults by never doing anything wrong, but I have not lived up to this expectation, so every time I get in trouble or someone gets mad at me, I want to kill myself. After a while, googling my feelings lead to me finding antinatalism. I joined the subreddit dedicated to it, and saw this post that said if I commit suicide my mom will be sad but then they said she should have thought of that before bringing an innocent soul until this messed up world. After seeing that, I thought the same thing that post said, and probably will kill myself the next time someone yells at me or gets mad at me.
