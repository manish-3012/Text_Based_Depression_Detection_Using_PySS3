I feel I am behind in life and I don't know how to change itI come from a poor family but I managed to go to a good business school. I now have a debt and I am 5 years late in studies because I played video games in my appartment, which leaves me with poor social skills at 28.

I did my first two internship in sales job where I did not learn much, even though it made me grow and it was in big companies.

I now feel stuck because I realize I don't know how to deal with politics in a company, I never learned in school since I stayed alone, I always feel I get the low opportunities everywhere.

I don't know how to behave to create and nurture friendship, I always feel inferior and I am loosing confidence. I have so much to work on that it feels too big and I fear I'll be behind all my life, having to take the crumbs because I have 28 years of wrong behaviors to correct.

The task seems so big. Have any of you been in this situation?
