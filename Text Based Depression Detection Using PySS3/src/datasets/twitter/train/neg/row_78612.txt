Honestly the fact that I'll never get to travel is one of the worst things for meMy parents decided they needed kids they couldn't afford, decided I needed to go to college or they'd kick me out, decided I needed to financially support them for three years after, decided I'm never leaving.

Now I have a boyfriend I have to be here to support, I'll never get to travel because I can't just take off and leave him to starve and i definitely can't afford an international trip for two between supporting us both and paying my massive debt.

Honestly I've realized my suicide will be a matter of when, not if... Guess I just gotta keep forcing myself forward until then
