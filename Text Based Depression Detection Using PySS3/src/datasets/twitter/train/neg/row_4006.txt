I want to kms and end it all :(Both my family and my ex have told me to go die and I feel so fucking betrayed. My family has always wanted me to be perfect and if I donâ€™t do one thing right, I get abused. My dad has had cancer for 12 years and heâ€™s gonna pass away soon and it saddens me a lot because heâ€™s the only one that used to defend me. My ex broke up with me 6 months ago because I had/have mental health issues like depression, PTSD, BPD, anxiety. And even tho it hurt, we were cool. Until a few days ago he texted me he hates me, he doesnâ€™t want anything to do with me and Iâ€™m better off dead ðŸ’” 

I canâ€™t stand it anymore. Iâ€™ve suffered enough. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m under so much pressure and suffering so much pain. I canâ€™t do anything right, I feel so useless and like such a failure. 

Iâ€™ve decided to end my life for good (I have previously attempted suicide a few times but failed). 

They donâ€™t even care that Iâ€™m still here, when I could have been dead last month. They take me for granted and it hurts so fucking much. I feel so betrayed and backstabbed. 

Why cry when I was in hospital if they still act like this towards me? 

Iâ€™m going to kill myself soon because Iâ€™m exhausted.
