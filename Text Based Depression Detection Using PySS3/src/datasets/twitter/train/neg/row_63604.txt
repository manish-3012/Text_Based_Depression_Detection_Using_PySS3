I've planned my suicide several years in advance but each moment that I'm alive is becoming increasingly difficult.I have a plan to die quietly, to disappear. But I can feel myself getting weaker and weaker. Every passing moment is more unbearable than the last and I feel as if the pain is getting exponentially stronger. My will to continue for just a few more years is slipping and I don't know what to do.

Nothing can help. No one can help. Talking doesn't work, therapy doesn't work, the several antidepressants don't work. I'm out of options. I'm falling apart and I'm so lost. I really want to stay alive for a few more years to maybe save up some money for my family after college. But I don't know if I can...
