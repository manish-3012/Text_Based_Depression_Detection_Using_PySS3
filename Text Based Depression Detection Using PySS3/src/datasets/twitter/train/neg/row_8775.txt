I'm not sure how I feel about Jockos and Jordan PetersonJust now, I watched a couple of videos from these two, I think a lot of their ideas are reasonable and admirable. The way they talk about focusing on hard work and confronting my own troubles and odds uplifted me. But at the same time, a part of me feels like they don't truly understand. Anyone can ride on the momentum of success or have a network of supportive people to get into a zone where taking on challenges can become a joy and a high, but for people who chronically live in the depth of hopelessness, it's a lot harder than "just do it, just handle it". I'm not sure what to make of their ideas and I'm curious if you could share your perspectives on them.
