I don't want help, I want to be dead.I don't want to be "cured". I don't want to fight through it. I don't want to "do anything" with my life.

I can't emphasize this enough, and no one seems to understand, LIVING is my issue. What happens after you "feel better"? Go back to fucking work and pay your bills and worry about your finances and relationships until you eventually die anyway. 

FUCK ALL THAT.

I'd rather die with at least some dignity. Not being someone else's financial bitch for the rest of my life, only to die anyway. 

I used to chase relationships. That only caused immense amounts of pain and was pretty much psychological/emotional torture. I thought about using some hard drugs to OD, but I don't even give a shit enough to even start that whole scene.

FUCK. Why can't I just be dead already!?! I wish deities were real and I could call one out or get them pissed off so they could take my life. I FUCKING HATE BEING HERE.
