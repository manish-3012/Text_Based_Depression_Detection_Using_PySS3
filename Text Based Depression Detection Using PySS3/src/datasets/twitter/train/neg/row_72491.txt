I don't know what to doI dont know why this is happening. I dont know how I ended up in this place. Nothing bad has ever happened to me.
Everything I feel is despair. 
I don't know why, I was never diagnosed with depression and dont think I have it.
Everything I do just seems pointless. I dont see an end to my sadness, although everybody always says it's going to get better. And even if it does so what?
I do not have a future. I am never going to get a job or even finish high school. Please dont tell me it's all going to work out. It's not. It has never worked out my whole life.
I am never going to change. I will never find the motivation to actually work.
I just wasn't made for this world I think.
All I want is to die.
There is no point in trying to keep going.
I don't even have anybody I want to say goodbye to. 
Nobodys day is going to be changed without me.
I am the most annoying person you'll ever meet. All I ever do is unnecessary. Everybody I know just will be less stressed without me.
I think it is time for me to go.
