Trying to leaveThis may be strange for some to understand, but I want to die soon. I'm not suicidal (meaning I would not want to kill myself), because I wouldn't want my family to have to live with the fact that I took my own life. However, I would openly accept death if it came from an outside source, disease, accident, etc. I don't want to be alive, frankly. I'm trying to leave this life because I simply don't feel fit for it. I have no sob stories: I just don't want to be here. Anyone else feel the same?
