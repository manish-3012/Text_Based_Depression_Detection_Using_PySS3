I think it's timeI know that I am toxic and thinking about doing it is bad. That it is a selfish act and I'm going to be hurting a lot of people. But maybe there's going to be some peace on the other side of it all. I'm scared and hoping that it will at least be easy. I don't see my life as one that is worth living anymore. I have no support and live alone and frankly I'm surprised I haven't done it already.   


I've posted here before. I'm sorry if this is redundant. Let's see how the day goes. But it may be goodbye
