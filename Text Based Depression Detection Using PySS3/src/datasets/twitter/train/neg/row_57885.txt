I've got no reason to continuePeople always say "it gets better" and in the groups I'm in "that's just your mind saying that, you gotta have unconditional love" and all that shit.

I'm 18, so it's not like I've really gone through anything bad in life. I have an unhealthy obsession with women because I can't handle not having someone else. I have gone through so many mental health resources and they're all bullshit. There is no cure. I can't even think about comparing myself to other people my age or younger because they're infinitely more successful. Nobody actually likes me for myself, which is what I need to know. There is no reason anybody would prefer me to someone else. I've scared away every person who was into my briefly because I get too pushy because they feel like the solution to my problems so I try to get it stable as soon as possible. Now I get to live knowing about how all those girls are happy with their lives and hate my pathetic guts. And even writing this feels like shit because I'm that disgusting that I am obsessed with people. I could kill myself and maybe people would care for a second, but when they saw anything that showed who I actually was, they'd be glad.

Besides being a huge creep, I've fallen into more and more drug use. It's the only thing that fucking works. I've "stuck it out" for long enough and it's only gotten worse, at least drugs are a temporary solution until I get the balls to kill myself. I'm sick of being juggled on meds just so I can be on equal footing with other people where I still can't compete.

I'm obsessed with my ex, I've got nobody to turn to, and I don't have the balls to kill myself. This isn't a way to live. I'm sick of waiting down the days until something good happens.
