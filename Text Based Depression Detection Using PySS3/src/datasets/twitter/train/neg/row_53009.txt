Low Point after Super BowlI was really making a lot of progress. Even though I still cried myself to sleep most nights, at least I wasn't suicidal.

Super Bowl Sunday, I watched the game surrounded by family and friends, I ate more than I should have, way more than I should have.

This made me feel like shit. It reminded me that I am shit.

It has been hard to get through the day this week. I am closer to pulling the trigger than ever before.

I feel like somebody is constantly pushing down on my chest, like I can't breath.
