It doesn't matter what good I do from here, I've already disgusted myself to the point of no return.I'm not who I want to be. I hate this person that I am. I hate everything about her. She's lazy, spoiled, and inconsistent... She did terribly in high school and has been going further downhill since. She drinks her fathers alcohol all the time. If she could die she would. She's too lazy to even run from her problems. She was a piece of shit girlfriend to a wonderful man, who was smart and funny, and had some of the most amazing ideas. She didn't deserve him. She didn't deserve all the other men in her life, and she doesn't deserve the people in her life now. She has no job, no money, and no chance off redemption because she knows she won't change. She knows that this is the best she can do, she knows nothing about living in this world. She tried so hard though, for so long. She tried all the wrong things, and kept it all to herself. She doesn't trust anyone, especially not herself. She's had sick thoughts and feelings that echo in the back of her mind and leak into her everyday thoughts. She's cut herself to feel better. She doesn't believe anything she tells herself or anyone else. She hates herself. She hates all the time. She judges all the time. She contributes nothing. Her mind is foggy and sore and she's had enough of this world. She is unmotivated.
