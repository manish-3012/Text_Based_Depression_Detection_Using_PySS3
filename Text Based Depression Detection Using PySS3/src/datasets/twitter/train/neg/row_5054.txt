I'm sorry for disappearingI'm sorry to the people I've gotten to know through chat here who just saw me disappear and wondered if I'd ended my life. The truth is, while I'm battling suicidal impulses almost daily, the main reason I'm not active on this account is shame. Shame for writing all these raw posts about my depression/self-harm/suicidal fantasies, and how pathetic and attention-seeking I probably appear. I come on here to vent, to say things I'd never normally be able to, and once I'm done I hide away. Pretend it didn't happen, pretend it wasn't me, pretend I'm a normal person who doesn't cut themselves and want to die. I've been ashamed of my mental illness as long as I've had it - so most of my life - and I probably will always be. I want to thank every single person who's reached out and started a conversation...all you beautiful, caring, empathetic people. I don't know that I can make it, but I hope with everything I have that you can persevere. Thank you, Reddit.
