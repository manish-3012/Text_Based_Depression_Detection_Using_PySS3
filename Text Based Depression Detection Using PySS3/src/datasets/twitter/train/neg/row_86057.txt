Iâ€™ll never amount to anythingIâ€™m surrounded with so many people who care about me but somehow i always feel like iâ€™m disappointing them. Iâ€™m not good at a single thing. Having an interest makes me realize that itâ€™ll just be another thing that will waist my time. I constantly hear songs in my head. I canâ€™t sleep at night. I feel like this will never end and my life will just be suffering for the rest of the time iâ€™m living. Iâ€™m confident that Iâ€™m a burden to my family, however my family members think that they care about me, even though when iâ€™m desperately crying for help they do nothing. The only thing stopping me from ending it is the fact that i donâ€™t want to hurt the ones i love, even though i donâ€™t think they love me back.
