Why can't you kill yourself?I have spent 10 years trying to change my life and it never, nor it ever will. I don't think I'm depressed anymore. I have just taken a very logical decision to kill myself. No matter how happy I am, this feeling of wanting to suicide never changes. Unlike the past when I could hope for a fantastic miracle, now I'm more of a realist. I know I'm doomed to live a pathetic life. And it's my choice to better be out than to live a miserable life. I'm not depressed. It's my choice. Just trying to find the right time, to come to terms with the fact that I'll be leaving my loved ones behind, and also trying to get over the fear of causing death to myself.

Why do people tell you that you must be depressed if you want to kill yourself? I'm logical and I'm a realist, I'm not depressed. So, why shouldn't I kill myself?
