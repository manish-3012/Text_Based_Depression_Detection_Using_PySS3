Sooo... I hope it won't be long until i reach the motivation to do it.Well what to say?
Lost my only real friend, got rejected by the only other person i like of all the humans i know, i probably will fail to reach the education required to study my dream job, wich i would fail anyway due to my vast lack of motivation for literally anything, and in the end im just a fat fuck crying somewhere in a room with noone giving a fuck (at least noone that i actually care for), whining on the internet about things im too pussy to tell anyone irl, while simultaneously searching the best way out.(yeah i know the statistics but i do indeed have no access to guns or Cyanide and know that if i tried jumping from somewhere i would just puss the fuck out and actually simultaneously show the idiots around me how i actually feel, further decreasing my self-worth and will to keep going. 
Fuck.
