Why live when you're an ugly broadI'm female and I'm really fcking ugly: people avoid looking into my face, children cry when they see me, that sort of thing. Never had a boyfriend (I'm in my early 20s) and don't have any friends. To put a cherry on top of the cake - my crippling self loathing makes me talk like a retard. I really see no reason to live anymore. Sooner or later I'll just become a pancake on some train conductor's windshield.
