My eyes just look so deadI look at old pics of mine, and it looked like I had so much more life in my eyes. I remember the raw energy and excitement I had to take on the world. Might sound trivial speaking like this at 24, but I feel old already. Donâ€™t relate to most people my age cause Iâ€™m not on social media or anything. Fucked up in school and working by either being distracted or behind a loser druggie. I seen multiple members of my family go to prison. 

Seen someone very close to me commit suicide. Seen the same happen to a friend. Seen my dad lose his job and force to burn through his retirement, knowing my loser ass hasnâ€™t helped him. Iâ€™ve seen my entire family fall apart to be honest. Nowadays, I just live with aggressive alcoholics, and I work a dead end job. My mind is really good at tricking myself into thinking Iâ€™m doing anything important. But I know I ainâ€™t. Iâ€™m a fucking loser. Every experience Iâ€™ve had with a girl has been paid for. The first date Iâ€™ve had, and she ghosts me after too. 

Hahahah, I donâ€™t even care to be honest anymore. Iâ€™m just so numb to all this
