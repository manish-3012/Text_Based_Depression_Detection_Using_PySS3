Music and the apocalypse
I deleted this before after getting downvotes (not sure why) but I still feel terrible so Iâ€™m reposting in the hopes that anyone can help.

Music has, sincerely, been my life. I dedicate most of my free time to making it and listening to it.

Iâ€™ll put it this way: America is crumbling and protesters are being disappeared in unmarked vans. Okay, at least we have art to turn to, right? Well, not really, because all our artists are rapists. I guess we can just make art ourselves, right? Well, not really, because every venue in America is going to be shut down, ruining the livelihood of virtually every musician who isnâ€™t a stadium-filler. Uhh well things can always get better, right? Well, no, because we live in a rapidly declining nation that - best case scenario - will be subject to worse famine and plague than itâ€™s ever seen before as climate change worsens, destroying our food supply and unleashing diseases trapped under the Arctic ice. Worse case scenario, we go extinct!

I guess my question here is, why donâ€™t I hang myself and get that out of the way quickly?
