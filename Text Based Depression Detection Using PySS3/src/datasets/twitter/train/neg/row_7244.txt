Breakup BluesJust broke up with long term GF and don't really know what to do except write a long rant about it.

 I have had past relationships and one other long term one but I have never connected and opened up to anyone as much as my now ex. I  have been dealing with depression, anxiety and ADHD for years now but I am capable at keeping them at bay for the most part. Now, I just feel tired and kinda zoned out, my ADHD is already thinking up dozens of ways to off myself and give up. 

Honestly, the breakup was kinda mutual, she has been despising me for small things that add up and I have been feeling pissed off that she no longer shows affection or sex and has been snapping and insulting me daily. I am aware that breakups are not the end of everything having been through another very hard one, but I have invested so much into this relationship in both time, effort and money that I just feel empty now. 

I'm now reminded of how much I really don't want to be alive (something that I rarely ever think because I stop myself whenever I catch it) and how shit I am as a person. Everything that I was depressed about in the past just came surging back. It's not like she was the only thing that made me happy, but she was something I could look forward to everyday and feel completely comfortable being around. Now, Gaming doesn't make me happy, my friends dont make me happy, not even sex makes me happy anymore.

I am not an incel in any way, I realize I fucked up in the relationship and I should move on. The issue is that I dont see the point of moving on anymore. I think I am just happy being depressed and suicidal until one day, I finally am brave enough to actually do it. Please help

Sorry for wall of text, I cant format right now.
