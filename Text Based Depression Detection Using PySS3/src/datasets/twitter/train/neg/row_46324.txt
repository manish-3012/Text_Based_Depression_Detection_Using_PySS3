I don't know what to do anymoreI have never been closer to suicide in my life then I am right now.  I am completely lost.  I looked at this subreddit and saw all the posters and thought "With all the people who need help right now, why would anyone notice me of all people?"  There is nothing that makes me special or stand out.  But if anyone happens to read this for whatever reason, I need to talk.  And there are zero people in my life I can talk to.

I am 32 years old.  When I was a child, my life was hell.  My father was extremely physically abusive to my mother, my brother and me.  I have scars from when he would cut me for fun.  My mom was always stressed and always mad at me.  Always.  She was always yelling and telling me how nothing I am.  How worthless I am.  Never to my brother, just me.  My brother was a combination of my mother and father.  He hated me from the start and that never changed.  I had to learn how to walk on eggshells at all times.  One wrong step, or one word spoken in a tone they saw as "disrespectful" and that was it.  The yelling and hitting started again.  I had no idea how to talk to other kids.  I couldn't laugh or play or have fun because I didn't know how to.  So I just stayed quiet.  My dad left when I was around 11.  Never saw him again.

Around 6th grade, I started trying to talk to other kids.  I started trying to see how the whole "making friends" thing worked.  I guess I was very awkward and weird, and kids hate awkward and weird.  It also didn't help that even though I tried really hard to keep the home clean (with no help from anyone else in the house) I smelled like cat piss.  No matter what I did.  

&amp;#x200B;

In middle school, I learned very quickly that I am apparently extremely unattractive.  There was a girl that lived down the street from me.  I never had a crush on her or anything but I tried to make friends with her brother.  She always made it a point to let me know how "not cute" I was.  "That's just one girl" you might be thinking.  But all through high school and college I never got any feedback that made me think any differently.  

&amp;#x200B;

I never learned how to make friends.  Never learned how to make bonds with people.  So I was on my own pretty much the whole time.

Around 2006 or 2007 my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I didn't know what I was supposed to do.  I Didn't really know how to think for myself of make my own decisions, so I stayed with her.  Drove her to chemo and the Canter Treatment Center.  I slaved in her apartment, just like when I was a child.  I cleaned up after her, did her bandages.  Caregiver stuff.  She was still so mean.  Around then was when I started to figure out what depression was.  I just had a thought one day.  "What if I was dead?"  I didn't really know what to make of it at the time.  But it was a thought that would never leave my mind.  Always there.  

&amp;#x200B;

I had what I think was a nervous breakdown in 2009.  I don't know exactly what it was but I had never felt that way before.  It was as if the safety net that held my mind in place just disappeared.  I did something I never thought I would do.  I asked my mom for help.  For advice.  She called me crazy.  Said "I always knew you were nuts."  This triggered an anger in me I had never felt before.  I left.  I moved in with these guys I knew.  They made me pay half the rent by myself and they would just pay small portions.  They didn't let me live there out of concern, they just wanted the money.  I put pretty much all of the money I made at my shit job into living there.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was away from my mother for the first time in my life.  I would have nightmares of her pounding on my door and slamming it open, raging into my room.  I would have nightmares about the filthy house I lived in as a child and the apartment I had lived in with my mother only recently.  I couldn't interact normally with the guys I lived with.  I just expected them to do the same things to me my family did.  They left me alone, though.  They were completely indifferent to me.  I had an asthma attack for some reason while I was there and none of them even bat an eye.  I drove myself to the hospital, almost completely unable to breathe.  

&amp;#x200B;

I left them in 2011 and moved to a city.  Lived completely on my own.  The freedom was intoxicating.  I had another shit job, but it was okay.  No one was mad at me all the time.  No one telling me I am worthless.  But I'm not very good at anything I do.  One day I was trying really hard at work but apparently I wasn't doing a good enough job.  I was told to go home and not come back the next day.  I had no idea what to do.  I lost my job, and was going to lose my apartment.  So..I moved back to my old town.  With my mother.  I used the little growing up I did to completely close myself off.  By this point, it was around 2015.  I helped my mother again.  She was emotionally abusive as usual but I lost the ability to be phased by it.  I couldn't feel anything.  

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up moving out and moving in with one of the guys I used to live with before I moved the city.  My mother went septic in December 2017.  I was the one who called the ambulance.  I was there for her.  Even knowing she was never there for me.  I didn't shed a tear.  Not one.  I thought I was supposed to be sad losing my mother, but I didn't feel anything.  I lost the job I had shortly after.  I don't even remember why.  It was most likely my own fault though.  My room mate will be kicking me out soon.  The town I live in has a horribly high unemployment rate making it very hard to find work.  So I am at my end here.

I am 32 years old.  I have never had a real friend.  The only family I knew hated me from the moment I was born.  I have never been shown affection of any kind.  No one has ever said "I love you" to me.  Or "I'm proud of you".  I have never done anything worth being proud of, though, so I guess that's okay.  I have come to the conclusion that my mother was absolutely right.  I am worthless.  Useless.  A complete waste of life.  I have tried so hard in so many different ways but everything has failed.  Before people start the judgement spree, I know.  I know all of this is my own fault.  I should never have moved back in with my mother.  I know all the things I shouldn't have done.  I get it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I can't afford help.  Suicide posts are always saying things like "talk to your friends!" or "get help!"  But I have no friends to talk to.  There is no help to get.  I sit here in my room all day, every day.  I clean the things that need cleaning around the house, but I don't go outside anymore.  I have gone multiple days without speaking a single word.  Sleep is a nightmare.  When I lay down, my heart freaks out.  My whole body feels like static and my heart skips beats all over the place.  I saw a doctor in the local ER but he said it's just anxiety and sent me home.  Who am I do doubt a medical professional?  So I'm lost there too.  When I actually DO fall asleep I have constant nightmares and sleep paralysis is very common.  I want it to end.  And I am very likely going to end it very soon.  I hate literally everything about myself.  I know there are millions of people who have it worse than me.  I get it.  I know there's nothing about me that matters, which is why I have never reached out to anyone before.  This is the first time I have spoken like this.  But I am sitting here in my room, staring at the rope I plan to use, trying one last time.

I'm sorry this was so long.
