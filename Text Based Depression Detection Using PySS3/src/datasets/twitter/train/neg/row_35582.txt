what the fuck am i gonna doi am a burden. entirely. with everything in me. i have nothing to offer. and right now itâ€™s either run away very far with my old car that likely wonâ€™t make it far or kill myself. iâ€™m hurting everyone around me. verbally, emotionally. itâ€™s only a matter of time before everyone gives up on me just like iâ€™ve given up on me. and then what do i have left? nothing. i donâ€™t give a fuck. i donâ€™t know what to do. i know what i want to do but how do i go about that without being selfish or inconsiderate? there isnâ€™t an option. the only option is to keep going but thatâ€™s not for me, itâ€™s for everyone around me, and even then, iâ€™m not doing something for me. iâ€™m a waste. absolutely useless. if there was somewhere i could go to make my death look like an accident, iâ€™d be there in a heartbeat.
