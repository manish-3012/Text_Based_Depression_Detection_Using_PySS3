is my friend really suicidal?I have this one friend and her parents are mildly abusive (mostly verbally) and very strict. she often jokes about killing herself (because of various reasons) and I don't know if I should take these signs seriously because I joke about that too and im probably the least suicidal person ever. I even asked her stuff like "would you actually do it..." and she always says no but I mean how can I know? shes most important to me right now and losing her knowing she showed signs would be the worst thing that could ever happen to me. so now to my question, how do I know if she's being serious?
