Chester Bennington's suicide put me over the edgeEvery single person I have reached out to has left me hanging.  I made an attempt in July of 2016 and since then every single person that knew has turned on me eventually.  They've cut me off, stopped talking to me, told me I wasn't welcome in their home.  

This is exactly why I am depressed because there is little empathy and compassion in this world and all these people have demonstrated that this is indeed the truth.  I'm getting closer and closer, when I heard about Chester Bennington's suicide the first thing I said was "Damn you were brave enough to follow through!"

After I heard about Chester's suicide I reached out to a friend I said I was in a really bad place, said I'd call in fifteen minutes but this friend didn't answer the phone, it was 5pm and my phone call was never returned nor was there a response to my text.  So goodbye to the last "friend" I thought I had.
