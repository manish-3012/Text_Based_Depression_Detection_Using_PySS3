I lice with fears, i can't stop finding reasons to end this allI'm tired of this, I'm tired of trying. I fear people don't like me, I fear they fuck my trust up. I don't even know what's going on through my mind, i just need this all to end, I'm not sure if someone actually wants me, I'm not sure if I really help anyone by existing. I hate that I have to admit that bad things will happen everytime, joy is temporary, the moments of happiness just feel empty and full of anxiety, i don't want to be useless, i want to be someone to be proud of but im just stupid and nothing i do is what others would like of me i just need to end this but im also afraid of that and this doesn't seem to get any better aaaaa
