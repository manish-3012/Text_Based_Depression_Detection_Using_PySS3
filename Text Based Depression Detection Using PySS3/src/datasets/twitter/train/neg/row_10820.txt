Suicide on the Installment PlanI think about offing myself every day. Constantly. Unfortunately, I am too chickenshit to actually go through with it. Instead, I have been drinking, smoking and eating myself to death. I drink about ~750 ML of 100 Proof vodka every night, smoke ~1 pack of cigarettes each day, and eat like shit even though I know my blood pressure is through the roof on a constant basis (I'm 35 and it's ~180/100 when awake). I have also been on methadone for the past 6 years. I have been setting aside doses of my liquid that whole time; to the point where I have over a gallon of the shit set aside in my closet. I wish I could just bring myself to gulp a bunch down so I could just fall asleep and not wake up... But I'm a pussy and I am scared to die. Well, that and I have a wife, a family and a dog who I care about and don't want to destroy. So instead of manning up and downing the 'done, or loading up the trusty 12 gauge, I have been drinking and smoking and sitting myself to death. It's only a matter of time before it does me in. I'll have a nice stroke or coronary by 40 at this point. My dad went at 48, and he wasn' nearly as fucked off and lazy as me. Until then, I will continue to distract myself with video games and books. I will pretend that everything is okay when dealing with my wife and family and employer. But in the end, I will die an early death. I have taken out a decent insurance policy on myself, so my wife should be okay. I just need to figure out how to get all of my money out of my business and personal accounts and transferred to her upon my death without the fucking IRS looking into it and taking it all (I owe them a pretty penny). Well, figuring that out gives me something to do in the meantime. Out of curiousity, is there anyone else here in the same type of situation?
