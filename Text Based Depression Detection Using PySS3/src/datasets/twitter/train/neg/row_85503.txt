I don't want to live anymore.I've been diagnosed with manic depression when I was six and since I've been on over 40 different medications and hospitalized against my will three times. I've missed out on so much in life, (I missed 1/3 of my total days of high school but still graduated) and I can't remember ever being happy for more than a couple weeks. 

If this is going to be my life then I want to be done. The world makes me absolutely miserable and the only thing that is keeping me going is my mom. But I know she will get over it if I chose a method that she won't have to find my body. So yeah... I don't know why I'm posting this. I just had to get it out.
