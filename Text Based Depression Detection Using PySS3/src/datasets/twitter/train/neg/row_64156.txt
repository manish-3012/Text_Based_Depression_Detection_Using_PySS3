Feeling like I've lost everything.I feel like I've lost my entire future and life in general. I fucked up and lost the most important thing me, due to my own failures and I don't know how to process this. My life is empty without her and the future we have both planned. I'm so worried with all of this bottomless grief I'm going to hurt myself to the point where recovery is impossible. I really don't know what to do.
