People don't fucking get itPeople say to live for the little things in life, but that's extremely hard to do.

I have a plethora of (diagnosed dw) mental disorders that are very hard to cope with, let alone cure. 

My situation, and many other's, is very likely going to be lifelong. 

I've been cursed and 'finishing my shampoo and conditioner' isn't worth my 5 fucking mental disorders. Believe me I wish it were.

The only reason I am alive is because I don't want to hurt my mom. 

Is it really the craziest thing that I would prefer not living, than living in so much pain and fear.

When a dog is sick, you put it down right? The owner will be extremely sad, but ultimately it would be cruel to force the dog to live when they are in such great pain.

I wish I were a dog.
