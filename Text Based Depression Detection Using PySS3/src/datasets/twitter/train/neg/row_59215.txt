blood, so much blood.Iâ€™ve started cutting again, I went a year clean but fell right back into it, same with my suicidal thoughts. Itâ€™s just getting too much again, the mundane days, the constant crying and freaking out because of my anxiety and depression. Itâ€™s just redundant. 

My family could care less about me so it wouldnâ€™t even matter if I died, and my friends only think of me as a fucking therapist. They could care less about my personal life. My girlfriend could care less if I was dead since she only talks to me if she wants to talk about herself. I love her so fucking much that it seems like she doesnâ€™t even want to try anymore. 

Iâ€™ve stopped taking my anti depressants because I hate the way the make me feel, I donâ€™t want to be so dependent on a useless ass pill. I just want to be done with this life and move on to the next. 

I think a lot about if I were gone. It would make me a lot more fucking happy for it to be that way. 

I was told once that slitting your wrists doesnâ€™t hurt if youâ€™re too high or drunk out of your mind to care, so maybe Iâ€™ll try that. Iâ€™m just a fucking pussy when it comes to pain like that dude, cutting is one thing because of my pain tolerance but to go that deep? I just...I just donâ€™t know. 

Iâ€™m a fuck up in everything, my life, my relationship, college, work, everything!

Life is worthless. I am worthless.
