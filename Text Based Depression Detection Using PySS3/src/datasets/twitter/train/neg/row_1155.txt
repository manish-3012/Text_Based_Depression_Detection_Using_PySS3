Meaningless lifeHello everyone. 
I can't stop thinking about suicide. My life as perhaps that of many others of us is not easy. I am a 20 year old male and I recently met a girl. Generally I can't open myself to others and tell my emotions and thoughts. I've spent the last two years destroying myself. I recently tried to get help from a psychologist but I gave up. I can't take it anymore every day that passes, life loses all meaning. I met a special girl recently and after talking for a long time I opened up and told her about my life. Unfortunately I returned home. We live in two different countries. We continue to talk daily but my thoughts about suicide do not pass. I feel like I feel something for her and I would work hard to stay together but I wonder if doing so will not make her suffer more. I need some advice should i gave up on her?
