Non existenceSorry if this has been asked already. I don't have energy to look for similar posts, I'm ready to delete this one if you want.


How do you cope with the fact that there will probably be nothing after death? Eternal oblivion, non-existence, losing awareness just haunt me. Those topics are the only reason I fear ending myself at this moment. Nothing would stop me if I knew... Or if I wasn't a coward.
