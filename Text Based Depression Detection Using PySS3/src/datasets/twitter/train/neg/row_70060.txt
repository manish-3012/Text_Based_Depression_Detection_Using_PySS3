i feel trappedi am so anxious all the time. my heart feels like it is constantly racing to the point that is feels like its normal. i am so tense. my toes are always curled. is it normal to constantly clench your butt and vagina? i have been clenching my jaw to the point of exteme pain and teeth cracking/chipping. i feel so paranoid of men that i am beginning to feel distrustful of my bf and i have no idea how to tell him this. i feel like we need to break up but he is literally my only support system. i am awaiting help for mental health issues but i don't even know if i am strong enough. i don't even know if i want help. i can't do it. i'm just done.
