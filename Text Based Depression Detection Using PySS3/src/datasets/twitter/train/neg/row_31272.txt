I feel like itâ€™s timeHi Iâ€™m a 17 year old girl and I think itâ€™s time to end my life Iâ€™m feel trapped i suffer from adhd,asbergers, anxiety, depression and BDD Iâ€™m sick of my life I donâ€™t want to here anymore at all Iâ€™ve thought about it and Iâ€™m sure but Iâ€™m a little scared not because Iâ€™ll feel bad, bc people will get over my death but because Iâ€™m scared it wonâ€™t work. I stay with my mom I hate her sheâ€™s never been a proper mom to me never got taught things etc, sheâ€™s a horrible horrible person I have nowhere else to go I have family from my brothers side but I donâ€™t want to be a burden to them I just had a big argument with my mom told her sheâ€™s partly the reason why I want to kill myself she then proceeded to shout my personal business in the street saying â€œitâ€™s not my fault you have BDD etcâ€ Iâ€™m just asking for advice idk what to do anymore ðŸ˜­
