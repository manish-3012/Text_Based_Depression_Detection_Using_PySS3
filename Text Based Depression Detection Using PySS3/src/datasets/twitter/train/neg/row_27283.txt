Ill never live a satisfying life.I genuinely have worked so much on trying to get better. Different meds. Different types of therapy. Nothing's gotten better. When I think its getting better I spiral down.

Recently I tested a slight over dose of my meds to determine how much Id likely need.

I understand that my friends care about me but I find it hard to believe. Someone recently left my life when she told me that was something she wouldnt do. Saying  we have nothing in common and I am manipulative unintentionally. Which I can understand what actions would be considered 

I do not have a life worth living.
