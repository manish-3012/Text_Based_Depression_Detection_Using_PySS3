I'm crying for helpMy cat is sick and in pain but vet can't come until next hour. I've been beating my head and scratching my clothesfor a while now and my mom said that's not gonna make it better.
I told her (after months knowing it myself) I'm autistic and have my coping mechanisms, she looked at me with disgust and left the room saying nothing else.
I literally feel like I'm dying right now. I can't control myself anymore and everyone thinks I'm making this up except my partner who is kms away from here.
I can't afford my own house, or therapy, or any vet. I really need some help. Not money, I need real help because I don't want to try my third suicide try this year.
