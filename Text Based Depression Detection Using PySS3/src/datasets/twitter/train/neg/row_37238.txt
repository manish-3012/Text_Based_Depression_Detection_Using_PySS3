I swear, this is trueI started this morning with the thought that this would be my last day.i failed at marriage,  I failed at fatherhood. I live in a halfway house and am a drunk. I have not much to live for.i drove by my wife's house because she has a shotgun and I thought that would be the easiest way to go. I didn't do it because I'm a coward. So I drove back to my shitty halfway house and as I pulled up, there was all sorts of ambulances and cop cars. Someone had jumped off the roof,  and I walked in right as they were cleaning it up.

I may be all of those things and worse. But I'm trying.
