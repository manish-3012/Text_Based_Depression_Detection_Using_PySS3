I don't think I'll ever kill myself but I think about it sometimes and I just wanted to share that with someoneIt's never a violent or urgent desire, but sometimes I feel trapped and I wonder if there's anyway out and my brain goes, "oh, death is an option I guess". I don't think it's all that serious but it's a secret I have and I wanted to be able to type it out to make it real.
