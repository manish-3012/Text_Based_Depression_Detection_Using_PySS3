My mother makes me want to kill myself I'm in college, I work 4 days a week, but because I remind her of my biological father I'm a piece of shit.

I'm a piece of shit for leaving my clothes in the washer/dryer too long

I'm a piece of shit for not washing the dishes.

I'm a piece of shit because my dog whose old needs to be coaxed to the bathroom when I'm working or at school and she refuses to so it's my fault the dog shits or pisses in the house.

She tells my younger sister how worthless I am.

I struggle, I don't ask for anything. I cost her what maybe $150-200 a month in groceries and utilities I pay everything else myself.

I come home everyday wanting to die because of how I get treated. I want to swallow all her stupid muscle relaxers drink a handle of  whatever lay down and never wake up again. 

I want to die because my own family treats me like garbage. 

I want to die because I let someone physically, mentally, and emotionally abuse me because it was slightly better than how she treats me.

I made a promise not to kill myself but that promise is easier said then kept. 

I'm sorry.
