im really scarerdedit: i talked to suicide hotline person. it did not help

I don't really know what to talk about but right now I'm waiting to talk to a suicide hotline chat. Im really scared that i might kill myself and i dont know what to do i had to cut work off early because of how much i felt like this

i have no one i can talkk to right now and i wouldnt want to talk to any of my loved ones anyone or theyd freak out and be mad at me

i dont want to suffer from depression anymore i just want to get better. i have to wait until thursday to find out if i can have benefits so i can throw myself in therapy and hopefully get on medication

im scared that because of my depression i have to throw everything i know away to go to a psych ward because i feel like a monster and just really messed up help me
