I need to learn how to talk to people before it's too lateI'm incredibly nervous almost all of the time I need advice on talking to people or being in a situation in which people will come and talk to me (not about suicide/depression just normal communication) there is a lot of other stuff I have to deal with but this is what is killing me.
