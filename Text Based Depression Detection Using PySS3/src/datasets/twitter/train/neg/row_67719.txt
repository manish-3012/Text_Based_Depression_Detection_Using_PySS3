I lost hope, will time change things soon enough?I'm losing my mind to despair. I can't think or sleep properly. The things that are supposed to make me happy, fulfilled, distracted, or satisfied aren't working at all. 

I used to believe time can heal (even if not fully heal) all wounds but now, it seems they won't heal fast enough.

There is also things in our life that makes life worth living for. But what happens when these things... No longer helps? When our favorite food doesn't taste anything like it used to? Or when we keep waiting for an answer that never comes? 

I'm don't want to think suicide is the best ir even the right answer, but what if it's the only option? 

My world is falling apart, I was supposed to fix it, but it seems I'm the one fucking everything up. I want to be positive, but I don't think I can. Can I find peace or redemption in death?
