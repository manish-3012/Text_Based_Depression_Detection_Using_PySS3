Consequences of suicide? (In a particular case) I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place to post.... 
 
 To elaborate, I'm not suicidal but I was wondering what exactly happens after a person commits suicide in a boarding school? Will the school be under a lock down and will it taint the school's reputation (I don't want that)? If the suicide results in failure, what will happen to the person? Would a suicide note help dissolve confusion? I'm only curious.
