It doesnâ€™t get betterI hate when people say- It gets better. It doesnâ€™t get better. You get better. You learn how to change your perspective and that takes time. People used to phrase â€œit gets betterâ€ as if you stay alive another day, you could win the lottery. But it doesnâ€™t work that way. You become aware of your situation and learn how to overcome it. You gain a layer of resilience, in a healthy way. So keep trying. Give yourself a chance to feel happy, because thatâ€™s what all this is about. It isnâ€™t about grades or money or love. Itâ€™s really about you enjoying life and feeling comfortable. A lot of that is self love as well. Itâ€™s very hard to get out of your darkest times. I call it the â€œabyssâ€ but once you learn how to work through your shit, the lessons you learn along the way will be extremely valuable.
