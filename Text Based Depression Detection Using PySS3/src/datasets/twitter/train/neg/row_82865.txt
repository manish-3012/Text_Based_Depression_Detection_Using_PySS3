I cannot listen to any music except for songs written by people who have killed themselvesMy depression has reached an all time low. I used to find comfort in music. Not anymore. I listen to the songs but these people do not relate to me. Yes they may have depression but at least they have talent. I have nothing. There is nothing I am good at. I am a worthless person and only good for taking up space. I can now only listen to music by people who have killed themselves. They are the only ones who understand how horrible I feel. I want to die so bad. I cannot see a car without thinking about jumping in front of it. I cannot see a building without thinking about jumping off of it. I am never going to get better.
