My birthday present to myself is a bottle full of pillsIâ€™ve had a bad year. The only I girl I was convinced wouldnâ€™t lie to me did and then she threw me away like I was nothing. But I saw her today in public and she saw me. I saw the most successful relationship - all she saw was some guy she fucked for 6 weeks until her first choice was ready to commit. So since Iâ€™m nothing I might as well die like nothing. All this on my birthday. So my present to myself is a razor to my wrists. This is going to be the last sunrise I ever witness. I hope itâ€™s a good one.
