I've started to seriously consider suicideThe last 24 hours have very much messed me up, and while suicide has always been something I thought about, I never genuinely believed I would do it, not since one dodgy time when I was younger.

Right now, I do not trust myself. This is the first time in about 7 years that I have seriously considered committing suicide. My life isn't even bad compared to anyone else's but there is a weight in my head I can't get rid of and I'm being dragged down. 

It would destroy my little sister, my Mam, my Dad and my girlfriend, who is going through a very hard time right now. I know it would destroy them, that's what always held me back. But I don't know if even that could stop me right now. I could do it tonight, I really could.

I probably don't even deserve to be posting here, I feel like an imposter or like there's other people way way worse who deserve the help, not me. But apparently I am not very strong, not strong enough to stop myself from feeling this way, or too weak to deal with it anyway.

I don't know what to do, I don't know who to talk to. Maybe I just need someone to say that I'm ok, I'm not a parasite. Maybe I don't need anything at all. I don't want to ruin my little sisters life, I don't want to be a tragedy that everyone talks about sadly. But I really don't know how much longer I can ignore how I'm feeling.
