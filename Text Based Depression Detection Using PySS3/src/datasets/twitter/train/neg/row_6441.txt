There is nothing for me here. Maybe I should just move away?I have come back home after a long time spent travelling. I have started a new job which I instantly hate, a messy relationship with a girl causing issues for my mental health, and I'm feeling trapped, self-destructive (already caused serious self-harm...the thought of the scars make me feel ashamed) and I want to drink/drug myself to death.

I want to say fuck this, do an online course for teaching English abroad and move away. I might also hate it. But it is a new direction. I am scared that I will get too drunk and cut myself again or find the courage to kill myself. I am feeling defective and unable to shake off this painful level of self-hatred and hopelessness. I'm 25 years old, I still live with my parents and I can't act like an adult. It's pathetic. Why do I deserve a roof over my head? Yeah, I've already had people tell me I need an awakening, I don't know real life. My parents say I shouldn't wallow, that I need to look at the bigger picture. I can't. I feel broken, inhuman. I fucking hate myself for even typing this. I'm whining like a baby. I pray so much for a fatal accident.
