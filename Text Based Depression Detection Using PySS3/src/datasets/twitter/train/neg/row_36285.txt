Substances can no longer numb the trauma, I've never felt so completely empty...Nobody cares about drug users but ya know, that's unfair! Just because I can't tolerate the intense and often **physically painful** depression I have, doesn't mean I'm worthless! It shouldn't anyway.

But who cares what I think, I'm a "druggie". A degenerate because I'm sacrificing my health to keep myself alive hoping I can live a day without being tormented by a broken psyche.

All of my friends left me, literally got together and left. (My worst nightmare as far as I can ever remember) I've posted before but I just can't fucking believe they did this to me.

People I loved like blood and would've gone to fucking jail for, decide I'm not good enough. On top of my already treatment resistant chronic depression!! WHO DOES THAT TO A PERSON?

I just want it to stop. It's all I want, I just want to feel loved by my family and be able to process emotion in any capacity.
