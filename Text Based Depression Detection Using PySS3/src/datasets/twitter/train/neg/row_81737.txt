Give me one reason I shouldn't kill myself soon.I'm sick of struggling through everyday without any social interaction and having all these regrets pile up. I'm a weird and stupid person, I honestly don't think I'm going to make it to College. :(

I'm going to cry myself to sleep rn for the millionth time...
