SchoolI started  in person for my semester yesterday and im new this year anyway. Its been so hard and draining. The people laughing and talking. People everywhere. Ni introductions nothing. I feel like a fish out of water. I feel like an impostor. Starting new things after depression is impossible. It's been two days and here i am exhausted, drained, emotional and well. Suicidal. My classes are so fucking hard and my mind is scattered. I can't help but feel like a ghost that's so alone. Existing hurts. Waking up it hurts and i hate it. My birthday is drawing closer and i still can't think about how i wasn't even supposed to be here this year i planned to die before ny birthday last year but it didht work out. Now i feel like a failure. A year of failing at life and death. I don't want to live year after year like this. I don't want to age of it just means another year of pain or worse pain. Im so tired of it.
