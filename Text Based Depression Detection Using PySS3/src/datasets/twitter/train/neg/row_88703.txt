It's getting worse and worse, please help me :(Haha, I've just returned from a party where I was drinking beer and having a great time with some of my best friends so you could say that I'm lucky and all. And right now I'm listening to some music and writing this. But in fact, I went there because it was an outdoor party and I was hoping for some relief (which I didn't really get), at least for a while. Because when I was going there, even though it was in the middle of the night I was dying from heat. It wasn't hot at all, but my body doesn't seem to care. I know I could be doing so many great things, but there's one thing that's stopping me. I'm a little bit suicidal right now, but there's one thought that's keeping me alive - "IT'S GOING TO BE GONE ONE DAY!". So don't worry guys, I'm not going to do this, at least not right now :)

But, I'm crying right now. If you would like to find out why and help me a little bit, please read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/38lp3a/feeling_hot_all_the_time_starting_to_really/

I know it's a wall of text. But it would mean a whole world to me if you read this and sent some words of support :) Or maybe has anyone else experienced this? I don't think so, because I'm feeling so alone in my problem... :(
