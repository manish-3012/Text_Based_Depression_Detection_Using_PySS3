people say i'm kind.that's the only compliment i get. but whenever someone does say that i feel worse. everything i do is... fake. just done so people ignore me and leave me alone. i'm really apathetic about everything. my friend got hurt? i don't care. someone's mom died? no tears from me. my great grandpa died? oh. ok. my sisters died? never knew them anyways. what should i say? i always act happy. i act sad if a friend is sad. i laugh at their jokes, but only rarely do i actually laugh a non fake laugh. really, i'm nothing but a shell on the beach, with nothing inside. no crab inside. no life inside. no personality. nope. just a shell, hollow inside, but nice on the outside. i'd really like to be dead right now. the only thing i care about are animals. they don't speak, they don't judge, they just like your company and comfort you. my dog's the reason i'm still alive. not humans. 

thanks for reading this far, if anyone actually sees this. i don't think anyone will.
