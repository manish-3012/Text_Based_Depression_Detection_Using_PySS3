We all die at some pointWeâ€™re not immortal weâ€™re all gonna die at some point so we can either just do it ourselves and get it over with or we can wait just because life might get better like itâ€™s not even guaranteed that itâ€™ll ever get better
And honestly I feel like people that tell you that it gets better and tell you not to kill yourself are just being selfish cause they donâ€™t really know what youâ€™re going through and they think your life is just as perfect as theirs
Well guess what it isnâ€™t and not every story has a happy ending
