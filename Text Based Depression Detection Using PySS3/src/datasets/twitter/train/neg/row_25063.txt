I need something. Iâ€™m not sure whatAll I know is I need something. I donâ€™t know what exactly, if I need someone, or help, or just to actually die for once but I just need something. I donâ€™t have the capacity right now to write out everything. Maybe in a few minutes, but I just need to get something out there. All Iâ€™ve done for the past couple of hours is cry. I can physically feel my heart, everything inside me just keep breaking. I keep praying to god and begging him to kill me. To just let me go. To please stop torturing me. I canâ€™t do this anymore but Iâ€™m too pathetic to do anything. 

Hereâ€™s some notes from the last couple of days to help get a look inside my mind. Iâ€™m sorry for the formatting, Iâ€™m on mobile.

I think I might drink myself to death. It seems like a good idea. Surprised I havenâ€™t thought of it before.

Iâ€™m going to go to hell and I know it. And itâ€™ll be seeing him walk away from me over and over again.

I tried to kill myself the other day. As soon as I was in the hospital I regretted it. But maybe I only regretted it because I got caught. All the times Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself with no one around, no warning, I never regretted it. 

I feel that sinking feeling again. Everything is still going downhill. Now faster than ever. With even less people. I want to hide. I want to crawl away. I want to disappear. I donâ€™t want this. Why am I here.

Iâ€™m alone. I have no one. No friends. Theyâ€™ve all left me for better ones or just left cos they realized how pathetic I am. No family. They all have their others that they love more. No love. I thought I did but youâ€™re stupid, donâ€™t ever get fooled. No matter how good it seems, theyâ€™ll always leave. Theyâ€™ll always hurt you. Use you. Abandon you. Youâ€™re never worth it. I wish you did die. That counselor makes such a big deal of the fact that youâ€™re alive cos you were so close before. But you messed it up. You mess everything up. Pathetic. I hate you. I wish you would die.

If I open my mouth to say or do anything Iâ€™m going to cry. Iâ€™m not even doing that now and I still feel like Iâ€™m going to break at any second. Why am I never a priority to anyone. Why am I always alone. I just want to hide away. I want to stop existing. 

I used to wish that I was the only person in the whole world so that my loneliness would be justified, so that it would be because thereâ€™s no one else and not because no one wants me. I donâ€™t want that anymore. I just want to not exist at all. 
_______________________________

I keep telling myself I want to go home but it doesnâ€™t exist. I donâ€™t know where itâ€™d be. I donâ€™t know what itâ€™d look like. I donâ€™t know whoâ€™d be there. Maybe no one. Maybe home will never exist.

I canâ€™t wait to get back to the apartment. I need to cry so badly. I can barely hold it in anymore. I feel so broken down. So alone.

I wish I had just one person to talk to. Just one. I have no friends I have absolutely no one. How do I always end up so alone. Why do I keep feeling so broken
