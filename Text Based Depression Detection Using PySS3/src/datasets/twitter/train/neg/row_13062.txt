I messaged someone in California. Iâ€™m from Australia, and i need help. She is calling out for my help through insta posts accompanied by cuts. I want her to stop.I assume the person cutting is a girl but iâ€™m not sure. I was scrolling through random hashtags about adhd because i have it. Then in a post i clicked a self harming hashtag. Then I saw her profile with 2 or 3 posts of her cutting herself. Very new, and its been 6 days since sheâ€™s first made the profile.

First attempt talking:
Titles herself as an unwanted person. She wants help, and I saw it and I fucking had to do something. I couldnâ€™t just leave someone crying for heIp. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to her using knowledge Iâ€™ve read online. She doesnâ€™t want to talk to me and replies with â€œidkâ€ constantly. So i said Iâ€™ll leave her and told her to think about seeking a professional. Told her to remember itâ€™ll pass and some other things. So i stopped talking for 2 days.

Second attempt:
I came back to her profile account, and saw her new posts. She was trying to talk to me through her captions accompanied by photos with more cuts. She said â€œif you canâ€™t help me no one canâ€ and â€œhelpâ€. 

So i messaged her/him again asking if she thought about seeking professional help yet. She wrote â€œabout?â€ and â€œtyâ€ and asked how old i was. She then posted on her profile page again with â€œi need you but you donâ€™t seem to need me ðŸ™ƒðŸ”«â€ with more fucking cuts...probably because it took me a while to respond since i didnâ€™t see it. 
Back to the private messages. I said i was 19. Sheâ€™s seen my message and hasnâ€™t responded for about 4 hours now.

I then texted â€œdo you live with your familyâ€ just recently. I need help right now. I need as much help to stop this, I canâ€™t let this go. Iâ€™m not experienced with this, i only messaged her because i was the only one who has seen it. This is so sad.
