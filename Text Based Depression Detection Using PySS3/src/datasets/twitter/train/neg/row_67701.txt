Iâ€™ve avoided other people every single day of my life. I donâ€™t want this virus forcing me to stay alive anymore. PleaseI would just meander with groups until they got creeped out and told me to go away

I canâ€™t take a picture and think this is someone worthy of money and happiness and respect

Iâ€™ve felt out of place and pathetic everywhere Iâ€™ve ever dragged my sorry piece of shit carcass around

I literally have hated myself since I was a kid and told my parents I was made fun of in school every day for being weird and retarded

Iâ€™m realizing how horrifying my life has been and the pain Iâ€™ve held in my heart

Iâ€™ve never recovered from being in that mental institution 

The horror of being removed from the house crying. Not understand what I did wrong

I just wanted to be left alone

I just want to be left alone

Silence please

Someone turn it all off please
