I want to kill myself out of sheer frustrationI'm 15, and I'm just frustrated with the stupidity of everyone, especially my age group, and I think my age group is the dumbest so far and will only get worse.

I know we all have guilty pleasures, things we like that we know aren't really good. But, these people watch pewdiepie, and tobuscus game videos, and listen to Justin bieber and nicki fucking manaj. 

These people also know nothing about politics or religion, I can respect someone who differs than me opinion wise but these people have the worst arguments. They praise Ronald fucking Reagan, and couldn't explain one difference between communism and facism (they all asked me to the answer on that essay question).

I'm not saying I'm smart, in fact I'm  glad I'm not a mcarthur grant genius but the thing is is I just sat down and stopped jerking off and playing angry birds for a while and read some articles instead, and just decided to spend some time more intellectually instead of wasting it, The sad thing is the only kids I see interested in stuff like that believe whatever their parents do ( tea party nonsense)

Another thing is that I can change people's minds. No matter how correct I am or how well I argue my point there will still be 9-11 truthers, Obama birthers, and people that think that Muhammad flew to heaven on a flying fucking horse.

And the idiots in the world are reproducing at the rate of rabbits while the smart people might as well all be neutered.

I want to kill myself because there is no hope, and I don't want to see humanity decline further. I took my dads gun from his safe, even had a note and everything; and a girl that I liked deciding to Skype call me was the only thing that stopped me from pulling the trigger (she wasn't aware, I hid the gun before I answered), this incident was this last Friday.
