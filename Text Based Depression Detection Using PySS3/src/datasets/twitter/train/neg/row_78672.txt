I'm just not someone who's supposed to be alive.I'm an 18 year old in my last year of high school.

I've been thinking this for over a year now. I feel as if I'm not meant to be a part of this world. I'm useless and pretty much a glitch. I'm alive, but I shouldn't be.

I've had an anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember, but it has gotten worse lately. Over a year ago now, I lost every single one of my friends. Pretty much at once. I haven't made any new friends since then, since I pretty much can't talk to people. I'm extremely awkward and just an all around uncomfortable person. I don't fit in with anyone at school at all. I usually hide in the bathroom so that I won't be seen by anybody.

And now today I was just fired from an unpaid internship which I did during school hours to get one of my last needed credits. I'm supposed to graduate in june and I needed that credit to graduate. Now it's done, I don't know what to do.

I just think it's time to go, it'd be best for everyone.
