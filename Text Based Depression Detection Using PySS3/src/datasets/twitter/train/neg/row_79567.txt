I am bleeding a lot right nowSome advice from people who have attempted suicide by wristcutting. I cut myself about 8 minutes ago just as a self harm thing, and now I am bleeding a lot. I am not sure what to do, I keep bleeding, it isn't like a lot, but there's still a slow amount of blood is coming out of my arm. What do you recommend? I was planning on dying tomorrow, but going out with pills, and recording a video before I died, this is just too awful

EDIT:  I stopped bleeding as much. Like there's a bit of blood coming out, but I think I'll be okay, thanks guys! 

PS: What's that white skin you see below the skin?
