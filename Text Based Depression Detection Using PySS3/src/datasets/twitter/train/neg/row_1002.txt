Not sure if i need helpHello, i'm a 30 yo french dude, i've been depressed since i have like-8 yo cause of many things that i won't explain here. 
My gf left me 4 months ago, we have been together more than-4 years, since i've been in a lot of drugs like i used to before, never had a day sober, i drink everyday/night, even alone. When i was with here i was happy, i put my depression away to be here for her, but now, everything is like before but like 1000x. I've been in hospital 3 times cause of od, suicide attempt, and one time in psychiatric clinical. I have a lot of scares in my thighs and my arms, and tonight i have cut my arms a lot more, cause i can't find a reason to live, and to take my mental pain away. everything is meaningless, everyday is a torture, i want this to end, but a part of me want to .be happy, find peace without commiting suicide. Everyday when i wake up the first thing that cross my mind is to blow my head open.. i think i have to talk, i'm not sure.. i don't talk about it to my friends, and don't post a lot on reddit, just now i feel that i'll end this life really soon.. (sorry for my english, i'm french, drunk and like everytime on drugs)
