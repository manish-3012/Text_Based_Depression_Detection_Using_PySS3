Just doneI'm a 29 year old male. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was 12. I've always somehow pushed through so far. I've abused drugs and been in and out of detention / jail / prison and mental health facilities since the same time. 

I can't maintain relationships because I hate myself and I hate other people. Sometimes I wish I could connect with people, but mostly I find comfort in the fact that I can put a bullet through my head when I want to.

Having the gun in my room and loaded has been a bit of a relief for the past few months. Knowing that I can just end it when I want somehow helped. However, the assurance that it is easy and available has slowly become not enough.

The alcohol and heroin isn't numbing me enough to get me by anymore. It's practically impossible for me to get a job that isn't minimum wage or close to it. My credit is fucked because of ER visits so I can't get a place to live without a cosigner which leaves me dependant on others and forced to bend to the will of them.

I want control over my life and I've never had it. I don't think I ever will aside from ending it. I've had so much time to do something with my life and I haven't been able to put anything together. I'm a fucking failure and I know it.

I've seen mental health professionals and been nothing but disappointed. I'm only posting here because I want to be able to admit to myself that I tried everything before I kill myself
