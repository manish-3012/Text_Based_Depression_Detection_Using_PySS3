I don't know what this is all aboutI'll tell you what I do know know. Today I left my job and I don't have another one lined up. All I have is my writing, and my drinking, and my Xanax, which helps when I can't drink. I have a wife who love me but who can't stop my want to walk into the river Yarra with a big rock and just walk to the bottom and sit there. So my shrink knows I am having suicidal thoughts, alcohol problems, and obsession with writing. And for the moment I'm unemployed.   

You know, I don't know what I'm asking you all for.

*edit sorry. this doesnt belong here. Im drunk and depressed but I have my book and I'm going to finish it. I'm sorry waste your time



forget it i'm not serious

* edit. Thanks for your kindness. Today I went fishing with my best friend, and I told him about all this. I think be okay. The thought is still there. The plan, the knowledge that I could do it, it would be easy. It's so perplexing. I know a hundred ways to die, but I need to figure out how to live. Suicide is an existential threat. I want to exist.That's what I tell myself, that's what I beleive. Time changes all things. As a philospher once said "And this too shall change".
