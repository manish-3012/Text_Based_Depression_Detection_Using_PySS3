7 days since i left my apartment lastI havent left my apartment in 7 days now, not since my last interview for a job that i didnt get. 

All i can think about lately is how apathetic i feel and not being around anymore.

Im going to spare you the details but i really just needed to put this somewhere. 

Realizing its all your own fault has been the worst part of it.

Finding a will to live is fleeting. 
Im about ready to put religion to the test and find out whats in the afterlife.
