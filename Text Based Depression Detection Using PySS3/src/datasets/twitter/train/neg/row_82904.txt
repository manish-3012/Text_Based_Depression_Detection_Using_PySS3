nothing comes to mindI'm pretty much done. Suicide hotline is a waste of time. Nobody really cares anyway. I'm broke, worse, buried in debt. I've achieved the level of fuck up where even my death will only serve to burden others. I can't fix anything. If I can't escape by death what else is there? What do I do?  Spare me empty sympathy, I need solutions. Or maybe I'm just meant to be a bane. It's not like I'll be around to be guilty anyway. Not even sure why I'm bothering to post this other than I can't sleep. Perpetually tired. Maybe I'll force myself to rest today
