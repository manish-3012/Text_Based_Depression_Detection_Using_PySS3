I'm trapped and tired of existing.Well, my first attempt to write this was excessively long. Maybe I can give a summarized version.

It would take a book to explain the whole situation. The summary would be this: I grew up in an abusive home, was bullied at school, had few friends, no social skills, terrible grades despite scoring extremely high on tests, and was eventually tossed out of school on my ass. For a twist, it turns out I had mild Autism the whole time and no one, including me, figured it out until over 15 years later. So, I entered adult life with no social skills, no life skills, no practical skills, no education, a broken family, and my only support a couple of grandparents whose solution to everything was to throw money at the problem while mismanaging their own affairs, and tell me how I and everything else should be.

Things got better for a little while when I got involved in a church, made some friends, and got on the inside of a social circle for the first and only time in my life. It didn't last, as these people had expectations, and I am horrible at living up to others' expectations. Long story short, the situation reached critical mass and blew up in my face. I don't attend church any more, and likely never will again.

Still, I managed to live up to a few expectations. I managed to get a job, which was very difficult for me due to the Autism I didn't know I had. I met someone who seemed to understand what I've been through and ended up marrying here. Both of these situations have deteriorated severely. The job, though I have kept it for many years, is draining the life out of me and provides me with only a meager income. My wife is as well, she is not a very understanding person, and communication between us is horrible. I feel like I've made strong efforts to make things right, but one sided efforts don't make relationships work. I didn't want to be that guy who walks out on his wife, but now we have kids and leaving would mean serious consequences to me. With my low income, I couldn't afford to live if I had to pay child support and support myself, especially with how biased the courts are against fathers in these cases, particularly in my state. And I wouldn't want to live and not be with my kids anyways. So, I'm trapped in this relationship.

Lots of other issues have been going on. My house is falling apart, my car is dying, my health is going bad, and I can't afford to deal with any of these issues adequately. I have ideas, dreams, and hopes but I don't have the time, opportunity, education, or resources to develop or act on any of them. Everything I want has been placed out of my reach. I have no friends, no family that I trust, no support network, and a wife who makes me feel more alone than if I *were* alone. I can't afford a therapist. I have no options to move, change things, or alter the course of my life. I feel like I have no control over anything anymore. I'm just here, being a workhorse that supports my family and serves no other purpose. And there is nothing I can do to change it, no hope of being anything more.

Everyone has problems. Problems aren't the problem. My problem is that the problems seem to have no solution. I can see no options. I can't get out of my situation. I have no alternate job options in my area. I'm trapped in this sardine can of a house, with noise and activity that makes me feel paralyzed with sensory overload, a wife I have to constantly walk on eggshells around and work to keep happy, and just enough financial resources to get by and have a little wiggle room. I'm tired. I feel trapped. I see no solution that doesn't create a bigger problem. I'm ready to give up. I don't want to. I'd rather find a solution to the problems. But I don't see one. And I don't have the fortitude left to keep going on like this. I am beyond spent. I don't actually want to die, but I'm tired of living. If this is all it's going to be, then what's the point? If my life is destined to be a waste or a tragedy, then I'd prefer it at least be a relatively short one.

The good news, I suppose, is that I have never been able to harm myself. I can't even prick my skin with a needle. I'd make a terrible diabetic. But I have spent hours trying to figure out ways to circumvent this mental block, and I find myself spending more and more time trying to find a way. I would love to find an alternative to ceasing to exist, but I don't see one.

Let me just preclude a few common, go-to responses that people will likely try to throw at me:

* I can't afford a therapist, a marriage counselor, or anything of the like. I don't have friends. I don't have family that will understand. I don't have people I can confide in or talk to that won't just make things worse. I live just outside of a tiny rural community and few resources are available. Commuting to other towns is expensive, and I'm poor.

* If changing my life's course is possible, I don't know how to do it. Changing locations, jobs, or other circumstances would be difficult at best. My options on all of these things are *extremely* limited right now, and will likely be for some time.

* Talking to my wife is like talking to a wall. I've exhausted myself trying to be understanding, bridge the communication gap, and fix things. It takes two, and my efforts are one sided.

* I've tried meditation and all that stuff. It's hard to do in my hectic environment, and it doesn't deal with the external problems. I can cope with pain. But no amount of coping solves the real, tangible, pragmatic problems causing the pain.

* I can't take a time out from anything or anyone. I have no useable vacation time, nowhere to go, and responsibilities that I can't step away from.

* I'm not taking drugs, I hardly drink, and aside from wanting to end my life I'm not engaged in any high risk behavior.

* My motivation is in extremely short supply, and barely enough to get me through day to day activities, let alone doing extra stuff.
