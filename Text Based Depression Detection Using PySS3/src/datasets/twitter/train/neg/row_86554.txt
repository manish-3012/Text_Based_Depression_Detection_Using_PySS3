I give up.My entire life I've been struggling with depression and anxiety and autism. I keep fighting I keep going to therapy I keep taking medicine I keep trying to exercise and eat healthy and I keep trying to keep in touch with people.

I keep fighting over and over and over again struggling in pain trying to get my shit together and trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel and not lights not ever coming.

I'm tired of it. I'm tired of every single day being a struggle to not fall into a deep depression and hate myself and wanting to die. Just can't fight anymore. I'm so sick of it.

I honestly don't see the point of continuing to live just so that I can continue to suffer there's no end to it in sight. At a certain point you have to put something that suffering out of its misery. It's cruel to let a wounded animal suffer, if there's no hope for it, you kill it.

I just don't have any reason to keep living and putting myself through this. I live a fairly sad empty existence and that hasn't changed and won't change. 

I have nothing to look forward to except just more of the same. I have no reason to live. No one needs me. Everyone I know has their own happy life with their own families while I'm alone and miserable.

Life has no purpose no meaning there's not a single reason I can think of to keep living because I know exactly what's in store for me just more of the same misery.

I just can't keep doing it.
