Point of life when nothing you want can be accomplishedWhatâ€™s the point of life, when you are ugly? When you are not smart? When you are not social but you would love to be. When you can not even tally anyone. Honestly corona makes everything worse, because before this I was forced to talk to people, now I am not. Furthermore I always tried to support other people and make their life better, I always thought if I canâ€™t be happy, my point in life could be to make others happy, to help them. But maybe I am just a net negative for this world. 
Yesterday I found out, that people exist which do not have emphaty (psychopaths), I was horrified by the thought, that actually 4% of people seem to be like this. What if everyone is like this? What if nothing you thought is true is true? If everyone is like this, than everyone always used me. I want to die so much alll day I am thinking about death. I would love to be stronger more confident and less thoughtful of others I would have done this.
The only reason why I can do it, is because I really love my family and I do not want to hurt them. I am a bit scared of the pain aswell to be honest. What should I do now, after I realized all this? Hopefully soon the pain is enough to not give a fuck anymore, I am too exhausted just want to sleep....
