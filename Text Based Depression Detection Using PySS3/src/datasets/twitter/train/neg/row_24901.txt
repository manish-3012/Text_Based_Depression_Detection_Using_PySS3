I just went apeshit and almost put a whole on my (cement) wall.  My knuckles are bleeding... I can't stop crying.  Well, it comes and goes.  About every 10-15 minutes I just get a rush of tears and I burst out crying for 5 minutes or so.  Then it happens again.

I locked up my 3 pet rabbits in their cages because I'm afraid I might take it out of them.  I'm taking them to the local shelter on Saturday to surrender them. I know I'll miss them but I'm afraid for them.  I feel like I want to talk to anyone but I feel so much anger inside right now that I can't.  To top it all, my cellphone just won't get any reception at all.  I've tried everything for the past hour but it just keeps saying "No Service"... fuck T-Mobile.

Anyway, I'm going out for a run (maybe for a half-hour tops).  I'm afraid I might want to kill myself soon.

Edit: I'm back. Feeling better... but now I'm frozen and sore lol
