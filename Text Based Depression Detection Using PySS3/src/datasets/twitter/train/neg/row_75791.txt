I'm 45, feel a failure, have a sad crush on a younger woman and have the means to kill myself tonight.I dont have a bad life; I have friends, a good job that I'm good at and where my managers, colleagues and even canteen staff like me. I have friends, surprisingly good health though a bit overweight, no debts and a decent home with good TV WiFi etc.
 Yet it's not enough.
I have no family since my Mother died four years ago. I have bouts of depression since. I'm not married or in a relationship but through choice as I have refused many chances.

 But something odd has made me aware of what is fundamentally wrong: a much younger female colleague showed some interest in me which I ignored, not wanting to make life difficult, though I was flattered and interested.

However, over the last months my feelings for her have grown as the more we talk the more I realise how much we think alike. However, she now has a boyfriend.

But it's made me realise that so many of my decisions were wrong; I'll never attract a woman like her again, I'll never have another long term relationship, I'll never have a daughter. I'll always be second best to someone else.

I exist to continue my existence. I have had many opportunities and interesting life events and positions but the whole has never equalled the sum of the parts.

I feel a fat, middle aged fool of no importance who simply ages toward nothing.

I have the method for suicide available and every Sunday I wonder why I don't just end this pointless existence. I truly hope death is nothingNess. 

I feel like a failed experiment and a fraud. People at work remark on my intelligence and 'wisdom' and i feel I am truly neither.

 I want to jump off the train before the inevitable crash.
