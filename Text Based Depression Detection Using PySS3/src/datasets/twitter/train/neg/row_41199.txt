i can't fucking take it anymorethrowaway for many reasons.

first of all, let me introduce myself so you can understand why i'm having suicidal thoughts.

hi, i'm elliot(alias), i'm 13 years old and have a lot of issues.

1. i lost someone to suicide on september 21st 2017 and it ruined me. i cared for him and he was a really funny guy.
2. bullying. for 3 years after his death i got bullied endlessly for doing stuff i had NO FUCKING CONTROL OVER.
3. suicidal thoughts happened a year after his death where i straight up said to a bully "i don't want to live sometimes because of you, and the BEST FUCKING PART?! HE LAUGHED, SMILED, AND SAID "GOOD FOR YOU" WHILE CLAPPING." 
4. school. i'm so far fucking behind i TRY MY FUCKING BEST! I'M SO WEAK AND PATHETIC I CAN'T EVEN GET A FUCKING A! MY FAMILY FUCKING PRIORITIZE GRADES OVER EVERYTHING ELSE AND I FUCKING HATE IT.
5. mental health issues mainly, like depression, anxiety, and insomnia. i only get an hour of sleep at night sometimes and sometimes i don't even fucking sleep.
6. i believe i have bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder but my family disagrees.
7. i just want a single family member who can actually fucking understand where i come from. but they don't understand JACKSHIT.

so yeah that's it. if i don't reply don't be surprised. this is a throwaway.
