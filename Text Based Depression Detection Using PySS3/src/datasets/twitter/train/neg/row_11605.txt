What was I thinking?Just once I wanted something to go the way I'd hope them to. There's a Halloween party at my comm. college, and I thought it'd be fun. Had a sweet costume to show off, just wanted to chill with some ppl and have a good time, and hey who knows, maybe I'd meet a nice girl. Is that really so much to ask?! For me it is! The "party" if you can even call it that, hardly anybody goes to, and it's about as disregarded as could be. Does anybody like Halloween anymore? Just once I wanted to have a good time with a little bit of fantasy mixed in. I just wanted to be noticed for once, I haven't been to a party in years, and idk why, but I just thought things would change if i took a chance. Well, that chance pretty much exploded in my face. Now i feel like dying, because nothing ever happens to me and that's NEVER going to change.
