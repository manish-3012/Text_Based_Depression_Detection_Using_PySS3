Never thought trying to play a college sport would ruin my lifeIn high school I was very optimistic and out going.  Played sports, was in clubs, and generally had fun a lot.  I had a really bright future (not just in athletics, at all)

My decision ruined me mentally, less than two years later I dropped out and quit my job after my second ACL tear.  I look back and wonder wtf I just did to my life. Why didnâ€™t I quit after the first one? Iâ€™d still have my mental health, and I likely wouldnâ€™t have retorn it.  

I lack the motivation to do, anything. Iâ€™ve lost all the muscle in my body, and I lay in bed until my parents force me to get up.  Iâ€™ve already gained quite a bit of weight and my legs feel like shit. 

I used to have hopes and dreams, for some reason, theyâ€™re all gone. I donâ€™t care about having them.  I want my knee to be fixed, but I lack the motivation and discipline to exercise.

I donâ€™t want to kill myself, but if dying is anything like sleep, I could go for that.
