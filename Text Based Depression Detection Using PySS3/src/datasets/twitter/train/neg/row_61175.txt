Fuck this world. It's not what it used to be.Society is crumbling fast. People have become so cold and apathetic. I've had enough of suffering with no end in sight! When you're down like I am it's impossible to see how things will change. Who wants to date let alone be friends with a reject like me? I've lost everything that mattered in my life: my wife, friends, my job.  I suffer from CPTSD, ADHD, OCD, and MDD. The only place I have to turn is my parents but they are fundamentalist Christians that may as well be radical terrorists. They reject me because I don't believe in their religion of hate. So really I have no one. People sense that I'm down so I repel people everywhere I go. I fought so hard to leave the cult I was raised in only to end up in a place that's arguably worse off. I can't go on.
