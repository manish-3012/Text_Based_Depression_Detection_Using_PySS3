It hurtsI'm so sad that it physically hurts. I have pressure on my chest, swallowing hurts and i cried uncontrollably. It's too much. I'm supposed to be on a high speed train tomorrow. I'm fantasizing about throwing myself under it. I couldn't do that to the guy controlling the train though. Or the other people whose ride would be delayed. I'm worthless, i don't want to ruin their days/lives. Fuck. I hate this. I wish i could be someone else.
