I just wanted to share a little hope and let you know that you're strong. .You've come so far and gone through so much and you're still fighting. Even if you feel like you aren't. Even if you feel like you're just sitting and doing nothing, or you feel like everything is going wrong, you're still here fighting. Even if you feel like life isn't worth it. I, personally, think you're doing great. I think that even if we loose a hundred fights, at least we can stand up to continue forward, even by an inch or millimeter. Don't let your past devalue your future.

I hope this made you smile and made you feel a little better, random Reddit user. Because I'm on your side, in your corner, cheering you on to the future.
