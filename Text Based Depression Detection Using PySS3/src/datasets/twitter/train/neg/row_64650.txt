TitleI'm 5'5, 103, on 3 different medications and I need to disappear. 
I drop a pound or more everyday. I force myself to eat, nausea/vomit, I think about eating, nausea. 
I picked up the puppy I was getting today, thinking her being here would help a bit but it did not. I still banged my head on metal/steel, I still drank and smoke, I still punched walls and I still cut myself. I know it's not gonna be as simple as that but my routine was still happening even with her being right next to me.

I am glad my health is worsening every day, I'm glad I have lung/heart disease. It'll be easier and faster now that I know.
