Where did all my friends go?2 years of isolation is all it took. Before that I was the big(tm) d e p r e s s o but had a loving support network. My best friend was always there for me. No matter what, it was unconditional, dropping anything in the world to be with me and make sure I was ok. One relationship later and I have cut off all connections with the people that were the closest to me, that took years to build connections with.

I feel that I was more loved and in love with my best friend than I ever was with my Ex. A love that was so pure, like a mother's love, that never let me fall too low -- low enough to want to die like I do now. Never did I have to impress them or make sure I was their favourite person. I just cared so much for them that no matter what happened I would be there for them.

There was no jealousy. No demands. No economic ties. No battles about having the same life goals. It was just a pure.

Why couldn't have that been my Ex? Why must love corrupt?

Now I have no energy to socialise, I never really know what people's opinions of me are. They probably all think I am weird.
