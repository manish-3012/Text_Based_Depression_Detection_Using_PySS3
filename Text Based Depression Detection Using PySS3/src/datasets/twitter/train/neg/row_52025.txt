Alone, lost, and pretty much done with lifeI donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m to do anymore other than just give it in. I thought I would have somewhat figured out my life by now after being a half decade out of college, but I have no clue what Iâ€™m doing. The once hopeful boy who dreamed of a life of happiness from finding meaningful work, circle of friends, and an equal, loving wife has faded from my heart. All thatâ€™s left is emptiness and regret.
