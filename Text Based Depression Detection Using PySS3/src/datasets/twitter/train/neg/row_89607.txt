my general fundamental belief is that humans want the worst for me. and that's not a nice feeling. i have been hated for no reason by so many. it just comes naturally to me that strangers prefer to hurt me rather than help me i'm slightly nerdy looking (not a lot tho, but a bit) maybe not very intimidating.

i don't get any respect at all. i mind my own fucking business, i don't go out my way to bother people.

but it's like people see me and they see my maybe nervous body language (because of some trauma and stuff) and they like to boost their own confidence by looking at my lack of confidence.

like fx if i were to tell somebody "this would really help me out a lot"... i would never tell a stranger that because my natural thought is that they will then try to do the exact opposite and worsen whatever situation i might be in at the time.

lets say in the bus... if i ask someone "do you know how long my ticket is valid?" my natural thought is that they will intentionally lie so that i could get a fine for not having a valid ticket. except for old grandmas and stuff, i haven't lost my trust in them... yet haha

and yes i'm suicidal. i just posted this on the depression sub. god i hate this fucking site (reddit)

but i come here to rant instead of bothering my fb friends
