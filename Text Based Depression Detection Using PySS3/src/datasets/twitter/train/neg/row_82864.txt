I'm going away forever tomorrowI've actually been watching this subreddit for a very long time. Well, as long as it can be.
I've decided that after my repeated mistakes, I've decided to leave. I wont do it today might not do it tomorrow either, but I WILL do it no matter what it takes. Thank you all for being there with me in my darkest times!
I finalized it after going around the internet and seeing repeated successes after successes of other people.
See you all maybe in a later life!
