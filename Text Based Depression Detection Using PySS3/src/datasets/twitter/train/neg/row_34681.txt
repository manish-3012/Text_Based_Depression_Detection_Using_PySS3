I posted this elsewhere but I want to die now after this.I was raped.
I canâ€™t tell anyone because Iâ€™m a man. My family would not understand, my friends do not understand. So here I am trying to get these words out there. I need some way to talk about it and this is it. First of all, I have always identified as bi-sexual but this experience makes me never want to interact with a man again. I am no longer bi. It started on Saturday night. I was having drinks with my friends. I got carried away, my pre-existing alcohol problems got the best of me. In the past I have always been able to compose myself, but not this time; it was too much. Around midnight my roommateâ€™s friend came over. He was a black man, around 20 years old. I am 21. He was gay, it was a very clear flamboyant gay so I knew immediately. I was so drunk though I did not care about that. Being a self-identified bi-sexual I immediately started hitting on him, this is normal stuff for me but I have never in my life been with a man. I didnâ€™t want to be with a man, so now I have to live with these stupid regrets.
I was at the point of black out drunk, but I still remember what happened. I went to my room because I couldnâ€™t even stand any longer. He followed. He laid with me which was nice initially because I needed some kind of affection. I was too drunk, I felt sad and alone, alcohol triggers my depression. Before I knew what was happening his hand was on my crotch. I asked him to stop. He told me to relax. I didnâ€™t know what to do. Then he started kissing me. I didnâ€™t kiss back. I just lay there, too scared to say anything. He started to kiss down my bodyâ€¦ â€œPlease stopâ€ I begged him. I didnâ€™t ask for this, I may have hit on him; but I didnâ€™t ask for this. He pulled down my shorts. Please please stop. Donâ€™t let this happen. My brain was telling my body to stop this; I couldnâ€™t fight. He began to give me oralâ€¦ This lasted for about 10 minutes. The entire time I begged and begged for him to stop. I pushed him and hit him. Stop. Stopâ€¦ STOP. But he didnâ€™t. He got tired of me and stopped then. He sat back up and apologized. Your apologies will not change what happened. I told him to get out of my room, he did. He proceeded to lay on the futon in the living room.
I woke up the next morning and did not realize what had happened until the day went on and my memory started coming back to me. I checked my phoneâ€¦. I had told my girlfriend what happened and she blamed me. She told me it was my fault. I drank too much. Was it my fault? Did I do this?
Now here I am, two days later. I canâ€™t tell anyone. Iâ€™m supposed to be a man, Iâ€™m supposed to be strongâ€¦ What do I do? How do I continue when I canâ€™t even look at myself in the mirror? I am disgusted by everything I am. I am poisoned by the toxicity of society. I am a man, I was raped.
