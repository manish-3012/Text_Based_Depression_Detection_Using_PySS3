I think I'm gonna be okay.I had a rough time growing up. My mother was diagnosed with cancer when I was about 10 and died when I was 14. From then till around a few months ago I experienced the worst years of my life. My father became physically abusive, I was raped by one boyfriend and hit by another. I tried to end my life multiple times. I couldn't handle one horrific event after another. It felt as if the minute I started to attempt to recover another thing just took my hope away from me. I started college and have failed classes every semester since. Thankfully along the way I reconnected with someone from my past and he helped me begin to attempt to pick myself back up. We began dating and eventually moved in together. This past semester I decided to take a break and just focus on myself. We adopted a little cat and she's made me so happy. I'm now about to turn 20 in 20 days and I could've never imagined myself getting to this point and actually being happy to be alive. Some days I still fall back and feel like one day someone is just gonna take this all away from me, but I try to remain as hopeful as possible.
