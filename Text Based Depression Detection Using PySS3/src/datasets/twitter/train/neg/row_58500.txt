Maybe writing will help.First off, Iâ€™m just writing this in hope of relieving some of this pressure I feel in my chest. It may not be interesting, but feel free to read my thoughts and sob story. 

I had a relatively normal childhood. My parents divorced when I was 6, but I was so young then that it didnâ€™t really affect me much. My father was (and still is) extremely religious and as a result I never got to engage in a lot of stuff normal kids did. We didnâ€™t celebrate birthdays or any holidays, and my father prevented me from spending time with other kids for the most part. As a result I always felt like an outcast since I was young. I didnâ€™t have a social life for a long time because I wasnâ€™t able to cultivate any social skills for a long time. School was the only thing I had some sort of pride in. I got good grades, good test results, and so on. 

Despite me being pretty lonely throughout most of elementary and middle school, I felt happy. In high school I stopped living with my dad and I was able to do stuff I wasnâ€™t able to before. I made new friends, went to parties, and I was happy. Then all of a sudden  one day in the beginning of my junior year of high school I felt like I hit a wall. I kept questioning my existence. What is the point of everything? I kept imagining different futures where Iâ€™d be successful at achieving my goals, but the thought of it didnâ€™t bring me joy anymore. It just had an underlying feeling of emptiness. From then on things like hanging out with friends, listening to and playing music, didnâ€™t bring me joy anymore. I felt and still feel empty. I closed myself off and lost friends and failed classes. No one tried to help me, and I realized how little I matter in this world. I started thinking about suicide daily and it began to be a pervasive thought throughout each day. 

I ended up dropping out of high school because my attendance was so poor. I have my GED now and Iâ€™m going to community college, but Iâ€™m only moving forward because I donâ€™t know what else to do. I hate living each day and the thought of suicide is almost a comfort, but the thought of just not existing scares me more. All I know is to exist and just ending that is scary to me. Maybe one day I wonâ€™t be afraid of that anymore, but until that day comes I guess Iâ€™ll just trudge through each day. I hope one day Iâ€™ll feel like how I used to. 

If you read this all thank you, but it is mostly for myself. I wish everyone the best, but I know wishing doesnâ€™t really help.
