Death sounds kind of niceFor a long time, I've thought about ending my life. It's crossed my thoughts for years, triggered through various ways, but with that said I don't think I'll ever go through with it. Not only do I lack the courage to do something like that, it's just frightening to think about what comes after.

It's just a reoccurring concept that keeps crossing my mind because I feel like a total loser. I mean, I'm a 23 year old high school drop out who has various health problems that works a minimum wage job in a liquor store. I don't even get to spend my paycheck because I have to give it to my Dad so he can buy the groceries/pay the rent/buy alcohol so he can be a belligerent asshole for the rest of the night. 

Shit, I don't even know what I'm going to do with my life. It's crushing to know people younger than me are more successful/smarter than I am (which manifests itself in my co-workers at my job). It really just makes me hate myself so much more. Why am I so awkward? Why am I smart enough to realize how stupid I am? Why do I have to have these health problems? Why do I procrastinate so fucking much when I know I have to get shit done? 

It's silly, but one of the reasons why I want to live is because I want to keep experiencing the joys of this life, like seeing the sunrises/sunsets. Seeing my sister's graduation. Personal fulfillment through accomplishing my goals. Playing that new game that comes out next year, or watching that new TV show.

Being dead would be easier, but it's not the answer. Atleast not at this point in time.
