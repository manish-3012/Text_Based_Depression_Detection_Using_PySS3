I'm not actively suicidal, but I don't want to be here.I just wish life were like a video game I could turn off &amp; stop playing.
I feel no sense of purpose or joy, nor do I have anybody who cares about me around.
My family dynamic isn't the greatest, nor do I have many friends.
The fact that we're all going to die one day makes me lose all hope or interest in trying.
What truly is the point in any of this?
I don't understand.
I don't want to be here much longer.
