Most of the time, I don't want to improve my life, I just want to dieToo scared to kill myself, though. I don't know myself and what I really desire. I'm old (depends on perspective, I think I'm old as shit, anyway), male, short, fat, hate myself and sometimes I get angry (or like a very mild panic) that I can't fucking believe there's so many years left of ABSOLUTE FUCKING BULLSHIT that is my life, unless I do something about it. This is embarrassing. Maybe there's someone here I can talk to about this.
