Not going to do it. But can't shake the thought nonetheless.40s, educated, divorced American father. Childhood friend committed suicide when I was 15. Lost a step brother to suicide in the early 1990s. Father died when I was 10 and likely suffered depression. Mother died when I turned 30 and I was her sole caretaker. Also suffered depression. So, I'm pretty used to death is what I'm saying.

There have been some relationship and professional hiccups lately. And I just don't feel like trying so damn hard anymore. I have kids and I have people that love me, I know this. But I just don't feel like talking to them. When they talk to me about life, trivialities, about the weather, I just want to shake them and say "I'm fucking dying, I can't concentrate on what you're saying because I'm so damn preoccupied." I can't say that to my kids. I can't say that to my partner. I have a sister. That's it. She'd get it. But I've burdened her with so much of my emotional baggage over the last year, does she need this, too?

So today's been really bad. I woke up really early. Whenever I wake up earlier than expected it's where my mind immediately goes. I work from home, alone. And I'm watching the clock and just saying go another hour. Go another hour. Go another hour. But I also think which doorway has the strongest support? Which belt would work? How big a nail would I need? Do I have one that big in the tool box?

And then I go back to work. And think just get through another hour. Just get through another hour. Get to bed tonight and tomorrow will be better. Exercise tonight. Exercise tonight. Read until you fall asleep. I've been to enough suicide support groups to know that no depression lasts forever. Wait it out, things will turn around. 

I need to work. But dammit I need a distraction from these thoughts that just don't quit today. Distract me, I dunno.
