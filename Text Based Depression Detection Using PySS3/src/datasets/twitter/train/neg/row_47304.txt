Serious helpIâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts for a year now and even cut myself on the wrist at the age of 14. I went to several therapists and nothing helps. Not to mention all the work school loads onto students. I recently lost the best friend i couldâ€™ve had to severe whipping and a hanging. Nothing seems to be worth it in the end and it will just get worse and worse.
