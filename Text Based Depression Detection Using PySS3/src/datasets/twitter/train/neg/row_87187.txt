How did you go through social anxiety and depression and end up OK? How can I?I'll try to not make this too long. So about me. I'm a 17 year old boy. I've been living with social anxiety and depression for a while now. I've only had one boyfriend for a short time a while ago. I've never had a girlfriend. I've never been kissed. I spend almost all my time inside. I masturbate too much, but I am trying to stop. I only have one friend and we're not close or anything. At school (when I did go to school) I don't really speak much. I almost can't connect at all with normal kids. Whenever I do go to school, I feel out of place and think a lot on just dying. I still do out of school. This is my life.

I wish I could be normal. A normal person with a normal life. Doing normal things for a person my age. Some adults enjoyed their time in high school. I don't. But I wish I could. But I can't change who I am . At least not completely. But realistically speaking, what I want is to have a few couple of close friends who I could call family and a boyfriend here and a girlfriend there. Maybe both at the same time lol. And kids. Hell I think I'd like kids now at 17. I don't think I'm asking for much. Many people have this. But to me it seems like a complete fantasy. If I could see into the future and if I saw myself with that, I could carry on with how life is now. But again it seems like a fantasy. Is it? If so, then why should I keep living? But I can kill myself, at least not yet.

To those who went through what I'm going through and ended up with a friends and family, how did you do it? How did you get there? How can I do it? Since I can't kill myself, I'd like a little bit of hope to hold onto. I wouldn't mind living if I had people that cared about me.
