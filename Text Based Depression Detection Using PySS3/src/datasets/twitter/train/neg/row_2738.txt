I had to let go of many toxic friends. Iâ€™m now realizing that all of my friends were toxic, and I donâ€™t have any friends left.I finally cut contact with the people that claimed to have good intentions, only to slowly distance themselves from me and made me feel like I wasnâ€™t important. But, now that these people are out of my life, I donâ€™t have friends. I have a couple of people here and there but we donâ€™t talk often enough to call them friends. Iâ€™ve remained alone in my room since New Years Day, crying and being a mess over not having consistently communicative friends. I didnâ€™t think this could happen again, but it did. I feel alone and I honestly donâ€™t think anyone would notice or care if I suddenly disappeared. I havenâ€™t had the urge to cut myself in years but thatâ€™s all I want to do now. Iâ€™m riddled with misery and I have to feign happiness. This is horrible. I feel so alone and unwanted. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I want to give up. I canâ€™t stop crying and I feel insanely weak. Iâ€™ve let so many people hurt me and drag me down that I donâ€™t want to get up again. Iâ€™m tired of fighting this when no one cares about me. I want to just sleep forever. No one cares.

Edit - canâ€™t seem to read comments, Iâ€™m sorry if it looks like Iâ€™m not engaging in conversation, I just canâ€™t see what anyone comments for some reason
