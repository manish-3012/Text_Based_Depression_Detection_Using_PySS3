In a few days time, I think Iâ€™ll kill myselfI no longer have anyone or anything going for me. The only person I had woke up a day not long ago and realised they no longer are in love with me. This person was the only person keeping me here, the only reason I havenâ€™t done anything sooner. I still love her more than anything. I canâ€™t stop crying but I also feel so numb, I feel completely abandoned. She has all the right to no longer love me but I still want to hate her for it. Iâ€™ve crossed oceans for her and it seems like she wouldnâ€™t even jump over a puddle for me. I just donâ€™t know what to do and the pain that I already considered never-ending now seems to be 200x worse. I think I am just going to end it, Iâ€™m not sure how yet.
