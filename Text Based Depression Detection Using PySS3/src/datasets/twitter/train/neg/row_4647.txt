Life sucks all in all â€“ iâ€™m not good at anythingiâ€™ve come to the conclusion that i am truly incapable of doing anything. anything. iâ€™m incapable of being any type of good person. iâ€™m not pretty AT ALL, i donâ€™t get attention from guys (considering iâ€™m a junior in high school and have not dated anyone my whole life) while all my friends have boyfriends and i feel like the â€œduffâ€ of my friend group. iâ€™m not smart, i just try hard enough to make it look like iâ€™m smart but in reality iâ€™m actually dumb. iâ€™m not outgoing, i feel left out and reserved during conversations. iâ€™m not caring as my friends say, telling me they are the last person they come to when theyâ€™re sad because i never know what to say apparently(i never realized this was yet another bad trait of me). iâ€™m not funny. iâ€™m not good at any sports, as iâ€™m extremely unathletic which was proven when i tried joining track and ended running the longest time on the team.  if i were to ask my peers around meâ€”â€œwhat do you think is my best quality?â€ you would hear crickets chirping because the answer is nothing. 
honestly, i just want a new life. or i want to start something new in my life and try and excel at it. thank u for reading lmao
