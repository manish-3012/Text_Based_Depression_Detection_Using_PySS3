Why is this so easy.2 years ago February 18th 2018 my dad killed himself with his .357 i was 14. I found him. What the fuck who the fuck does that to their son. Then my mom gets re diagnosed with cancer and spends 5 months in the hospital almost dying 3 days left to live yet she somehow made a recovery. Lifeâ€™s been nothing but shit since then always some sort of issue in my life going on that would very easily cause anyone else to jump off that edge and go where they shouldnâ€™t if that makes sense. 

You know Make suicide seem like it was a expected outcome but not me I powered through that for 2 years. Things are finally getting better for once I just got out of living through a domestic household for 5 months things seem great for me right now a sudden change in life Iâ€™m talking to a beautiful girl too. So why can I sit here with my shotgun in my lap picturing how quickly I could get it done but I canâ€™t think of anything after that I can see the world stopping for me at that point if it makes sense all my problems in life gone not having to worry about anything in the future, but it just makes what my father did more sense. His troubles he was done he didnâ€™t want anymore it makes sense what he did now that Iâ€™m in his position but 

I donâ€™t want to do this to my sisters and my mom they donâ€™t deserve it so why can I see myself ending it now and not having to worry about anything. Itâ€™s scary how real I can picture it happening. Iâ€™m not going to do it I donâ€™t think but why is it seem so easy now. Why have I had to think about this for 2 years but now itâ€™s so easy for me to do. I have ammo in it anyways itâ€™s for home defense but why now. Why so easy? 

Iâ€™m really at the point I donâ€™t give a fuck how my grammar sounds either. Why the fuck is this so easy now.
