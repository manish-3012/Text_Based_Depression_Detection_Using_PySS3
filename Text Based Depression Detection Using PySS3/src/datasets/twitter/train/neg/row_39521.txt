Reminder: You're still here, which means you're doing something right in my book.Life is difficult: it doesn't give much of anything freely -- of the things it does give freely, few of them are worth having.

I know life isn't fair and I'm sorry it isn't, but when you feel like you're worthless and you're doing nothing right... remember: you're still alive.

I don't care what excuse you give as to why you still being here isn't an accomplishment, I don't care what you say as to why your life isn't valuable, you're wrong.

You haven't "logged off", you haven't "quit", you're still trying even if it is by default -- and that's a win in my book.

If you need someone to talk to: PM me, or let someone on this sub know, or find a different sub that will help.

You're still here, which means you still have the potential to turn everything around and make life worth living.

I tried to kill myself at 18 and failed, rehab sucked, the meds were the worst part for me, but now at 35 I'm not only happy to be alive but I've had so many people thank me for being alive *for them*.

**You are not worthless**, and if you don't believe me: PM me, I'll be happy to debate with your self-loathing as to why you are worth something.
