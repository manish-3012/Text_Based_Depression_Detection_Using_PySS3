life has come to an endiâ€™m not myself anymore. iâ€™m either angry, sad, or tired. iâ€™ll have a happy period for a couple of hours once or twice a month. this has been going on for years. today i left my practice and just sat looking at traffic for half an hour and crying, calling my ex boyfriend to help me but hanging up. i was going to buy coke. why not, iâ€™m going to kill myself anyways. donâ€™t care what happens to me. been having mindless hook ups. nothing excites me. failing every class. i have no drive, no ambition. i want this to be over, iâ€™m so tired. what should i do. nobody knows. i ask and i ask and the only answer i get it is â€˜i do not knowâ€™. iâ€™m so unbelievably sick and tired of this. i have things i should look forward to, but i cant even see myself going through tomorrow without killing myself or doing coke to feel better. iâ€™m so tired. if anyone has advice, please. iâ€™ll take anything.
