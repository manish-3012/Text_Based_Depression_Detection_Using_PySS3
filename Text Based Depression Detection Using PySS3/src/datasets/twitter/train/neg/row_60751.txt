My friend confided in me that he wants to dieI met my friend on Reddit itself. He is a 19M and we've been talking for over a week. One time, he randomly talked about his self harm and since, then we have actively talked about his depression and his need to self harm. He also confided in me about having suicidal tendencies. But he doesn't want any help and refuses to talk to me if I suggest we even get help online. Things got really bad today. He was feeling feverish and had difficulty breathing; he's asthmatic but it could also be a COVID19 infection. I tried calling the helpline for him but I don't have his address. He threatened to never talk to me again if I try to get any help, especially to his house. I am scared for him. His parents are not at all understanding about this and his mother probably knows about his problems but has only scolded him for it. I really appreciate any advice anyone has as to what I should do.
