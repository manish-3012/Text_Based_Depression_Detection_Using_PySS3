Last resort.To start this I know my depression has taken over completely. I only fell into my depression about a year ago when 3 big part of my life broke in front of me.

I am a 19(M) and I have had the worst of years ever couldnâ€™t tell you when I was last happy until yesterday, me and my friendâ€™s decided to go camping and drinking. It was one of the best experience in my life but the second I got home it felt like a baseball bat hit me in the face, I couldnâ€™t think and I just fell into a panic attack. I went to my bedroom and I couldnâ€™t move out of my bed.

I have tried most things that doctorâ€™s have recommended but it just doesnâ€™t work. I just finished writing my suicide letter to my dad, mom, sister, all of my 4 under 10 year old siblings. I only make every thing harder for my family. Like I said this is my last resort. I donâ€™t know what to do. I am the problem and my family shouldnâ€™t have to suffer because I canâ€™t beat my depression.

Thank you for reading. If it was difficult that would be because I am dislexic.
