It's almost time. I've lost my job, my girlfriend, my friends, my debts are through the roof, I've tried really hard, I've been a good person, I've been supportive for others, always looking to help and aid with anyone and everyone in order to help them and make them feel better.  My parents are at a loss, my father lost his job, my handicap sister having a hip surgery has taken its toll on all of us. I help my sister daily as I loss my job, my parents cant pay me for the help but I am fine with this. I just want to help. I just want to offer something to others. I'm adopted, I've never known my family, I've never known what my fathers background was, I never knew my past life, I wish, But I could never find anything. I'm lost, I dont deserve this pain and I certainly feel as if I deserve to be alive, I just know their isnt a point. My smiles are tricks to everyone, my jokes and laughs are all camouflage my true feelings, my true hurt, my true pain.  

Nobody thinks or knows I feel and have these pains, nobody comes to help, nobody smiles, asks, nobody does anything. Its a society that only cares for itself. When I go, people will cry, news will cover it, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram will all explode with photos, 'memories', and saying how good of a person i was. Yet, days will past, weeks, and months, people will forget and the cycle continues.

No more tears, no more debts, sadness, pain or hurt, no more of it. Just sleep and rest. Something I feel I deserve after all these years of hard work and striving for greatness, I am tired and withered. This is it. This is the last huzzah.


"Sadness is but a wall between two gardens."
 
Khalil Gibran 

Lets go to the other garden.
