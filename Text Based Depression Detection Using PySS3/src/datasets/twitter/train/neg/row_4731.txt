Hello againYou know what, sometimes shit happens and it's always going to happen, there is no escaping it but how you deal with what happens is up to you. I know I'm probably making the wrong decision, but again, thats up to me. I've spent my life telling people to never give up on life, that it gets better and everything will be ok but I've always known, deep down that that's not how it goes and I was just lying, trying to fool myself more than anyone. This is why I have such a hard time opening up, because I'm too busy trying to fool myself, distract myself from everything and honestly, I always knew one day I would just snap and say fuck it. That day is coming closer, I can feel it and I'm so sorry. Its no one else's fault, I mean it kind of is but it's no one that would care, I don't even think they know who I am but anyways, that doesn't matter. Nothing honestly matters anymore. 

I'm sorry for even existing in the first place.
