Woman downLately Iâ€™ve fallen deeper into this uncontrollable sadness. I feel overwhelmed because I donâ€™t feel like I can catch a break. I recently took a big exam for nursing admissions and my grade only went up 10 points. I studied for 5 months and worked so hard for it. But the score falls short. I feel like such a failure. I keep finding every reason to blame myself. I was in an abusive relationships or 6 years and Iâ€™m blaming myself for allowing him to tell me I couldnâ€™t go to school. I am on SSRIâ€™s for PTSD and I blame myself for those. I keep telling myself if my head wasnâ€™t so foggy with meds maybe Iâ€™d be smart enough. I canâ€™t move away for school (due to family circumstances), so now I find myself constantly crying because I feel so empty and feel like a failure.  I donâ€™t know where to go from here. Iâ€™ve invested so much into this and now I donâ€™t feel this is possible. Iâ€™m not happy, deep down Iâ€™m not. I feel like nursing is my calling and what Iâ€™m meant to do. I feel like that was my ticket to happiness. And since I am failing at that, I donâ€™t know how to be happy. Iâ€™m drifting so incredibly far away from happiness that Iâ€™m not even sure how to function in society. All I want to do now is sleep. Stay in my bed all day. Stay away from people. Completely remove myself. Because honestly I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
