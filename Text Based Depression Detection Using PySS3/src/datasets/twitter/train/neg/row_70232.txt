Job search catch 22, and it's downfall.I graduated from university back in December, I was really stoked and had a generally good time the last three years. I went back to school after a long bout of severe depression, I was jobless then, homeless, and had no confidence or self-esteem. I got somewhat cleaned up and started meds and found a program that took a big investment in me. They accepted me as a student and an employee and I worked fucking HARD to be the best I could be and I...enjoyed it.  
  
Now I'm graduated, it's been three months and I have been trying so fucking hard to carry that momentum and enthusiasm and passion forward. I can't even get a reply to an interview...I'm sending out resumes, carefully crafted cover letters, portfolios. I've spent every bit of my last bank account trying to make the best first impressions...Following up in days or weeks with emails and phone calls and it's like falling from the mountains again.   
  
It's somewhat fucked up, I'm losing more confidence in myself everyday, that in turn makes it more impossible to find a job which feeds this cycle... I've run out of money to pay for much of anything. No more meds, no insurance, I've got one more month before it's all done. I'm not even just applying to my field but any part time job. I can't keep this up, I thought I would be okay if I left enough in my account to buy a gun if worse came to worse but it seems I can't even afford a painless suicide. I cry myself to sleep every night, look at my phone every 3 minutes hoping for some response and god knows what I would do if it were, maybe fuck it up but I need it right now... but nothing just never anything...
