My sister is in the ICU.I live 600 miles from my family. My mom called me around 5:30 this morning to give me the news. My sister was at her dorm when it happened. She's a sophomore in college. They had to intubate her. I don't really know if this is the right subreddit, but oh well.

I don't really know what to do. I'm stuck at home because of snow, and my parents can't use their phones while they're in the hospital. I'm still waiting for more news.

I've been thinking about ways to keep in touch with her. Presumably, she's going to stay at home for a little while. I want to help her, but I don't know how to approach her. We've never been very close. I was thinking about sending her a set of postcards, and I would have another set, and we could send short messages to each other, just about anything.

Knowing my parents, she'll have very little time alone. Maybe this will help.

Any advice or reading materials would be incredibly helpful.

It's strange. I always thought this would be the reverse.
