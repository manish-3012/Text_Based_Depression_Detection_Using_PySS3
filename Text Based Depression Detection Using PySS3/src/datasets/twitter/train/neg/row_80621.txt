people say suicide is a permanent answer to a temporary problem - but what if your problem is a permanent one?my family is poor that they can't afford a lot of stuff that requires money, including better education.


i want to help out my family by working on jobs that have high salary, but they usually need high academic requirements and that requires money to get in.


my grades here suck which adds to the reason why i want to study overseas. however the scholarships there are mostly for students who achieve high results in their local education. i have tried every way possible but apparently everything doesn't work out.


my family's poor financial situation is to blame, i guess. i can do nothing about my future, even though i have a concrete plan.
