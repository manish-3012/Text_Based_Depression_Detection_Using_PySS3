The time for talking is overI'm holding a box cutter to wrist, trying to work up the will power to just get it over with. I can't fucking deal with life anymore. I give my all and get nothing in return. I'm just so fucking tired and want to rest. Great now I'm crying. I'm such a weakling. I don't deserve to be alive anyways.
