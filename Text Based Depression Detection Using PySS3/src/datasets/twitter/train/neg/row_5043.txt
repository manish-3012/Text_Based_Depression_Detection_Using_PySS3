Got back at cutting now even more deeplyTitle says it, i think I'm doing this as a cry for help. I want people to talk to me, i know i shouldn't but i can't stop myself. And each time someone try's to talk to me i reply with "wanna play 8 ball ?" since i already know there gonna say the same shit the others said. But i know it won't get better. I can see it
