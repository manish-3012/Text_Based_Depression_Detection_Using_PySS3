I have reached my breaking point. I'm fed up!I'm done, I just can't take this anymore. 8 years feeling like shit every day, 2 suicide attempts a few years ago. I just want to be taken of this shitty planet, there is no reason for me to be here nor do i want to be on this shitty fucking rock full of dogshit people. I really want to try to kill myself again but I don't want to let my friends down but I just can't take living anymore, I wake up tired and go to sleep even more tired every day more and more tired, I cannot take it anymore.
