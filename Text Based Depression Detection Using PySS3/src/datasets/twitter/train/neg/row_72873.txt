Why is everyone encouraging life over death ?Honest question : What's wrong with wanting to die?
I've never understood why everyone is talking like you've chosen to be born. What is that makes wanting to die in a world full of violence , crime , dishonesty and fake people less acceptable or relatable than wanting to continue on living in the same mentioned world?
I am not trying to encourage suicidal thoughts , I am just trying to understand what makes the decision of continuing to live a desperate life "smarter/more rational" than wanting to end it
