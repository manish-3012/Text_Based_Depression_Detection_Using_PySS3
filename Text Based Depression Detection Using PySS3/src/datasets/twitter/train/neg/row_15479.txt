the one and only person i thought would stay with me, has left me now too.my life s been a tragedy for many years now but a girl came in my life 10 months ago and picked me up from the ground, just to be on the verge of suicide again after 9 months of a relationship. she told me to piss off, dont talk to her and to leave her alone and i just cant handle this anymore, im never really good enough for anyone i should just go
