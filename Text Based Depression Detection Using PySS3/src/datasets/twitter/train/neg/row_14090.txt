I wish I had the guts to do it.My mom just finished screaming at me/ranting about what mistakes I'm making as a senior and how I'm a baby for crying like I was. I'd love to see her try to not cry during a Sensory meltdown.

It's all just so pointless to me. I don't have any close friends, I'm not comfortable talking to anyone I know about anything, and I have destroyed my life so thoroughly that I'm probably never going to be able to go to college or get a job.

I don't see a reason for living. I just don't have the guts to do it myself.
