My life is sadI don't see the point in watching tv/movies, listening to music, reading books, going out or other things. I used to but I can't remember what made me stop being interested in them. I don't see the point in getting a good future if you're gonna die anyway and lose everything. I can't go out and interact with humans anymore, I always cringe after when I'm home. I'm much different than other humans. Talking to humans is always awkward to me, they make me feel awkward and I feel like covering my ears. I actually had a period when I was covering my ears eveytime I heard humans talking. It's cringy af now when I remember. I'll never get better. I know it. I'll probably die because of a brain tumor because I most likely have one. Ofcourse I have to die of a brain tumor, because I'm a pussy and I can't kill myself. I never even tried it once. I don't know what stops me. There's no hope for me anyway.
