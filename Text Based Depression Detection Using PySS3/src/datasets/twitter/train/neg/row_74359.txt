Living with PTSD and memories of 15 years of rape at the hands of my father. I can't do this anymore.This is my cry for help. I've made an appointment with my psychiatrist for next week, in therapy, on meds, I have done everything in my power to try and take care of myself and my PTSD and all the symptoms of it. I pressed charges and got justice, I've overcome so much, overcome my best friend dying, my little brother dying, having my heart broken over and over, years of rape and being held in front of a mirror and told to repeat how worthless and disgusting I was, how I would always be damaged goods and nobody would ever love me enough to stay by my side for long - but I feel like I've just hit a new low. I am feeling extremely suicidal. I don't want to die, but I just feel like my strength has run out. I called a suicide hotline at my lunch break. That helped a little, but not really. Normally I would never broadcast this on such a public forum, but I desperately need help and so I'm trying to turn to this community. Nothing is working, not my clonopin for panic attacks, nothing. All I want to do is to end this, to end the memories, night terrors, flashbacks, panic attacks, psych ward visits, and hurting everyone who loves me by constantly making them watch me cry, watch me scream, watch me writhe in pain and feel completely helpless because they don't know what to say or do. So this is my last ditch effort to try and find someone who can say something that will help, I don't know. Just please help me, someone.
