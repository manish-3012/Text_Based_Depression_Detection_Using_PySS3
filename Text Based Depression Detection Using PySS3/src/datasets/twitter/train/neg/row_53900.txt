I think I might do it right nowI'm sixteen and I just don't know. I've already been to the hospital twice this year for attempting.

I don't have anyone to talk to about this. I don't have any close friends. I don't know. I'm sobbing right now, and I don't know what to do. I settled all of my arguments, made peace with old friends. I just have to write a note and do what I must. I'm so fucking sad. I haven't been happy since I was a little kid. I battle so many mental illnesses and I feel mentally and physically tired because of it. I don't have a good relationship with my family. I don't know what would happen if I died. I'm so sad. I just want it to be over, do you understand?

Misery, tiredness, I can't stop listening to Accident Prone by Jawbreaker. "In sadding around" too, if you get me. I had a horrible childhood. My mother has never shown care for me in the way that I need it. My brother only bullies me about my mental health and previous attempts. My dad is out of my life for abusing me. I don't have any close friends anymore. I'm alone in this.

I can't stop crying. There are few people that I love, and I would stay just for them. I really wish she knew. But I don't mean half as much to them as they mean to me. And it breaks my heart. And I just hope to be happy. I hope as much as I can hope. Do you understand?

I've been saving pills for months. I just need a reason to stay. Goodnight reddit.
