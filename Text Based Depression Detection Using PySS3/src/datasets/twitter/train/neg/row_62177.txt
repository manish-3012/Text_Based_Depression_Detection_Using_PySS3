Suicidal right now?Feeling pain/ emptyness/ tired / suicidal ? Any other things?

On march 19th this year I tried to crash my car with 80mph in order to take my life. I won't talk too long about me because this post is here for you. I succeeded in crashing my car but I was and am still fully alive. Now I proceeded to find every possible way to never feel that emptyness again. Let's call it bad mental health for now. 

So how did I get a better mental health over the past months and stopped thinking about wanting to die. 

1. Working out. Do at least a little workout every day. Apparently when you physical health goes up. Your mental health goes up too. 

2. Sleeping well. Again  apparently mental health increases as physical health goes up. 

3. Drinking 8 glasses of water each day. 

4. Go less on the internet (studies have shown higher depression rates with people who spend all their time on the internet)

(After having done these basic things for a month i was able to talk and express myself better. Find ayone, anyone really to talk with. Preferably with a stable mental health.)

I wish you so much luck and wish i could let you feel how much progress i made and how much i want you to make the same progress. 

For real man. For real, i know what you feel. I felt it too. And now I don't want to kill myself everyday, i am able to think more clearly and find solutions to problems.

I will go to sleep for now. I will respond on comments tomorrow morning (8 hours from now).
