I feel so inadequate in lifeEverything Iâ€™m doing isnâ€™t for myself. I do it because I have to. I do it to survive. Because as I get older I will have no one to rely on but myself. I know I shouldnâ€™t be comparing myself to everyone but it hard not too. 

Has anyone realize COVID has made it seem like your peers are doing better than you are?

I feel that everyone is coping better. 

I try to exercise but Iâ€™m not doing it for myself 
I try to quit my porn addiction but Iâ€™m not doing it for myself either 

I just hoping on some mindless willpower to try to be better but it not for me. It just so everyone can look at me better. 
I hate that I have no passion. 

Idk what to do.
Part of me just wants to off myself because I just feel so behind in life compared to everyone else. But a lot of that stems from me so I canâ€™t blame anyone other than me. 
What to do?
