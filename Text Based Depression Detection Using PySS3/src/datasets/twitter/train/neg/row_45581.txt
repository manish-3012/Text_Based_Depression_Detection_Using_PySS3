Half the time I'm happy, the other half I want to die...what's wrong with me?I have Major Depressive Disorder and have been taking this amazing medication for a year now...i call it amazing because it doesn't make me fat like the other one i used to take, it numbs emotional pain, and makes me feel normal -- even 'very' happy. But then one day i feel like making plans to kill myself (this is one of those days)...i dont want to tell my doctor tho because he might increase my medication. Im just sick of drugs, i want to go natural. I'm a female in my late 20s if u need to know
