Want peace. Put me out of my miseryI'm tired, so tired. I have to keep going for my daughter but I can't do this anymore. I have surgery on Thursday and I hope something goes wrong. I don't want to feel anything anymore. I'm a ball of  constant anxiety and self criticism. I am torturing myself, even more by refusing to take my xanax because my ex filed custody paperwork claiming I can't take medication responsibility. After a refill, he would try to talk me into flushing my medications... The only relief to my chest pain is just another thing in my life he still has control over. Please, let me die.
