i'm just so fucking tired of everything at this pointjust another day in the shithole. worrying about the future. "it's a year away, i better prepare fast!" while at the same time feeling "it's a year away, i'll probably be dead before then. such a long time"

i'm tired, sad, scared, angry.... just about every negative emotion you could think of. want to bang my head into the wall over and over and over until i pass out and die. i wish i could be free.

&amp;nbsp;

i usually tell people on reddit that i'm not planning anything for fear of it coming back to bite me in the real world (psych wards, etc.) but fuck it, i'll be straight up. i have ideas. i have notes written out. only thing stopping me is my fear of the void and lack of means and those are two pretty flimsy fucking defenses.

seeing as i won't have my freedom for another year there's a very real chance it'll break me and i'll wind up doing it. who fucking knows at this point.
