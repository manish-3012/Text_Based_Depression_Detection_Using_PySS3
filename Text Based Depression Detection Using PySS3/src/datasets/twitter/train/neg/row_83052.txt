I miss my best friend so much... can't stop thinking about her.I'm a 14 y/o male. My parents have always made me switch schools, so saying goodbye to my friends was nothing new. But this one was different.

My parents sent me to their home country to "learn about their culture". I went to school there. I made friends, knowing I'd have to go back to America in the end.

There, I met a magnificent girl. We were so much alike, and I looked forward to seeing her everyday. I eventually fell for her.

She rejected me when I asked her out, but unlike some other girls, we actually DID stay friends afterwards. Our friendship actually grew stronger from that rejection, which made me love her all the more. She even gave me the privilege of kissing her on the cheek to say goodbye.

But the time came. The school year ended, and it was only a few days before I was leaving on a plane. She gave me a big hug, told me she'd miss me, and it felt like the world around me froze. We hugged for so long before I walked home. I can't stop thinking about her, flashing back to that hug. I know my parents want me to continue high school in America, so I may never see her again.

Every second it hurts. It's just pain and I really can't take it. I'm so tired of having to leave everyone all the time. Especially her. Sometimes I cut my arm thinking of her. Sometimes I cry. All I want is to be with her forever, but I have no contact with her and now she's gone. In all the time I've been on this planet, I've never met anyone like her, and I probably never will.

Thanks for reading. I needed somewhere to vent. Any tips on how to move on would be appreciated.
