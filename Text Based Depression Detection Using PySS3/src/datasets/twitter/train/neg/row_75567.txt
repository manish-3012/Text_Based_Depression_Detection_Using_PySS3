Life isn't neat, it's a bunch of chaosWhen things go as planned I'm just like "Well that's the way it should be" but when things don't go smoothly or as planned I get so overly disheartened. I can't live like this for the rest of my life getting depressed and frustrated over failures that happened years ago. How do I accept things the way they are? I've read so many ways to try to cope, I don't know what to do. I can't change my mindset. Nothing in life is worth it due to this. Suicidal thoughts are frequent.
