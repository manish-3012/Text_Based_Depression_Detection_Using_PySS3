Iâ€™m going to try again tomorrow nightI have some things to take care of tomorrow. I have to call my exâ€™s parole officer and tell her that heâ€™s using so that he can get some help and so that I can get the car back that I bought him so that I can authorize his friend to sell it and donate the money to charity. 

I have to close the bank account we had together so that he canâ€™t write bad checks. I donâ€™t know why my credit score will matter if Iâ€™m going to be dead. 

I also have to go see a new psychiatrist that took me a month to get into and my therapist. I already called out of work. 

If anybody likes podcasts, the hilarious world of depression is a good one. 

Other than that I got nothing. I already told my good friend that if I go, itâ€™s not his fault. Itâ€™s amazing how many people who wouldnâ€™t give you the time of day before suddenly flock to you when you say youâ€™re going to kill yourself. I wonder where they all were when I was reaching out for help for the last 3 months. Itâ€™s crazy. My dad thinks Iâ€™m just sad over some boy and doesnâ€™t think itâ€™s a big deal. Not that heâ€™s taken the time to call me in months. 

The biggest problem is that this isnâ€™t an anxiety attack. This is a calculated thought process. Iâ€™m calm. I tried to cut my wrists today but it didnâ€™t work. I guess I have bad technique or something because itâ€™s never worked very well. 

To my ex: you took everything I had. My love, money, sanity, will to live. I hope you can get better. I really do.
