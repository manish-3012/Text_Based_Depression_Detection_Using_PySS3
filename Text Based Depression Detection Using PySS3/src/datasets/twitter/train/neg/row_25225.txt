Today was my birthday, and I want to die more than everI wish I didn't have birthdays, always horrible occasions. Just a reminder that yet another year has passed and my life is still miserable. I have no friends, nobody besides my parents that cares about me. Spent the day at home feeling lonely and imagining all the things normal people do on their birthdays like go out and have fun. This pain is unbearable, and it hurts me even more to see my parents try their best to cheer me up, when I have plans to kill myself soon. I'm just done, I don't want to live another year.
