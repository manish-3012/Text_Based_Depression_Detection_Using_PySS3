Can someone be my internet therapist?I feel like I have a lot on my mind all the time, but the thought of real, in person therapy is scary. I feel like no one sees me. Like Iâ€™m invisible. Though a couple people might be sad when I do it, theyâ€™ll get over. If one thing is for sure, life goes on. People forget.
