So Fucking BoredIâ€™m bored of everything. But I donâ€™t want spend my life finding something worthwhile, Iâ€™m going to die anyways. Everyday is another internal argument on if today is *the day*. I donâ€™t hate everything but I donâ€™t really like anything. People drive me up the wall, everything in life makes me want to just end it all. I canâ€™t see any of these feelings changing or anything getting better. Iâ€™m so sick of it all. I hate to be so cliche with the sad terms but whatâ€™s the fucking point.
