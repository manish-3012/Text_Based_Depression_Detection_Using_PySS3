Brief glimmer hope that I could someday be happy, now gone.Hate where I live, also still live with parent. Never really had a super strong connection with someone. Met someone, two people actually, online. Seriously talked about moving in with one of them. Felt really good for a few months, felt like my life was headed where I wanted. Things got complicated now their is no relationship and certainly no moving in with someone. And I honestly feel like I lost the only reason I had to keep living.
Now it is Valentine's day and I'm lonely and reminded of the relationship I dont have with the person I love. Constantly think about how nice it would be to just die but generally just too chicken shit to do it. Right now I'm staring at a bottle of pills trying to figure out if I want to risk not dieing and being worse off.
