Ordered a pizza and last time I ever made any orders or talked to anybody is close to a year ago....... it felt odd...

I nervously said hi how are you... and then when I asked what i wanted I felt off.. but then I took a deep breath and started getting confortable with it...

I ordered the thing.. they asked for my adress I said it...

But then they asked for my cross street and I froze for a split second.... I said what it was but it felt odd as hell.... 

I felt like I was goimg out of body or someshit... 
Pizza will get here in 30 minutes..... it just felt odd..

Being inside a room and no contact with humans other than family really affects you... i would recommend to not do that... Im worried about buying something in the store or someshit... 

Or even getting a job.... damn..
