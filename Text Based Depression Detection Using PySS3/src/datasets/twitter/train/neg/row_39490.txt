My life expectancy is 34...I am 19 years of age, I have severe fetal alcohol syndrome and ive just found out m life expectancy is around 34-37 years of age (Doctors diagnoses) and after googling it my doctor was being generous. I still live with my parents and I cant hold down a single job, even worse the girl I love and have loved for years doesnt even really care or support me and I dont feel connected to anyone else. My family is dosgustingly superficial and care more about how they look in a traditional family sense then my life.


Feel at wits end, I dont want to necessarily kill myself but I feel like just sleeping under a bridge.

My self confidence and self esteem is 0, I feel like I cant trust anyone, I think I have borderline schizophrenia, I have this fake persona I always try to live up too and I feel like men who show their emotions are weak and girly.

I dont know what to do


I hate therapists and rehab specialists ive been to both for years and all they tell me is Bullshit.

I'm raised by my brothers and not my parents, my parents were pieces of shit and they can die. Ive had a life of garbage and to know I probably only have 17 years to get my shit together I mean what's the fucking point.

Oh jesus and the last part, the girl I like is 15 so she cant even possibly understand what I want from her
