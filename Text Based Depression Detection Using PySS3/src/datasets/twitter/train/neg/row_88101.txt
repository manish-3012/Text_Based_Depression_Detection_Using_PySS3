Intrusive thoughts, just need to vent man...Hello reddit, itâ€™s sad to think this is my first post.

Iâ€™m currently laying in bed with my girlfriend while she geeks out about cars, and Iâ€™m just here, with awful terrible intrusive thoughts. 

Itâ€™s the kind where I want to do such extreme and harmful stuff to myself, like just hurting myself with a knife Iâ€™ve got, or taking so many pills in my families medicine cabinet. Or Iâ€™ll just what to punch a wall or the floor and just scream at the top of my lungs, or really just cut up my thighs. I even fucking found this lump under my right arm, and it hurts. I know itâ€™s probably just some deep ingrown hair, but some part of me itâ€™s some awful tumor that will just put me down.

Iâ€™m not trying to be edgy here, or call for attention, Iâ€™ve just felt so hopeless recently, and Iâ€™ve just needed to vent. Iâ€™m hoping most of this is just hormones from my period, and itâ€™s just worsening my depression.  I havenâ€™t been proud with what Iâ€™ve done, and I hate the awful coping mechanisms I have. 

I wanted to see if anyone here has dealt with the same things, or if anyone could provide any advice ? I am an artist who tries to draw frequently to help cope, but it feels like this plague of a mental illness or affecting my love for art....
