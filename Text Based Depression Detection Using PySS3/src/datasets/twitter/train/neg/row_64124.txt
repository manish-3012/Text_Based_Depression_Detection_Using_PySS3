I have anxiety about killing myselfThe only reason I haven't killed myself is because I don't want to inconvenience the people who would have to deal with me. No matter how I go someone will have to deal with a corpse, but if I crash my car, I either hurt someone else in the process, or I destroy someone else's property, and my car is a company vehicle owned by my family so that'll hurt them too. Jumping in front of a car or off a bridge present the same problems. I have feared medication because I think the anxiety would be fixed before the depression and suicidal thoughts and I'll finally act on it.
