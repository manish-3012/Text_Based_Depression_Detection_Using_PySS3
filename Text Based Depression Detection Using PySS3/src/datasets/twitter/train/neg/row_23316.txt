My mom just attacked me and left me 500 miles from home.I'm at my sister's house. My mom brought me here. My mom and dad are divorcing. She is going insane, I think it's the medication she is on and general mental health. She said that she wanted to kill me in 2016. She's been better and worse and better and worse. She's an alcoholic. Hadn't drank in over a year. Started drinking again four days ago when I let her know I was confused because dad had a girlfriend. My fault, should die. She threw something at me when my boyfriend was over, that's a line that doesn't get crossed. She can attack me sometimes I deserve it. But not in front of him. Then we came down here. She has been horrible. totally unloving and thankful to my giving sister. She just hit me and spilled water on me and said I am on my own from now on. She left me here.
