I'm fucking pathetic and worthless.Let me start by saying that after 200,000 years of human evolution I am a disappointment at best. I really do need to help out natural selection and just kill myself. I have tried, and failed or backed out. Wow, I guess that just makes me even more of a coward , I don't even deserve pity. I don't get why people say life is worth it and all of that bullshit. Take a look at the world we live in. It is harsh and unforgiving and the people in it don't care about anyone but themselves. I have been told for years that I'm smart,  that my intelligence is above average but what good does that do when I just so happened to get depression and anxiety along with it. I can barely talk to someone without my heart rate skyrocketing. I had friends, I also had a girlfriend. Notice the past tense. We were a tight knit group, they were the 4 people i could talk to like a normal fucking human being. Well miraculously I started dating her. She was perfect. In every way,  shape, and form. She had no business being with someone as terrible as me. But she realized that, she left me the night after I tried to kill myself. I got talked out of it, big mistake on my part. Now she can't even stand to talk to me and the rest of the group followed suit. I  no longer have any friends. No one gives a shit about whether I live or die. I am a worthless, lazy, piece of shit. That wonderful quote brought to you by everyone I know and even both of my parents! Why. Why can't I do it. People say it will get better, people also lie. I don't believe for a second that I will ever enjoy life. Why wait 60 years and be a burden to everyone for every single second when I can spare myself and them a whole bunch of unnecessary pain.  

Right now, where i live it is 11:50 pm and if all goes well I will be dead by morning.
