I don't have the courage to call a hotline.I just don't have the power to search for the number to call them.
I am too afraid of what I should say.
I don't want to talk with anybody, don't want anybody to hear my useless voice.
I don't want to do this to my friends-not taking the last option.
But it's too much for me.
I will just jump down here.
