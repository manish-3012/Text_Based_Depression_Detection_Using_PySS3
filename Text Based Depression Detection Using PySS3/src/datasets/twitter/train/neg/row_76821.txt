I tried to open up about my suicidal thoughts but no one seems to really careIâ€™m 29 with preexisting  mental health issues. I lost my job, my car, and my house all in the last few months. I lost my job to Covid (substitute teacher) my car to a bad transmission which I canâ€™t afford to fix, and my roommate wanted me out so her boyfriend could move in. I said yes to the latter because I canâ€™t even stand up for myself anymore. I canâ€™t afford rent on my own. 

I told my boyfriend of 1yr that Iâ€™ve had mental health problems and that I think I need to seek help (Iâ€™m not ready to tell him I have a plan for suicide). His response was that I didnâ€™t need therapy, I just needed to get a job. Like a job is suddenly going to make me interested in life again. The only problem being that Ive been applying to jobs everyday and havenâ€™t been able to get a call back, and the only jobs available now are as cashiers at hardware stores, and as a teacher with two degrees and no interest in DIY, I really donâ€™t see that being the cure all to changing my outlook on life. No hate to retail workers at all, I just know that after working as hard as I have to be where I was a few months ago, it would feel like a massive step back. 

My anxiety is so bad, I have a hard time talking to people now and will instantly cry and start trembling when Iâ€™m in an uncomfortable situation, even talking to insurance over the phone will cause me to have severe panic attacks. This doesnâ€™t exactly make me a great candidate for customer service or retail and it makes me a burden to everyone around me. 

My boyfriend backed out of living with me, saying there wasnâ€™t enough room for me at his house anymore, so I had to move in with my parents. I donâ€™t have a good relationship with my dad.  I told them Iâ€™ve never been happy because of all the domestic violence Iâ€™ve had to witness growing up, the unfair pressure I felt from my dad all my life, and my overall situation right now, and that for over a decade now Iâ€™ve wanted to end my life, but never had the guts to do it. Now Iâ€™m more afraid and anxious as ever, because the thoughts are so intrusive, theyâ€™re constant, and I even have a plan in place to do it.  I think about it all the time. When to do it, who will find me, what Iâ€™d need to carry out the deed. Theyâ€™re response was that Iâ€™m acting like a 12 year old and living with me is a nightmare. Iâ€™ve only been here for two days, and I spent most of it in my room, not bothering anyone except maybe you could hear me crying if you had your ear to the door. 

I canâ€™t help but feel like a giant nuisance to everyone and nobody really seems to care or think that Iâ€™m serious. I feel like Iâ€™m a joke.
