Really needing some kind of supportI know everyoneâ€™s feeling this but i am just so unbelievably alone. Iâ€™m stuck in my dark feeling and canâ€™t escape. Iâ€™m the type of person who has to be hanging out with someone and doing something to keep me busy 24/7 as a distraction from my depression. Obviously I canâ€™t do that right now. I havenâ€™t taken my medicine in weeks. I havenâ€™t seen my friends in forever. I canâ€™t sleep. Iâ€™ve tried all of those ~self care~ things and they only work temporarily. Iâ€™m stuck feeling like this forever and I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold on. I want to go back to my old habits- self harm, drinking, smoking literally any of those things that help distract me but I have no way of doing the last 2 currently, and Iâ€™ve been clean from self harm for so long that I really donâ€™t want to go back down that path again because once I start I wonâ€™t be able to stop. I wish i could talk to my friends or family about this but they wouldnâ€™t understand and donâ€™t take me seriously. This sucks and I never thought that I would really be thinking about cutting my life so short especially being only 18. Iâ€™d love any words of encouragement or support. Thank you.
