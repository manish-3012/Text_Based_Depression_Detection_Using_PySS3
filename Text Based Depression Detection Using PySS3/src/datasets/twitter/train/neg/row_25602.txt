ALone and want to dieI am going nowhere in life and I don't want to go. I tried so hard to make friends on discord, tumblr and subreddit. But no one cares enough to get to know me. I am alone. I think I want to die because I am tried of living, begging people to talk to me, and trying hard to keep them. I am so fed up with things u have to do in life, get and keep a job, and all that other crap. I hate my life, but can't change, everytime I try, I fail. Wish I could die. I want so bad to hang myself but i can't do it.
