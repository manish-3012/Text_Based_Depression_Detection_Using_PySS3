I think everybody would be better off without me.I'm worthless. My family rejects me. Nobody will hire me. I'm up to my ears in debt and most of that is probably going to be passed on to my parents who were kind enough to cosign. I shouldn't have even let them do that knowing what I know now. I've just thrown my life away at every opportunity and I don't know why. What I've done is worse than killing myself at this point.

Why shouldn't I end it all? I don't even think I have the guts to commit suicide. And knowing my track record in life, I'd fail at it and just make my life worse -- if that's even possible. What the fuck is wrong with me? Why can't I accept responsibility for my actions? How do I go on with my life knowing I have done nothing good for my family, for society, or for myself? 

I'm such a wreck that I can't even go out in public any more. I feel like everybody can see right through me. Every lie, every fault, every misdeed I've committed can be seen just by looking at me. And I just want to disappear.

This probably looks like jibberish to anybody reading this, trying to figure out what's so wrong with me that I feel this way. I don't even know why I'm posting here. It might be the hope that one sentence from a kind stranger will pull me out of this downward spiral. It might be that I just wanted to get these feelings out before I attempt to die. Things might not be as bad as I make them out to be, but I doubt it. 

Whatever happens, thanks for taking the time to hear my soft cry before I extinguish the flame of life. May those I loved live better lives than I have.
