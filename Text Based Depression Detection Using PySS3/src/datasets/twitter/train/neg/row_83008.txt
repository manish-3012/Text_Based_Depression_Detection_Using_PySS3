I want to hang myself from my door knob. How do I do it? Please. I am literally begging you how do I end my life? I dont want to suffer anymore. No one loves me and I am just freaking done. I'm done done done done done!! No attempt I have ever made has worked and I want one that will! Physical suffering is a thing but what about psychological?! Someone help me please because I have spent the last five hours crying on my floor and I am just done!!!!
