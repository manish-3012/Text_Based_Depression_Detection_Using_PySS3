Should I get Baker Acted? What's it like?I'm reaching really bad places. I'm so sad. I've even decided roughly a time to do it. About 15 months from now. But there's still a rational part of me that is looking for help. I want to get away from the world. That would be so nice. I've been considering going to hospital, but I don't know if that will help. Is anyone willing to share an experience as to how it was like? Do you think it will help? 

Also, this is sort of weird, but one of the main reasons I don't want to go to the hospital is because I have this weird fantasy where I imagine myself being terminally ill and being in the hospital with people I care about visiting. For the first time in their lives they are going out of their way for me, they are crying for me, they don't want me to die. I actually feel like they want me. But I'm scared that once I go to the hospital, that fantasy will be shattered because I know for a fact that no one will visit me. Are you even allowed to be visited during a situation like this? It would be so heart wrenching to know that no one will care, because I will interpret that as a confirmation of me being unwanted and not cared for.

Also, do you think it will be expensive? I have really crappy insurance. I don't even know if my family can afford it.

Sorry for poor formatting. I can't think straight right now.
