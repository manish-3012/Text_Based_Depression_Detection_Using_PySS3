Alice in WonderlandI was going to kill myself last night, honest to God. I was ready. Note was written. Blade at the ready. I was done. So, before I finished myself off, I decided to give the Suicide hotline a try. When I got to the website, I discovered that there was a chat online option. It was almost 3am at the time, so obviously I went with that option. 

I waited a while, in virtual line, until they connected to me to a random counselor. Alice. We talked for 3 and a half hours. It was the best conversation I had in a very long time. No one, and I mean no one, could have stopped me last night or changed my mind. It was all but set in stone, for me. But our connection, our topics of conversation, it was unlike any before. I was making her laugh, joking around, she was making me smile and laugh, we just had a really solid connection off the bat. 

I do have abandonment/attachment issues, so for me, a 3 and half hour conversation, that went THAT well, surely means there will at least be more? Right? Well, unfortunately, I'm 100% sure there are rules that you can't swap numbers while on a Suicide Chatline, lol. 
So I'm hoping beyond hope to find Alice in Wonderland here. Or in some other fourm. I'll be cross posting this to wide my search. 

For everyone else, hang in there, you were given this impossible situation/burden/issue/emotion, because the world/universe/God/Allah/whatever, knows you have the strength to beat it and overcome it. So do it. If I can sit here and write out this paragraph for all of you, after my near suicide last night, then so can you beat it and win this fight. 

For Alice, the category is food. I'll start since you started last night. A- Avocado, because apples is too basic, lol.
