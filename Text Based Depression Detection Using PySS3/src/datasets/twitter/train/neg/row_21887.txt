I'm so fed up.I hate this 24/7 agony of hating who I am. I'll never be comfortable in my own skin as long as I am alive.  This is why I need to die. I need to not be stressed or in a constant state of anxiety for just 1 minute.  
  
But that is impossible.  
  
I just want to be happy. Why is it that this is just not meant to be? Why do you get to be happy and not me?  
  
As soon as I can get off my lazy ass and find another job, my first purchase will be a gun. If I weren't such a pussy bitch I'd use it to take others with me to hell.  
  
Fuck you all.
