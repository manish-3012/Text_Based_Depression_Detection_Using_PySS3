I wrote a post here a month ago.But then i deleted it. Idk why tho. But i have just decided, that iâ€™ll not go further than the age of 20. And iâ€™m turning 20 in August, so i just have a year and few months. Thereâ€™s a v low probability that iâ€™ll something to live for and if it gets worse before that deadline, iâ€™ll do it then. Just wanted to tell this to someone, and i cant tell anyone irl cause you know theyâ€™ll try to stop me and all. Thanks.
