If I dont become prettier by summer's end I'm killing myselfIt's the only thing I think about day in and day out. I'm sick and tired of having acne and having small boobs. I'm fuxking sick of it. I've been dealing with this stupid shit since I was fuxking 10. Why can't I just look normal. I'm so fucking sick and tired of trying to be decisional about why people dont fucking like me. I tried to convince myself it was because of me being quiet but that's not it. No one fucking talks to me because of the giant patches I'd hyperpigmentation on my fucking face. Or the ugly ass cysts on my skin. I'm tired of it. I'm so fucking sick and tired of this shit. I'm fucking tired of not being fucking pretty. Guck this shit. If I'm not pretty by summers end, I'm killing myself. I dont want to walk around looking like this anymore. It's absolutely fucking humiliating to be seen looking like this. I just want to come back to school August and finally be treated like a fucking human being. Is that too hard to ask? I'm ordering my noose tonight. Fuck this shit.
