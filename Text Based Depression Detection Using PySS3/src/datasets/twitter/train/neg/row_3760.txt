my suicide noteI'm sitting here, on a night almost like any other, feeling utterly defeated and disappointed in myself. I can't quite comprehend why I'm so self-destructive, nor can I understand why I'm so unappreciative of the wonderful life I had been given. I'm aware that there's nobody to blame for the way I've been feeling these past few years except for myself. This guilt is stacked so heavily on my chest, like a pile of bricks dragging me down every day- being such a burden or even a plague to my life that I just want to succumb under the weight of it all. I'll never be able to explain the feelings of loneliness and isolation that I felt on a day to day basis. There's absolutely no way I'd be able to tell my mother, someone who breathed life into me and nurtured me with all the love she's had to give, that her baby doesn't want to be alive anymore. It's easy to comprehend that I'm not alone, in terms of others feeling the exact same way as I am feeling at this very moment, but it's difficult to find even a hint of solace in knowing that. I would NEVER wish these feelings upon anyone. I thought I could be saved- as if my problems would just magically disappear as soon as I reached out for help, but that obviously wasn't the case. I wish everyone the best. In their schooling, their careers, with their health, their successes, and their friends/family. This is simply too much for me to handle and I am not strong enough to carry on. After 16 years, I believe I finally realized that it's nearly impossible to truly feel joy whilst battling the worst, most relentless demons in my head. I'm sorry for not being the friend you wanted me to be, the daughter you wanted me to be, the student, the niece, the cousin, the person, I'm sorry. I hope these final words will shed some light of my mindset in my final moments of life. I'm so sorry. I truly love you so much. - K.L. (01/16/18 1:38 AM)
