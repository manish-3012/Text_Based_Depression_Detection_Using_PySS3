i make a lot of paper cranes at work n wonder if anyone will see them n think of me after im gonei wonder if anyone keeps ny little paper cranes. pretty much every station at our McDonald's has some. i make them when were dead and to keep my mind away from dark things. sometimes ill make special ones n give them to my friends at work. i wonder if anyone keeps them? i wonder if i killed myself if they would see them n think of me? maybe after im gone theyll find one back behind a shelf or something n think about me. i know everyone there knows how much i appreciate them n how much theyve helped me. i dokt want it to be a saf thing really. maybe like a little hapoy thing. after im gone theyll see a paper crane n think of it as a little happy sign from me.
