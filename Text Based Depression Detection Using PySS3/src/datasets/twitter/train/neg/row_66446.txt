Good evening...You may call me Prometheus. At least, that's who I want to be remembered as. 

For as long as I can remember, I've been a victim of depression. At the age of thirteen, my mother found out after using my computer and seeing that I searched "What is the least painful way to commit suicide?". I saw her find it, and locked myself into the bathroom. I didn't want her to yell at me. She tried opening the door, couldn't, and yelled at me to unlock the door. I did, and when she saw me on the floor, crying, she hugged me. "Everything will be okay...", she told me. Mind you, this was only a week after my grandmother passed away.

I believed the lie my mother told me.

I got "help".

I was put on meds.

And, in a few days, I'm going to kill my self by overdosing on my meds. If that doesn't work, I'll use my belt as a noose.

I don't want anyone to stop me. I just wanted people to know WHY I killed my self.

Goodbye...

-Prometheus
