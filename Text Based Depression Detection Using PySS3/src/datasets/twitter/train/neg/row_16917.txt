WhyI have two sisters older than me, one by 1 year and the other by 4 years, ever since I can remember, I have always been the subject to laugh about every single day, man I remember those days I would ignore it and just move on but doing that made me built anger over time, note that this has gone for as long as I can remember, and at some point I just lost it and snapped like crazy, but still it continued, it got to the point that due to so much pain I just stopped caring for them, I stopped loving my parents ever since I was a child, I was pretty stubborn back then, and due to me not actually taking word of what was being said I ended up stubborn today, but what really hurted the most was that laugh after saying hey remember the time Franklin did this, man I fucking hated those moments to the core of my very being, so ever since I can remember Iâ€™ve been suffering from depression without even knowing, I remember one day at school I told the lunch lady I was suffering from depression and she laughed at me and said na you too young to go through that. The laughter continued for years until I left the country for a better life in the US, and moved to Florida which is completely different from where I used to live, down in my hometown everything is poor, you see trash everywhere and nothing major happened that I became aware of there so I was pretty naive, immature and childish, I wasnâ€™t ready for what happened next. 
The moment I arrived I had family waiting so the transition was smooth and was enrolled in middle school, me being a no drug person, I was pretty close minded about it and went on rant about it without even knowing what it really anyways, the first day I went to middle school the bus was late by 2 hours and I was very nervous, then I felt reassured when there were a lot of people who talked Spanish, and made temporary friends, and then I got to school and I was so damn late, before knocking on the door I thought damn Iâ€™m in another country with people I donâ€™t even know this is going to be bad and got even more nervous than before, so I knocked and the teacher went on a little rant then she gave me the books and went on to take a seat, and due to me being the only Mexican in every of my classes I pretty much was alone except in Spanish class and other 2 in which I made a few close friends and some other friends too but apart from that every other class  I was alone with Americans, which referred to Spanish speaking people to refs, which is pretty much a word to look down on people due to their race and insulting too, so I didnâ€™t messed with anybody except for some girls, and then one day in my math class there was a girl that asked help (ever since I was a child I have been doing math and math on my head so I was pretty good at it) so the teacher told me to help her, I used to sit at the last sit to the left, and she used to seat the last sit to the right, I stood up and went towards her and she noticed me since the teacher said aye Franklin go help Jennifer, the moment I was one desk away from her, she says ooh I love your grey pants, which I hated, so from that moment onwards I fell for her, she was so beautiful, and she resembled perona from one piece which at one point was in love with her, it was not her looks only there was something else, I fell in love with her after some time, but out of nowhere she was gone, so I felt like shit and then a friend of mine shows me her Ig of her in her new school already with a boyfriend, that killed me, I was really down so much that I remember crying for her at lunch in front of a bunch of people, but I didnâ€™t gave a fuck because she was gone and with someone else, the days passed and I was still sad but I moved on and caught interest of her friend but it didnâ€™t work out at all, then there was one girl that was also her friend, we started talking on ig, and she used to wear glasses and I thereâ€™s something about women with glasses that I love, so I was intrigued by her, and she kept posting pictures with captions like I think Iâ€™m in love with you and the sort so I asked her to be my girlfriend and she agreed until some days after she broke up with me and broke me even more than before because it was real between me and her, later she told me it was her parents that forced her to do that and that there was still something but at that point I was already in another place and in high school, middle school was full of pain due to girls and then high school.
The difference between middle school and high school is than in high school Spanish speaking people dominated the school ( as in the majority, even amongst workers) and I enrolled into soccer which had been the way I dealt with stress pain and depression back in Mexico, and it was awesome, I was a freshman that was alone until I entered to soccer team, I finally made true friends I could count on care and support and life was pretty good, I felt alive and tired at the same time due to the long runs at trainings, then season started and it was dope, I could leave in the middle of class to go to another school on a lively bus and play matches, When the season was over I scored a total of 5 goals so I was feeling really good about my self since in Mexico, the only season I finished there, I only scored 1 so I was happy at the progress. One day my friend told me aye skip to PE with us to play soccer and I agreed and skipped, (2nd time skipping ) that was a really bad decision because once you start skipping, it is very difficult not to skip again, so I did many more times. Then one day I see someone close with a pipe then he notices me and quickly puts the pipe away, and I go, what are you doing???? He answers, you wanna smoke some weed? At that point I didnâ€™t know anything about weed, due to him being close I forgot about me being no drug and went on to smoke and it didnâ€™t hit, it was a placebo effect of me thinking Iâ€™m high, then one night I go out with some friends and one rolls a blunt and sparks it, when itâ€™s my turn I hit it for some seconds and then another time and passed it, that was enough, BOOOM!BOOOM! My heart pounced then my friends got into a fight so my homie and me go out in the middle of a highway and run through both lanes to where people where hanging, then my homie picks us up and we go to a big possessed hospital up to the roof, man the view was magnificent all the lights trees buildings, quite a view. Then in the back of my head I decided Iâ€™m going to experiment and see how higher I can get, and next thing I know Valentineâ€™s Day happens and my girl received something from a boy so I flipped out and was stubborn on being mad so I disrespected the one teacher you do not disrespect (that I knew of) and was sent to the one in charge of all teachers of ESL, and I was a dick to her and I got an attitude, then next day my coach talked with me and I wasnâ€™t sorry so I just said that straight up and then the coach said something like oh you dismissed yourself (as in no longer part of the team) so I decided not to think about it and got high instead, without realizing it, that was the reason I fell, some days after my friends meet Molly-drug-, then I meet her due to me having nothing to lose. I used to take one then not being able to sleep until the next day, but that next day at night before sleeping, took another one, for a total of 3 days without sleep, then sparked a blunt, that is really bad, donâ€™t do it or fear the long lasting consequences- no joke- at first it was cool because I looked at the moon and there was a stair and then a stick figure climbing it so I thought it was okay, the night happened and finally I was about to get some sleep when I noticed if I focus I can make music with my brain, so I focused and played a song -drip- then I stopped like what, then continued on with the song -drip drip- wait is that the song, damn am I getting paranoid or is my health deteriorating when I play that song, also a lot of crazy visuals due to being in the hypnagogic state, ( I claim that because after not sleeping for so long, you actually see colors like yellow and blue like sponges that increase in size and decrease too and make weird motions as if youâ€™re tripping although itâ€™s a natural process that every human being goes through, only heightened due to lack of sleep and use of drugs) and fell asleep, then one day the worst happened, I bought a cap of mdma and I put it on my mouth, after it dissolving a little I chews it. I fucking chewed that disgusting ass artificial poison all due to me trying to feel more high with less, dumb idea, I ended up fucking up my tooth, throughout the night I would clench my jaw so hard I could hear CRACK!!! Multiple times, ( ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜« chipping away little pieces of tooth with each crack, so I got some gum, but still CRACK!!!! There goes another piece) I was living in a nightmare, until it wore off and re-dosed  for a total of 3 in one day... then I notice itâ€™s 4 am and we are at a beach ready to go smoke a ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥blunt and before reaching the lifeguard post, I see a guy and a car then I see it get closer and closer until it passes through me, I was high of my damn mind, I remember being shot and having a panoramic view of my body although it was either a daydream or an actually dream, but it happened that day I believe, then an hour after we leave the beach, I get home and got to my bed and layed down, I saw weird visuals and felt as if my heart could stop beating at any moment and the music was there too, drip drip drip drip, Iâ€™m like what the fuck is happening inside my head, so fearful that my heart would stop beating I moved next to my sister and layer down, drip drip drip, I see her flinch once, drip drip, she flinches yet again, then I knew I wasnâ€™t tripping and it was real, that made me change my perspective and personality unconsciously, I would claim Iâ€™m not fucking crazy then do some crazy ass shit later. I realized that due to me chasing the side effects of mdma got instead the long lasting effects... after that happened I lost faith in all humanity in other words I stopped believing in people and shut myself from others while at the same time being violent to whoever attacked me, nowadays if I knew how shitty my life would be after that night I would had lost all hope and let my heart stop beating due to me giving up, I donâ€™t know I have talked a lot about some of the things that trouble me still I still feel the other world to be a better place for me, not this place, man sometimes I just want to sleep and never wake up again
