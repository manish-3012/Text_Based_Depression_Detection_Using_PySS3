Something to look forward toTruly find comfort that all this pain will be gone in the end. That nothing will matter because i simply will not exist. I donâ€™t have to worry about others will think because i will be gone and it wonâ€™t be my problem anymore. 

Plus fuck them all anyways they didnâ€™t care enough when i was here so why would they care when Iâ€™m gone. 

Regardless the only thing that makes me feel â€œokayâ€ when I am sad is i wonâ€™t feel anything in the end.
