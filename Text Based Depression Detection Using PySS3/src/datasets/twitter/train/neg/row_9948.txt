I want to end it all, I'm thinking about doing it on my trip, but I'm going to try and endureI want to kill myself, not to die, to kill myself. I have a financially well off family. My cousins and old friend have shown me a kindness I don't understand. But internally, I have to be able to love myself. I'm a failure. I'm 23. Everyone I know has a better career lined up than me. I can't find a boyfriend and hold the relationship. There are some non-life threatening stuff. My writing makes almost nothing. I worry that I will fail my barber and that will be my last chance. I can't do it. I'm going to go to therapy and call hotlines, but I just feel like it's time to go. 

I'm looking forward to visiting a friend of mine who (it seems) will be working in our home region in June. On the last night I'm there, if the trip works out, I really think I might silently leave his place and go slit my wrists somewhere the cops can find me. I live in the PNW now. I'm going to try and get through the trip, (If it works out). I just think that I should kill myself in home region, but I want that trip to be disconnected from my death. I hate this feeling.
