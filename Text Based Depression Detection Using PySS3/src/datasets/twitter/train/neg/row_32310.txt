titleIâ€™m pathetic 
I donâ€™t even have a reason to be sad and every single day hurts and Its becoming harder and harder to find a reason to keep living. Iâ€™ve been like this for 5 or 6 months but Iâ€™ve only gotten worse and lost more friends
Iâ€™ve been cutting a lot and I have no one I am comfortable talking to. I canâ€™t get a therapist or treatment. Maybe Iâ€™ll kill myself maybe I wonâ€™t but I just need to vent somewhere I guess. So anyways how is everyone else feeling
