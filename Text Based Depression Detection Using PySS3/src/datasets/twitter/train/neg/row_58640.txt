I'm bipolar and want to just end everythingI have bipolar II, am on 5 medications and might have to add a sixth. Life is hard and I struggle with mental illness every day. I am turning twenty-two next month and I am a junior studying psychology with a TESOL minor. I'm sitting here waiting for my boyfriend to finish his class and I feel so empty and alone. I don't want to burden anyone anymore. I was in a psych ward twice at the end of 2015. I feel like this will never get easier. Last night my boyfriend cried and held me because my only reason for not killing myself is because I am too afraid to die. He told me that shouldn't be my only reason.

But it is. And now that is even starting to go away. Yesterday was my boyfriend's twenty-first birthday, we celebrated and I got him a ton of stuff. Tonight we're going to a bar for his first time. I should be happy and excited but all I want to do is cry and sleep.

I'm having chronic nightmares. I wake up in the middle of the night from one, then I go back to sleep, and have another one. I haven't slept well in more than a week.

It is really affecting my boyfriend and that makes me want to kill myself even more- so he doesn't have to worry about me ever again. 

I don't know what I'm looking for, a pity party? Advice? Help?? I'm debating calling the suicide helpline. My mental illness affects everyone I know, and I'm at a breaking point.
