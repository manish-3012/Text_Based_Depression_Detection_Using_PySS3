The truthRecently I told two of my friends that when we turn 18 I would take them to New York so we can life our lives in the same state, but what they donâ€™t know is Iâ€™ve recently been thinking about committing suicide before 18. I wanna be there for my friends but I donâ€™t wanna be alive anymore and Iâ€™m scared of what I might do. Please help
