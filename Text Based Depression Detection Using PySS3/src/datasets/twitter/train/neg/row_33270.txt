Been thinking about suicide last few days...Been trying to distract myself from my loneliness for over 5 years, always convincing myself that things will get better and my chances of finding a friend will improve.

Slowly added little things in my life to be responsible for that put me out in society and hopefully amongst people that I might get along with.

Was tough to do that because social settings are usually very awkward and unpleasant for me, I like to avoid crowds.

I can't quite believe that I will actually commit suicide at this point, there's too many people that it could really let down and I can't see it as a real solution. But it doesn't stop me from constantly thinking about it atm.

Are there any good coping mechanisms for this sort of thing that you guys use that has worked?
