Life is lonely and itâ€™s becoming unbearable.I did not ask to be born with a hand deformity but here I am &amp; everyone is freaked out by me. It doesnâ€™t help having family members who poke fun at you too. I canâ€™t stop fantasizing about jumping in front of a train, stabbing myself or picking a fight with someone so theyâ€™ll seriously injure me.
