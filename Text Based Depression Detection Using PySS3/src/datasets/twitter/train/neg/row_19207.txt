Getting closer to the date I set.I donâ€™t cry about it anymore, Iâ€™ve become desensitized. I donâ€™t even feel sentimental anymore or sad for anyone I leave behind. Iâ€™ve just become numb to everything. Which is strange because normally everything triggers an intense emotional reaction from me.

I canâ€™t wait for this nightmare to be over.
