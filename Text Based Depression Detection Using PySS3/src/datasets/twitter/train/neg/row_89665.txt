Why should I bother going on?I'm only 17 but I already know that I will never have any kind of meaningful connection with another person that isn't over the internet. I've accepted that my social anxiety has full control over my life. It's stopped me from learning how to drive, going outside, making friends, having relationships, and it made me quit school. As for my depression, medicine hasn't helped, therapy hasn't helped, I've done daily exercise and meditation for almost a year now, and there's been no change in how I feel. I've tried everything. On top of that I can never not feel exhaustion for some reason, no matter how much I sleep. It's like the world just wants me to die. I can't go on like this. I'm an embarrassment.
