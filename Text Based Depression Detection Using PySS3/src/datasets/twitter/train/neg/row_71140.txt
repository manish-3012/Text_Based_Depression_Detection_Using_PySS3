How can I not get attached to people?i have a problem, I get very attached to people. Sadly the hard truth is about 80% of the time things with people donâ€™t go as planned. Iâ€™ve accepted that but wish it wasnâ€™t reality. My dad told me never let yourself get attached to anyone, Iâ€™ve tried not to but sometimes I canâ€™t fucking help it. This does not help my suicidal thoughts at all. What should I do? Iâ€™m currently very attached to someone and just the thought of them leaving my life makes me wanna cry or kill myself. Obviously this isnâ€™t what I want.
