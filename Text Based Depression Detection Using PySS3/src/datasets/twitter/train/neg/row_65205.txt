Did I do the right thing for my suicidal friend?We've been arguing back and forth over her mental health and planned suicide at 25. I told her this: If she doesn't talk to her mom (or anyone) about this and try to get help, then I'll tell her mom. She told me it's an insane violation of privacy (duh) and that she wouldn't be friends with me after that and I said that's fine.

Since then I pulled back even though I feel like that was an okay move. The ultimatum is now this: if you don't talk to your mom or someone, I won't be friends with you. My reasoning is I won't stand by while she plans her suicide within the next decade. We're best friends for context btw.
