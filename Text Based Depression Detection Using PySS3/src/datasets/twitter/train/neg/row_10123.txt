Titles are dumbI think to every time I've tried to do something in the past year and I can't find any action that hasn't caused me or someone else pain. I don't know why I'd stay alive while I can't do without harm. I get mad tthat people want me alive, I just think it's dumb and they are objectively wrong. If someone could prove me wrong I'd be happy but I am not receptive. 

I can't depend on my ideas not to hurt people anymore, and that's all I have anymore. I need to be decommissioned. I want to piss off someone who would murder me so I can just not be responsible. I can't be responsible for this anymore.
