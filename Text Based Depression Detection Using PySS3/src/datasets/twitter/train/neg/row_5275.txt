The desert of the real.If I donâ€™t kill myself first, cigarettes shall be my death. I like smoking far more than I should. Iâ€™ll be up to a pack a day in no time. Oh well. I like the nicotine.

I am so fucking lonely. Most of my so called friends donâ€™t bother to even check up on me or contact me at all anymore, and only interact with me when they are forced to. My messages go ignored, snapchats read but not replied to, text messages ignored. No one can see the sadness in my eyes. The hollowness. The complete lack of light. Today isnâ€™t a good day. Music isnâ€™t helping. I canâ€™t get interested in a book, even books I know I would love or do love. Video games can't hold my attention. I can't get into a movie. I just want to hang out with someone that can see how much Iâ€™m hurting and make it go away. Someone that can see that i'm not okay. 

The world isnâ€™t against me, the world is out for itself.
