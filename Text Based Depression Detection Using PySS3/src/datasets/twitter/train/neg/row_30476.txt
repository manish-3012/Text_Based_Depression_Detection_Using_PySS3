Suicide rates higher among whites - why?Hello, Reddit!

I stumbled upon this statistic recently: https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/. If you look at the chart, whites are the consistently most common race for suicide.

I deal with kids with problems in my job every day, but it never got my attention since I live in a white country.

It really got me to think about why it's the case. Any ideas?
