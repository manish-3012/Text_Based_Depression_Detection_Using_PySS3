I just want to get sumthing off my chestDepression is a life sentence, once it enters your system the only way for it to leave is to shut down the system, medication might help you not feel depressed but that is because you're not feeling anything anymore. I don't look down at those who have ended their lives, if their pain was so unbearable that death was a better alternative.

To help prevent the people that care about me developing depression themselves I choose to abuse my organs with alcohol, drugs and smokes, they can't blame themselves for my organs failing. it also gives me time to ponder, the problem with hanging/shooting/cutting yourself or simply jumping off a tall building is that it gives you no chance to reflect and weigh your actions or even change.

If theirs nothing after death no time, no darkness then theirs no depression but at this point, hell would be eternal life
