Not scared of death, but failing to dieMy dad keeps his guns too high for me to reach, and usually he takes it with him and is never home. So I really donâ€™t have access to a firearm. So, my method of choice is going to be partial suspension hanging. I have the noose already tied and hanging on my doorknob, the knot hiding in a bag hanging on the door. I plan to pull the rope over the door and hang myself on the other side. 

Iâ€™m scared of failure. Iâ€™ll do it at night so no one thinks to come in, and lock my door. Iâ€™ll probably even steal the spare key so no one can get in, but that might raise suspicion and make them even more inclined to get in. What if, during my convulsions, I bang my head against the door and someone hears and tries to save me, leaving me completely dependent on them for the rest of my worthless life?
