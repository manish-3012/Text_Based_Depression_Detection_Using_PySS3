Parrents want to make me kill my self Okay, I hate my life. My dad hates me and calls me a failure because of my bad grades. 78 in Spanish 2 88 in math 2 honors 85 in ap comp science principles 96 in English two honors. My parents are never happy with my grades. They say they are terrible and only want me to have all 90 and says having 90 is just average. They have never congratulated me on my grades and only do so when I tell them. Yet they always no when I score badly.

My dad slaps me when he is really mad at me and mad when I say something rude and scares the crap out of me when he is around me as he always yells when I do something bad or have missing assignments. We got into fights about grades as they never congratulate me and they say that my grades will drop which is why they don't celebrate. They only care about final grades as we are only halfway through the first quarter of 10th grade.

My dad says I am the worst kid in the family as all family members score better than me with the most opportunities. Yesterday we got into a fight because my Spanish grade dropped from an 85 to a 78 and math dropped from 89 to 80 which rose back up to an 88 but my dad was not happy with that. Dad calls me good for nothing worst in the family.

Mom is bearable but still bad. I am a 15-year-old boy. Sometimes in the past, they decide if I don't do my study well in the morning they won't give me lunch. Last year I scored one b total and this year I plan to score 3 a with one b but I know they won't be happy with that.
