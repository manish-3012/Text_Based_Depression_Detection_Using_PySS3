My therapist told me I was too broken to fix and that we would only be having one more session.I thought I found a place where I could get medication for this shit I've been battling my whole life. It's a free clinic but they have mental health students that volunteer there who take my information after every visit to an actual psychiatrist (psychologist?) who can then write a prescription for me if need be. 

They've been trying to convert me to Christianity since my first visit, offering to pray over me after each session. When I told the student that I just wanted help, they started telling me I couldn't be helped because there's "too much" to handle. I can't do this anymore. They refused the test to find out what medications night work best for me, they refuse to put me on any medication, and now they want me to do electro-shock therapy. 

I took a loan from a Redditor the other day and after I pay them back, this is over. My birthday is in January and ending this is going to be my gift to myself. I've got no one. No family or friends, no one that will notice I'm gone. 

I've been homeless for months, working a job I hate, my car is about to break down, and I have literally nowhere to go. The VA refuses to help me, the housing authority won't help me... I'm done. Nothing left to do but say good riddance.
