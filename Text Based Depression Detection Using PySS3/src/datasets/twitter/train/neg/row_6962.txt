I'm ready to go23F. I've been trying to fix my life for almost the past year and I've had enough. I'm tired of society, life, people, my dead end job, and backstabbing "friends". I made my noose and I'm going to try to hang myself this weekend. I tried it once when I was 15 but it failed, though I think the noose I made this time is much stronger. If that doesn't work, I'm going to go back to Golden Gate and actually jump off this time.
