I'm hoping this is goodbyeEveryone has a story, Everyone's is different. Sometimes people like to read it out loud for everyone to hear and some like to read it silently alone, scared to turn each page. That feels like me. I don't know what's wrong with me, especially recently It just feels like I'm watching my life unfold, watching myself slowly wasting away. I'm not even myself anymore, I feel as though I've been replaced by someone else, someone fake, plastic and cheap. I've lost my personality, my ability to speak to people and make basic conversation, I've not eaten or slept in days and I've done nothing productive at all in months, I constantly cut people off and I feel awful about it, I can't face other people though. Not now and I don't see it happening any time soon. I have awful coping mechanisms I wish I didn't use but I can help it (tw) I've had to have stitches 4 times since lockdown began, that's a little over one hospital visit a month. I manage to talk my way of having to go to the ward every time but I'm tired of having to fake a smile, pretend to be fine because I'm fucking not. Im finally realizing that and it's just making everything worse. My life is falling apart at the seams and as I said in my last post, I don't see myself finding a way to put myself back together and I'm so sorry that this is my decision but nothing any one else can say can change that. 

I know I didn't really speak about what my reasons are but at the end of the day, does it even matter?

I'm sorry and remember I love every one of you &lt;3,

Alex
