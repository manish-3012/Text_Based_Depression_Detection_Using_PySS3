Turned 28 today and the lack of happy birthday messages made me realize how small my life is. It's better I don't exist anymore.Six people wished me happy birthday on facebook for my 28th birthday today. One was my mom and the other my SO, a girl with whom I've been in a long distance relationship for three and a half years.

Most normal people with a healthly level of social connections get upwards of 20 happy birthday posts.

My life is so incredibly small. I don't really exist or matter to anyone. I have no real friends. I missed out on all the fun everyone has in college due to social anxiety. 

My life has reached its low point. 28 years old with no friends, a job in which I work online and don't interact face to face with other people, and no social life.

I have had suicidal thoughts before, but today it became more real than ever. I've missed out on so much already, so many friendships and connections. They say the 20s are the most fun decade of life; mine have been marked by depression and anxiety. 

It's all downhill from here. Time to end it I think. What hope do I have? I can't see any semblance of hope in my future. Just an increasingly toxic attitude of regret and feelungs of loneliness. I'd rather be dead.
