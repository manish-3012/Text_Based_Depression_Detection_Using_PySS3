Should I kill myself?Hi reddit

So I've been thinking about this for awhile, should I kill myself? A little backstory;

I'm a lonely, unattractive, unqualified 16 year old boy who is hopeless in school. My parents told me they wish I was someone else. I keep trying to tell myself I'm not useless but at the end of the day I know I really am. I have been having these thoughts for months now and I have no one to talk to about them as 1) I don't have any close friends 2) all my "friends" are people I met in video games. I long for someone to care and for someone to actually enjoy conversation with me but I don't think that's ever going to happen. Is there really light at the tunnel for everyone or should I do myself and the world a favor and end it now?
