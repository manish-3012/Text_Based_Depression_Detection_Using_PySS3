Birthday was a few days ago.Honestly all I really want for my birthday was just to die and not feel and have to worry about anything anymore. 

I ended up going to my shit job instead and dealt with my shitty family that I can't escape from instead. I got birthday cards from other relatives but didn't bother opening them. 

It's been several months since I stopped myself from being hit by a train. I still regret not going thru with it.
