F (27) Verbally Abusive Ex- and A Poorly timed ReboundI'm not entirely sure where to begin- only in that it's been almost 5 months since I broke up with my ex of 3 years. Throughout those 3 years he was verbally abusive- often yelling at me, telling me my thoughts made no sense and were stupid, and then often neglecting or abandoning when I need help. 

During those 3 years I had 2 miscarriages, my father passed away almost a year ago now, I had a cancer scare, and have been told it is likely I will not be able to have children. I've remained strong throughout these crises, but now it seems to be all coming to a head.

I broke up with my ex in October because I had enough with being forgotten and neglected. He was often flirting with another girl and spending a lot of time with her. When we broke up, I felt like it was only a matter of time before he started dating her- because of this, I made a dumb mistake and started dating one of my really good friends (whom I've known for about 4 years). He is absolutely fantastic and understanding, and yet I feel nothing. I am numb. I got accepted into graduate school, I've taken up about 5 different hobbies, and I've got to make some deeper connections with old friends and family. I'm also seeing a therapist. Nothing seems to be helping. 

I miss my ex desperately. I am moving out of my current apartment- and all of his old stuff (which I'm throwing out) has caused me to break down again and again. I don't really feel anything right now. I just want to escape all of this. I know time is supposed to help heal, but I've just been feeling trapped and alone. I've talked with friends and my current bf- nothing helps take away the pain I feel. I just feel like a fuck-up- like I lost all purpose in my life.

Please, just talk to me.
