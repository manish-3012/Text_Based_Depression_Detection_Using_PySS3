idki don't expect any pity or answer after this i just needed to let it out since i feel like i can't do it anywhere else.
i've been thinking about killing myself a lot lately because of school, mental health, people around me. 
i've always been so close to doing it but then i'm too much of a coward to finish it.. my girlfriend has been stopping me all these times before but i still feel like crap, it's still the old shit that i can't escape from. i'm basically just stuck and don't know what to do.. i just feel alone and maybe empty? 
whenever i let out my emotions and say what i think and how i feel, everything turns into shit.. my gf who i'd talk about it just suddenly switches and gets all dry and moody/sad just bc i said i was not in the right place.. so i decided to go quiet and don't talk about it at all anymore. it feels so wrong now to type this,, but i'm glad i found this subreddit, i feel like nothing's bad going to happen after i ended this, but it still feels wrong in a way.. i just hope i'm not annoying or smth
