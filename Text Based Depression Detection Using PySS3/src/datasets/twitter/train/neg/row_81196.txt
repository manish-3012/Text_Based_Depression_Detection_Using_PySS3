I'm scared of myself.I live a life filled with depression. I go to school, be ignored, come home, be ignored. I just want someone to hear me... I'm almost done with everything. I'm close to my breaking point, and after that I won't be able to turn back. I'm tired of being ignored, and just want them to hear me for once...
