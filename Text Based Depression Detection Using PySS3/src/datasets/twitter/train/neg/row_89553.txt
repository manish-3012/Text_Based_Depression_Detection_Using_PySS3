Senior picsMy mom is making me take the sr pics. With makeup. They require girls to wear this drape. Im trans but im not out and im crying because those pics will be in the year book and ill have to deal with that for the rest of my life. I dont know what to do. i dont want to live with people having those pictures of me.
