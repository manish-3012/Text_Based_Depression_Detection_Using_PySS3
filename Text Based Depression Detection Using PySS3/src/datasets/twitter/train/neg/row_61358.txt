My friend has thoughts of self harm and attempted suicideMy friend has been going through some tough times recently and was admitted into a hospital a few months ago for a suicide attempt, and another time one month ago for a failed attempt. She was clean for 30 days after, but recently started self- harming again. 

Weâ€™re both 13, so Iâ€™m scared I canâ€™t do enough or donâ€™t know enough to help her out of this. I told her iâ€™d be here to listen to her problems, to be there for her if she needed me- but iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s not enough. What else can I do to help her?
