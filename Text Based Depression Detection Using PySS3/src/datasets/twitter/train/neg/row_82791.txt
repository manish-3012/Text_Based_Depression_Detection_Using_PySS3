LonelinessI don't know how to handle the real world. I'm graduating tomorrow, so hooray for thousands of dollars in debt with no real life plan. I don't know how to navigate the real world, and I don't know how I'll find a real job. Everyone around me is already getting hired. It's frustrating to watch and realize how pathetic I am. 

Lately I've also been craving more romantic intimacy- which I just can't get. I feel like I'm incapable of ever having a romantic partner who really loves me. I've never had a real relationship in my life (like a couple weeks of seeing this one dude who wasn't even into me, and then also seeing a girl for mere days before she realized she wasn't into me). I have lots of friends, but lately I just really want that romance they can't provide for me. I'm not really ready for it anyway- but that doesn't stop me from wishing I was and that I already had it. I just feel lonely, I'm in my 20's and I've never even dated anyone for real.
