One day closer to an uncertain end.
One day I'm going to level a gun to my head and end this charade. One day it will all be over. No more ungrateful friends and family, no more being the one to do everything, no more being the butt of every joke. One day I won't have to put on a smile and pretend I care, I won't have to play this game. When the time comes, I'll leave them all behind. I wish I had the nerve to make that day today. It will come soon though.
