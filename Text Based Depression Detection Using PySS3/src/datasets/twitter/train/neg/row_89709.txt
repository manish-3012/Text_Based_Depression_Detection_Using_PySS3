Tell me otherwiseJust going to make a brief. Over the past few years, I've been having more downs than ups. By that I mean, more thoughts, nightmares, and moments that encourages me to not live anymore. However if I just end it now, I don't have to feel anything. No more sadness, crying, or other negative experiences. By going down this route, you can end it all and be more happy. Most would say, you would not feel anything, but just thinking about letting everything go is all I can wish for. That would be happiness for me. Then others would say, what about everyone else? Well if I'm dead, I don't have to worry about that. So, why should I continue to live? I keep telling myself that it'll get better, but everything is the opposite.
