Exhausted.So who will be like this tonight? One hour away from 2021 totally alone in your bed siblings out with friends empty home, empty soul, dark room
No friends a situation that will not change and years to come doomed to this life. 
Sometimes you slowly try to accept and feels okay, is not as rough as it was but you still suffer deeply, a deep cut no one can heal. 
You lie to yourself, you see others living and you ask why you canâ€™t have even half of it. 
You only try to make your family happy in the hope youâ€™ll stop being a total disappointment when you finally leave.
How will you get out?
So who... No one? Only me... cool :) happy new year everyone
