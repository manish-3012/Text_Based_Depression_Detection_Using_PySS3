I know what I need to change, and the steps that it takes to change, but I can't find the power to do itEvery time I think about quitting smoking, and taking responsibility for my life, and actually try and be successful, I get this overwhelming feeling of you're not good enough. All I've heard since I was 15 was that I wasn't doing enough, and now after a shitty breakup, moving back in with parents, and hearing all my shortcomings again, it makes me feel so worthless, and all I can think is how much I want these feelings to stop, and the only way I can think is by not being here anymore. I punch myself in the head when I get overwhelmed, or if I say something that made a situation worse. It scares people around me if they happen to see, but all I want is a hug right now, and for someone to hold me, and let me cry, but I don't have anyone who would accept me in that state, not even my mother. All I want to do is cry, but I can't well up the tears, so I just sit with my emotions wanting to die
