If you want to hear my story, I posted it earlier in this reddit, but I can send it to you directly if you want to hear it.But I really want to die. There is no other way to numb this pain. My heart and my mind are so broken they wonâ€™t let me sleep or even try to be happy. My parents just called my doctor and got me antidepressants. What do they do? Will they help me? Or is the only way to actually get rid of heartache to just kill yourself? Because itâ€™s becoming more and more of a viable option.
