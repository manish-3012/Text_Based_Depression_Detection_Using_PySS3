Iâ€™ve got nothing to live forMy soulmate broke up with me about 2 weeks ago and has blocked me. 
I canâ€™t imagine being with anyone else other than him. 
He was my reason to live and now that heâ€™s gone I donâ€™t have anything else to live for. 
I give myself about one more week before I go. Then Iâ€™m gone forever.
