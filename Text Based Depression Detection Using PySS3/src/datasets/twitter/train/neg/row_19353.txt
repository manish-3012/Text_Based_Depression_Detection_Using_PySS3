How long should it take for me not to feel like dying anymoreHey there. I've been depressed, it has very quickly screwed up my life. I feel like I was riding in a car speeding down the highway and suddenly the driver slammed the brakes and I flew through the windshield. I feel like I have failed at school, my career, and life in general. I have wasted the time and money of my parents and boyfriend, I'm a waste of space. 

I am on my third med so far. This is day 5 of it. Should I feel better yet? Should I ask for something else? I'm terrified that if I admit that yes, I am suicidal and yes, I have many plans, they'll send me back to the hospital for another week. But I don't know how to get better without telling someone that. I feel absolutely crazy. I shouldn't be thinking of how I can kill myself. But here I am.

I don't know what I'm looking for here. Sorry
