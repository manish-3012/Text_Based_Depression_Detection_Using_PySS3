I could do it right nowItâ€™s so quiet in middle of the night right now and I havenâ€™t gotten out of bed for a week. Itâ€™s so hard not to call an Uber right now to take me to the bridge. Itâ€™s so tempting itâ€™s right on my phone it could be here in just a few minutes. Iâ€™ve been wanting this for so long I think I could do it. Once I got there I donâ€™t think there would be any hesitation. 

I am alone. I just needed to tell someone that.
