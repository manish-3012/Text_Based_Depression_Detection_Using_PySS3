want some voicesconstant anxiety mixed with depression I am weak and never have gotten help or told anyone in my life apart from people I barely know that i wont see again or internet strangers.
I think theres something wrong with my brain that makes me think this way but I'm too weak to fight a battle to get myself right and live out life , a life that may be good or bad or ok. I don't care which it is its just too complex and I cant understand anything and don't think I want to try anymore.
nothing makes sense to me and I cant rationalise or explain anything and I know I will be hurting people by doing it and I'm so sorry for it but I'm not happy anymore and I'm selfish and a scumbag and a letdown
