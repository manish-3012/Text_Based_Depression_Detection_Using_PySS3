I can't stop thinking about it, I am reduced to tears. Idk why I have these thoughts in first place.Idk why I am like this, I just want these thoughts to go away. I am tired of these thoughts such as "\_\_\_\_ took her life.", thoughts about crashing my car and dying, cutting my right arm (even though I don't cut, but I have used other methods of sh in the past.) 

Why can't I just be happy?
