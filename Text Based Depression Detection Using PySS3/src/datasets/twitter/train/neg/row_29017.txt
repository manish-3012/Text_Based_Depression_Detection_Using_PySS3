Will writing goodbye letters to health care workers and a friend make it better or worse for them?Before you give in to the impulse to tell me to hold on or hang in there or that things can get better, please save it for someone else. Its not what I need, and its not what I want but thank you for wanting to try.

I'm already writing letters to my mother, the police that will investigate my passing and the rescuers that will take in my cats for rehoming. I've pretty much completed them, I'm just wondering what people's opinions are about if it will make things better or worse for the workers when I explain why I'm finally taking the plunge and say thank you, goodbye and good luck since I'll be dead by the time the police show the letters to them.
