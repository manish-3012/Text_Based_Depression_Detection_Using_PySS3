My soul is so tiredIâ€™m not going to hurt myself, but Iâ€™m definitely in some deep depression and idk what to do. My marriage is dying, I donâ€™t like my job, I lost my identity as a person when I had my kids, and I have nobody to talk to causing me to bottle everything up and itâ€™s weighing me down. Now, while I have no plans of hurting myself because I couldnâ€™t bear to think about the loved ones Iâ€™m leaving behind; I do wish I can just rest for good. Thereâ€™s no light at the end of the tunnel, and Iâ€™ve worked way too hard for a life that looks good on paper, but leaves too many voids. I know this is â€œsuicide watchâ€ but Iâ€™m in so much heartache and pain, that every day I feel like Iâ€™m walking with cinderblock shoes, and my will to exist is just withering away more and more every day. Iâ€™ll take any advice I can get, but I needed a place where I could anonymously get this weight off my chest. So if youâ€™re reading this, thank you.
