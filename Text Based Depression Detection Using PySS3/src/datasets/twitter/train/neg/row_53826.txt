Iâ€™m in so much pain right nowI have social anxiety and depression and today I started my university. I tried to kill myself yesterday THATS how much i donâ€™t wanna go there and deal with anything. Iâ€™ve never felt such fear and dread in my life and that time I really meant to kill my self I donâ€™t even know where the courage came from. But I knew it wouldnâ€™t succeed I just donâ€™t have the means to end it. (my family is always at home, donâ€™t have a gun or pills that can kill me) 
Even normal people find it almost fucking impossible to be in uni how am I supposed to deal with it with my anxiety and depression. 
Today I took the pills again. Hoping that it will end. And again I know I wonâ€™t succeed. But guess Iâ€™ll just slit my wrists then. 

The felling of absolute helplessness. When you know no ones going to help you. Even yourself. Itâ€™s so hopeless. Feels like I just donâ€™t have any other choice. It genuinely feels like it and I wanna scream from the pain that these thoughts bring me. 

My mom. She cares about me so much and sheâ€™s so worried. How can I do it to her. But everything just hurts so much itâ€™s hard to describe. After all when Iâ€™m dead I wonâ€™t feel anything and I wonâ€™t remember that I left my family to deal with my suicide. It is selfish. But iâ€™m too fucking tired to care. Iâ€™m numb and in pain at the same time. Itâ€™s unbearable. 

No oneâ€™s gonna save me. So iâ€™ll save myself from everything this shitty life prepared for me.
