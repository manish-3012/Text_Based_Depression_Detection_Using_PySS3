Slowly drifting away into insanity.I created a throwaway for privacy reasons. But I have severe OCD and possible Tourettes and with my OCD I have obsessions where I can't think about a certain person while doing something and if I do think about that thing or person I have to completely redo whatever I was doing I know my obsessions are nonsense but that's why I'm here I'm trying to make sense of my obsessions which is driving me crazy, what if my obsessions are real they don't make sense to me when I think about it logically but what if they are? Because of my high anxiety state it has caused me another condition called derealization and that made things worse and at this point I'm thinking of ending it all, I can't live with all of these obsessions from my OCD I refuse to take any of the medications they throw at me because they make me more suicidal or don't do anything. Would therapy even work? I'm way too embarrassed to tell people what I think happens if I don't do what my obsession wants me to.

My parents are the "Get the fuck over it" type so it is hard to get support from them
