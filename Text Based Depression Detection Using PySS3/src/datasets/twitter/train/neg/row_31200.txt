They only care when you're deadI'm so fucking tired of all these fake people who say shit like, "I'll always be there for you" or "I care about you a lot" just for them to leave because they can't handle my bullshit anymore. I know it's not my fault that a lot of people just suck but I can't help but blame myself for burdening them to the point where they don't care anymore. I guarantee at least half the people that tell me not to kill myself wouldn't really give a shit if I died. They always text me for a day or two and then I don't hear from them for weeks, months, sometimes never again. I'm always the one initiating conversation which proves my point even more. I wish that people would just be honest with me.
