I should have been aborted, but if anything I can do it myself, end myselfHello to all. I am a 24 year old. Chronic pain from a neuralgia in my neck, I also have lower back pain that shoots down to my left leg and kypho-scoliosis. Cystic acne that scars my skin, back, chest, shoulders and the face. Bad teeth. Low cognitive abilites and psyhical ones, too.

With so many genetic faults I should have been aborted. I feel like I am should end this, I am a low performing unit. I have already started searching for best methods, let's find out if there is anything after this(I don't belive there is). Even if there is nothing after that, there will be no more suffering, yes also there will be no pleasure, but suffering is always greater than the amount of pleasure. And if anyone says it's because you have too good in The West, I am not from The West, I am from SE Europe, barely making money for basic costs of living.
