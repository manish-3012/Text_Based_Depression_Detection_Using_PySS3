I'm going to make it through the holidays, and then I'm going to kill myselfMy tinnitus got worse again. This happens every eighteen months or so, and it chips away at my happiness, sanity, and overall mental fitness a little bit more each time.

  
This time I'm losing my last chance at a successful life.

My state has gun shows every weekend. I'm going to rent a car, drive to one, get a handgun, and shoot myself in the head.

I love my friends, and family and I already feel awful what this will do to them.

&amp;#x200B;

But I am so very very tired, and I just want to sleep. I no longer mourn the life I could have had. I don't even want this one.
