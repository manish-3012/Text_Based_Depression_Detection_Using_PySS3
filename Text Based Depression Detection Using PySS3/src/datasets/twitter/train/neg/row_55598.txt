Itâ€™s New Years, worst time of the yearYay now I get to watch other people parade their fake lives on Snapchat while I stay home, get drunk and hopefully die, I have friends but recently Iâ€™ve been feeling so so depressed for no apparent reason,

Havenâ€™t left the house in like a week, I donâ€™t know what to do to cheer myself up that doesnâ€™t involve drugs.
