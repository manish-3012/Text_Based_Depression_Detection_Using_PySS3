I think I'm done.I honestly never imagined I'd be thinking of doing it everyday. But things have gotten so bad for me, I don't think I can take it anymore. I feel so alone, and I want people to talk to and be around, but I don't. I don't message people, I never talk to someone unless they talk to me first. I don't know how to socialize as most of my life, I've been kept sheltered by father, who is now kicking me out, 2 weeks into college. These past few months, the thought of killing myself has been on my mind daily, and I'm just waiting for a way that's quick. And what bothers me most is when people say 'he should have reached out.' It's so hard for me to be close with someone, and when I tell you that, and you still leave, that just makes me feel like I really should just end it. Referring to the only person I've opened up to/loved. I don't know why I'm posting, I guess I just want people to know. If I told those I knew, pretty sure they wouldn't care. I don't want to leave knowing for certain that I won't be missed. Using main because I don't care anymore. Not like anyone I know will find this...
