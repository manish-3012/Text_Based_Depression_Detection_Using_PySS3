Need to talk with a mature personAs the title says, I need to talk. I have a plan to get help, but I'm not sure how good it is or if it'll work. For context, I'm 14F with suspected depression and social anxiety, but doesn't have to guts to get diagnosed. I want help but struggle to tell anyone. 

Please comment if you're willing to help.
