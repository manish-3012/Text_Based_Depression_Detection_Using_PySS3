all i am is a fucking unwanted burdenI feel like i manage to hurt everybody that I get close to and all I do is ruin lives.  I'm too much for everybody and a burden for my family yet I'm still too fucking cowardly to kms.  If I wasn't so scared of failing I'd be dead.  But guess I'm too much of a coward to try.  Wish I was fucking gone.  I feel like everybody secretly hates me and if they don't its because they take pity on me.  What is the point of my life when there's nothing good.  I'm too needy too dumb too fucked up for anybody.  At this point ive given up on everybody and stopped trying.. especially in this quarantine.  Texting just feels like so much work.  I just fucking hate myself and everybody else hates me too.  Then here i go crying for fucking help on this subreddit where there's people who are actually suffering.  I'm just a waste of space and time and i should just be fucking dead.
