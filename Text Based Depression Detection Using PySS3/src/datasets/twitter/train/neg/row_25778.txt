I have never been satisfied in my life as a man and I want to end it!I'm 21 years old and I have never been satisfied in my life as a man, I have always thought I was a woman stuck in a man's body. I have never been interested in meeting the expectations of what people want you to do as a man and I've always been a little more emotional than the average man. 

I have thought about have a sex change, but to me, it never seems genuine, it feels fake like I'm still a man playing dress up and I don't want that, I want to forget that I am a man and I want to be a woman as I feel I am much happier in that position. Being a trans woman would just not seem right to me as I'll still feel like the man I don't want to be. 

So, I guess I'm going to end my life as it is...a big unsatisfying disappointment! I want to kill myself and leave my horrible life as a man and hopefully become the person I've always wanted to be!

I want to say goodbye to everyone here and everyone who I have loved in my life...I'm currently alone..in my student home and I'm going to end it right here, I've left a note to let everyone know how much I hated being a man. 

Goodbye!
