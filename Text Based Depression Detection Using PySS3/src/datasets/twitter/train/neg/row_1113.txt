Nobody can ever be there for meAll of the people I trust just can't. I'm so overwhelmed by school and work and my newly destroyed relationship and I'm such a mess but nobody can help. God I just want this to be over. Everyone either doesn't care about me, or cares so much that it'll only make things worse to talk to them. I feel so afraid and lonely and lost I just can't handle it. It's been almost a year since my last suicide attempt but why not now? I just can't handle my current situation, and I can't do anything about it. Please just make it all end...
