IgnoreI feel like my life has reached a point where there is no possibility of me being happy. I cant think of anything that would make me want to live. Theres nothing I want and nothing I look forward to. Except death of course. But I still stay alive... it makes no sense its paradox. There is no reason why I shouldn't suicide rightnow but I still choose not to for some reason. There is nothing stopping me but I'm scared of death I think.
