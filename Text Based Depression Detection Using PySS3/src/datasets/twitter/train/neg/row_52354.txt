I could do it. I probably wonâ€™t.I really want to just end it. Right now. I could. But for some reason some small part of me is not wanting to go just yet. Like wondering maybe something good will happen if I stay. Thinking about how much Iâ€™d like to see my girlfriend be happyâ€”be there for my dad throughout his divorce with my mother. Meet up with my best friend again. Adopt children or some shit, when Iâ€™m an adult. Get better. Like hell, Iâ€™d love to get fucking better. But I know nothing is ever working out for me. The way I have to go is killing myself. I havenâ€™t planned on anything else. The world is too much to take in if I think about what itâ€™s going to be like after I graduate high school. Fuck, what about college? Iâ€™m never gonna make it. I canâ€™t take pressure. I make decent grades, but my best isnâ€™t good enough, and my best never will be good enough. My friends mostly hate me. Except for my one best friend, and my girlfriend. My (drunk) girlfriend thinks Iâ€™m not trying to get better. Maybe I should just stop trying. Iâ€™m sick of trying so hard and never feeling like Iâ€™m progressing. Or being told Iâ€™m not trying. Iâ€™m so fucking sad. Iâ€™m not even brave enough to get it over with. My friends would be better off without me.
