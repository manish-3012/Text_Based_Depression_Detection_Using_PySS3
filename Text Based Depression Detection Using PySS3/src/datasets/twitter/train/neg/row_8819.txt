I hate myselfI hate myself. I'm so ugly and fat. I cut and it makes me look weak. Everytime I do I feel good and then I feel awful. I cried today while I was with my boyfriend and now I made him sad and depressed even more. He started cutting because of me. It's my fault that he hurts himself. I thought that I could finally just have someone to cry around and not have any problems. I'm always the strong one to my friends, I can't ever cry around them. I thought I could cry around him and I was wrong it just made everything worse. His cuts are so much worse than mine and I feel like an awful person for crying and for cutting. I want to go jump off a bridge.
