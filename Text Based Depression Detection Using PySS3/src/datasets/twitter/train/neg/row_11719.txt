I left school to pursue a career I don't enjoy. I don't love my partner. I don't want to be alive.I left school when I was 16 to take an internship at a software company. I really enjoyed it and ended up staying there for about 3 months. I later got a job at that company. I was overworked and paid peanuts, but I put up with it. By age 18 I had my own flat and I was living by myself. By anyone else's standards I was doing well for myself, but I just felt nothing.

I owe my parents a copious amount of money and I have spending problems. I have a poor diet. My weight is becoming more and more of a problem. I have no real friends.

At this point I was feeling pretty down, but I attributed that mostly to the bad job I had. I thought I could fix it by getting another job, so I did.

I've been at this new job for about 6 months now, and I have the same feeling. But worse. I don't enjoy this career, I don't love my partner, and I don't particularly feel like being alive either.

I keep having these invasive thoughts while waiting for my train and out in public. I'll stand right on the safety line as a train approaches, and I think "Jump. Do it. Nobody cares about you anyway". I have to physically turn myself away from the track and the train to stop myself. A similar thing when crossing roads. Of late, I'll see a car approaching, I'll slow down and think "Go on. Hit me. Please". I feel like I'm just following the same routine day-in day-out, waiting until I finally die.

I'm scared and I don't know how to get out of this. I need to talk things out with someone.
