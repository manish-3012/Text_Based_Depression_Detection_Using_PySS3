I feel like I have a duty to kill myself before I get worseI had depression all throughout High School, and managed to get rid of it at the end of senior year. I started hanging out with better people, and dated an incredibly sexy girl. My confidence returned, and I was ready to go off to college and build an amazing life for myself. I went off to college, and my depression came back almost immediately. 

The school I go to isn't a great fit for me, but I can't blame the school for my incompetence. I've made some good friends, but not as many and not as close as I should have. I'm 19, and still a virgin. 19! There are VERY few virgins at my age. All of my friends from college/home have gotten laid a long time ago. Whenever they talk about sex (which is quite often) I just want to off myself. 

I used to be a respectable person. I've always been very competitive, I've always had an obsession with never showing weakness, but I can't hide it anymore. My friends all know I'm a virgin, and all of my other friends have been very successful socially at college. I know that they're losing respect for me. If myself from 6 months ago could see me now, he'd be disgusted/ashamed. 

I'm only getting worse as time goes on, and I feel like I have a duty to kill myself before I finish my transition into a complete loser. I'd rather be remembered as a  respectable person who was troubled and took his life than a loser who clung to a life that wasn't worth living.
