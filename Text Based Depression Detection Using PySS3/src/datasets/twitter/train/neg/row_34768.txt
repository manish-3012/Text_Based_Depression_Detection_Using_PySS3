Trans and stuckMarriage dissolving. No resources. Phd almost completed but for two exams. Under psychiatric care but no use. Hopeless. Isolated. No reasons to keep going. I have ruined my life and my career by attempting to transition in late twenties early thirties and only getting halfway to passing. My life is hell. I should add that I am not suicidal, but that I do feel at a total lack of hope, drive, happiness, joy, anything. I am only trying to hold on until I can see some goodness in my life again. Help? Suggestions? Encouragement? 

Edit:  just thinking about the impossibility of raising enough money for sexual reassignment surgery seems to be the checkmate for me in all of this. I have no trust funds, no savings, make less than 900 a month as a graduate teaching assistant, and have no job come May. I can't support my wife and son, can't even feed myself, but could get a professorship if my sex says female (sex change required) and my face was female too. I know reddit is capable of doing some pretty amazing things to help their community members out, but would they help someone like me raise enough money for a sex change. How/where would I even ask? Or is it even worth asking? It is my and my family's life, security, and chance at cohesion we're talking about... 

Edit 2:  would those of you more reddit-savvy be willing to help me ask the larger reddit community for donations toward SRS? Or is this an idiotic and likely contemptible question to ask?

Edit 3: thank you all for your kindness this evening. You really helped through a very difficult time. Even though the trouble remains, I am going to try to rest and approach it freshly tomorrow.
