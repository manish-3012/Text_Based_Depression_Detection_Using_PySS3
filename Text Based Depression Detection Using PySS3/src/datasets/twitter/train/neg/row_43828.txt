I'm not doing well...I'm thinking of killing myself all the time.  I'm severely mentally ill.  I've lost my therapist. I don't have any friends.  I have no job.  I don't leave my apartment.  My medications aren't working and I don't have an appointment to see my psychiatrist until next Wednesday.  I spontaneously wrapped a vacuum cleaner cord around my throat and pulled it very tight to get the sensation of asphyxiation.  I have a lot of sleeping pills and keep thinking of downing them all with a lot of alcohol, and duct taping my mouth shut.  Hoping I'd pass out and vomit and choke while unconscious.  If I had access to a gun I'd shoot myself in the head right now without hesitation.
