Donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep this up.Iâ€™ve attempted suicide 5 times and each time I think Iâ€™m getting better everything turns to shit again. I donâ€™t know how to function without being under the influence and when I try to talk to my friend about it I feel terrible because her dad was an alcoholic. 
I was recently diagnosed with BPD and itâ€™s completely thrown me for a loop. I donâ€™t know it just feels like the cards Iâ€™ve been dealt keep getting shittier and shittier and it fucking sucks.
Iâ€™m just tired of trying. Iâ€™m tired of trying to get better and nothing working. Everything feels heavy and I feel like Iâ€™m slipping. It feels like the end and I donâ€™t want to keep going.
