he broke up with me on my birthdayiâ€™ve fallen in love twice in my life. iâ€™ve finally found the second person who i donâ€™t have to force my feelings towards, who makes me feel alive, makes me feel something else than depression, and helped me get over my last love. i was so happy that i got him. so so happy, i cried and hyperventilated because i was so happy and excited and for the first time someone i actually love loved me back.

then he cheated. i didnâ€™t give up on him, i gave him a second chance. i thought that all iâ€™ve done for him wouldâ€™ve been enough, but it was not. i was the first person he has ever cheated on. why me?

now, itâ€™s my birthday today, right now. itâ€™s a long distance relationship but he came to visit me. everything went well until he started asking me if i would hate him if he left me. i could never hate him. but he left me. i canâ€™t look at him knowing this person is now just a friend. i canâ€™t look at him knowing he doesnâ€™t love me.

nothingâ€™s going right. i recently lost a clean of over a year, and today i lost a clean of over a month. my best friend is really suicidal, i got scammed for money, i barely even feel like i am alive anymore. i want to have zero reasons to not kill myself. i want to be able to kill myself. i want peace, i need a break. my head is going to explode.
