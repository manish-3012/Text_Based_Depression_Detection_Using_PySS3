I don't know how anyone does itI just don't know how anyone can wake up in the morning and think "yay! another day, let's do it!" How do people do it? I don't know how.

It's been one thing after another, and with nobody to talk to about it I guess I'm turning here. 

A few months ago I realized I didn't have very many friends, and after being the cause of every relationship I've ever been involved in failing, I don't know why I keep living. I'm a toxic person, I sabotage anything good in my life because I'm scared of feeling happy, I'm scared that if I'm too happy and I let myself stay happy that everything will fall apart around me. 

I have terrible anger issues, but I hate hurting others, so I make everything in my life my fault so the only person I have to be mad at is myself. 

But I don't know if I can do it anymore, I don't know if I want to wake up for school on Tuesday (I'm Canadian we have Monday off for thanksgiving) my entire life is; waking up, going to work/school, and going back home again to be depressed for a few hours before I fall asleep and have to do it all again the next day.

I'm a sick human being, I'm truly a terrible person and I don't blame anyone for not wanting to be around me, but it makes it so hard to try and change myself when I have nobody in my life to change for.
