What is the least painful way to die?Sorry for my bad english but Iâ€™ll try to be as clear as possible. I was too scared to ask this question, but for weeks now Iâ€™ve been feeling like I should just give up. I realized that none of my so called friends actually care about me, and some actually want to see me feel bad. Every time I try to tell them, or anyone else really, that I am feeling depressed, they tell me to stop being dramatic. All this has had an immense negative impact on my life, Iâ€™ve been getting really terrible grades, and my parents keep pressuring me about â€œyour grades define you, if you donâ€™t do well in school youâ€™ll have no jobâ€. If I break down at any moment, I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll end up trying to kill myself, but I donâ€™t want it to be too painful. Iâ€™ve thought about many things, such as slitting my wrists, hanging, overdosing, cutting my neck arteries, but they all seem so painful. I hope you understand what I mean, sometimes I really want to give up, and if I do, I just donâ€™t want to suffer any more than I already am.
