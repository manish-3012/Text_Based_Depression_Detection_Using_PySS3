Im not sure what to do anymore.The past couple years have been difficult for me but ive been able to get by, but the last couple of months I have been feeling really bad. I have been struggling with anxiety for about 5 years now. It ended a good career which i took really hard but am slowly getting over it. The past few months I've been away for school in which ive made some great friends who helped me get through a couple bad panic attacks but i cant get it out of my head that all im doing is ruining our friendship because of my issues. I used to never consider ending it because of my problems but my mind keeps going in that direction lately. Im still pretty sure i wouldn't end my life despite my thoughts because i dont want to put my friends or family through that but im really worried. I feel like if thats the way im feeling now its going to get worse. 
To be honest im not really sure why im posting this. I just had to get that out there because im to scared to talk to my family or even a doctor about it. If me venting is against the rules let me know or report it.
