Goodbye noteYou told me to get the fuck out of your life and so I shall.
You told me I didn't care about you stuff that the past years together were fake. 
I'm sorry for not being a better fiance and for not immediately taking your side.
Hopefully there is reincarnation and perhaps we shall meet again in new lives.
I shall always love you and I'm sorry for disappointing you, I shan't again.
Goodbye Malcolm.
