I want it to look like an accident.I been doin increasingly stupid things lately. I drove all over a frozen lake one night looking for the pressure ridges so I could fall in. Last weekend i was speeding around an unfamiliar prairie trail and hit a tree pretty hard. I'm still here and I'm still lost. It has to look accidental because I don't want my family to question why...
