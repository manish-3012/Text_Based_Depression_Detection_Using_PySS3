If I can't have a cuddle buddy or someone then I can't do this anymoreIf I can't have someone there to comfort me and make me feel loved then I'm sorry but I can't do this. I can't move on in life not feeling cared for. If anyone near Lake Stevens, WA would help a 25 year old guy out it would help me immensely. But if I can't find a person like that to help me out then sorry but then I can't get motivated to do anything in life and it feels like I might as well just end it. I'm having a really hard time and I'm extremely lonley and because of the feelings I'm dealing with and the emotions I have I can't do the things that everyone else can without feeling supported and like I'm cared for. So sorry. That's the end of it. I guess I just wasn't meant to be in this world. I am not like all of you. I'm completely different from everyone else. I'm like an alien.
