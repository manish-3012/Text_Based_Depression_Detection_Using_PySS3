I wanna end it all but canâ€™t bring myself toI got home from work about a half ago, pulled the gun I carry out of the console, turned the safety off, and sat looking at it for I donâ€™t know how long. I want my life to end but as I sat there looking at the gun I couldnâ€™t bring myself to pull the trigger. Itâ€™s the closest Iâ€™ve ever come to going through with it. Maybe as time goes by Iâ€™ll be able to get close enough.
