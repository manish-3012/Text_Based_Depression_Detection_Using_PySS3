i want to die again, but i don't have anything to be sad about anymorei'm so confused. i'm happy. everything is going good in my life, i'm starting to feel better about my appearance, but the urge to go and lay down in the snow and freeze to death is overwhelming. i'm not even sure why i'm posting here, because i know damn well i don't have the guts to do it. i guess i'm hoping i can talk myself into it or something.
