Fuck my OCD! Fuck everything!I'm 14, and Male, I have OCD, I'm Bipolar, so one minute I'm bashing my skull and clawing at my neck, the next I'm playing games, I'm Biphobic, mainly because... I am Bi, well, I'm Bigender at least. I may be an Asperger, I've always had trouble with socializing, I was also bullied to the point Homicidal THOUGHTS when I was in school, every time I got bullied I built up more of a blood lust (no sexual arousal involved) I left school because, I realized these thoughts were very dangerous, ever since I've been here, home, isolated. only going out on a bi weekly basis, (another bi, apparently I'm Bi-man), I don't have any friends, and i don't have the opportunity to make anymore, my parents are worried i'll get lost when I go out, I got a phone yesterday, as a late birthday gift, but even with a phone there not sure about letting me go out, my mother is disabled with Arthritis, so she can't take me out, my dad takes me out, but he works all the time, and I'm bogged down with mental illness, no one's gonna want to be around me, so I'll likely never get a boyfriend or a girlfriend, I'm waiting to see a therapist about my OCD, but it could likely take weeks to get an appointment, I'm danger to myself and others, a dangerous psychopath. (Don't know how to PM) I don't what to do, what do I do?
Sorry this is so long, thanks if you read all of it.
