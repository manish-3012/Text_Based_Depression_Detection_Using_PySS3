Someone help me Before we start, I have to tell you that I'm gay. It's a secret, so if someone in public asks, I'll deny it. Even in family, friends. I only publish it here, because nobody cares here. And the fact that English isn't my first language, so don't correct my grammar.
 
 Around 2 months earlier, I was with one of my friends, who I have a crush on. We were friends, but like BEST friends. But I tought more of him. So, after a long day,we were going home on a bus, from which I get off earlier. When we were around 10-15 meters from the stop, I held his hands, and looked at him in the eye. He started smiling, and asked: Is it a bet or something? For which, I said that I'll explain it at home. I texted him, telling him NOT to tell anyone. I told him that I have a crush on him. He was suprised. What do you think happened? He showed it to all our friends. I didn't know about it back then. At one time, I was hanging out with one of our mutual friends (note that guy wasnt there), when she says: So... i heard you were gay, is that true? I said no, why would I be? She told me that he showed it to her. I acted confused, like I didn't know anything. When I got home, I made a fake profile of him. Exact picture, exact name, everything. I made messages with stuff like him saying ,,I miss you" or ,, I want to see you". I sent it to our friends, got it cleared. Somehow, I got a girlfriend (5 weeks ago) and realized, that she is going insane for me, but I'm only acting like I love her. I feel like I just want to kill myself, put and end to the story. End this emotional rollercoaster. Get rid of the trouble I caused.

 I'm desparate. Help me with anything you can do. Just little bits. I'll be thankful.
Thanks for reading.
