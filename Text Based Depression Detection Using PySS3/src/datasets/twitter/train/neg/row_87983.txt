Year after year I try and year after year it only goes downIâ€™ve tried everything, Iâ€™ve had therapy, Iâ€™ve spoken to people, Iâ€™ve picked up hobbies, Iâ€™ve distracted myself and done everything in my power to feel like Iâ€™m worth something. Years, Iâ€™ve been trying for years. And it all always comes back to the same feeling of worthlessness and the same emptiness I feel of not truly achieving anything in life. I only wish I had the strength to complete it but Iâ€™m too pussy to even do that. I just wanna fade away, ride the winds to a place of thoughts and nothing else. If only I had the fucking willpower. If someone can perhaps help me fight a little longer Iâ€™d appreciate it because Iâ€™m so terrified of dying but at this point it feels easier to face it than face everything else.
