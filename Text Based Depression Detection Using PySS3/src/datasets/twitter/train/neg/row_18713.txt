Pre suicide logisticsI have been suicidal for a long time now and am almost ready to kill myself but I wanted to know if there was anything I should do before hand to help my family and friends deal with my death. So far I have got a note written, visited all my relatives and am in the process of giving away my things. Any advice on things to do before hand would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
