WHEN WILL IT ENDi wish it could go, all the pain and suffering. I'm sick of it. I want a connection with someone. I have never had a gf in 23 years of this planet. I got brain damage from a self-induced concussion after a breakdown. It always happens in bed and IM IN BED RIGHT NOW. I can't take it anymore. I want love. I need intimacy. I cant take it anymore. I cant deal with it anymore. This is just one area that is fucked. I don't speak to sperm and egg providers. I was abused as a child and teenager. I just want to die, im nothing but a shell. I cant deal with it anymore. A BROKE BRAIN AND A BATTERED HEART
