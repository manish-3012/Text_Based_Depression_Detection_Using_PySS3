Considering buying a gun.I've wanted to die for almost 12 years. I drink constantly to cope, I'm unemployed with no job prospects and no skills that make me stand out, I'm fat and unattractive, and I keep managing to ruin relationships because I guess my default mode is self-destruction. Even my parents have realized I'm a loser. I'm a burden on them and everyone.

I live in a state where getting a gun is very easy. Thinking of getting one so the next time I'm drunk enough, I'll just end it.
