I'm so overwhelmedI thought I would feel better after finishing my final but I don't feel better at all.

I keep telling people not to cause any harm to themselves but after hearing about Sulli's death I'm like "I suffer from much more than just depression and am sill here. Why shouldn't I free myself from all this pain too?"....
