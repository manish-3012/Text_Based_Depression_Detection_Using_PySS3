I feel I am a worthless and inferior person and must kill myself.I have failed to kill myself in the past. But I feel I am worthless and must die. I am very introverted and just like to by myself. But it is wrong to be introverted so I must kill myself. It is so stressful to me when people try to talk to me. I must kill myself because I cannot change my personality. 

I'm sorry to bother people about this. Probably it is best if I die because I don't contribute anything anyway.
