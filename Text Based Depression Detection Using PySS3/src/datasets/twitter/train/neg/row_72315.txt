[Advice] I'm 20, I suck at basically anything, dead inside, can't study, hold focus, most social interactions drain the life out of me, jobless, constantly disappointing my family, closeted, the list goes onObviously I can't live like this forever and I have to achieve a certain level of autonomy somehow for when shit hits the fan for the second or third time and my mother realizes I've been spending this year studying in a big city just to fail at the national exams next month, so please **can you guys point me to some cash-earning hobbies I can learn via the internet?** It's basically one of my last attempts at even caring about my future cause I'm halfway given up and just letting things fall apart while I sleep/slack my life away and hopefully finally wake me up from this trance when they get awful enough for me to be bothered enough to kill myself.


Ps: I've been in this battle long enough and I've run out of things to type/say, or out of the energy to do so, that's why I don't even care to type a big wall of text explaining my life anymore, but let me preemptively avoid some advice I know I'm gonna get: Don't tell me to ask my family for help or to look for psychological advice. I've been there, done that in my late teenage years, first off my family is very backwards, they don't get mental illness, blame it on the lack of ''god'' or whatnot, weren't financially willing to get me on some advanced neurological/psychiatric tests, sent me to some really shitty psychologists who couldn't even figure me out and prescribed a lot of awful meds, and I ended dropping all that because it was a useless waste of my mother's money, and we are poor to begin with, living in a shitty country with a terrible health system, nevermind mental health system.  All I wanna do is find some source of income without alerting them to how bad I'm doing by my own because I don't need to hasten the shitstorm that's coming when it happens. Oh yeah, and I tried getting real jobs. It's really tough and the economy is fucked for the foreseeable future, sooooo


**TL;DR:** Please point a talentless, probably mentally impaired boy who can't amass useful academic knowledge, to some profitable hobbies he can learn over the internet as an alternative to eventual suicide.
