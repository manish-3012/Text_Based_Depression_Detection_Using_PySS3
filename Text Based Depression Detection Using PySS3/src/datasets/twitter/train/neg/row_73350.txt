Still awake at 5am. Planning to have a good Monday at school, to hell with everyone's opinions.Pre-made my lunch for today, made salad shit instead of eating the same junk food from my school's canteen. Gonna chug a litre of coffee, do my hair in a messy way so that I don't have to fix it throughout the day and not put an effort into smiling, hate that shit. Fuck everyone's opinions, I deserve this.

Anyone who takes issue to me not smiling as usual can expect an obese 'fuck you' from me. Sick of quite literally putting on a grin for people who constantly tell me to smile. Lemme have my resting face to myself, if you're so pissed then go smile at yourself in the mirror.

Have a good monday yall
