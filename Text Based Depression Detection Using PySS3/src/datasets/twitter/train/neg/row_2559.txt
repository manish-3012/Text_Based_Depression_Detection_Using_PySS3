Two Mental Hospitals. Hasnâ€™t Helped At All.I have had 2 suicide attempts since January 31st and spent a total of 8 days inpatient. I know that I  left both of them way too early. I was not diagnosed with depression, but with an unspecified anxiety disorder. I cannot find any meaning in life. At this point I want to end it all and make sure itâ€™s done correctly. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m not better but I canâ€™t do this anymore.
