I couldI could go to the bridge, the suicide bridge and stand in the middle and look over the edge and feel all the feelings of everything and everyone who stood there before me and even though they put up a fence I'm a fast climber if I need to be

 I want to dangle my legs over the edge and feel the fear on the bottom of my feet and think of those who had courage and knew they could it

I'll park on one end and walk right in I  won't look at anyone and won't say a word 

a trip a fall a slip away
