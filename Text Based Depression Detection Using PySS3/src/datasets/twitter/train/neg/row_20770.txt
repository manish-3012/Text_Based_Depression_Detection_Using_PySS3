imagine needing someone to talk you off the ledge but having no oneyeah thatâ€™s about all there is to it. past couple nights iâ€™ve needed someone to say donâ€™t kill yourself and hereâ€™s why but no one does because no one cares. i feel worthless and pretty much everyone in my life contributes to that. no one wants me as a friend, my boyfriend doesnâ€™t care at all, nothing works out in my favor. i have nothing to look forward to. iâ€™m 21 &amp; a woman. in college, involved. you would think itâ€™s so easy to make friends. but iâ€™ve never been able to. quite possibly because iâ€™m too much to handle because of stuff like this. but it just shows no one cares enough. iâ€™m too fucked up to be anyoneâ€™s friend including my own so whatâ€™s the point? goodbye world feels so good to say
