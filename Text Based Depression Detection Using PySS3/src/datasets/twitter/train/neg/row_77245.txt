The life has just been sucked out of meMy ex husband, who I get along with pretty well, just told me that if I committed suicide that he would not let our daughter come to my funeral. He knows about my struggles because Iâ€™m upfront about it so that our daughter is with him if Iâ€™m not feeling well. I thought he understood depression. I feel like I have no value now. I canâ€™t imagine my daughter not being allowed at my funeral. I donâ€™t know why he would tell me that. It hurt me so deeply. Im not currently suicidal but I do struggle from time to time. A lot of time I donâ€™t feel like I have any value and his comment makes me feel dehumanized as though if I died by car accident or something else I would deserve to have my daughter at my funeral. I feel so much pain deep in my soul about this.
