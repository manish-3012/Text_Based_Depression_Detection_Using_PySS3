I have no friends, I'm sick all the time and my long time girlfriend just told me she wants to go stay with friends because she's "confused"I'm doing my PhD in a city where I have no friends, I have a genetic illness that makes me in pain or feel sick to some level 99% of the time and my longterm live in girlfriend just said out of the blue she is going to pack up some stuff and go live with friends for "a couple days" because she is "confused" over text message. Anti-depressants have done nothing but give me side effects. I want to die and just eliminate my fucked up genes from the gene pool. I would be dead already if society wasn't there to hold me up.
