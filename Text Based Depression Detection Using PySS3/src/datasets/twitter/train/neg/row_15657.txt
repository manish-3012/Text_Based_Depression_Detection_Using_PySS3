Am I even a person anymore?Iâ€™ve never really resorted to the internet for help but Iâ€™ve never felt so alone.. I just donâ€™t feel like myself anymore.. I just remember fragments of who I was a months ago and now idk who that is anymore, who is she? 

My last year of college ended a few months ago and I didnt feel one ounce of happiness. This year has been so hard.. balancing my last school year, depression and my long distance boyfriend who needed me so much. I guess I forgot about myself.. since then idk who I am anymore..

My boyfriend broke up with me because I wasnâ€™t enough.. i didnâ€™t give him enough time. I fought with him. I never stopped and listened. I never was the best.. I just was wrong.. Iâ€™ve been trying to get him back but I dont have much fight in me anymore.. he is the love of life which is a strong statement but he makes me want to be a better person.. he has been my number one.. but he doesnâ€™t believe me and we fight.. Iâ€™m a piece of shit.. I ruin everything.. he was the best thing to happen to me and I just let him down over and over. I didnt do enough.. I just want to fix it with him.. I need him. He gave me a chance but he keeps changing his mind.. I just.. idk.. I feel like I lost the last piece of myself to him.. 

I just want to disappear.. I feel like everyone would be happier if I just vanished. Idek who I am anymore.. I feel disgusting.. I feel empty.. I feel everything at once or not at all.. Iâ€™m just so gone.. Iâ€™ve been sitting in my car for hours.. I wish I could just be gone...Iâ€™m not even sure any of this makes sense.. Iâ€™m not even sure what to do.. I feel so alone.. I want to give up so badly.. Iâ€™ve thought about it so much lately.. itâ€™s so overwhelming.. I cant really take it anymore.. idk what to do...
