I'm scared I might do somethingthis is my first time posting anything on the internet that is this personal, but I really need to vent and I can't rely on my friends to do so. I'm tired of being pittied. My parents beat me up and treat me like crap. Not a single day goes by without an argument, and I could only find relief on being with my friends. this one girl particularly cared and I started having slight feelings. Upon discovering she didnt like me that way I just entered what I believe to be some sort of depression. I just don't know what to do anymore, so in a desperate attempt of I don't know what I bought what are "legal drugs" in my country. those are heavilly harmful for one's health but I wasnt caring. they got my head out of everyday's crap. I also had a knife and I ended up cutting myself while I was high. The drugs eventually backfired and I started throwing up and having a panic attack while I was by myself. I sit now typing this completely frightened about what I may do to myself. I'm scared to go back home everyday because I know I'll get yelled at for no reason, and I can't be with my closest friends because I start feeling like shit.
