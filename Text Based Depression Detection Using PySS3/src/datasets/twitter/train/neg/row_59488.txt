I can not reach out for helpAs the title says it feels impossible for me to reach out to anyone I know and I do not know what i should do about it.
For example: I had made some post on this sub-reddit with great supportive and helpful comments but as soon someone found out about my acc i deleted them because I am scared and embarrassed about it.
