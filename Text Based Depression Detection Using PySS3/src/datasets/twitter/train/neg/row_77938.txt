I donâ€™t think I can do this anymoreIâ€™m 22 and a marine. On New Years I found out my girlfriend of 8 years had been cheating on me for the past 3 while she was at home, and I was stationed stayed away. I was gone 8 months on deployment being cheated on the whole time.

We broke up, and her new man moved in with her right away. He has my entire world while Iâ€™m left with nothing.

My best friend died in a car accident in February and it has been extremely rough not seeing him everyday. I donâ€™t really have anyone else because my family life back home was already rough and I havenâ€™t seen them in so long. I over drink every night and lately Iâ€™ve just been hoping to not wake up when I pass out. 

I donâ€™t want to be here and Iâ€™m tired. I see people here with all these huge issues in their lives, and it makes me feel stupid for being so upset over little things like a breakup.
