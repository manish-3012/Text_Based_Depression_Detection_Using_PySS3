I gave up everything and now it's time to numb it all.I just can't do it, I don't care for anything anymore. I'm only 13 and I have no clue what the world is going to hit me with. I gave up love, I gave up education, I gave up my friends. All that keeps me alive is my music and it's slowly killing me. I can't do it anymore, there is no point. I'm ending the pain, I'll pretend everything now great. Numbing the pain is the only option. I've tried, I really have but this world just won't stop. First it was child abuse then it was neglect then depression and everything is taking a nice fucking nosedive to the pits of hell. I can't keep going. At least I'll stop it all. No one will read this anyway, I know no one does. My friend will be desimated but I don't care. My dad will feel like he failed me, he did. My brother will never recover, he deserves it. My step-mother and step-sister will be in eternal dispair, but I don't care, i don't even them enough to care. I can't. It makes it harder. I gave up everything that was step 1 and now it's step 2 to numb the pain. I don't care if anyone calls me out, calls me unwanted, stupid, unloved, or anything else because your fucking right and it hurts but when I kill myself I'll go to the pits of hell where your insults are silenced. I want to go up but that's not what happens. If I kill myself god apparently will not care and will send me down to hell, at least that's what I heard. I give up. I'd rather go to  hell for eternity than live another year on this earth. Or maybe it will be just blackness. Better that then being forced to see the horrible things this earth does to people. I'm done ranting and I'm done living. Goodbye.
