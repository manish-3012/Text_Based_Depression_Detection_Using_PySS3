Posting on a throwaway because I donâ€™t want people to think Iâ€™m a freak: I spent all day doing a comprehensive study (accounting for biases) of whether I have had a positive or negative impact on my peers. I suspected that it would be overwhelmingly negative, but I was surprised by the results.Iâ€™m obsessed with data and recently unemployed, so I have lots of time on my hands. Iâ€™ve just spent all day completing a comprehensive study of everybody I know and for each person, I asked myself one question: have my actions positively or negatively impacted their lives? Has my existence validated theirs?

I know 848 individuals. I define â€œknowingâ€ as a mutual ability to look at a photograph of the other person and identify him or her by first and last name. Of these 848, most were immediately disqualified as â€œneutral,â€ meaning my actions have had neither a positive nor a negative impact on their lives, OR that my actions have had an equally positive and negative impact.

28.5% of individuals (242) were identified as â€œnon-neutralâ€ actors. Of these, it was determined that I had a net positive impact on at least 117 and a net negative impact on at least 103. 22 were classified as â€œnon-neutral without category,â€ meaning that I impacted their life, but a positive or negative skew remains ambivalent.

Furthermore, this study was deeply flawed:

1) there was a confirmation bias as a result of my mentality going into it and the judgement of my own mind, and

2) family members were never classified as â€œnegative,â€ and rarely classified as â€œneutral,â€ so my 29 family members skew the data. 

Here is why the results surprised me: I expected an overwhelming number of â€œnegativeâ€ impacts and few, if any positives. Instead, there were more positive than negative. As I made the list and checked it twice I looked at all those positive names and knew that I couldnâ€™t commit suicide for their sake, at least not yet. Some of these people are quite old and as they pass, the negative scales will draw closer to equilibrium.

**TL;DR: thought I was hated, turns out itâ€™s pretty neutral**
