I decided im killing myself tonightI already started making the noose. My life is so shit i guess it official my family doesnâ€™t care or even love me anymore. So I guess this is goodbye

Goodbye Peter- you always made me laugh and was always there for me when I needed you please donâ€™t blame yourself because of this

Goodbye Kayla- once you found out i was Bi you started treated me like I was garbage but I still love you so much donâ€™t forget that

Goodbye Pablo and Blue- you were my support animals lol when ever i felt sad you guys cuddled up right next to me and made me feel so much better I will miss you guys so much I hope mom and dad will take good care of you.

Bye Dad- Dad I still love you after all the things you said to me, I know you never could of loved a gay/bi kid and I understand thats my fault. 

Goodbye Mom- you were the only one that actually supported me through these times I love you with all my heart. And my dying wish is for you to move on donâ€™t blame yourself over me This is not your fault

Goodbye everyone
