I canâ€™t deal with my stuttering anymore.Iâ€™m 21 years old now, never had a true girlfriend, virgin, in a mediocre school with a lame major and Iâ€™m also epileptic. Today in class, my professor who is a huge fucking asshole called me out to read my notes and called me out when he said they needed to be typed and I should check my email more. HE NEVER SAID THAT. ONE. Imagine being 21 years old, having people think you canâ€™t read, remember ur name when asked etc. 

I also completely embarrassed myself in front of a girl in my class that I was talking to but now.... I donâ€™t think so. 

All my life Iâ€™ve been so fucking ashamed of myself and I canâ€™t take it anymore. Please, I need advice.
