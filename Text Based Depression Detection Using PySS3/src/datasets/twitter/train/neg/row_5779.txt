When youâ€™ve lost everythingIâ€™ve lost my two of my four children, my sister, my grandparents, my parents kicked me out when I was 14, lost all I had fueling money into my sisters well being as she passed, gave up my career of owning real estate brokerages, someone forced me to give away my therapy dogs after I moved in so he can help me with grief. I as diagnosed with cancer, 3 huge surgeries including brain and a full hysterectomy. Iâ€™m only 35. Iâ€™ve lost everything. I donâ€™t want to live. I canâ€™t look my youngest two in the eyes. I beg each night to not wake up. This has been going on for 2 years 4 months 15 days. I work again but itâ€™s to pass the time and ignore the massive pain. I beg for help. I beg for release. Iâ€™m in hell and want it to end.
