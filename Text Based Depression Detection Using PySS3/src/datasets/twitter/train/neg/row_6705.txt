Suicidal about college and my futureI am 18 and about to go to college. The issue is the college I am going did not accept undecided so I had to pick business as a major.  I have heard the horror stories of how business majors end up working at Starbucks at minimum wage and frankly I would be poor and in debt for the rest of my life.


I could switch to engineering or CS but the school I  am attending has a lot of prodigies( top 10 for many engineering fields and highly ranked CS program) and I would be far behind my peers and suck at engineering/CS.

The thing that bothers me about college is if I mess up I could end up in a lot of debt and unemployed and this bothers me. This may seem like a first world problem but sometimes I wonder that I wouldn't have these issues if I weren't.
