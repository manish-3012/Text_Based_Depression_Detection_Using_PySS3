I wished I killed myself when I had the chanceI said in a previous post that I was contemplating of killing myself. I almost did it a few days after the post. I tried killing myself. But I was too much if a coward to go through with my plans. I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself but I was too much of a fucking coward. Then for some odd reason I told my friend about my shit and I regret that. I shouldnâ€™t have told her, I shouldnâ€™t have asked for help. I donâ€™t want people to waste their effort on a lost cause like me. I donâ€™t want to get help, I just wanna die already. Now I donâ€™t feel as suicidal but I donâ€™t want that. I donâ€™t want to feel happy again because I know more of these â€œepisodesâ€ of shit will just happen to me again and I donâ€™t want it anymore. Idk why I feel this but long story short, I just donâ€™t want to feel better, I want to be dead. Iâ€™m sorry if this post comes as confusing or pathetic. I just donâ€™t fucking know what the hell Iâ€™m feeling.
