My cousins wedding is in one week and I plan on ending my life before it happens because my life is a piece of fuck that I can't fix!I don't have anything to live for now, I may only be 22, but I've just lost everything to live for and I want to kill myself and be rid of everything that I hate! 

No one will care for me, sure my family may cry, but in a years  time, they will not miss me! My cousin's wedding is coming up and I don't want to be there as I don't want to watch their happy lives while I live a shit life with no future with no opportunities and no promise! 

Fuck this life!
