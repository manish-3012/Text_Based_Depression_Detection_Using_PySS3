I'm a messI'm 17 years old, 18 next month. On New Years Eve, I broke up with my girlfriend. I was already planning to kill myself when IÂ  broke up with her. She blocked me and I haven't talked to her in a month. Then on January 9th I tried to hang myself, but I failed. I was admitted to a mental hospital for 8 days. They put me on Lexapro. I had stopped taking Wellbutrin in December. I made good friends with my roommate in the hospital and we've been hanging out a lot. I've been smoking weed and taking kratom. I quit weed last year in April, but now I'm smoking again because I don't care anymore. The way I sleep is fucked. I'm waking up every day around 2 pm I thought I'd be dead by now, so I'm not functioning very well at all. All I've been doing every day is getting high and writing in my journal. I'm trying to fill the journal completely. I feel completely lost. I'm in pain. My heart hurts.
