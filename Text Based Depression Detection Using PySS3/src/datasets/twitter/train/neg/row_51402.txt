I think this are my last daysSomeone use me, rejected me, and he even make me to say "i love you" but later he keep liying and liying about everything... Now I think i discovered that he had another person on his life. 
I don't understand anything about this behavior.
But this year absolutely destroyed me. I can't do this anymore. This is a new level of pain, i think I can't continue. He is going to be another fucking asshole who hurted me and never is going to have ANY consecuences. Nothing brings me peace anymore. Because if life is about people coming to my life, destroying everything and never face a real consecuence, pain or even guilt I can't. This is not for me. 
The worst part is that I would never receive an explanation. I would never receive anything. I didn't deserve the love, the patience and the good treats that other girls received.

I don't know what the fuck I do to deserve this. I'm going to wait to have access to buildings if someday I can access the fucking city i have to left behind bc coronavirus. And I'm going to fucking smash my head against the paviment. 
I'm only a peace of meat to experiment for him.
