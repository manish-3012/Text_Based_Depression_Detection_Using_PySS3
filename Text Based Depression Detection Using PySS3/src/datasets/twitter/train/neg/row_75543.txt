How aggressive will creditors harass my family once i've taken my own life?One thing i'm afraid of is the burden of my financial woes to be placed on the shoulders of my loved ones. I understand that debt dies with the person, however i've ready that banks and collections agencies will phone and harass members for payment. Do any of you have any insight into this matter? It would be greatly appreciated, Thanks
