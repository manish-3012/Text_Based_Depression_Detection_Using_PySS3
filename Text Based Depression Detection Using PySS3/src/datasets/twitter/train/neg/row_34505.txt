Wish I wasnâ€™t born.Iâ€™m on mobile and this is only my second ever post so if itâ€™s shit please tell me how to fix it. 

So I hate myself. I was born to force a relationship. With two parents who are broken. I wish I was dead. I wish everyone would forget about me. Iâ€™m in so much pain everything hurts I want to give up.  I just want it all to go away forever and ever and ever. Why does everyone fucking hate me. My own parents fucking hate me. My family hate me. I didnâ€™t ask for this. Iâ€™m doing my best. Iâ€™m trying hard. Iâ€™m so torn on everything. Iâ€™m in so much pain. I just want it to stop. I really want it all to stop. I canâ€™t tell everyone how much it hurts. I feel like a cloth filled with water. My parents love it when I cry. Iâ€™m sad because I canâ€™t afford to drink. I need to drink or Iâ€™m like this. Itâ€™s all my fault all the time and I canâ€™t shake that. I just want to sleep and not get up and have everyone forget about me and be happy. Without me everyone would be fine. I wish I was dead.
