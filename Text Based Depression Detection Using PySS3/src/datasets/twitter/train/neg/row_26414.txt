I have a plan nowI've been suicidal for 8 years. Life has once again screwed me and I'm lost. My stepbrother and sister-in-law have a house on our property. They own a lot of guns. I think I'm going to borrow my sister's 9mm and go somewhere out on our property to kill myself. I might take my car somewhere beautiful and blow my brains out in the drivers seat. I let someone into my heart and once again they abuse me. Fuck this.
