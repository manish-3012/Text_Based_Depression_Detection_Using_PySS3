On Zoloft, quit weed, all of the sudden I have an overwhelming urge to dieLike I have a scarf wrapped around my neck and I keep tightening it and *I like it*.

I want to feel my head keep swelling up and the fuzzy tingly to take all of it over and then fall asleep and be in that warm comfy place forever. 

This is really scaring me. I've always had depression but was the sort who simply thought it would be easier to dead. 

But right now I want to do it, like I really, really want to.
