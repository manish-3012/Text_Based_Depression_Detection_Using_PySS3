Tired and hopelessI tried to kill myself (a flimsy attempt so Iâ€™m not surprised that it didnâ€™t work), obviously unsuccessful and Iâ€™m not sure what to do now. I feel really bad, Iâ€™m unsure whether or not to tell my therapist right now or wait until I see him next week. Iâ€™m afraid of coming off as attention whoring...really not sure what to do anymore. 

I canâ€™t talk to my parents because theyâ€™re not understanding at all, Iâ€™ve tried in the past and theyâ€™ve always belittled me. My dad once said my struggles were â€œsinglehandedly ruining the familyâ€.  I feel hopeless and full of guilt, Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™m burdening my therapist and everyone around me. 

Any advice is appreciated, thank you
