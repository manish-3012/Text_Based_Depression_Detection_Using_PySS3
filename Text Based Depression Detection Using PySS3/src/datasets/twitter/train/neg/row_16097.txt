Lifeâ€™s a sick jokeLifeâ€™s a sick joke. I wanna talk to my friends about my issues but not only can I not articulate whatâ€™s on my mind due to it being a mess but they also have lives and itâ€™s unfair to throw this burden on them. 

I have close friends who iâ€™ve shared countless deep secrets with...yet I just canâ€™t bring myself to communicate this hell Im in. Iâ€™m alone but not...

Iâ€™m so tired and Iâ€™m so overwhelmed with everything. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™ll have sudden bursts of moments of sensory overload and then apathy comes in. Then the cycle repeats.

Iâ€™m at my limit. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore because nothing gives me satisfaction or pleasure like it used too before. Everything is blank and... grey. I keep trying to do things because I believe that maybe one day Iâ€™ll feel that satisfaction you get for doing the activity, but Iâ€™m at my lowest point right now and my future looks very bleak rn. 

I canâ€™t keep going on likes this. Any advice I should take that might help?
