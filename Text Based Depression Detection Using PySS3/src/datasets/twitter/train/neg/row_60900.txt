Fantisizing 'accidental' deathDoes anyone else daydream abound dying? often I will think about how easy it would be to die in a car crash, or get mugged. Food poisoning, infection, randomly getting a deadly disease, the possibilities are endless. If you died like this instead of killing yourself, then no one would think you were a "coward" or just "seeking attention". People would actually care about you and not think less of you. People would view it as unfortunate, but nobody would blame themselves. If only it could be that simple.
