Oh man, do I have every reason not to die.And yet, with my first high school girlfriend, and a project that needs to be done, I sit here. I still have reoccurring thoughts of suicide, but I know I won't. Too much to live for, too many people depending on me, but GOD DAMN FINALS. I have a presentation of a project for my first final, and OOOOOOHHH BOY does that make me feel nervous, especially because I'm just starting the website that I will use to present. Nothing like last minute projects to make you feel like dying, amiright?
