my mental health is going to shitever since i got on birth control(about 2 months ago) ive been extremely depressed. id like to think i can deal with it but so much stuff has also happened in the past 4 months that has killed me inside and ive reached my breaking point. i used a throwaway account because ive posted in these forums so much i feel annoying.

so basically, ever since september ive been going through things. i was used for my virginity. this past november, i was sexually assaulted, blamed for it, lost my best friend, found out that an old friend of mine was murdered, my hair started falling out, ive been getting bullied online pretty bad, im losing my friends because i know theyre tired of me complaining, ive been getting little to no sleep and i have anxiety attacks/sleep paralysis constantly and im afraid to go back to sleep at times, and today, when i was perfectly okay and happy, my wallet and all my cards, cash, and identification were stolen right before i could do the last of my christmas shopping. i feel like this little thing was the breaking point for me. i dont know how to cope with all of this. my head is killing me, i cant stop crying, and i just want this all to end. im afraid to die but i dont know what else to do. i dont have enough money to talk to someone professionally. i feel like im falling apart and no one understands how bad it truly is, i cant live like this anymore. some of whats happened to me might sound trivial to some but all this stress is killing me, i never want to leave the house anymore. i just dont know what to do.
