All I can feel is myself getting worse day by day, I need help but I'm unable to tell anyone about how I feelI've never been able to verbally tell people how I feel, what I'm thinking and what is making me upset cos I get too emotional, so my brain just shuts off and no matter how hard I try, I can't speak. I can't help it, it's not my fault that I can't talk, I've repressed everything for 8 fucking years that it's become impossible for me to speak.

my thoughts are getting worse, I feel so fucking hopeless about the future, I can't even picture one. I'm going to a job interview for something I don't want to so cos I need the money, I hate living. School is miserable, I have no motivation. 

i dont even have the energy to hurt myself anymore, I'll just lay there crying and thinking of knives and hurting myself

I'm at my wits end and I don't know what to do anymore 

I need help
