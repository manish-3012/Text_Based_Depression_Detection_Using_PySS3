Scared. Asked for what I need. Got it. Still want to die.About to have my 3rd child in March. She has an ultrasound tomorrow to check the heart. I knew about it for 3 weeks, but just asked today. Supervisor said okay, coworker said they'd cover me for a few hours.

Now that I got what my gf and child needed, I feel the need to hurt/kill myself. Because I am not allowed to have good things happen, to get what I need or want, or for people to like/be nice to me.
