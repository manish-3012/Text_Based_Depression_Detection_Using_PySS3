After a month I'm still broken inside, sadness turned into angerI can barely get out of bed, each and every second I'm still thinking about you. How you broke up with me.

You left me when I needed you most, you left me when the tables were turned. I helped you through your troubles, now it was your turn to help me, but you ran. So fuck you for that, every cent and every second I wasted on you to make you happy and get you through it all, all that went through the gutter. You left me to rot. You left me because you couldn't handle my issues WHILE I HAD FOUGHT THROUGH YOURS.

FUCK YOU

Next Monday I have an appointment with a psychologist at my university. I hope he can help me continuing my life.
