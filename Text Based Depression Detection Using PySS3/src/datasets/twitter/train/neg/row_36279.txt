Thinking out loudI have been considering it for a bit now, weighing my options. I am currently away from the US. I thought going to a faraway country to do volunteer work would give my life purpose, make me feel like my life has some value and meaning, but, I am as lonely, depressed and miserable as ever. I am in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and I literally have no social life, no friends, no one to spend any waking moment with that isn't related to work. I've spent much of my life self harming and with severe eating disorders and for the last few years, they had been in remission, but now, they have returned. I am cutting myself almost daily again... I don't know what to do any more. 

I've tried, I swear that I have, but I don't have the courage to. I have been fantasizing perhaps using my unique position as a volunteer in the third world as a way to perhaps arrange to have someone kill me, thus freeing my family from any guilt or pain caused by my suicide. The only thing stopping me honestly is that I know that my mother would be upset if I did die...
