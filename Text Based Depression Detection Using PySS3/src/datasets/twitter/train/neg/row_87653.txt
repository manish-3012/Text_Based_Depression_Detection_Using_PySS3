How do you stop being worthless?How do you make yourself into something better? Something that isn't stupid, or dull, or ugly. I'm tired of being the trifecta of badness. You can be ugly and stupid as long as you're funny. You can be boring and ugly as long as you're smart. You can be dumb and boring as long as you're pretty. So what happens when you don't have anything in your favour? What if you're stupid, ugly, and boring? How do you get out of that? I'm just really tired of being so insecure. I always feel like I'm worthless and useless and stupid and dull, and I'm always questioning whether the people that hang out with me actually like me. I'm always playing the waiting game of when they're going to leave, because they always leave. Always. Whether it lasts a month or five years, everybody always leaves. And I'm just really tired of being left all the time. Maybe if I don't talk to any more people, maybe if I cut off the people I know now, then I can't be hurt by people leaving anymore. Maybe if I leave them first, it'll be better. I wish I could erase myself completely from their lives, from everything. I wish my family hated me so I could just put my affairs in order and find a cold ditch somewhere in the woods and kill myself. They'd get the life insurance and I'd be free. I'm worth more dead than alive anyway. I'd pack up all my stuff and donate it to charity or something, make sure there'd be nothing to clean up afterwards. I'd just disappear, and it would be better. I'm just so tired of feeling this way. I want to not be a burden, I want to remove myself from everything so I don't bother anybody with my existence. All I do is fuck up anyway, not like the world would be missing anything important. I just want to stop. I want everything to stop.
