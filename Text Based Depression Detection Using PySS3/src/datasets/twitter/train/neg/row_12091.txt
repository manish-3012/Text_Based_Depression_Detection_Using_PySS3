I CANâ€™T SEE MY PURPOSE IN LIFE ANYMOREItâ€™s been a long time that I have been questioning my purpose in life. I mean life hasnâ€™t been particularly fair to me just like everybody else but letâ€™s just say that if life kicks other people down, it kicks sand in my face while Iâ€™m down. I donâ€™t know what is the point of living, all the things that inspire me before just doesnâ€™t hold the same meaning to me anymore. I donâ€™t look forward to anything anymore, I just live by the moment. Nothing piques my interest, I donâ€™t like people in general because most are just fakers who look down on people less fortunate than them. I donâ€™t want to kill myself as of the moment but I feel like I am slowly dying inside and I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s worse, living this meaningless life or ending it.
