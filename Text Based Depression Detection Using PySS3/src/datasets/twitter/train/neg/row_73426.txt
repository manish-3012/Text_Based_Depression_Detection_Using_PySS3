Goodbye, thanks for the help.Gun loaded, just waiting to end it. Good bye Reddit I will be ending my life after post.  I want to say thank you for everyone whoâ€™s attempted to help me cope with my depression but unfortunately the depression has gotten worse and every second Iâ€™m awake is a pain. My life wasnâ€™t lived to the fullest as iâ€™m only 17 but that doesnâ€™t matter. Iâ€™m sorry everyone, goodbye.
