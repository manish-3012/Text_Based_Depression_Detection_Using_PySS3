I wish my thoughts would shut up for a secI'm so goddamn pessimistic. I don't say everything on my mind fortunately but a dark thought is always in the back of my head. It's like my brain is constantly always in debate.

I don't want to be that person, why does this keep happening? Everything gets on my nerves and I'm worried I'll lash out on someone. It's interfering with my life. Saying be more positive doesn't work. I act like that around everyone all the time, people tell me I'm nice. It just makes me feel fake.

Sometimes I just think about killing myself out of frustration to have some peace. I don't know if it has anything to do with multiple personalities. I can't pinpoint anything in my life that might be the cause,
