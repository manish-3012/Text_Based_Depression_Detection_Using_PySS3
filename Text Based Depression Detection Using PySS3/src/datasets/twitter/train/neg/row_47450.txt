My one year aniversary of the closest I ever gotI've obsessed over killing myself since I was 13. I am now 22. Almost a year ago, I got a hotelroom and gave it a shot. Even though I didn't die that night, I woke up the next morning and havn't felt the same since. I'm not sure what I lost that night, but it hasn't come back. Maybe I have brain damage from that night...maybe I have PTSD...maybe knowing that I have death as an option at any moment has numbed me. I tried to kill myself because I felt I got hurt too bad, and on my way to recovery some stranger kicked me while I was down. Since I tried to kill myself, I now know that recovery is not an option. Misery is kind of like anorexia - you hear about how once anorexics starve themselves to a certain point, thier brain gets all fucked and they have lost control over food. I feel like that brush with death was my starvation, and now I'll never be able to control the sadness. Sadness has always been my friend, but it wasn't everything. Now, it's all I see, it colors my world and sets me in a confused haze. The one year aniversary is comming up. I am so tempted. I'm making plans, trying to make the process more efficent and doable. Last time I tried to kill myself I was rash and acted on the spur of the moment. Now, I have time to plan. To prepare myself phsyically and mentally. To make sure that when I step into that hotel room, there's no turning back. Help?
