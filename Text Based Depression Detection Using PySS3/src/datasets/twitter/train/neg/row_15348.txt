rantto dad

if i could be born again, id still choose this life. id be fine with living every single fucked up thing all over. id live it over and over and over and over again. i wouldnt even hesitate. but only you. i would make sure you are not my dad. you make me sick. every day i wish if someone could radicalize you so u can leave us alone and go die somewhere in the middle east.
