My best friend is getting married tomorrow and I can't look forward to it at all.What the title says. Hate the thought of being stuck at an event and having to pretend to be happy when all I mostly feel is empty and wrong. Yesterday I ran accross a meme that was basically "two weeks to live :|. hey, two weeks to live! :D". And it got me fantasizing what I'd do with my last two weeks and how nice it'd be. I'd probably do mostly nothing, maybe have a party, watch things, play things, show my therapist tv shows. That's how I want to live. But I don't want to live at all. Been suicidal since last week, and while it doesn't sound like much I have a date (that got postponed because of bojack horseman).. so now I feel like I only have 6 months left in me. Most of which are going to be spent working, socializing once a week and therapy once a week. I'm just so tired from life. I've been suicidal on and off since 16, no attempts though. I'm 30 now. I feel like it's a good age to die. Haven't had a proper girlfriend, though I'm picky as well, since my interests are so narrow I can only talk to other geeks. Plus I'm gay in a small country. I keep going back and forth between being fine and being suicidal. I just wish it would stop. Meds don't really help anymore. Seeing my psychiatrist on Saturday but I don't even want to ask for help anymore, I think I'm lowkey beyond help from her. Since I'm so high functional. I wish dying was easier. I'd have done it long ago.
