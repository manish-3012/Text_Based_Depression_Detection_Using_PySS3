I feel so AloneI don't think im strong enough to keep on going anymore. Im miserable. Life is so shit and it honestly look like it will be better. I feel so alone and every single friend that I've had in my life is slowly drifting away and its all my fault. I have lost all motivation or energy to even get out of my bed and smile anymore. Everything that I found enjoyment in means nothing to me anymore and It saddens me so much. My life is only gonna go downhill and I honestly cant take it. Im so deppresed that it physically hurts me sometimes and I cant handle it anymore. I don't want to die but I just want the pain to stop. i just wanna go back to the times where I was at my happiest but I took those times for granted. I just want to be happy again
