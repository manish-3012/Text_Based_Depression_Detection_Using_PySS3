Christmas wishI don't have anyone in my life who cares about me.  My little sister that I was raising has found happiness and safety with a family and she said I need to just go away and let her be happy.  My goal, Christmas day, go to the mountains, find a really way out of the way area, fall asleep and just freeze to death.  In the spring, when I thaw, the animals and bug will have something to eat. At least I can be good for something.  But then, who knows, maybe some christmas miracle will happen and life will be good.  Who knows.
