I don't know what to doI've been going through it in my head for weeks now. I want to talk to my family, friends, but it just never comes up. I just keep pushing the idea into my head that how I feel doesn't matter. That I shouldn't burden them with how I'm feeling. Lately, suicide has been on my mind constantly. I've thought of different ways I could go through with it, how, and where it would happen. It went so far that, when I went for a drive to be alone last week, I brought some razors with me. I went down some back roads, on the countryside and I was ready. But I was scared, I didn't want to leave behind my family or friends. I was scared. What if right as it happens, I realize that I want to live? But it'd be too late. Everyday I live empty, I try to contribute to conversation, but there's always something missing. I never feel motivated to do anything I used to love. Drawing? Nope. Haven't drawn in weeks. I feel like I'm in a really deep, dark hole. I keep digging deeper, it's all I can do. But I want out. I hate it. I hate this feeling. I hate not wanting to be alive and being too chicken shit to do anything about it. Please help.
