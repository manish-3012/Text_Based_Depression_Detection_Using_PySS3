What's even the pointI've been depressed for years, already tried ending it once or twice before. I found a girl I fell in love with, and it felt like it was getting better for a time. But one afternoon I was on a date with her and I had the thought "Why keep going? Your life seems decent right now so what is the point in waiting for it to get worse again? ". That's almost all I've been thinking of nowadays, and I'm sure it's affecting my relationship. But I'm back where I used to be before her, and I feel like it really isnt worth it. A relationship used to feel good,  and I used to be happy,  but now all I can think of is how I'm ruining her life with my sob story bullshit and just find a bridge to jump off of.
