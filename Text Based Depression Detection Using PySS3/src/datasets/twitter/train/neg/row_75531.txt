My best friend is dropping out.She was the only reason i decided not to kms, as i didnt want to make her sad and it was the only thing that made me happy to talk to them. I lost the joy for things i used to enjoy, music, games, sports. Its all just feels like a way to kill time instead of have fun. Highschool sucks, losing all my friends, bad grades throughout 3rd-9th grade even when ive tried to get good grades. My best isnt enough for school to even get above an F. When i had a suicide plan in middle school my grandpa told me to wait and life will get better. I believed him as my dad never really believed in me, im the disappointment of the family, ugly, fat, dumb, unskilled. All i got from waiting is dead dog, mom with lung and kidney cancer, dead Grandpa, and now nobody in person left to talk to.
