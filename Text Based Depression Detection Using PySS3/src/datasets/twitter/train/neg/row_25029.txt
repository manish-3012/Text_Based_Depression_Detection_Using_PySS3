Help meI don't know what to do anymore. I've made this account to vent my feelings. I'm a 13 year old male and my life is just spiraling downhill first I got taken out of school because I was just losing it now I've failed online school. I feel like such a failure. I feel as the only way to escape this is by suicide. I already have a note written, a homemade noose and a place to hang it. I feel so worthless.
