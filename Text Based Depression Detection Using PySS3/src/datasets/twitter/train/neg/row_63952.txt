Still Thinking About ItSo a couple years ago I was fired from my job... That was the culmination of years of being miserable and abusing alcohol.  I was drunk a lot of the time (yes at work) because I was not happy.  I hated my job and where I was in life.  It was the proverbial vicious cycle. 

After I was fired I spiraled into a deep depression.  I thought about killing myself all the time.  Every single day.  What I told my therapist "I don't really want to kill myself.  I just don't want to be anymore."  I was lay in bed before my alarm went off praying (to no one in particular) not to wake up. 

After getting another job that I loathed my depression only deepened.  At the urging from my mother and sister I agreed to begin taking anti depressants.  I was also quitting the booze at the same time.  Apparently this was a bad combo because my suicidal ideation kicked into overdrive.  I was not only thinking about suicide.... I was actively planning mine.  I had a plan to wrap up some stuff and consolidate some financial stuff and then do it.  Thankfully my sister sensed what was going on and got me help.

I had a psyche eval, which does nothing to make you feel any less crazy, by the way.  Anyway, some tweaks to my meds and more intense therapy helped me.  In the time since I have gotten an amazing job which I love.  I have fallen in love with a woman who will soon become my wife.  My relationship with my family is as good as it's ever been...

So why do I still think about suicide every day????
