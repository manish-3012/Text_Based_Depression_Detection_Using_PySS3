Does anyone know the easiest way?i cant take this shit anymore. School is almost over but it feels like an eternity and thats the least part of the problems. I was recently kinda betrayed and yea now everyone kinda knows i have mental isuess. Besides that i hate myself so much. Im a hypocritical  bastard that begs for attention. Ironicly, i never wanted to step out much, just for the people i wanted to. I cant handle myself anymore i tried once but my mind stopped me now i am finally done. I cant take depression anymore. Anexiety is also killing me. I just want to rest. I just dont know i had suicidal wishes and its getting worse im scared that i will hurt someone i acctually care about. i dont need anyone to talk to i just want to know the easiest way to do it. Thanks
