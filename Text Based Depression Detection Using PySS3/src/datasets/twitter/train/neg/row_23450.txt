Anyone else wish nobody ever tried to help them?I had someone try to help me once. I thought it was a really good thing, I thought it was helping. It wasn't. It made it so much worse. I wish I had never met her. I wish she never learned about me. I wish she had never tried to help. I don't want help. I need something to kill me.
