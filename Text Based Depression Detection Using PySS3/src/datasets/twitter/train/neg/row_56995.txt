Does anyone know /u/LauraOfTheLye?A few weeks ago, /u/LauraOfTheLye made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/vlslw/i_am_the_worst_kind_of_person/) post to suicidewatch. He went through with his suicide attempt, but was rescued and hospitalized, and eventually returned to reddit.

Today he deleted his main account and all known alts. This worries me because it mimics the behaviour of his last suicide attempt, and because it seems to be an attempt to "put his affairs in order". If anybody knows anything about Laura that could be used to track him down before he hurts himself, I would very much appreciate it if you messaged me.

**UPDATE** Laura has contacted me, he is alive and well. Thank you all for your concern.
