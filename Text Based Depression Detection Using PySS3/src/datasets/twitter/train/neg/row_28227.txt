Iâ€™m seeing a therapist in 2 weeks, after waiting 17 yearsI tried to commit suicide aged 8 due to bullying, my school required me to see a psychiatrist but my mother was afraid I would be committed, so she had me lie.

I think that telling the psychiatrist what she wanted to hear was the worst decision I ever made, these issues have had almost 2 decades to mature and manifest in various different ways.

Iâ€™m a pathological liar, with a need for Machiavellian control and delusions of grandeur. Im incredibly depressed and almost constantly suicidal, the only thing preventing my suicide is my own ego.

I have to tell all this to a stranger in order to be better, so I can be a better person.

Iâ€™m just really scared and overwhelmed, Iâ€™ve never spoken about this with anyone before.
