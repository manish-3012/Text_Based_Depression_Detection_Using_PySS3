Back with the DemonsAll the darkness is too much, I can't fight the urge to slice up my arms. I'm so sad and alone. All my friends live overseas so I'm just bored while theyre asleep.
I just hate myself so much and can't cope anymore.
I'm not sure if I want to die but I definitely don't want to live.
