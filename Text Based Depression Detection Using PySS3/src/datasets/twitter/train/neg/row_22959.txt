I am fat piece of shit that is disgrace to our family and should just end itMy mother said this today just 6 hours ago, I have had trouble with depression lately but what my mother who has loved me and helped me in the past said, it's just too much for me. I have a knife, 15 000 mg of paracetamol and rope ready but haven't decided what is the way to go. I don't know why I made this post I guess  i just want to rant before that

I would have to life with my mother 3 more years before I could leave but where would I go? I don't have any savings, my grades are bad and I don't have any friends. hell I can barely write english
