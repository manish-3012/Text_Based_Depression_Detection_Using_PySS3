Well I guess this is itI tried to be optimistic. Iâ€™ve been unemployed since January, relying on my parents to take care of me and my daughter who I have sole custody of. It took almost two months to get my first interview. I have yet to receive another one, even though I apply to at least two jobs per day, and have since I became unemployed. I was informed today, two weeks after the fact, that I didnâ€™t get the job. Iâ€™m over it at this point. Why would good things happen to me, that would be too easy. My daughter is going to be staying with her mom for a few weeks starting next week so Iâ€™ll probably do it then. 

Before anyone says â€œthink of your daughterâ€ or â€œthink about this personâ€ or â€œthink about that personâ€

Iâ€™m fully aware Iâ€™m making a selfish decision. My daughter is 3 so sheâ€™ll forget me soon enough. My parents are aware Iâ€™m suicidal but they really arenâ€™t doing much. Theyâ€™re only giving me money because I have my daughter. I donâ€™t really have any friends, and the few I do have, Iâ€™m not even close to their top priority friends. Iâ€™m just that guy that shows up to play magic and makes funny self deprecating jokes. The girl I thought I had a thing with doesnâ€™t have feelings for me, so why bother? Iâ€™m $65000 in debt ($59000 now that they took my entire tax refund). All of my possessions are maybe worth $1000. Why try? At this point thereâ€™s literally no reason to. I expect any comments I get (not expecting any, nobody fucking cares when I post anyway) to try to dissuade me. Donâ€™t bother
