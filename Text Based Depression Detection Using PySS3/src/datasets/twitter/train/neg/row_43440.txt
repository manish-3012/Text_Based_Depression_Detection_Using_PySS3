not sure if i belong in this sub, but...i need help. i'm tired of being who i am. i tired of being in pain all the goddamn time. i'm tired of ruining every friendship i manage to make. i'm tired of feeling shit. i just need a break, and it's impossible. how do you take a break from yourself?
sorry if this is the wrong place for this.
