They say time heals all woundsThen why do I feel broken all the time? I've never had a meaningful relationship. I've never had a girlfriend, I've been strung along for so many years. I've never even kissed a girl and I'm already in my thirties. All I want is someone to love me or at least give me a chance. I've never admitted this to anyone, everyone assumes I'm a normal person that's has normal relationships but it's never happened for me. I've been rejected so many times I can't believe where the time has gone. What is this all for if it's not to share your life with someone you love? I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of being alone. I'm tired of being sad. I'm tired of being alive but I know I'm too much of a coward to do anything about it. I'm a waste of human life
