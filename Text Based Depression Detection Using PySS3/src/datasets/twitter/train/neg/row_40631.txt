My birthday is on the 21st of June. I turn 17. If things aren't okay by then I choose to die.I'm worthless , very few of my friends understand. I am in constant mental pain , I want to die every second of every day . I just can't fight anymore . If things aren't okay by then , I'll see you all on the other side. Love all of you
