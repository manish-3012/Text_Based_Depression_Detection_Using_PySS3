People don't give a fuck about how you feel until you actually kill yourself.My family couldn't give a fuck about me, no one does. They say suicide doesn't end your pain, it just transfers it to your friends and family. Well since I have no friends, you're damn right I want it to transfer to family. 

I hope it hurts them, so they know how it feels.
