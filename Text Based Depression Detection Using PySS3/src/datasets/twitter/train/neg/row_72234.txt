How do I move on? How do I accept I'm just not cut out for my dreams?Dreams are great but only one in a million can grow to be truly fantastic. I'm not that one, I've fought, struggled, grinded, and floundered only to see that now.

It was really nice dreaming it up aswell but oh well just another delusion down the drain I guess. But I just can't let go- I can't stop gripping onto the tail of this angelic hope and praying it sinks down to earth for me 

But Im not one in a million. No matter how many tell me I can be. I'm a gear- like everyone else. Fit to just tap away at whatever job thrown at me for the rest of time
