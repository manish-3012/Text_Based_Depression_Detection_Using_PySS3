Anxiety.I think it's the only thing keeping me breathing.
Once again I'm posting from my bathroom floor bleeding holding my razor blade.

How can I realise this isn't okay; but still I keep doing it?

I'm petrified of committing suicide and failing again, and going back to a suicide.
10 years ago; I was 15, I tried to kill myself twice; luckily for my parents I awoke vomiting everywhere and in turn woke them up.
I was off in an ambulance for a charcoal pump.

The second time my dad kicked the bathroom door in and grabbed my bleeding wrist, once again saving my life.

There's been to many cuts to recall over the last 14 years. 
Last year my then boyfriend followed me when I flew out of the house in rage knowing where I would go and park at a quarry I knew how to get into. He threw me in the car and took me home and sat at the end of the bed all night threatening to call the police and tell them I was suicidal knowing I couldn't handle the anxiety of that I managed to fall asleep.

In the last 4 months I've got 8 piercings and 3 tattoos to try and deter myself from cutting when something has happened; or when nothing has happened and my mind is battling, but the blade always wins. 

It comforts me in a way no human can, I cut and I cut and I cut until I'm vomit crying in my bathtub wishing away my anxiety of failing to kill my self.
