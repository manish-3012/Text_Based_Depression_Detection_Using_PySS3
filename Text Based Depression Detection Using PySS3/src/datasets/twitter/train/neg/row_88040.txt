Who even cares anymoreI'm fat, can't get fit, I'm sad, can't get happy. Nothing you do will matter in 100 years so what's even the point of doing anything? To get a feeling that lasts 5 minutes? I wish there was a reset button on life, where you could be a different person from a different family from a different country. I probably won't live to see the next solar eclipse. The world is turning to trash.
