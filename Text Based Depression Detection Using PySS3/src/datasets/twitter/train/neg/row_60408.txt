Death wish.For at least a year now I have been wanting to die. It's not that I don't have a future, or that I don't have a present. I have it all - people that love me, talent, money, etc.

But I'm just done with life. Everything bores me. I'm 25, but I feel like I'm 80. I drink or get high to make people interesting and to enjoy my life which I wouldn't really be able to do sober. There are things that bother me, like getting a job, not having certain pleasures in life, even regret my drinking habit, but I know that it's only a matter of time and patience and things fix themselves eventually. Yet, I'm sick of chasing happiness. I'm sick of being alive, almost disgusted by how I have to strive for happiness everyday. I wonder why happiness is all that we need, in everything. I, however, like to embrace sorrow cuz it enables me to think and wonder, while in happiness I'm ignorant but then I'm tired of sorrow as well.

I'm just tired of it all.

The only escape I find from real life is in movies and video games that are often times larger than life. But now I'd like to just die. I WANT to die. It surprises my friends when they hear me talk about commiting suicide so nonchalantly. I f***ing hate the fact that I don't have a choice in the matter. Everyone around me wants to just live and don't want to give others the option to die either. Nobody gave me a choice when they forced me into this dull as f*** world.

Being the living thing that I am I fear pain so I can't even kill myself without convincing myself to go on. Anyway, it would be great help if anyone could tell me some, lol, "pleasant" ways to kill my self. I'd prefer a quick death by shooting my self in the head, but where I live the gun laws are stringent.
