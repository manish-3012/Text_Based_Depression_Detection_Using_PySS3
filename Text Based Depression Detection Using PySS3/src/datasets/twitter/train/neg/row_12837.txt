What if i dont care....I have a question; let me give some context. I can think of, and have heard of billion logical reasons why I shouldn't commit suicide. Think of your family, your friends, your teachers! I know, I know...... but I don't care. Even according to my own beliefs, which I view as more important than anything else in the whole of reality, I believe suicide is wrong, immoral and illogical..... but I don't care. I know I'll be missing out on all the happy things, and a chance at a fulfilling life, all the possible good.......but I don't care! Cognitively I understand that I shouldn't kill myself, that I should keep living, but to me life isn't worth it. I don't enjoy any of it. Every single moment is at the least discomfort. I am never satisfied or even content. And at the worst, I am screaming in my mind because the pain is pure agony. I don't enjoy analyzing data so why would I pursue it as a career? Same with life. I don't enjoy life so I don't want to continue it. To some extent I can oppose my emotions to obey logic, but not all the time, not forever, not life. We as humans need emotions to motivate us. We can't do anything continually if we lack the emotion, the care, the motivation to do it. This is why I can't continue living when I don't care. What should I do, and how when I don't have the motivation to do it? How do I do anything, including what will help me in my illness, if I don't care? Help!
