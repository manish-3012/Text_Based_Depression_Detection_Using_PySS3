The Claustrophobia of suicideI feel so suffocated by my suicidal thoughts, every day they get more and more pressing. i keep feeling more and more hopeless. i don't know what to do, i tried getting medical help but i only get one appointment every 6 months. My house has thin walls so i can't phone helplines without my family over hearing it. Which leads to another problem, my family and friends have no idea how to handle it and just overwhelm me with various 'ways to be happy' etc etc, they don't understand and end up making things worse by just suffocating me, with fluff. they don't or just refuse to acknowledge the underlying reasoning for my suicidal thoughts, mental illness, and just end up making me feel like shit for feeling suicidal (they don't mean to, they just don't know how to handle it). This has lead to a situation where i can't voice my struggle and just suffering in silence and i sacred i gonna lose that struggle if this keeps going
