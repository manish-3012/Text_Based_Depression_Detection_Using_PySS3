I want to fucking kill myselfI just got 33/200 on a MAJOR FUCKING EXAM for calculus. If I get a 100 on everything else I might be able to make a high B but there is no way in hell I can do that. Fuck my life, fuck independent learning calculus. My parents are gonna bring this up for the rest of my life.
