I'd rather kill myself than keep living alone.Copy from my reply.

I'm sorry. I have told my story so many times, every now and then I forget to re-tell it. I am in a much better place now. Maybe I have jus tricked my brain, but that is at least what I think. Not that it's a particularly good place when it comes to being in good places. It's better than what was before. I go to school, work and I have "control" over my life. That issue I feel I have taken under control for now (could probably shatter from just about anything). However I don't actually enjoy or find my life pleasurable, nothing about it really. I used to play video games, prior to that I played volleyball. Non of these activities, actually no activity at all give me any meaning. Or insentive to think life is enjoyable, I'm even considering smoking weed in desperation of trying to do something that would make my life pleasurable. (not that I think it will.) There is one thing though that I long for, someone I can be completely honest with, someone that I won't judge and won't judge me. Someone I can open myself completely to, surrender and have her (him? not sure.) surrender to me. I see that friendship can be fine for someone that enjoys doing things, sports, reading what ever really. But I don't enjoy it. And the friendships I have, all seem lacking of something that I would want to share/have with another person. Title now explains how I feel. (I apologize for the lenght, incoherency and grammatical errors. At work so I didn't have time to formulate myself how I'd probably want to.)
