How can you judge me for not wanting to live?Chronicly ill. I'm either feeling sick with a very uncofortable body feeling, very tired or my stomach hurts non-stop for months. Went to 1000 doctors and specialist no diagnosis. I'm just laying here enduring the torture without making any contribution to society or getting anything done. 

I feel it's super egotistical for the people around me to guilt-trip me about contemplating suicide. I didn't choose to live and I don't want life and now I need to go trough it because otherwise it will hurt my breeders who got kids because of egotistical reasons in the first place. I would never be so egotistical to not let someone kill themselves because I know that for most people it is the best option.

Nobody knows if life's worth living, we don't know how it is to be dead. Maybe death is the best thing there is. And I believe that death can never be as painfull as living like this and I know this is not gonna heal. I tried everything!
