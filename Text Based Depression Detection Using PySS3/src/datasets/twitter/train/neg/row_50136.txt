I think itâ€™s timeIâ€™m absolutely broken. Iâ€™ve relapsed for the first time in really years and I just canâ€™t stop hurting myself now. Iâ€™m just tired and too broken and full of self hate. I donâ€™t think I belong here. I donâ€™t think I deserve to be alive. I just think itâ€™s time. Iâ€™ll probably end up hanging myself later. Oh well, I know itâ€™s what I deserve and I guess itâ€™s the only way I have to stop my sadness.
