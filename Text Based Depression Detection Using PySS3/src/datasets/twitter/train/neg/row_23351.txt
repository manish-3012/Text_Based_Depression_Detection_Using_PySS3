deathi apologize for any fucked up grammar or anything. i cant be bothered to fix it

I'm so tired of my life. I fucking hate everyone else and myself. The past 3 months have just been CONSTANT self sabotage. I can't go a day without fucking up a whole aspect of my life. I actively choose to do this. Anything to make me feel worse.. I just can't take much more. I recently tried to explain to my friends how I am to a point where I am living on the edge, and that I needed advice, but it blew up in my fucking face. I'm not someone who really opens up so not getting much of a response and just being told "I'm sorry" has just...pushed me over the edge. I was staying alive for other people but I've come to realize it's pointless since they value my life less than *I* do. It just makes me sad thinking about how everyone is so used to me being mentally unstable they don't see it as serious.. I just have nowhere else to turn. I don't think I'll be able to open up to anyone I care about again anytime soon. I can't get professional help. There's nowhere else to go. Every day I sit and almost bring myself to doing it and force myself to stop.. I just. I do not know what to do. I just wanna let go man ):
