I miss you JessI just feel like I just wanna end it all the time but at the same time I donâ€™t wanna leave the ones that I love. You see there was this girl and it was going great and I loved her and then she cut me off unexpectedly and it broke me. Ever since then I havenâ€™t been the same. i miss you Jess.
