I thought I was doing better latelyBecause i have been doing better, iâ€™ve become numb and got a lot better at ignoring how I feel.

But i think since the holidays are coming up and iâ€™m going to be alone that thatâ€™s why itâ€™s coming back. I havenâ€™t felt this bad in so long. I canâ€™t stop thinking of the negative. My life is shit. I canâ€™t stop envisioning myself getting plastered and hanging myself on thanksgiving.

i have no one and nothing.
