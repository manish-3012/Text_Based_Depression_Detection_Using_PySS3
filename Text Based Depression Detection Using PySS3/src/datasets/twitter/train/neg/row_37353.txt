What's the point in living if my life sucks?I'm 20 and I still live with my abusive parents because I can't make any money to get out of here because I'm too mentally ill to hold a job. I'm covered in scars from self harm and I keep relapsing and I tell no one because everyone gets mad at me when I relapse. I have no talents at all, nothing about me is special. I'm not attractive or anything. I'm not successful or rich. I have no friends, no one wants to be friends with a freak like me. The only person I have is my partner and they deserve so much better than a useless, fucked up piece of shit like me. Nothing is helping, I've tried everything, therapy, meds, hospital, etc... Nothing has helped. I should've killed myself a long time ago.  Maybe my time will be soon. I've tried many times before and failed everytime. Because of course I did, I'm a failure at everything, I can't even kill myself properly... I'm so sick of living. I just want this to end. I'll never be happy. Never.
