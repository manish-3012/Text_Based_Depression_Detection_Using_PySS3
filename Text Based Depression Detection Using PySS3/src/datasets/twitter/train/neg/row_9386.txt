I have no meaningful relationships/life isn't for everyoneDon't assume I'm lazty/shy and tell me to put myself out there; I do that already.

Don't assume in some some disgusting entitled low life person; I don't demand/people be my friend etc. Its hard to judge your own character but I certainly try hard to be a good person.

I'm not trying to blame others. But it seems the person who I've become has no proper place in my society. I can think of one solution

Don't tell me things get better; they have and I still end up the same
Don't tell me it's a phase; this is nonstop from 11, just shy of half my life I'm like this
Don't tell me I'm not thinking straight; I've spent countless hours in my head over this

Even at times when I feel some fulfilment, feel love from a large group of good friends girlfriends and family, feel in touch with nature, I still want to die

Don't call me selfish, I've come very close to ending it all before. There was a period where I was only staying alive to keep others from being devastated. Even still, why can't I be allowed to die. Living is pain, those who claim they'll be sad are only adding to the pain, I didn't ask to be born

I very so desire to slide a knife through my neck a few times and then experience my last few minutes in pure bliss

I don't know if I want an afterlife, to be mentally/spiritually non-existant and completely gone from the void is better than what I have. Any heaven would be hell if the way I am doesn't drastically change in the spiritual passing process

Being happy shouldn't be too much to ask : (

I don't want this pain
