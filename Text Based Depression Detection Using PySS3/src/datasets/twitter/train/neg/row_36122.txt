The more suicidal I become, the better I feel!Being suicidal is great! Nothing matters, cause I'm gonna die anyway! Wooo!

Just counting the days until I finally get the courage to run out to the woods outside my dorm to hang myself. I think I'm getting close. My current plan is to do it December 1st, that way I can see my family one last time before I'm dead. I'm honestly pumped.
