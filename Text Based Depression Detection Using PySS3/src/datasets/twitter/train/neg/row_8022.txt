child protective servicesi'm 15, i have extremely bad social anxiety, a depersonalization disorder and i'm suicidal.

i skip school a lot, not because im lazy its because i'm scared to go, i would've had a job for the past two weeks for school but i didn't go cause i was scared, and honestly its not a huge deal i could just work for two weeks in a month.

tomorrow, school starts again and at 3pm ( my school ends at 1pm ) my teachers and child protective services want to talk to me and my parents.

i feel like such a fucking disappointment honestly, my parents are nice, they dont make me do stuff or hit me or whatever

last week, i was ready to kill myself i was 100% convinced i was going to die today, i put on my shoes and was about to leave the house but my mom stopped me and comforted me.

i'm really really lonely, i don't have any IRL friends.

i really just cant take any of this, i hate living.
