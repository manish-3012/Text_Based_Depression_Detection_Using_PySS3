Sadness is crushing meThis world is full of so so so much sadness itâ€™s never ending. Wherever I look thereâ€™s sadness, whoever I speak too has some sadness, whatever I read is some sadness, whatever I watch there is sadness itâ€™s everywhere and itâ€™s never going to end. There is no where to run no where to hide itâ€™s never going to go away. No matter what happens thereâ€™s sadness itâ€™s the only constant in this world. The weight of this is so heavy itâ€™s crushing with relentless pressure. Itâ€™s only been 9 days of this year and all there has been is sadness. I wish there was some way out I wish there was some end but there is not. It will never end. Turned 24 on the 8th of jan, spent it alone spend New Years alone spent Xmas alone. This is the most horrible couple of weeks and I donâ€™t know if this year I can make it through it. I just want it to be over, no way out of this sadness.
