NewI'm thanking about starting suicide videos on YouTube. I know there are already so many but to people really listen to them? There are even movies and shit about it everywhere but who really listens.  I will tell you who does the once who fill the same way as that person does or did.  I don't want to try and prevent it or lecher anyone on it all that does is makes matters worse for that person.  I do want to help others but i also want someone to help me.
