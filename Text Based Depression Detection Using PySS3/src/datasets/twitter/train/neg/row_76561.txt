Iâ€™m tired of never being happy and even going as far as digging to find things to be sad about and it never endsI feel like Iâ€™m constantly getting bullied by my brain, no matter how many good grades I have, I get one C on a test and suddenly feel like a total failure and that Iâ€™ll never succeed in life, no matter how many people tell me Iâ€™m pretty, one bad comment about my appearance and Iâ€™ll think itâ€™s true and start hating how I look, I feel like Iâ€™m at the mercy of external circumstances and other peopleâ€™s opinions, itâ€™s like I have no solid core and my opinion about myself is constantly going from 0 to a 100 then back to 0 again and it just keeps going, I feel like my only 2 options are total isolation from society or just dying at this point
