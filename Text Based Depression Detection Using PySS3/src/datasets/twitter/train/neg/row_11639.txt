It would be nice if life didn't suckLife is hard. Lots of people agree on that, but for me, life just seems to hard to be worth it. It's generally not an enjoyable experience. I feel like plate of bad food that I'm being force-fed. I can't just stop eating it, as much as I wish I could. Maybe if I wasn't so lazy I'd be able to make an effort to enjoy life. I'm kind of stuck with that, though, because it's kind of difficult to stop being lazy when you're too lazy to. Anyway, I want to die. It would be nice if someone handed me a gun. Either that, or tell me how to make life not suck. Thanks. &lt;3

TL;DR Life is hard, and therefor not worth it. I want to die.
