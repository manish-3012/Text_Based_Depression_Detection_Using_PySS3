idk what else to dolike i dont want to kill myself because my girlfriend broke up with me, but rather because she was the only thing stopping me from doing it , so im like, well might as well now. also im really tired of "dont do it because it will affect your friends and family" i know it will, but i really dont care anymore, i cant deal with the suffering of life any more, so let them deal with the suffering of my death
