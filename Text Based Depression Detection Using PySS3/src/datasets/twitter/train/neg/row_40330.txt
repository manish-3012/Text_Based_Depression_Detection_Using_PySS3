Ready To Go.Just another generic post. Honestly, I'm just tired of living. Tired of feeling miserable. Tired of knowing that I'm never going to change anything. Most of all, I'm just really tired of being alone. I'm not very good at interacting with people, and the weight of my social deprivation is heavy. I feel like I'm insane. Not worth anything or anyone. I don't even deserve to live.
