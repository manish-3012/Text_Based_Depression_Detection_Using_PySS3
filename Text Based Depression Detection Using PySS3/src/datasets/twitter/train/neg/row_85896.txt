I'm sick of being deformedI was born male but tried to transition into a woman. I wanted to look normal, feminine, to feel less bad about my body. But even after many years I'm stuck in a guys body. My boobs didn't grow, my hips didn't widen. I'm fat, but not in a "thick" or "curvy" way. Just fat as a dude. My face looks androgynous at best.

I fucking hate all this, to be honest. I don't see any point in continuing this joke of a life and the only thing holding me back is lack of a sensible way to kill myself.
