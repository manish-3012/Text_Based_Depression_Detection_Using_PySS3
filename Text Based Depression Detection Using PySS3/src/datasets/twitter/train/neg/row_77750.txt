I do not fear death, since it's better than where I even live...Hey, I'm a 17 year old male who was born in England.

Recently, I have noticed the downfall of our country, Article 13, Brexit, the pornography block etc.

As someone who has been going through a domestic abuse case (which no one believes because I'm a man who is the victim) I have noticed that I have had less help offered to me because of the fact I am a man who is in severe depression. I feel like all these stupid regulations are targeted specifically at me; I have a really bad sex drive, which means pornography is the only way to relieve it since no one really likes me IRL, and of course how dare I have freedom to relieve my tensions.

The education system at least where I live is shit, my county has the worst education of any county in England, and I feel like every single odd is stacked against me. I have been bullied countless times due to the fact I am homosexual, and no one seems to give a shit about the fact I am the one being bullied.

I have tried to go to therapists, but most of them are too busy with women complaining about the tiniest things, so people like me who DESPERATELY need help are being turned away.

This place is slowly becoming worse, soon I doubt I will even have any freedoms of any kind... so I just want to die, because it's more peaceful than trying to exist in a country where everything is against you.

I've tried multiple times to commit suicide; unfortunately not succeeding, I hope someday I will be able to enter Death itself, so I can finally rest without any hassles left in the world.
