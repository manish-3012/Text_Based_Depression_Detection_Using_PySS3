I donâ€™t know why I keep posting hereI know that realistically, it doesnâ€™t do anything good for me at all, but I canâ€™t stop. I guess Iâ€™m just fantasizing about a world where anyone actually cares. It isnâ€™t this one, Iâ€™ll tell you that.

When I wake up in the morning, the first thought on my mind is drugs and alcohol. Hundreds of people hate me and would be genuinely happy if I were to kill myself. I have stalkers who hate me and I havenâ€™t had decent sleep in years.

I just donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m still here. If I didnâ€™t know any better, Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m just here for the stupid hedonistic part of me that loves being drunk and doing opioids.

In the end, nothing I wrote here matters, nothing Iâ€™ve ever done matters, and I donâ€™t matter. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this.
