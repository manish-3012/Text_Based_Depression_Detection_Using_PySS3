Joining the 27 clubSuicide has been something thatâ€™s played on my mind for as long as I can remember. Iâ€™ve never looked to the future because itâ€™s just never occurred to me that Iâ€™d stick around for it. 
I live in a strange city where I really have no friends (not the woe is me type of no friends. I genuinely have 0 friends) and thatâ€™s not for want of trying. 
I have 20 morphine tabs, 15 Valium and a veritable fuck tonne of gross spirits in my basement which I hear calling my name. I donâ€™t even really know why Iâ€™m writing this here but seeing as I have no family and no friends Iâ€™d like to say goodbye to somebody. Take care of each other and tell those close to you how much they mean to you. Big love xx
