I feel disconnected from anything.Hi, first of all, sorry if ny english isn't the best, i'm from MÃ©xico and i don't speak it that often.

I'm 24 years old, I've been in treatment against suicide for almost 6 months, i tried it already 3 times, sleeping pills, jumping off of a bridge and pills again.
That last time, i don't know why, but i got fucking scared and threw the pills against the wall and my brother noticed the noise, that's when i started to get help.

I always got this feel where i shouldn't be around my family because they always looked happy between them, they drink, they talk, etc. and every time i tried to experience that, i was moved aside, ignored or directly: "Shut up"

My mother and my brother knew about this after the pills incident a few months ago, and it was supossed to be private, i wasn't ready to talk about it, but i was feeling loved finally, i was feeling better.

Atm, i visited my family and all is happening again.
I tried to get along with them but now, I'm alone in the living room, they're outside, doing their stuff, drinking and i can hear my mom telling them about my shit, and i can hear all my family saying that i'm bitching about them ignoring me and that she shouldn't care about anything about me because i will be fine.

I'm not feel like i'm fine, i just feel like something is squeezing my chest, it hurts so much, i can't do anything, like: go there and ask them to stop.
I just need someone to talk, i would talk to my friends but they don't know anything about this and, idk, i don't want to talk to someone that i know already, i don't want to feeled judge.

I don't want to do something stupid, i was getting better, i'm fucking scared.
