I kinda regret not going through with itI've considered suicide a lot in the past, but never went through with it because I thought my death would be causing more issues for them than I would if I just lived.

I was wrong. I'm an underachiever, a lazy bum, and whenever I actively try something, it blows up in my face. I have horrible social skills, am constantly getting sick, look like a fucking gremlin, and can't hold a job to save my life. Issues I have no power to change anything about, and those that I brought upon myself compounded into me becoming a bottomfeeder NEET. 

I stay with family members and mooch off of them. All I literally do for the household is cook breakfast once every other month, but I use their wifi, use their electricity, drink their water, share their food, sleep in their beds, and leech off them like a human parasite. 

I've tried to fix my problems, I've tried to be a useful member of society, but I always fail. I try to get a job, don't make it past the interview. I try something online, it blows up in my face. 

My point is that I caused more problems than a dead man would, which is why I abstained, and family members have told me that themselves also, they've told me that I should just kill myself and be done. 

They aren't wrong, and my current existence can't be called 'living'.
 
I took some time to reflect, and I realise that I set myself up for failure from the very beginning. To whoever's reading this, I hope you haven't fucked yourself as much as I have.
