I think I'm in too deep and I'm afraid no one can help me anymore.When I was young I was full of life, then the bullying started to get really bad. I had no friends. I turned to sports got thin and beautiful and popular, but unfortunately it didn't stop the hardship. I've been in multiple relationships with abuse and I struggle to have a connection with my father sometimes cause he carries the same mental illnesses as me. My mother is virtually out of the picture due to the fact she enabled my rapist and is a narcissist. I think truly the only thing that keeps me going at this point is my dog.. and the mere fact that I must have been a reason I kept going. Through all the pain to be where I am now, but I'm really unsure. I've been thinking more and more and talking less. I really need some advice right now and Reddit is the only place I can really turn..
