Need some help. Willing to do what it takes, but how?Feeling extremely vulnerable and stressed out right now. Was seeing a therapist for several months and that helped a lot, but no longer able to continue seeing. Almost took the the plunge on Saturday, but the crappy weather, of all things pulled me back. Feel like I am losing control of my life and maybe my mind.  I would love to go back to some form of therapy but not exactly rolling in cash right now.  You guys have any tips for getting low cost or free counseling? The previous therapist was with my school, but anything like that wont be available until the Fall, and even then, its not guaranteed. Any advice would be appreciated.
