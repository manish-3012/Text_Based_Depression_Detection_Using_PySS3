Everyday I think about suicideThe past month or so Iâ€™ve thought about ending things and how it would just be easier than dealing with all the shit I put up with on the daily. Thinking about my daughter is ultimately what stops these thoughts and how I donâ€™t want to leave her motherless. But the thoughts always come back eventually.
