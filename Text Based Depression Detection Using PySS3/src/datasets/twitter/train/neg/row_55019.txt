No Other OptionI see no other option other than committing. At the start of the pandemic, I lost my part time job, and halfway through it my mother kicked me out of the house for being bisexual. 

I lost all of my friends, my girlfriend turned out to be a catfish, and now Iâ€™m getting kicked out of my apartment because I canâ€™t pay my goddamn rent. I have nowhere to go and no money to pay for a fucking motel or something.

I am officially done with life.

This world has never been kind to me.

Iâ€™m done.
