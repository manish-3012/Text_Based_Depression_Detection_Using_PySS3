I honestly don't know where else to ask it, so I think here is the best place.I'm planning on seeing a therapist, what is their stance on illegal shit. Let's say I do illegal shit and I think it is vital for me to tell them about it, what can they do about it? Will they have to contact the cops or my parents since I'm under 18?
