Why does suicide have to be so hard?Why does suicide have to be so hard?

 I hate having to research all these methods and having to beat the survival instinct and all. 

Also, the methods themselves are hard to carry out, as the noose never knots properly, or deadly enough poisons aren't available. OTC medications never kill you, they just destroy your health without ending your life, and even if they do, you go through terrible pain, and there is no guarantee of death. You can't buy a gun in my country either.

 I just want to go to sleep and never wake up again. 

Why is that too much to ask for?
