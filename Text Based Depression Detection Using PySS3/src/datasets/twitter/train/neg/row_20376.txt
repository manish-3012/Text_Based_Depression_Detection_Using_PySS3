Something always set me backI honestly feel like I'll never move on from my ex. She just deleted our old messages on facebook, but accidentally did the thumbs up sign and I asked her if she was okay because I keep getting doctors appointment texts for her on my phone. She left the conversation, she could have at least let me know if she was okay. First words we've spoken to each other since November and that's what happens. Fuck this world man, fuck it! 

The only way I can cope is by getting high. I do cocaine now. Never touched drugs before in my entire life and now all I do is get high near enough every night. 

I just don't understand how unlucky one person can be.
