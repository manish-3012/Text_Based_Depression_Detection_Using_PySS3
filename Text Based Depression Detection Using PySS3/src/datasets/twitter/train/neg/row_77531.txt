I dont want to die, but i dont want to live eitherI'm severely depressed. And have been for quite awhile.

I'm 28 years old, and I have nothing to show for my time on this planet. I just no called/no showed my job due to depression and anxiety.

I have no job, I have no friends in my new town, and I have no health insurance to pay for anti-depressants let alone a therapist.

I'm so tired all the time, and I have nothing positive to talk about anymore. I dont want to burden my friends from my old town with my depression, so I act like it's all okay in my neck of the woods when I talk to them.

The only thing thing that makes me feel half normal is going to class. But once class is over. That normal feeling subsides. And it's back to darkness. I dont want to kill myself. Because I love my pets, and i know they love me. So i guess that's one good thing i have going in my life.

I just want someone I can talk to about this stuff without feeling like I'm a burden. I'm usually not one to reach out and talk about my feelings. I'm usually pretty good at acting happy, and cracking jokes all the time. No matter how sad I am inside.

But something about today is really wringing out my soul. And now here I am on reddit spilling my guts to a bunch of strangers.
