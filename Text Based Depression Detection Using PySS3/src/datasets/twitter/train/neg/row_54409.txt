BrokenSo many plans that never were to play out.Â 


We never even took a new, fresh picture.Â 

I didn't have time to help you get your card and help you get candy.

I didn't get to take you to that concert in April.Â 

We never got to have our spring picnics and our camping trips.Â 

We didn't put very much into that large glass canister, although you put more in than I did.

We were never able to go to a show together.

You never got around to baking me a cake and letting me see how good of a baker you are.*Â 

Also, we never went back to HH like we wanted.

We never hung our "Grow With Us" original art.

We never went on a Potomac River Cruise, which is something I wanted to take you on.

We never really walked very much or even got out of my house very much because almost the entire time we knew each other, it was cold.Â 


These are just a few examples of plans that never materialized. It really does break my heart but I now realize that you and I aren't meant to be. That doesn't mean that I don't still care about you. I can't just flip a switch and not love you anymore. We just aren't good for each other, and that sucks. There is so much more that I could write and want to write, but what's the use? You'll never see this because I can't send it to you. I just wish we wouldn't have ended up like we did because there is so much about you that I absolutely adore. All these memories, these left behinds, these plans that will never come to fruition. You meant everything to me.


*At that restaurant on the way to our first real date hiking and exploring, when you showed me the pictures of your cakes I was impressed and thought it was really cool that you were into something like that.Â
