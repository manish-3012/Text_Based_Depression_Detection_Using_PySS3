any advice?I have been in a very bad place for the past 3 years. Iâ€™ve tried committing suicide a couple times, I also think that i have anxiety, depression and body dysmorphia (not trying to self diagnose). I have so much hate for myself. I overthink way too much which leads me to a dark place. I am too scared to tell my mom what iâ€™m feeling so i bottle it all up. Idky iâ€™m scared since ik that she struggles with anxiety and depression aswell so sheâ€™ll understand me. Any advice?
