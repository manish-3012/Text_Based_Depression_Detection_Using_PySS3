I dug myself into such a shithole, suicide might be the only way out.I am male, 26, soon to be homeless, absolutely broke, PTSD makes it impossible to work, my depression made my dad cut contact with me, my mom is about to do the same. I got no money, no place, no health insurance, can't work, with huge amounts of debt. Can't get into therapy.

My childhood consisted of vast emotional, physical and from time to time sexual abuse. I know now I should be able to pull myself together on my own, as friends and family keep telling me but I can't. I just can't anymore. I still feel the pain and self-hatred, especially now in my mid 20s. Suicide seems so sweet. I don't know how to navigate life like other people do. It's best, I hope, to acknowledge that, as the weakest link in the chain, I should cut myself off. Can't support myself, so instead of leeching, I should rather go...
