I let everyone walk over me and i hate myself for itIt hurts a lot. I feel numb everytime i meet someone new. I know they'll use me, so why am i letting them into my life? Simple, i don't give a fuck anymore. I feel worthless and pointless. I'm living through this even though i can choose to stop it. This maybe is the last thing everyone is gonna hear from me. I just need advice to make myself want to go through it, it doesn't matter what advice. Just.. helpful advice.
