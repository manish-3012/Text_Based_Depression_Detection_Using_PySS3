I cutted for the first time last night... Not that deep thoI didn't go deep at all. I just got 3 pinkish barely visible thin scars.

It was 1 am and I've been thinking about trying to cut for some time. I said I should just do it.

I got a fruit knife and a sharp knife. the fruit knife didn't do anything. I took the sharp and cutted a bit.

I felt so happy. It's hard to describe. I did it again and went deeper . I didn't bleed or anything. I just cutted slightly until I got a slightly visible scar.

I always feel empty, but after I cut I felt so happy. I started laughing and smiling. Looking back I was acting like a psychopath. I felt tho very happy.

The sucidal thoughts and loneliness was gone for that time. I didn't feel them.

However I feel like my cuts are invalid because I didn't go deep. I feel like I should go deeper for it to count as self harm. There are people who bleed and i barely scratched the surface. I feel like my cutting doesn't count.

I know self harm isn't healthy but I didn't go deep at all so it shouldn't be a problem. I kinds wanna do it again. But my parents are awake currently so I can't do it.

Is it really that bad for your health ? If you don't bleed, what's the problem?

How should I be feeling? I'm not feeling bad, I kinda feel like I wanna do it again but at the same time I know it isn't that healthy so I feel like I shouldn't....
