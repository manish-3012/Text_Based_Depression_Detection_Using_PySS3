How to Say GoodbyeAfter 2 failed suicide attempts, spurred on by drunken antics, I decided to be sober for my last attempt and plan it completely. The date is coming up and I'm trying to sort out everything to make it at least convenient for my family.

I think the hardest part is saying goodbye. While I love my family and friends, they've never really understood my feelings. It's always brushed under the rug and forgotten. Just like the last time I tried to commit suicide.

I think I'm just rambling. With the date coming up, I feel anxious. I'd like at least some people to know before I'm gone. And by some people, I mean others that may be able to understand.
