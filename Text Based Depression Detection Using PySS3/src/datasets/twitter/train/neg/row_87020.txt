I'm just so indifferent towards living.I don't think I'm ever going to kill myself but if somebody did it for me or if I got really sick or something like that I really wouldn't even care. That'd be pretty great, actually. 

It's second nature for me to shut myself in my room away from everybody and lose myself through escapism. Everything else is just too much work. It's too much work to study, it's too much work to work, it's too much work to go outside or talk to other people, etc. I just don't see the point of doing any of it, either. I've lived in a fantasy world in my own head my whole life and I'm just starting to realize that and I don't know how to live in the "real world". 

I don't have any friends and it seems like everyone would prefer it if I wasn't around. I don't really feel a connection to anyone else. There's a wall between me and everyone else in the world. 

I do have goals and aspirations but they're all stupid, infantile shit that will probably just crash and burn if I did pursue them anyway.

I just really don't want to live anymore. I know all my problems are self-inflicted or constructed or whatever and that they're fucking minute compared to basically every other depressed person on the planet but I just don't want to do this anymore. I can't do this. It's all too much and I don't have the energy to do it. I've always taken the easy way out of everything and death is a whole lot easier than being alive. 

I wish I had the bravery to kill myself but I don't. I need someone else or something else to do it for me. I don't want to be alive anymore. I hate myself and I hate being alive. I despise myself.
