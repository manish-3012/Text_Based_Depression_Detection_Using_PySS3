I almost killed myselfTitle says it all. I've been all over the place lately. I'm in therapy, but I'm in that it gets worse before it gets better stage. 

My ex girlfriend, except she isn't really, told me earlier don't be surprised if you find out she killed herself. She's bipolar and self medicates. I called a suicide hotline to get advice on her.

Everyone in my life just needs me to pick them back up then they do whatever they want. 

I got so pissed I just got in my car and went for a drive. Without even realizing it I was going way too fast. I slowed down, but right before I turned back into my neighborhood I jerked the shell to the right hoping to put my car in a ditch and flip it. I immediately jerked it back because I didn't want to die.

Now I'm just sitting at home. I want to go smoke an entire pack of cigarettes just so everyone else can get some experience watching someone self destruct.
