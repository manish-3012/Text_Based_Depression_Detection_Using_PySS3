No connectionI am and have been unable to build a significant connection for 4 years now. I don't have close friends or anyone to talk to. Tried online friendships as A substitute, but it fills me with nothing but void, I feel so desperate to share my feelings yet most of The Time I am unable to do so, sometimes I can spend more than A month without even going out, I feel pathetic and worthless. I've never blamed anyone or anything but myself. I feel like i'm done I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like I tried everything, I wish I wasn't living in a self-made isolation chamber
