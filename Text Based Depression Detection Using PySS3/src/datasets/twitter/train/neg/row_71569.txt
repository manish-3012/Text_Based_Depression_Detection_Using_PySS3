Tonight I will be dead.I just posted this if you guys want to ask something to a guy who lost his hope on life, on this system.I am basically dead. Tonight I will vanish completely. I dont want to talk about why I have come to this point and I can say that there is no god. At least no god upon me. I never even intended to hurt or harm anyone in anyway in any point of my life but my life so far has been struggle. I just want all you guys to also know that deciding to kill yourself is really hard, the fear of death is so strong that I dont think anyone possibly did end their existence because of a 'simple' or 'unnecessary' reason.
