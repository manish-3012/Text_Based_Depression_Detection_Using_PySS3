Itâ€™s Christmas Eve and Iâ€™m sitting in my bathroom, listening to my girlfriend yell at meThe title says it all... idk why Iâ€™m still here and idk why Iâ€™m still putting up with life in general.
She says Iâ€™m the laziest person because I sit on my phone all the time and she feels like sheâ€™s stuck with her life and isnâ€™t getting anywhere with her life and she doesnâ€™t wanna spend her life with a person thatâ€™s always on her phone and doesnâ€™t do anything. Sheâ€™s helped me financially for a couple weeks and now sheâ€™s rubbing it under my nose.
Iâ€™m a burden for everyone, not just my parents and as she says Iâ€™m living in their house on their expenses and Iâ€™m a disgraceful little shit... made me feel like I should hang myself right here and now... why do I even bother anymore? 
Hoping that the next day will be better is like hoping that the world will end tomorrow ... hope is for fools and idiots. 
My life sucks, never hasnâ€™t and I feel like Iâ€™m about to crack and my time is coming.

I didnâ€™t get clean for this, I didnâ€™t TRY to make something out of my life for this... I hate the day I was born and I hate that I havenâ€™t killed myself yet
