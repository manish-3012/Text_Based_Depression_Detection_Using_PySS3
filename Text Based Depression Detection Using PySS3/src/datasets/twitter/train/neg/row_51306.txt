I don't have much to be here for.I never had a good life growing up. Back in 2015, my life changed when I met a girl named Jordan. We talked for a few months and got together. We really had a lot in common, and I thought it was a good relationship until about 6 months in... she cheated on me. She apologized, and I forgave her. About 12 months in, she cheated again. I was broken, but so in love with her I forgave her again. About a year and 8 months into the relationship, she cheated on me during her band camp. I forgave her. 2 years and 3 months in, she cheated again. I forgave her. 3 years in, she cheated. I broke up with her. She cheated 5 times. I forgave her 4 times. I was so in love with her. She completely destroyed me. Burned all of the stuff I made her, all of my clothes she took from me over the relationship, and a really special gift I made her. I am completely devastated to this day. I don't trust anyone anymore, every relationship since her I've just been used and cheated on. I've lost count of how many I've been in. I'm tired of getting fucked over. If this is how life is going to be, I don't want to live anymore. I realize now that I'll never find love. I'm unattractive, short, and always last picked. No girl wants me. All of my friends have great relationships and they constantly pick on me for not being able to have one. They never have time for me anymore, I'm just going to be alone forever. I don't want to hear the "you'll find the right one eventually" because I won't. I'm just done. I want to kill myself, but I don't want to hurt my parents like that. I love my mom and my dad who adopted me. I'm just tired and defeated. 
Sorry for the longer post, if you read to the end, thank you.
