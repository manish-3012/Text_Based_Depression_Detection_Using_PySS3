what if I failI am a foreigner, have not graduated from the med school in my damn home country yet. I am preparing for USMLE because I want to be a doctor here, and I want to immigrate to  USA, too. Since my home country is totally hellish.

But I am really not that excellent, not smart, and it is so difficult to prepare when you did not attend American med school. I am in the "best " med school in my home country, but still, just trash. Otherwise it won't be so hard to prepare.

Sometimes I feel like, I do not have any hope. I cannot make it happen, I can never make it. As an forefinger med student  I have to get 250+ ( super high score)  in step 1 to have a chance to match. But my brain is like, atrophy.

I am 24 now, when I graduate I will be 27. If I cannot success in this then what did I burnt all my youth for ?

It is so painful to continue, and more painful to give up. Recently I cannot stop thinking isn't it easier to suicide, no more anxiety. But damn it is a sin to suicide, too! Can life be more cruel? I am sure it will.

Not sure what I want to say, I may have depression, I don't care. Hope I will somehow die tomorrow.
