I don't know..alright so i've been thinking about stuff lately... why am i here? i can count the friends who care about me on one hand. i'm bisexual surrounded by homophobes. got turned down by the only girl i care about in that way. weed is the only thing that makes me feel better and i just got caught so that won't happen anymore.

i guess it doesn't matter to you guys and i don't matter but what do i have to live for?
