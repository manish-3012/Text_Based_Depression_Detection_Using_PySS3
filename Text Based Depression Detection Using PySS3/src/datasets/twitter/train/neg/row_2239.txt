My first suicide attemptI tried committing suicide for the first time on Tuesday. It was a shock for me because I never thought Iâ€™d ever reach the point where I actually was completely ready to go through with it. I tried jumping off the highway. Overdosing on pills. Drinking bleach. All of which my mom stopped me from doing because unfortunately she was present during that time.  I still want to kill myself but my mom is around so I canâ€™t do anything right now but maybe when she leaves. I can try. I honestly am trying to hold onto life with every last bit of my strength but I am struggling. Its not easy. I am in dire need of help
