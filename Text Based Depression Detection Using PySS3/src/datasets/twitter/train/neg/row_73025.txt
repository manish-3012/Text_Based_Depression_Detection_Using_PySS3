Have to wonderCame here originally because I was suicidal due to my son committing suicide. Always have had suicidal ideation, but better with age....until I found my son in my bathtub with gunshot to head....now PTSD is kicking my ass and I hate life. Yet a part of me find comfort in hearing you all say no one could help...and you also hide it from parents etc....then today another kid I personally know took his life. So I have personally known 4 kids...Iâ€™m shocked ...A) that these kids have the courage to do what I fear...B) see no hope in the future of mankind.  I know we all have it ruff blah freaking blah blah....shit as I said...my biggest fear...losing my son happened....and yet....I refuse to feel bad for myself anymore. I allow myself 15 min pity party then Iâ€™m like shut the fuck up and move forward. I may not know what forward looks like...or really even care about it... but I refuse to be a victim and instead a fighter...I really feel connected to you all...only yâ€™all understand what it feels like to want to be at peace...but fuck it...letâ€™s all be at peace here! Canâ€™t we figure out why we all have these feelings...what is making this even an option for us! Uuggghhh life sux...but even when we do die...regardless what religion u are or are not...we all have a life review. So we have to feel all the pain we have left behind...and trust me, itâ€™s a whole freaking lot. So letâ€™s say fuck it..and live life the way we want. So many fear letting others down...donâ€™t...live YOUR life...we fear rejection or have sad stories...fuck it...letâ€™s make our own and make it amazing. Happiness isnâ€™t what social media makes it look like. I found happiness today laying on my back looking at the clouds and thinking how cool it is that I can see so many things in something that everyone else just sees as a cloud. Omg I am rambling in a drunken state....but in all real, as crazy as I sound...u all actually mean something to me....u get me...yet u donâ€™t know me from the stranger u see on the side of the rode. Yet we are connected i this freaking feeling of wanting the madness to end. I choose to say fuck it...and live my life as I want. Ok...Iâ€™m done.
