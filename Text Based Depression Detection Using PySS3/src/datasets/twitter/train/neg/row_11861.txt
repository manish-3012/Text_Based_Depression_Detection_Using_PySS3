I don't know what to do...So I'm in middle school (I'm not saying my exact age) and because of this whole Corona thing I haven't done ANYTHING in weeks, so I've put on a couple of pounds. I tried to tell my mom that I wanted to do something to lose weight but she told me I wasn't fat and that I should shut up, that made me feel like shit so after that, they went out to a friends house and got drunk. While they were gone I decided to clean my fridge, (long over due) and when they stumbled through the door super drunk, I had yet to throw the expired salad dressings away. I found an old slushy thing (all moldy) and my dad asked my mom what it was and that made my mom angry for him "blaming" her about it, so now they are screaming over nothing... I honestly just wanted them to be happy that I cleaned the fridge, BUT NOPE they scream at each other instead. I just want to lose weight and because of that I'm really scared of someone walking up to me and judging me for being fat... thus, I want to kill myself. 
Thank you for listening to my "tragic" life story... please don't pay any attention to me, I'm not worth it. Goodbye
