Realistically would my friends and family get over my death?I assume itâ€™d take a few years for them to get over it. Is suicide selfish? Itâ€™s my life right? I donâ€™t bring joy to people anyway... I wish I could fix all the mistakes I made in the past. At this point just the memories and conversations haunt me endlessly. Itâ€™s a nightmare. Drinking helps but it just makes things worse overall. Lord send me an angel!
