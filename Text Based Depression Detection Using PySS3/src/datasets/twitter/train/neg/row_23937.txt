He pled not guilty.For context: in March, I offered a coworker to spend the night in my spare bedroom when he felt suicidal and didn't want to be home with his wife. In the end, he sexually assaulted me, and slept in my bed while I laid on the living room floor talking to every crisis line I could think of. About a month later, he waived his preliminary hearing, and today he had another hearing.

They want to deposition me despite a full confession from him. He pled not guilty to all charges, and there's going to be another date. They don't suspect it, but it may be taken to a jury.

I'm terrified. I've cried on my boyfriend and taken the day off of work, and I don't want this to be drawn out anymore. All I can do is think about the way I felt in March, about how I talked to crisis lines constantly, and gave people my blades, and went to the hospital because I couldn't be alone. I'm scared I need to overdose today, while everyone is at work and can't stop me. I'm so tired.
