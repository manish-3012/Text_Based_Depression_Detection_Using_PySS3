With my objectively unattractive looks, life simply cannot get better. So why shouldnt I just put myself out of misery.I am someone who is viewed as physically unattractive by the entire population. Not one girl has looked at me and thought I was attractive or desirable. Not one. My own ex said my looks meant sex was completely off the table.

I am considering just saving myself from a life time of loneliness. I dont deserve to live alone in misery, I am a good person who cares about others, but no one cares about me.

Ending my life is a kindness to myself. 

Any girl seeing this just look at my profile picture,  you wont find me attractive either I 100 percent guarantee this

Its time for me to go.
