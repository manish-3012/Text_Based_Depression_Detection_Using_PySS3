Been contemplating doing it for two months, feeling really awful right nowI'm not going to delve in to back story, but if you care you can look at my post history.

Basically, I drove away a girl I was seeing because I semi-threatened her with suicide (not really, I just called her a few times telling her I was suicidal). She said I've made her really uncomfortable and told me to stop contact her, but I kept contacting her. I've since stopped, there's no point continuing that. I feel disgusted at myself and the whole situation. It's vile and has fucked up my view on women and relationships.

I don't have a job, at least not a proper one (I'm an Uber driver). I have a Bachelor's degree in Arts, but my full time job prospects look pretty grim. I'm scared of entering the job market and feel like a child in this sense.

I have friends, but they don't really reach out to me. I've tried reaching out to them and they can only help so much. I understand this.

I spend a lot of time sleeping now, or just laying in bed thinking about it. I'm not eating properly. I feel like shit. Sometimes I can see why suicide is not the way, that there is hope for me to change my life around and become the person I used to be or someone even better. But most of the time I'm just drowning in my own sadness. Every day is lonely. Every day I think about everyone else going about doing their job while I just sit at home reading this and other subreddits like it. It's a fucking sad existence. I don't think I really, truly want to kill myself, I just don't want this life I currently have. I think a lot of you could relate if you read just these last few sentences.

I just need some comforting words
