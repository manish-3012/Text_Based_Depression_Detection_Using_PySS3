Maybe suicide is the way?I'm not suicidal anymore, at least I don't think that I am but lately I have been getting sadder. Life just seems joyless and I don't really think that people care about me. So I've been thinking that maybe suicide is the way to go, because I find no joy in life, I'm planning to spend all my money tell everyone to fuck off and jump in front of a train.
