Today was the closest I've ever come to doing itThis morning I drove out to this mountain near my house to watch the sunrise and wait for my nearest gun shop to open at 9. My plan was to buy a handgun, hopefully something not too expensive, drive to the nearest police station, and shoot myself in the temple in the parking lot. That way at least someone more prepared for it would find me.

I always promised myself that before I did it I would call the suicide hotline just to see what they had to offer. Honestly, it was kinda disappointing, but it still helped a lot to actually talk about my insecurity and fears without just getting some cookie-cutter, fake response. After that, I decided to sleep in my car for a while since I only had 4 hours of sleep last night. 

I'm skipping all of my classes today which sucks, but it's better than killing myself I guess. I can't afford to call off work so I still have to take a shower and all that stuff.

I don't know why I'm posting this, I think I just wanna get it off my chest since I can't tell my family or they'd freak out, and I'm worried about alienating myself from the few friends I have once they find out how depressed I am.
