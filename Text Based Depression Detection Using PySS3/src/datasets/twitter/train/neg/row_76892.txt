I'm runnin on emptyI'm on meds, regularly see my doctor, get therapy, use coping skills to manage my depression/anxiety, I meditate, exercise, go to work, pay my taxes, have hobbies, people care about me, I get support. I even smile and laugh sometimes. On paper, things seem pretty good.

But they aren't. I'm miserable. I feel empty, and I'm simply not attached to my will to live. I'm going through the motions hoping something will get better, and it's draining. "You can't measure your progress by how you feel," they tell me in the hospital. "There's so much ahead of you! You can't predict the future, just around the corner could be what makes things better! You're going to get better!" 8+ years and things aren't getting better. I'm only 23 and I feel like I'm 75. My soul is tired, and I'm ready to go. 

I don't know what I'm waiting for, or why I'm posting. Guess I just want to express myself anonymously, I dunno. All I do know is I'm not going to make it to 25. I don't *want* to make it past 25.
