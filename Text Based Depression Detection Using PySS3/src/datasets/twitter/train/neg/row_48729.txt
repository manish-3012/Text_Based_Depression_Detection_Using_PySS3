aloneI feel like no one gets me i should be happy i have a gf i have a roof over my head and i live with my best friend but i just always feel so alone. Like i haveto guard everything i ever say to everyo e because if they knew the real me they wouldnt like me hell i dont like me. I feel hollow. I have for some time now thought of giving up. Disappearing i think everyone would be better off with out me.
