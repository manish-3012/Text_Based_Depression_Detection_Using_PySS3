'it gets better'Ive heard it so many times. When? How? Why even. Nothing has happened for the better. Its only gotten worse and worse. An theoretically it does get better in the long run, Is it worth the wait, that amount of pain and trauma added? Years and years wasted only to barely live comfortably but still having that immense regret tormenting you until your last days. Is it selfish to ask for help? Im not sure. I feel as though im being selfish smearing that trauma onto others. Its horrible. I just want to vanish completely without anyone knowing. I want to tell my family that doesnt give shits about me that im moving somewhere far away or leave a note that i eloped, only to kill myself. I wish i were never born. Im so lonely. I have no one. And maybe wanting someone is selfish. Its always about me huh. I deserve to be lonely. And everyone deserves to be away from me. I dont have anyone and it makes dying easier but the fact that absolutely no one would know scares me.
