Feeling dead out :(I've got 4 brothers not close with one of them.
Three close to my age and I dont know them from Adam.
On new years went round to one of the brothers houses. 
Was stood there talking to him and my niece (who decided I was her go to that night) was apparently shouting me.
My brother repeatedly dismissed me as my niece was calling for me (shes 14) and was literally just trying for my attention all night.
I was just trying to have an adult conversation with my siblings. He kept being like bye...bye anon is calling for you....bye
Bearing in mind we were in the middle of w conversation.
It really hurt and I ended up going outside for a smoke and having a little cry. Felt really shitty on NYE
