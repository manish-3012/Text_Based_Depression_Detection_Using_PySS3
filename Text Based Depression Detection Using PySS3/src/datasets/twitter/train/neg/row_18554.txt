Trump just got nominated. If he becomes president, the world's going to end, so why not get a head start?I'm really distraught Trump got nominated as the Republican nominee. When he becomes president(becomes us Americans are idiots), he's going to start a nuclear war that will annihilate all of humanity. I'm thinking I should off myself before he becomes president. 

Give me one good reason why I should keep on living when becomes president? If that happens, I'd rather be dead.
