No one caresMy day has been complete crap all day non stop. I say alot that I feel invisible and this time it's more than a feeling.... I can't see my reflection. All I do is cause harm to anyone who gets close to me. 


What's the point of going on with life if all I am is the construct of my own loneliness and suffering? 

Who would miss me? A brother that ignores me? An aunt that just emotionally abuses me? 

What's the point of living when all I feel is pain??
