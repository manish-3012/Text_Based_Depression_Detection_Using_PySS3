I posted here yesterday and on Thursday. I have to say Iâ€™m incredibly disappointed in some of the users. Iâ€™ve gotten messages from u/OopsIForgotMyPassword that say Iâ€™m attention seeking and have abused those who offered me comfort so I deserve what happened to me, (I got doxxed when I posted a suicide note and the cops came to my house and it broke my relationship up for good and got me kicked out) 

and particularly on yesterdayâ€™s post people in the comments telling me to not â€œproject my shitâ€ onto them. That was said by u/thatswhatsophiesaid I think because I didnâ€™t offer up enough details in my post due to the fact it was about the the fact that I got doxxed and cops came to my house, you guys all downvoted me for saying sheâ€™s being fucking rude and I have to say how disgusting it is to talk that way to a poster here when the point of each post is just helping the *poster*. Completely uncalled for. I had to take the post down out of fear it would happen again because I said something that couldâ€™ve gotten me doxxed again. Some of you were incredibly supportive but Iâ€™m not going to forget those that decided to address me in anger with unsolicited advice. Itâ€™s against this subs morals, and most of all. I didnâ€™t ask for it. Telling me I deserved what happened to me on Thursday (the doxxing that ruined my life) because Iâ€™ve â€œabusedâ€ everyone whose tried to comfort me is despicable and I will think about that until the end. 

Yes I really wanted attention from fake internet points. Thatâ€™s why i so desperately talked about how much I hated my life. Yes I really deserved this event going down that will forever change the corse of my life. Iâ€™m not going to forgive anyone that talked down to me like that when I was at a point of below zero. Below rock bottom. Iâ€™m still at that point. And I canâ€™t say much because someone out there knows where I live but. I have to say. 

You failed me. You truly truly failed me. More than never reaching out could have. Never interact with a suicidal person ever again. You are dangerous to their mindset and it is rather despicable that you want to toy with a vulnerable head like that. Unless your motive is the opposite of what you want them to do. 

Go ahead and do the same thing in the comments. I donâ€™t mind. In fact. I need it for today. 

And for everyone that listened yesterday and sent me comments saying what happened to me was fucked up. Thank you. Those are what helped me. I just wanted to be listened to. You understood the point of this sub. There was a lot of you actually. You do a good job. I used to support those here before my life led down this path and itâ€™s nice to see people paying it forward. Have a nice day.
