Just want to whine and need an earSo today is my birthday, nobody said anything about it and it sucks, but not the worst thing yet. I went to my collage today just to know that my 8 years crush got a boyfriend, well at this point i dont really care anymore, i thought it could got any worse and i just want to go home early to sleep, then this woman come to my apartment and start to talk about her new boyfriend for whole 3 hours! Im like " mother fucker you better leave or imma batista bang your head". She left and i just go straight to my bad to cry(not really) , then what happened next is completely out of my fucking expectations, she come back to my apartment claiming that she left her boyfriend's birthday present. Thanks for listening guys, RIP since i will remember my birthday as the worst day of my life for the rest of my worthless life.
