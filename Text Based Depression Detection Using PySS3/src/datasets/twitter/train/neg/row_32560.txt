Is telling your partner that you're feeling suicidal manipulative?Our relationship has changed in ways I wasn't prepared for. We are supposed to get married in three months and I feel trapped because our relationship isnt what I signed up for anymore, at all. I don't know if I can tell them that I've never been this close to relapse in my 12 years clean. I don't know how to tell them my ideation has gotten dangerous. And I don't see my therapist til the 25th. I'm afraid telling them will make them sacrifice their needs for me and then they'll end up the suicidal one. I hate this. I feel like there's no winning.

I want help and encouragement and advice. Not more negativity. Sorry if that doesn't float your boat.
