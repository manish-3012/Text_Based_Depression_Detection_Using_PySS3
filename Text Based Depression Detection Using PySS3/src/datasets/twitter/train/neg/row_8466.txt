Feels like a weight's sinking me down.No matter how much I struggle, I always end up feeling awful and get off track from pursuing my goals. I want to study physics, but in my country there's literally only one decent uni where I can study physics and have a chance of going abroad for masters and a phd. I'm kinda confident in my intelligence so I think I have a good chance of getting in, but not like this. 

Thinking feels tiring for me, so I tend to spend most of my life in a dissociative fugue state, if that makes sense? I feel anxiety when I force myself to think analytically. 

I also feel like I can't ask for help from anyone around me. I'm mostly a stoic person who's infamous for showing no outward emotion, so people mostly get amused when I'm upset, which enrages me. 

Sorry if this makes no sense, English is a secondary language for me and I have trouble expressing myself with words.
