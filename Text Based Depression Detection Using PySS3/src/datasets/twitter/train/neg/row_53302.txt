Is there even a pointIn living when you simply realize that the past 4-5 years of your life have amounted to absolutely nothing. Telling myself it will get better tomorrow with everything just becomming worse. Realizing that actually 1/4 of my life was an absolute pointless ride, where anything i wouldâ€™ve tried to do to make things better, just contributed to feeling worse day by day. Eating healthy, going to the gym with positive thoughts and all, just to be hit every single night, without fail, by the worst feelings and thoughts someone could have. Sleep is actually making it worse, since 80% of my dreams are just nightmares filled with the things i always feared most to happen.
And then here i am, after these 4 years just begging at night to just have my existence erased somehow. 
Why would anyone just go forward, when every advice you ever got never helped, and most of the time just... made me hate myself more.
