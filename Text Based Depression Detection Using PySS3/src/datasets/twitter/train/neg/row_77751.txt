Suicide becomes more of an option as each day passes.Bit by bit I'm losing whatever hope is keeping me here. All that talk of "this is the only life you get" has zero impact on me anymore, I don't want another life, I'm fed up with this one as it is. The thought of escaping all my pain is tempting, I don't know how long it's gonna be before I'm done once and for all.
