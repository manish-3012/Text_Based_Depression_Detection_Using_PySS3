My suicidal episodes are becoming more frequent.Iâ€™ve done everything Iâ€™m supposed to do. I take the medication my psychiatrist prescribes &amp; I never miss a therapy session. But Iâ€™ve been falling into the suicidal rabbit hole every few weeks, with episodes lasting several days &amp; my methods way more realistic. 

I canâ€™t keep living like this. Something needs to give because I might not pass out before walking into traffic next time.
