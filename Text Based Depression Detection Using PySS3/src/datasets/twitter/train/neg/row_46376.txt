Scarily okay with it.The last 6 years or so have been pretty bad. Moving to a city way more populated than the small town Iâ€™m from, and somehow feeling more isolated than ever. 

Somewhere along the way through 8th grade I stopped participating in class if I didnâ€™t want to, and follow that through to highschool I stopped going until I basically dropped out. My dad tried to help me, as much as he could with the school board and such but I wasnâ€™t committed to it. 

Constant fighting and screaming for years, my grandpa passing away; who was basically my best friend, I would think about it once and awhile. All the what ifâ€™s and such. Counselling didnâ€™t seem to help, meds didnâ€™t help. Relationships were and still are a struggle. Self esteem issues as well. My dad threw me out back in august, to my mother of all people. Who doesnâ€™t talk to me unless she needed something only I could do or whatever, well she ended up moving and leaving me behind. So I called my dad and swallowed my pride. 

Been here at his place for about a month and a half now, and am being threatened to be thrown out again. It seems like my family just doesnâ€™t care about me. 

My life just seems to be going nowhere fast, and every time I start to even think about getting it back on track something happens that is out of my control. Recently Iâ€™ve been toying with the idea of how much simpler it would be if I didnâ€™t have to deal with anything all, and what scares me the most is how okay with that I am.
