Thereâ€™s no point. I really tried.Tried to get my life together and with every step forward itâ€™s been ten steps back.

I canâ€™t do it anymore. Especially alone. I refuse to continue to live miserably just for the minuscule chance that Iâ€™d ever even find a friend, let alone partner, who could deal with my mental illnesses. 

Iâ€™m tired, Iâ€™m a failure, Iâ€™m alone. Iâ€™m ready to give up now.
