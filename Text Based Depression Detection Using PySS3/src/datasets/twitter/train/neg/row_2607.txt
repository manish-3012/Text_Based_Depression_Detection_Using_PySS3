Should I do it?My partner recently came out as transgender. How Iâ€™ve reacted to it the worse way possible and I know I will have to breakup with them. I have been called callous and I think Iâ€™m evil. I also have a list of way I should do it, but Iâ€™m too much of a coward.

Vindictive 
Insensitive 
No consideration

Is this good enough reason to kill myself?
