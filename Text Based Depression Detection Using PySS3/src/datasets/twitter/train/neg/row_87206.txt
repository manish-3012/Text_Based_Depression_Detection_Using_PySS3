Iâ€™ve been feeling suicidal over the last couple of months.Iâ€™ve been trying so hard, but I donâ€™t know how to handle the things that are wrong with me. I made a few friends but it feels as if they talk to me out of sympathy. I donâ€™t want that. Makes me feel like a burden. 

I donâ€™t have the guts to do anything, but Iâ€™ve been losing interest in life lately. I donâ€™t know what I wake up for anymore, and honestly, I donâ€™t think I ever did. Someone called me broken and that is true, I am broken.
