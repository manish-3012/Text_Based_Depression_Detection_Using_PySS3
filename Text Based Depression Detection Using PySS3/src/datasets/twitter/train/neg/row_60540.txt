I can't do this anymoreI lost my job for bullshit reasons and no matter how much I look there aren't any jobs around here. I've even applied to fast food places and nobody is hiring. I have bills to pay. I have a gf but she hasn't even been talking me lately. It's a long distance relationship and way too far for either of us to make the trip. Shes in school with no spare money and I'm broke. She hasn't said she loves me in 2 days. We used to text thousands of times a day. We've sent 87 texts in the past 3 days. I counted. She doesn't understand that I'm depressed out of my skull and everytime I walk out of a potential job place without a job it hurts so much. I've been thinking about it for a while now but I think its finally time. I dont want to be an attention whore and dont expect this to be any help. This is more of something for my gf and parents to find after the fact. I'm sorry to take up your time and for the shitty writing. I dont feel like revising it.
