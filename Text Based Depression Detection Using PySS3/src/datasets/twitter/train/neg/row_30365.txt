Mild overdose as punishmentSome things happened last night and I was just sick of myself and I wanted to cut but I couldnâ€™t find the blade. So I took 3 of my allergy medications instead of one to try and â€œscareâ€ myself into not doing it again, but nothing really happened and it feels like a waste. The last time I tried to overdose was intended as suicide but I stopped myself. And I had uncomfortable effects as I didnâ€™t tell anybody but idk. Maybe I just needed to take more. Itâ€™s just allergy medication so itâ€™s not that strong. Is there any other ways to self harm than cutting?
