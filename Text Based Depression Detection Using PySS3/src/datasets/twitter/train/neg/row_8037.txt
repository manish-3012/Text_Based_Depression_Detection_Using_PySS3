I donâ€™t want my loved ones to worryI have been suicidal since probably 5th grade. As a kid, I fantasized about being able to protect my classmates from a school shooter, so that Iâ€™d feel like I had some worth. I have made some poor life decisions and now I feel more helpless than ever. Iâ€™d like to think I wouldnâ€™t do it, but I constantly get overwhelmed with thoughts of just finally ending it. I canâ€™t see myself ever being happy like my older sister and raising a family. I donâ€™t want to burden my loved ones by laying this all on them. How do I navigate? I donâ€™t think I will ever reach the goals I have set to make myself happy and my family proud. I just donâ€™t want them to waste their energy on trying to fix something broken. Iâ€™m so damn sad. It comes in waves and tonight it is hitting hard.
