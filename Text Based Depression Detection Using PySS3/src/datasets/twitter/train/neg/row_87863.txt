FailureI am a 19 year old guy who is a complete failure. After high-school I decided to go to the military. Mental illness runs in my family so I was discharged from boot camp. Before I left my family and friends we happy for me. I felt odd, like i was going for them instead of for myself. When I came home everyone I know seemed to resent me. The worst of it is my own father. He hates me. He thinks Iâ€™m a failure. It feels as if he doesnâ€™t love me anymore. It feels like Iâ€™ve lost everyone and Iâ€™m alone. I was sent home because I wasnâ€™t mentally sound enough. But now I think Iâ€™m worse. I want to end this feeling. I want to be happy again. I want my father and family to love me again. I think they would love me if I was gone. They would forget the failure if I was gone. I think thatâ€™s the best way to be loved again. Thank you for reading. I just felt like I needed to say this. Iâ€™ve kept it inside for what seems like a lifetime. Goodbye.
