a poem just a poem i wrote when i was feeling very, very empty

**transparent**

*where am i?*

*a glass box? seventh heaven?* 

*in a lifeless coma? living nothingness?*

*maybe just air, oblivion, and confusion..*

*arrows are shot right at me;*

*yet I donâ€™t bleed; nor are there scars*

*why is it so null, so dark, so crestfallen?*

*iâ€™m homesick; heartsick for a place that isnâ€™t home*

*and Iâ€™m not even in the chasms below*

*why isnâ€™t all of this euphoric anymore?*

*iâ€™m just a mistake, i canâ€™t concentrate;*

*just an overused mannequin of what others think about me*

*iâ€™m so fatigued at this point, itâ€™s crippling, itâ€™s so weary*

*stuck in the curse of a mirror, worthless; sullen; bitter*

*iâ€™m never someoneâ€™s favorite; always talking too much*

*i keep on saying â€œsorry, sorry, sorryâ€, because iâ€™m apologising for my existence*

*every day is such a deep ocean blue, consuming me to the depths below*

*iâ€™m hidden; hidden from the world, from existence, from laughter*

*iâ€™m just invisible.. nor do i want to be visible*
