I don't know what's happening to meFor the past god knows how many years, I've been at a general baseline state of mind at "I'm not really a good or worthwhile person, but at least the work I do makes people happy sometimes", and for what it's worth, that's been enough to keep me...I dunno, lazy enough to not seriously consider killing myself? 

But every now and then, I just have these massive f'king breaks where I'm just overwhelmed by this all-consuming desire to die. I don't want to be alive anymore. I just want to stop existing. So. Badly. 


I haven't felt this awful in a while, and I just don't know what the hell to do. Part of me knows that, in the morning there's a good chance I'll go back to being all "Yeah I wanna die, but that'd be messy and inconvenience people", but part of me also feels like maybe that's a bad thing. 

Like maybe I need to do something now, while I'm still brave enough to be serious about this? 

I know I'm not thinking straight but I just can't stop my brain from spiraling out of control like this.
