I donâ€™t want to live without my girlfriend anymore. Iâ€™m ready to go. Planning on hanging myself tonight.Itâ€™s now been 5 years since we broke up and it only gets more painful every year that passes by. I havenâ€™t met a single person since we broke up that I could possibly envision myself being together with. In fact the idea of being with anyone else makes me feel physically sick. The idea of her being with someone else, the guy sheâ€™s with now, makes me want to put a bullet in my brain.

Nobody else has ever looked at me, or touched me, or just know how to be in my presence the way she did. Thereâ€™s nobody else on the planet Iâ€™m meant to be with. I was supposed to be with her, and I lost her.

Iâ€™m not going to let this happen to myself anymore.
