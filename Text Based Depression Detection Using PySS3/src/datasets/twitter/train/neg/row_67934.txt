Can't think of a title.Hi Reddit. I guess you know why I'm here. My story isn't original or shocking. Been depressed for as long as I can remember, been to all the counsellors, psychiatrists, psychologists. Been on all the drugs, been through all the therapy. Everyone has done all they can for me but I've had to accept that this is who I am, this is how I am. There's nothing "wrong" with my life, nothing that needs fixing. And yet here I am again, thinking about suicide. If I'm honest, I think about it even when I'm not at my lowest, but now I've actively taken steps towards it. I'm tying up all my loose ends. The only thing I don't know is how I'm going to do it or if I can actually go through with it. I can't see an alternative. I don't want to live another 50 or 60 years like this. No the fleeting moments when I feel relatively good aren't worth staying alive for. I've run out of options.
