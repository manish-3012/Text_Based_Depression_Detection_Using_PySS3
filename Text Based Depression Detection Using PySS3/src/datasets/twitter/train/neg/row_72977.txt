i gave my roommate my razors and told him about cutting.he didn't freak out. but he said he was uncomfortable and that he now can't trust me as far as he can throw me.... and the reason i'm writing this is because it's always funny that if/when i tell someone, i always feel the need to apologize for it. i barely understand why i hurt myself (when i do, because, as said before, i don't want to die) but now i've got this added guilt/need to apologize when i do fess up. gah.
