What really sets us apart?I'm 22 and in a constant state of either severe depression or being in la la land. I have social anxiety, a severe distrust of people and a typical(not so typical?) sob story childhood. Sometimes my brain tricks me into thinking I'm depression-free and then the depression comes back like a slap to the face. This is all besides the point. What I wonder is how do people even get through life? I know there are people who have had worse lives than me but they live on and persevere. Meanwhile, I'm frequently wondering when I'm going to off myself. I know I'm going to do it eventually, maybe 5-10 years from now. 

Seriously, what sets those people apart from someone like me who has already given up? It can't just be therapy or friends and family. I'm not in immediate danger just fyi. I still have a teenage brother to take care of. I will wait until he is okay on his own.
