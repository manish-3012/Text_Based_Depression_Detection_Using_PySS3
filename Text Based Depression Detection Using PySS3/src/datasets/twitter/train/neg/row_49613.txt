I used to view suicide as a kind of punishment, as a moment of significanceIt was for the people around me. To finally show them what I really had inside. To make them feel my pain. I wanted to know how they'd react, to see if anybody even cared that I had killed myself. I think I wanted validation, maybe I wanted to know that people actually did care about me, I don't know. Anyhow, that's all gone now. I don't really care who knows I killed myself, or why. I don't really care how anybody will react. I see it as a milestone more than anything. I've finally reached the point where I stopped fighting. It's an expectation, not a decision. I will eventually leave, and it will be my choice.
