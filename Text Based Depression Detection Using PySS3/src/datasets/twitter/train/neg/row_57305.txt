I have no idea what I'm going to do.For some reason, everything is going to shit. Normally, I do fine in the high-level classes I'm placed in, but now things have somehow changed. My grades are steadily falling, the math class that I once understood seems like fucking gibberish, and my parents are riding my ass telling me that I'm fucking up my future and not giving a shit. My social life isn't much better. I only have one real friend who graduates at the end of the year, and I have to go another two years alone. Also, I found out that I'm "that guy". You know, the one who girls are dared to dance with because he's so fucking repulsive. I'm stressed as hell right now, and I feel like ending it all would be so much more peaceful than putting up with all this day after day.
