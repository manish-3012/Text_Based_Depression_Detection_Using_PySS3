Just relapsed (SH)Hi guys,

Usually just reading on this sub,but feel like sharing today.

So,I cut for most of my life(I am 13,and I cut myself since 9-10),I was clean for like 2 months,but,I relapsed today.Just came to the bathroom,and cut with the dullest,rustiest,razor ever.It hurt as hell,but it felt great.The worst part about it is,i dont really have a reason.Things have been getting better for me lately,but this empty feeling didn't really go away,It just gets worse,the better things look for me.

Maybe I don't know how to be "normal" anymore?
