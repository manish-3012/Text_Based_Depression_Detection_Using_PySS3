I just don't care.I just need to vent a little. I don't really see the point in going on. I won't be successful and probably won't find someone to be with. My friends don't care about me, either, I'm starting to realize. They don't want anything to do with me except to make fun of me. I'm mocked constantly at anything I do, from sports to social skills. My father passed away, and that doesn't really help things, needless to say. I don't really have anything to live for, I guess. The only thing I really have going for me is that I'm supposedly "gifted." I don't think I am. I look back on my life as one big clusterfuck, and I think others will, too. But why would you care, I'm just a walking so story.
