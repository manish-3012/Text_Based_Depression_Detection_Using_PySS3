darkness imprisioning megot shit grades this semester, probably going to get scholarship revoked, let my parents down who bet on me to do well this sem, its not the debt i worry about, (a naive thing to say, but that can be worked off) its the relationships of my family that i really tarnished, i love my mother and father, and i only let them down more more and more with every year. i think i should finally put an end to this downward spiral, atleast they have a good life insurance policy.
