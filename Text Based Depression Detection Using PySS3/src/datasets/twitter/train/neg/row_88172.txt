PanickingYesterday, I wrote Mensa's supervised test and I practiced a LOT for it and now I am panicking and am genuinely terrified that it will turn out that I am retarded or stupid. Honestly, I wrote the test, not because I am expecting a Mensa certificate, but rather to dismiss the idea that I am stupid. None of my parents nor my brother is stupid, so I can't understand why I would be? 

I have tested my intelligence with WAIS (wechsler, a tool to diagnose autism and learning disabilities) and I had Aspergers, with some strengths and some weaknesses. Never did they imply that I was stupid and after my enrolling in psychologist meetings (cognitive therapy), my psychologist told me that I was fascinating, had interesting thoughts, had big philosophic thoughts. Also he graded my homework and said that it was intelligently written, so am I to trust his judgment? Why am I still questioning my intelligence? I was never good at school, so that could be it. I don't know and this makes me panic, depressed and many times suicidal. What do I do reddit?
