If I don't get a different job soon I will probably end it all by the years' end.The cost of living here is steadily increasing but my salary has been the same for the last 5 years. I recently had to move into a smaller apartment because I could no longer afford my rent, but it wasn't enough. The bills just keep piling up and it is mainly because I just can't find something better. I am working a dead-end job that I absolutely despise. To top it all of my hours have been cut almost in half since the seasons changed. I literally have my default tabs set to different job boards and spend most of my time applying to jobs that I am qualified for when I am not working. I am a constant burden on my friends and family and I hate myself for it. My family is full of narcissists and I know that if I ask for help they will hold it over my head for the rest of my life so I dread going to them. I hate myself even more for having to constantly inconvenience my friends when they have their own lives to worry about. It seems like everyone is more successful than me and they haven't even tried. I went to a good school, got a high GPA, and when I am at work I work like a maniac, but I just can't get ahead. I often get "advice" from people saying "why don't you just take an unpaid internship to get more experience" or "why don't you hang out a shingle and go into business yourself" If I had the funds to start my own business, I would have done it years ago, and an unpaid position can't pay for groceries and might actually cut into what few hours I have left at work. Something's gotta give, either I get a job, or I just end it all and be done with it. I'm tired of feeling like I am constantly drowning.
