What people donâ€™t understand about my suicidal thoughtsIâ€™m juxtaposed between a perfect Instagram life and demons so ferocious I feel the flesh pulling from my bones. I banished social media long ago to keep me from feeling a need to portray a life of happy family picnics and glowing selfies but yesterday I reactivated my long deactivated Facebook to delete things I donâ€™t want as my legacy. I changed my photo to something closer to what I look like today. I think because I know my daughter will go to reflect on my life there. Iâ€™m tidying it up for her. 

Sheâ€™s much more like her father. They are both on the autism spectrum and live very clinical lives of black and white. Iâ€™m here on stage right looking at rainbow colors of joy one minute and the blackest holes the next. I donâ€™t have much insight into why my decades of mental healthcare hasnâ€™t worked but it simply hasnâ€™t. 

Iâ€™ve not killed myself more than once for my daughter. When I was pregnant with her my OB told me to stop my medication and I was naive enough to listen. Within days I was fantasizing about hanging myself from the second story window. I remember telling my husband that it was bad, my thoughts were as dark as they could be and seeing his face so vacant of understanding. Largely it still is when I talk about this kind of pain. 

There is no amount of time that will fix whatever is wrong with me. My father is so mentally ill heâ€™s nearly incoherent now. I fear my own mental decline from our shared diagnosis. Iâ€™ve read a lot about the long-term effects of psychotropics on the brain. Iâ€™m sitting at 31 years of mood stabilizers and anti-depressants. 

I donâ€™t know that I really WANT to die itâ€™s more I canâ€™t think of anything BETTER to do to improve. So, Iâ€™ll continue on my quest to just survive today and hope tomorrow isnâ€™t a bad day. I bought the rope and have it in my car as a safety net for bad days. A morbid thought but I enjoy the comfort of knowing I have the method if I needed it and the hope that it remains unused. Hopeâ€¦maybe thereâ€™s something left.
