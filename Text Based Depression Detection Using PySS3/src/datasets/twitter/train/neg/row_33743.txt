I've been fighting for so long and I don't want to give upI've been fighting for so long and I don't want to give up I just feel so weak.. I don't have a support system of friends around me. I have one friend that I talk to but when I talk to her about my problems one of my so called other "friends" has a problem with it and tells me to just go and bitch to her and he never offers any help despite me taking the huge step in opening up and trying to tell him what I'm going through. I've given up trying to fight it and I clearly can't rely on other people for help because when I opened up to this guy.. Who was my boyfriend at the time.. He said I was saying these things to get attention when I clearly wasn't and that's hurt me beyond repair. I don't think I can fight for much longer and I'm not sure what to do. I'm at a loss. Advice anyone..?
