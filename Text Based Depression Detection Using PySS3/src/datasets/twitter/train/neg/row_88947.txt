I think I'm going to give it two months.I just can't take it. My life has taken a 180Â° and I cannot cope with it. I have no support system in my life at all. The two people I depended on the most are not in my life any longer. One is deployed, and the other... doesn't need me in her life anymore. I don't know how I've gone 20 years without making any real friends. I don't know how to start making them at this point. 

I haven't felt this way in around three years. I know it's selfish but honestly I don't care. I've been shit on my whole life. I've always had to live with not getting what I wanted. This is something that I can actually control. 

I literally have no one. If I don't manage to turn my life around then what's the point? If I can't take control of my life by that time then that means that I'll never be able to. Counseling and medications have not helped. 

On top of everything I have chronic pain from a herniated disc. It hurts every single day, but I guess it isn't "bad" enough to be prescribed muscle relaxers/painkillers. 

God, I had these fantasies about what my life was going to be like with her. I was so naÃ¯ve. I guess everyone doesn't get their princess. 

I honestly just want the pain to stop.
