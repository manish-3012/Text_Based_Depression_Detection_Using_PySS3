Feeling lost, stuck, confused, frustrated and depressed.Hi, 

I'm a 22 year old guy  who feels lost and hopeless. The statement that "there's light at the end of the tunnel" I would reply,  what tunnel?
I know I'm only 22 but oh my god it has been rough. I'm so frustrated, annoyed, I don't even know where to begin. I read a lot of rescue kitten stories and I've just told myself that if a kitten can be rescued surely I can.

I'm stuck doing a degree at a fucked up university in a fucked up country, so I guess it's no shocker that i'm going through what I'm going through. But god I don't see a way out of it, really I don't, nor am I sure if I want or should get out of it.
I feel humiliated, embarassed, undignified. 
The things that sI used to like I'm not sure about, everythig in life I'm not sure about. Constantly confused. Anxiety and panic have been very good friends of mine, including feelig as if you're going to die, like you can't breathe anymore while you're sleeping, then you wake up as a result of that. 
The talk of energy and power is absolutely useless at this point, rarely do I have a "bright" moment. 
Most of my humiliation and embarrassment come as a result of me trying to "go outside" or "having friends" or anything that a normal person would do. 
I just want to ask, did someone go through and made it? Cause I've searched many times, tried counselling and anti-depressants and they didn't work.
I really don't know what to do.
