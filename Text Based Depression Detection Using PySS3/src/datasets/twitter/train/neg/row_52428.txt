Im so scared... No-one listensI opened up and no-one gives a damn. I've tried and I've tried. I can't do this anymore. I'm so scared but I'm so tired of everything. My nurse promised to call and she never did. 
I do the same thing over and over again, I can't escape from it. I don't care what happens in my life anymore. I don't care about progressing. I've cared too much about what others think, I've lied and I've fooled people. No-one gave a fuck. People say they care but when shit gets real, they leave. That's how it always is. Im a joke and my fucking life is too. 
Im lost. I'm done. Im tired.
