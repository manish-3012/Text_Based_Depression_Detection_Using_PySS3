Made an attempt 2 days ago and already want to do it againI lost my best friend of 7 years because of something I said and while he has said he's willing to try again and rebuild I know he will never look at me the same again and I hate that.  I tried to hang myself and couldn't drop myself and then 2 of my friends came over because they were worried and got into my house. I can't do this to them and I can't tell anyone close to me because they will tell my parents. I think I'm going to try again later today, I won't be telling anyone this time
