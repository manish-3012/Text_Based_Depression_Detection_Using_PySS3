Off my parents insurance. Canâ€™t afford a psychiatric meeting, let alone uninsured price of antidepressants. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.I keep getting told to go and look at free clinics and such. They just push me to seek paid help, or to other clinics. I canâ€™t afford it. Iâ€™m just done with it. I miss my antidepressants. Lexapro was my bro up until about six months ago. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Please somebody... anybody... help me figure this out....
