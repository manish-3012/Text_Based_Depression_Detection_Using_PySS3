How do I make up my mind?I have no-one. No friends, family who decided to disconnect with me (It was nobodys fault, they just never keep contact with me. Last I spoke with them so that they wanted to talk with me was 5-6 years ago.) and my wife had an online affair 2 months after we married, kept it going for 3 months and wasn't/ still isn't honest about parts of it.
I really want to find a way out, but I keep failing at everything. I tried to become electrician but failed, I failed my mandatory service in army too. I failed my marriage, and only have vague idea how.

I work in a factory now, and I see people in emotional pain. I understand them so I do my absolute best to be this upbeat guy, to make them happier. It works, but I still feel like a failure. I feel worthless and useless due to my past failures and my failed marriage. People I work with don't know how I feel, yet for some reason eventhough they are essentially strangers to me in my culture, I try to hang on them as... As a society that accepts me if you understand.
Yet I still feel alone.

I don't plan on killing myself, but I admit I have toyed with the idea. No that wasn't honest. I do have a rough idea of leaving my factory for good. And my wife. I had an idea of moving to different city, cutting all ties to everyone, so that if I do kill myself I hurt less people by offing myself.

But yet again I don't want to. I just want to make people happy. I wan't to be that goof who is, well, comical relief for people. I love it when people have something that keeps them happy, or at least smiling.
