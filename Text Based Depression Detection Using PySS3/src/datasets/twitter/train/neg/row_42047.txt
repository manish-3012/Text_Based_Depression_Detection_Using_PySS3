I want to give up.I just want to give up. I'm tired of the constant anxiety and dread. I can't think straight. I have two semesters left until I get my associate's in computer programming, but I can't code because I can't think. All I can think about is failing. I can't stop crying. Work is autopilot. My school has switched to a seven weeks schedule instead of fourteen so I'm up all night trying to figure out homework. The semester's just started and I'm already exhausted. I can't switch majors because I'm too far in. I'm trapped in a field I don't want. I'm so afraid of disappointing everyone around me. I'm just really tired.
