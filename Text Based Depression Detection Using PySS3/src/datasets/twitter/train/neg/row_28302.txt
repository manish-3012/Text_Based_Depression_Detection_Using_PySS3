trappediâ€™m 20, i live at a mental health facility (partial care; we do chores and go to groups for points, they feed us and house us, we pay them) and recently i was unfairly treated. they refused to allow me to leave to see my partner despite that i was meeting criteria. as a person with depression and anxiety, who had also already made the plans, i broke down.

this is a voluntary program, but 1. i can only leave after 30 days eviction notice and 2. iâ€™m dependent on my mother financially- she pays it for me. usually, she is understanding and kind, but will not take my side on this matter. she told me if i left here, i would not be allowed to come back to live with her.

i have no other place to go. i have no money and will not get to see my partner for a very, very long time after this due to lack of money. i am trapped, and as i cannot work, i cannot maintain myself financially.

i do not want to go to a psych ward. it will make me feel worse. i donâ€™t know what to do.
