I canâ€™t wait anymore for it to get betterI know Iâ€™m young, I have my whole life ahead of me and that shit.

I donâ€™t have a future. Iâ€™m always depressed and every time I just interact with people, hours, even days after, I beat myself up over the small little mistakes I made. I canâ€™t stop and itâ€™s every fucking time I interact with someone. I hate myself so much.

Everything I do is a mistake. I donâ€™t have a future. I have stopped going to school. I never go outside anymore. I just lay here in my room hiding from everything. I donâ€™t take care of myself and my teeth are slowly decaying at 15 years old.

Iâ€™m tired of waiting when thereâ€™s nothing outside for me. I canâ€™t live in a normal environment, and I hate myself for it. Everyone find me annoying I just wish I wasnâ€™t here anymore. It would be easier for everyone. Please someone just take me away.

Every fucking day I get these visions of me sticking a knife inside my chest. I hate this.
