Genuinely considering suicideIn a previous post I stated my girlfriend broke up with me. Now I am considering suicide more than I ever have in my life. Iâ€™m literally 13 years old. Sheâ€™s spreading rumors about me Iâ€™m pretty sure. She and her friends took our lunch table just to piss me and my friends off. I canâ€™t escape her, I canâ€™t escape the pain.
