i donâ€™t want to die in any way other than suicidethe thought of dying by accident is almost enough to make me kill myself. i have anxiety, and think about shit like the world ending, my house setting on fire, getting hit by a car etc most of the time. i am in some weird constant panic mode and it feels like someone is sitting on my chest all the time. 
sometimes i get so worked up about thinking about dying that i really feel like iâ€™m about to kill myself. i already want to commit suicide because of other things, and have been thinking about it for years now. i really was hoping my depression was a teenage phase, but i am barely a teenager now. i feel like all the fun years of my life when i should have been meeting friends and having fun were wasted by me just being sad all the time: 

ugh, i guess today is one of the bad days. sorry for the ramble
