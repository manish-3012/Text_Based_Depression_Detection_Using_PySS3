Scared &amp; ashamed, gonna end itI am going through a very bad time &amp; itâ€™s not even worse than some of the things that have happened to me, but Iâ€™m just tired. I feel it in my gut that Iâ€™ll one day end it all. 
I donâ€™t want to live... I donâ€™t want to die. I just want to not exist, but Iâ€™m ashamed myself that I should either decide to live or die. Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m useless. So many people.. even on this subreddit are going through so much worse and here I am. I should just fucking end it all. Iâ€™m hoping me typing this post out will give me the courage to kill myself and end this pathetic mess that is me.  I just want some peace. Thatâ€™s it. I canâ€™t keep going through this cycle again and again. But Iâ€™m scared &amp; I know if Iâ€™m ever brave in my life it should be today. I donâ€™t want to be a burden to my family anymore. I just wish I wasnâ€™t me. I wish I could stop being me. Useless, worthless.. I just make other peopleâ€™s life miserable. Yes, ending it all is the only way.

Thank you for reading this. I really appreciate it. 

I read a few posts on here and all of you are doing a wonderful job, I just needed to say that. I hope you all have good, peaceful lives.
