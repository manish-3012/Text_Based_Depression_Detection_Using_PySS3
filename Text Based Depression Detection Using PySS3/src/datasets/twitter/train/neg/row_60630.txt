Best wayI have a .45 caliber revolver.  I'm terrified of shooting myself in the head, but botching it somehow such that I don't die. So, I figure I could stand over the rail of a bridge, shoot myself in the head such that the momentum would carry me over the edge.  Even if the bullet does kill me, I will probably be too injured to appreciate the fall, which will kill me.
