WHY?I want to die.  Why is that such a bad thing?  I'm unhappy, I make my family miserable.  I just want out.  I'm not mad or upset I just want my family mainly my son to give me the ok to leave.  I just took some Tylenol pm and some serequel.  I washed it down with some gin and juice ( like snoop dog does).   Seriously though...I am such a pussy.  I want to die in a way where I know it's going to be a sure thing.  I don't want to live and end up in a hospital.  I would love to get drunk tonight and drive to the bridge and jump.  Stupid me never checked to see if it's even possible to do on this bridge.  I would take pills but I'm not sure that would do the trick :-(  I'm such a fuck up that I can't even kill myself the right way, lol.  What to do ...what to do....
