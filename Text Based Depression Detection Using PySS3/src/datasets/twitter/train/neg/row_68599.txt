This is all i do. I just want things. Im useless. This is why no one likes me. This is why ive spent nearly every summer for the past 6 years holed up in my room, just wanting. All im good at is complaining and wanting. Im too much of a lazy fuck to stop wanting and actually get. All i do is sit in my room and cry while slowly driving myself farther away from everything. I dont know anymore. Im on and off. One minute im bawling, then the next i could be punching my wall and breaking shit or laughing my ass off at nothing. I don't know who i am anymore. I don't think i ever woke up. None of this is real lmao. I must be long dead or in a coma because i sure as hell dont remember waking up
