I need something quick, painless, preferably not messy...Iâ€™m so fucking done..Long story short...

Iâ€™m 15 years old. A couple years ago, I lost my dad in the hospital, and my family had struggled financially ever since. Furthermore, I get in constant arguments with my mom and other family members now, like weâ€™ve completely drifted apart, and are more like enemies than family.

On top of that, I struggle to make friends at school. Iâ€™m mostly alone and have no one to confide in when I feel like shit. The people I can confide in never wanna listen, or go on about something else and just completely overshadow me. 

Iâ€™m nothing, to no one, clearly...

I just need to get it over with, nothing slow, nothing painful, nothing messy. Just get it done.
