Iâ€™m a terrible personIâ€™m an awful person. My Junior Prom date decided to quit without letting me know. Most, if not all my friends subconsciously ignore me, and forget I exist. I want to tell them how I feel, but that is selfish, why should I bother them with my problems if they donâ€™t want to talk to me? They probably donâ€™t talk to me for a reason, being which Iâ€™m an awful person. I canâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™m starting to forget everything I know. My friends are all in relationships while Iâ€™m just here, lonely as fuck. I wish a careless driver hit me with a car. I wish lightning struck me. I wonâ€™t do it myself, but I really wish someone did it for me.
