Iâ€™ve done everything right but I am still miserableI was always the â€œgood kidâ€ growing up. My friendsâ€™ parents loved me, I got good grades, never got in trouble. Went on to university, got a degree, got a good job. I have a healthy relationship and an apartment and stable income. From the outside my life looks great. 

So then why do I think of suicide every day? Why do I fight to not cry at my desk at work all day? Why do I get intrusive thoughts of slamming my head against my desk until I pass out? Why do I stay up late because I know another day is coming and I want to put it off as much as possible? I am so anxious and miserable and I donâ€™t know how to go on. I have a therapist who is fantastic but I just canâ€™t seem to put her advice into practice. I just donâ€™t care about anything or anyone and I want it to be over. I feel so numb.
