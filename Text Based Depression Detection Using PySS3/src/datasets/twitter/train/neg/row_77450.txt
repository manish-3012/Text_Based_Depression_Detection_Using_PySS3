I'm giving myself one more year.December 2, 2018. If, by then, my life does not improve in any way, and if I continue to struggle like it's the only thing that matters in life, if I don't get a better job and if I continue with these insane cycle of constant sadness and self-pity, I'm ending my life. I've exhausted all of my resources. If life is all about struggling, all about worrying if you'll have a roof over your head 10 years from now, all about worrying that you'll be able to support yourself, all about making sure enjoying fleeting moments of happiness that will be completely forgotten by long periods of intense sadness, then life is not worth living. I think my parents were very irresponsible to put me in this world, so I'll ask for a refund on life. One year. I hope it comes sooner than I think.
