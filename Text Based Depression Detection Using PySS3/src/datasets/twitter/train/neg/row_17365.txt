My problem: I can't goI've been struggling with depression since junior high. At 40, I understood a lot about how this came to happen. And I am so done with being alive. I am not sad anymore, not angry, not afraid. But I have a big, painful problem. I am a father. This makes it worse. A living hell. Literally, for me. The only reason I am alive at the moment is the fear of hurting my kids. An irrational fear, because they have a good mom and life insurance can most likely help. But I have something in the back of my head that tells me that my death would be a loss of experience and protection to them. On the other hand, I feel that I have no control over the universe and that me staying is pointless anyways. I want the best for them, but we are already living separated for 10 years now. They are used to not see me all the time. and sometimes not for a long time when I have to work odd shifts or second jobs, and I'm totally pissed and tired to be useful anyways. The most comfortable, logical thing to do for me is to just go. I have 0 problem with that. But I feel guilty as fuck that if I take that easy pill, my kids could be impacted. always having, at the last moment of planning, these thoughts that maybe, someday, one of them could be stuck in life and I am the one who can give any advice, to make their life be better. Even if they would have learned to hate me by that time. This is a really horrible and ridiculous situation and makes me feel even dumber. Condemned to be alive, like some kind of purgatory or living hell. I know that I will have to go sooner anyways, hopefully in my mid 50s. I just want to have enough assurance that my presence wont be necessary anymore. Because *this* is fucking hell and it hurts everywhere. Being alive...
