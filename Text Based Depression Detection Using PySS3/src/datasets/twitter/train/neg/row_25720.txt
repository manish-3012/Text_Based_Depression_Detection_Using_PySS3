I'm in so much pain and tired of hurtingI'm 22 years old. I never went to college. I don't have a car. I live with my parents. I only have one friend and she lives an hour away from me. My boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me because I wouldn't get help. I am now in therapy and on antidepressants but I still feel the same. It hurts so much knowing he is with another girl. He wants to be friends but I don't know how much longer I can stand it. I'm trying so hard to get better but I'm so alone. I stopped cutting for him. The nights are getting worse. My thoughts telling me to kill myself. Its my fault I'm not getting better. Its my fault I'm not happy. I have to punish myself. My family knows about me but can't help me. I'm so lost without him. I don't know what to do. I've messed things up too much. I talk to him every day but I miss him so much.
