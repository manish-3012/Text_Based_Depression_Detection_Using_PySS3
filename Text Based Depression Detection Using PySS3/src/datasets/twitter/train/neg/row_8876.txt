Life is work. Work is life.Wake up -&gt; Eat -&gt; Go to work/school -&gt; Come back home with all my energy and motivation gone -&gt; Lay in bed, screwing around online -&gt; Pass out and repeat

"Life isn't work." Ha ha, yeah right. When you dedicate 40+ hours per week, being surrounded by people you don't want to talk to, working for some company you don't give a shit about, life is work. The only good thing about life is the escape from it.
