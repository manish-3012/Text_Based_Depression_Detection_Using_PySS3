Thinking of trying to kill myself again after a failed suicide attempt.I tried to kill myself 6 months ago and failed. I took about 40 Zolpidem and 30 Xanax and throw up for like 2 hours and had to get to the hospital were I was stomach pumped (lol bad luck brian)

A little background I guess: I have always been that quiet kid in school with 0 friends. This was after a while getting me depressed and my grades stared falling and I soon had serveral F:s which made me even more depressed. I always tried to start a conversation or something with my classmates but for the most they just ignored me and walked away. I changed school 3 times but the same thing keept happening over and over again. I now turned to desperete things and joined a small Nazi party and began decorating my room with Swaztikas. I always knew this was nothing for me but I kinda feelt for the first time that I was accepted and had friends. But one day I left the party and I now I had 0 persons to talk to, I was even afraid to look up and contact a therapist. It was here that I tried to commit suicide with the pills. After the suicide attempt I lost everything. I lost the little ammount of friends I had, I lost a lot money and I lost my family. 

It has now been 6 months since the suicide attempt and I am 20 years old. The Swastikas has been replaced by flags of my country but my biggest interest is still WW2, mostly tanks and other neat stuff. My life has it's ups and downs but mostly downs. I still don't have any friends and my Facebook hasen't been updated for months. I'm thinking of buying a gun or making some sort of bomb since I failed with the Pills.

I don't know why I even came here. I guess it's a call of help of some sort.

And sorry for any grammar or spelling misstakes but like I said i got F in a lot of subjects and English was one of them :D
