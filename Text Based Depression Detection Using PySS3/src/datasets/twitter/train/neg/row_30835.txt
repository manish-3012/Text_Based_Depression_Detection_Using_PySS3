New friend CodeineI'm sure everyone here once you get something in your head you cant stop thinking about it. I live by some cliffs and it's always been a comfort to think about jumping off because I know that I wouldnt survive it I dont want any methods that could leave me still living. I've had surgery recently and I've got a whole ton of painkillers Codeine and some naproxen just one of the Codeine gives me a bad reaction (shaking, lightheaded, paranoia etc) so I'm thinking all of them might finish me off considering its morphine. Get some pretty great dreams from it too. 

Thought I was doing a lot better I've not thought about dying since March but I just feel like I'll never be happy and never have what I want in life which isnt much just wish loneliness wasnt so completely crushing. Anytime I fall for someone it's just fantasy for them and this time I even knew it would never be anything but I went and fell for them anyway. The first person in my life I have felt so completely sure of really never felt like this and it's just dawned on me they're going to break my heart and it's all on me. 

I try and be a good person and help people and be kind but I dont know what I've done to deserve this lonely life. I wish I could be loved. Just feel so desperately lonely I dont even want to die just I dont want to live like this either I'm 26 living like this until I'm old just feels so long. Yet I think I completely give up I cant keep doing this to myself.
