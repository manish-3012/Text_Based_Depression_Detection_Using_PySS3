What's wrong with me?Let me start of by saying i've had probably the best life that I could ask for. At the age of 17, I can look back on my life and honestly say that nothing has ever went wrong, or any cause whatsoever to be unhappy. I have two loving parents who have done an amazing job raising 5 kids, we live in a completely upper class gated neighborhood and I've never experienced half the pain others on this sub have. I go to a catholic private high school, but I don't really believe in God. I get pretty good grades (a's and b's) and have good friends. I have nothing to want for, and yet, suicide creeps into my thoughts every day, like a virus. I feel so tired some days, I just want to lay down in my bed and never wake up. It's weird to say for how young I am, but I am just tired of living. The same thing every day, going to college eventually and then what? Working for the rest of my life? My whole family is extremely successful and ambitious, but I just don't want anything. I just want to experience nothingness. Nothing motivates me, I honestly don't think I'll make it out of college, the only thing holding me back right now is the complete and unfair shock it would give my parents. I know i sound like a whiny teenager, i just can't articulate the sheer exhaustion i experience every day from living. Sorry for the wall of text I just need someone anonymous to talk to...
