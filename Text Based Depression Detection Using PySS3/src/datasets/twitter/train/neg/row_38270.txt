About 20 minutes ago I put my mosin to my head and in my mouthI donâ€™t know what to do next. I think I just had to many beers but Iâ€™ve never done this before and I am an alcoholic. I legitimately considered it for a full minute. Just ending it all finally. Not having to worry about paying for all the liquor and beer I just drank. Not having to worry about getting in shape or finishing school or anything. Just a sweet release. Like suddenly falling asleep. But what about my dog. No one would be here to find her for days. I could not possibly leave her here just alone to starve alone like that.  But at the same time I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about that either if I just went ahead and accomplished it. Iâ€™m so tired of being tired and confused.
