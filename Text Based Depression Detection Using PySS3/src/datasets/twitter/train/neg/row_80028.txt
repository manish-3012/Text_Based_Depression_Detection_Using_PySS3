I don't know anymoreIve been suffering with depression for 6 years now (at least diagnosed) I don't know if I can take the pain of the endless eternal void much longer I try to put my best foot forward everyday and its getting me no where fast. I just feel empty, like half a person, lonely, useless, pointless, not needed or wanted. Ive been trying to reach out for help but Im too scared to even ask my own parents anymore since they threaten to send me to a hospital. I don't care if that's where I should be it doesn't justify threatening me with it. I cant even cry anymore to dull the pain or get it all out Ive been over every situation Ive accepted them all nothing scares me in life anymore. I know my life is fucked. ruined, destroyed. I don't know what to do anymore Im starting to lose all my friends so I attempt to make new ones I try to find love but how can someone love me when I don't even love myself. I just want to end it and be over with this hell on earth. Only reason I haven't yet is because I know people care about me but lately I don't even care about myself.
"I dont know weather Im alive or dreaming or dead or remembering How can you tell whats a dream and whats real when you cant even tell when your awake and when your asleep."
