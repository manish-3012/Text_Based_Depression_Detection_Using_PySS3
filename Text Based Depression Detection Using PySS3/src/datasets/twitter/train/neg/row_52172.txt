least disruptive way to dieso I've made up my mind to kill myself, but I don't want my family or friends to find me. I can't add that on top of everything else. But I am worried that something like jumping off a building or in front of a train may not finish me off and then I'll just end up hurting myself so badly that my family will have to care for me the rest of my life
