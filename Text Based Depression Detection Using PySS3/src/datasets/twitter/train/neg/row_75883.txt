I feel like life isn't even real anymoreI can't even explain how often I think about ending it all. I'm 19f and I literally am on medication and go to therapy. I didn't come from a broken family or abuse or anything. I think I simply am broken. I thought things were bad before but now that I'm getting help and still feel this terrible I feel so much worse. I have truly lost hope and feel like I'm already dead. Even though some of the really hard times will pass I feel like I can't live with knowing that they will come again or knowing how dark my mind truly is. Why would anyone want to live with such anxiety and depression. I want to die and I also want a reason to live.
