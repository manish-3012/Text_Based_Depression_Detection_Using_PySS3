 "A hundred times I wanted to kill myself, but I still loved life.  This ridiculous weakness for living is perhaps one of our most fatal tendencies.""a hundred times I wanted to kill 
myself, but I still loved life. This ridiculous weakness 
is perhaps the most disastrous of our inclinations ; for 
is there anything sillier than to desire to bear continually 
a burden one always wishes to throw on the ground ; 
to look upon oneself with horror and yet to cling to 
oneself; in short, to caress the serpent which devours 
us until he has eaten our heart?"

Voltaire anyone?
