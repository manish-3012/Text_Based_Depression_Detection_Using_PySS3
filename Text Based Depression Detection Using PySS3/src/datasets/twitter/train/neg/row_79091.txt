Watching your friends move on...I'm 21 years old. This semester is my first back at my university. I've been away from school for two years since I had a psychotic break and was hospitalized and forced to leave school. Until now, I spent the last two years in almost complete social isolation. I haven't seen my friends since before I was in the loony bin. I was too ashamed to answer their messages, and they eventually gave up. These 3 friends are who I consider to be my closest friends in my life, and I met them in my freshman year. They were my first close friends, and words can't describe how it feels to watch them move on with their lives together without me over Facebook. I've tried messaging them a few times, but they either didn't respond, or they were busy. It's like I woke from a long sleep a few months ago, and everyone has aged and continued their lives while I'm still stuck in the past.


Has anyone had this experience? I tried to tell them what happened, but I don't have the balls to really tell them because of how ashamed and small I feel. I'm worried that my thoughts might lead to a final solution if I keep living this way. How do I escape? I'm not going back to the hospital. I just need to get my friends back and somehow cope with this shame simultaneously. The cognitive dissonance of that is what I'm having a hard time reconciling.
