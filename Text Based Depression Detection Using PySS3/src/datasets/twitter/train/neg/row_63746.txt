I can't eat anymore and I feel like im going crazyI feel like im going utterly insane. I think that the world revolves around sex and I fucking hate it. I find it disgusting and it makes me want to hurt people that encourage this or promote sex. I have had trouble with sexual abuse in the past and have self harmed and contemplated suicide many times. Though these thoughts are becoming more regular and i've had strong thoughts of it several times in the past 2 weeks. I dont know what to do because now im getting thoughts of hurting other people. It makes me feel sick and I'm just tired of being alive anymore. My boyfriend used to sleep around and I found out that he slept with 6 people last year in 5 months and i feel so sick thinking about it and I know thats a jealousy problem but it triggers me to cut and have these thoughts. Im supposed to be going to the doctors soon but I dont know if i can hold on any longer and I want to find a way out. I dont deserve to live anymore and I dont want to live in a world like this.
