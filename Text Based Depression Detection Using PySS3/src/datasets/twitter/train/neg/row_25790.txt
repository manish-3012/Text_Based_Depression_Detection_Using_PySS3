cant stop relapsingIts 4am super drunk taken a couple of 1mg xanax got to go to work at 8am. Ive tried so many times to quit drugs and be normal but I Literally cant do it, im on like my 40th attempt but relapse EVERY time after 2-2weeks. Life just gets so boring and dull after a couple of days I get suicidal so I relapse to escape the anxiety and boredom.
