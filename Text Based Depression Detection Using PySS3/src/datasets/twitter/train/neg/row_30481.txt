Having people who cares but doesn't care enough is horribleOne of the only things I used to get comfort from was the thought that I could kill myself anytime I wanted to. Nowadays I don't even get comfort from that because it's not an option for me anymore. I have concretely realized how badly it would ruin people around me.

It sucks so fucking bad to not have people or even one person in my life to care enough about me to do anything for me, to make me wanna live for myself, BUT to have people who care enough about me to be affected from my actions. Like seriously give be either one. If you can't give me satisfaction then let me at least do anything I want with my life without having to worry about people being worried about me. I'd just want drink all my money away and then get driven over by a train. But no. I have to suffer. And I have to keep suffering because my suicide would cause even more suffering. And I can't even relief the suffering by drinking because that also causes more suffering to other people than it actually relieves my suffering.

I'm so fucking done with not having anyone in my life I could talk to about everything. Or even close to everything. I can't even talk to a psychologist or a therapist about everything because an honest discussion about not wanting to live is something that unfortunately cannot be had. Instead I have to write here anonymously a text that maybe 3 people will read and nobody will respond like last time. I don't know what I'd want people to respond tho. I don't even know why I'm writing. I just feel like I'm in a cage and there's no way out of it and it fucking hurts.
