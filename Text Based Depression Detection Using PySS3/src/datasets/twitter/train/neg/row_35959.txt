Iâ€™m just tired of doing this.Iâ€™m 31 with a 3 year old and wife. I feel like Iâ€™m only a paycheck. Iâ€™m the guy that provides money for a vacation and a trip to Hawaii. I donâ€™t feel worthwhile and know my family would be fine with my life insurance. I could fake an accident easy (cell tower climbing) and things would be fine. 
Things would be easy for everyone and life would be good.
