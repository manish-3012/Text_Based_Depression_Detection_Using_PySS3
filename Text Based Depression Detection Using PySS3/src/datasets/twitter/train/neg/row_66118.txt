Cost of therapistsI seriously believe I need to see a therapist and discuss some of the issues and problems I have. Unfortunately, I don't know how much a therapist runs for and whether or not my insurance would cover it. I recently just got insurance as I started a new job but I can't continue this way. Can anybody who is visiting a therapist give me some insight into how much they are and whether or not they're effective? Please?
