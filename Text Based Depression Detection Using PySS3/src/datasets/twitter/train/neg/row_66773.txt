I wont be able to hold a job everIt's been a year almost I've been unemployed for. I had pyschosis on and off so I guess it's an excuse but still. My parents dont understsnd it . I'm not eligible for the military. I'm severely depressed past 8 yrs. I am so damn ugly. Dumb as fuck book smart wise. 

You know, sometimes these suicidal thoughts are so fuckin strong. They are the most real feelings I've felt too. However sometimes they become so strong I nearly black out every time. I think that I could black out one day and my subconscious will take over and off myself from all this pain. 

I only feel lonely 5-10% of times. But the times I do Jesus it hurts. It hurts so bad to have never been loved. And I know itll never happen. It's sad. But I fell in love with darkness it's all I know. It doesnt get better. I like to suffer and be depressed but  also the odd time I   just wish I had a normal life man.
