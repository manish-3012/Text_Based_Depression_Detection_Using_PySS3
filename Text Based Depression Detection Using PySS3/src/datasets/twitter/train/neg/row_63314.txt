I really wanna end it all but "mum would be sad" is why I'm not able to do it.I really really really wanna just get lost in myself and be able to kill myself... I'm nothing more than a disappointment to everyone including myself. Everyday I lose more of myself. Everyday I'm fighting myself. I'm a disappointment to even my parents. Just a good for nothing child. The person I thought I loved a lot even left me and I probably made her leave me. Maybe because I'm just done with life and everything. I don't see a future for myself and I really don't know how long I can take this. I don't trust anyone and that has lead to me kicking everyone out of my life and now I've got no friends to talk to either. I really don't need any for that matter because they were all a bunch of selfish people. Everyday is the same now,. I really wanna end it myself but just the thought of mum would be sad is what's keeping me going. I really love my parents and I really love my girlfriend who left me... I wish I could make everyone proud of me. I know I'm too much of a scared person to even kill myself and I know I'll have to live this life. But I hope once I finally die I don't come back again to this world... And I hope people get over me soon..
