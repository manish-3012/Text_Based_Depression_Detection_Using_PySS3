Iâ€™m so ugly I wanna claw off my face and dieI feel so ridiculously ugly. I canâ€™t look in the mirror without cringing. It started with when my partner told me that they still found me cute, but not as attractive anymore. They used to tell me all the time how attractive I was, so I actually got some confidence in myself. But when they said that, it all came crashing down again. Iâ€™ve been hit on several times before and my friends have said that Iâ€™m an attractive guy, but I just want the person I love most to want me again. This pain is unbearable, I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Maybe if I end it no one will have to look at my horrifying face again.
