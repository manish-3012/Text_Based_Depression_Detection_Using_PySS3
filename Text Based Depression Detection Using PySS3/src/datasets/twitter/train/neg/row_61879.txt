What the fuck am I doing?I don't have any hobbies. I don't have any passions. I have no motivation. I'm currently failing this semester because I just havent been going to classes. There literally seems to be no point. I dont even have anything to be sad about. Theres noone I really care about, no love interest and no aspirations.

Whenever I try to do something I should be doing, like write a paper, it seems so useless that I simply go play videogames or watch shitty television. Its not like Im not doing work because I have something else to do, Im just not doing it because I have no drive.

Theres nothing traumatic. Ive been given every opportunity in life. I look reasonably good, Im social and Ive always had good grades. It just all seems so arbitrary. Im a disappointment to my parents, my teahcers and worst of all myself. I know I can do better. I wish there was something that would get me going, get me exited and happy to work and be active but theres just nothing.
