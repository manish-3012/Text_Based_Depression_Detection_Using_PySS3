I just want ti end it allFrom the outside looking in I have a good life. Good job, good friends, good family and a good and loving girlfriend but still I want to die. Things in my head just get worse and worse and worse. I tried to get help but nothing seems to work. People would be sad I was gone but in time they would get over it and hell some people might be better off with potential life insurance payouts (not exactly sure if they will payout from suicide) and being an organ donor some people might actually get another chance at life. I was on the verge of tears earlier but not it's just a resigned calm and numbness is all I feel.
