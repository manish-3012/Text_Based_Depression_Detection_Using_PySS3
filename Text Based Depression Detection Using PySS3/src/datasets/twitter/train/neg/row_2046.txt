Everybody in my life will leave me and that's a terrifying thought because it just backs up the thought nobody wants me here.Everyone just ends up leaving. In the past, now. Everyone always fucking ends up leaving me? For what.
Why decide "oh I'll be friends with them, then get tired of them."

I haven't fucking did anything, I don't fucking open up to anyone because I know if I do they'll feel uncomfortable and leave. The closest thing to opening up to my 'friends' is saying I have a problem with abandonment and shit. And that's only to a few people. 
The people in the past that knew I'm suicidal left... I assume they got uncomfortable, so I don't really tell people anymore. 

I don't have any friends anymore, I live in a shitty household. I try and present myself as confident, lovable. People have told me that I'm a nice person. That's because I know most people in this works isn't.
I listen to most people's problems, I care for people, I try not to act mean. I've studied people's behaviours and see what they like in person.
I've tried basically everything to people like me. (expect threatening to kill myself and self harm, I know that's bad)

Basically everyone fucking leaves me, it happening now, it happened in the past. I don't understand. 
My friend of three years told me their going to take a 'break' from speaking to me, it's been a few days already. I know that means not talking to me again. I can't handle this shit, someone left me about 4 weeks ago and now this? Two important people in my life fucking gone. 
I can't, it's obvious them and no one else cares. 
 
Everyday just gets worse, the urge to kill myself keeps getting worse. I've basically got no one anymore, and it just leaves more time for thinking. 

No one cares about me anymore, I'm basically alone. I just want to be happier, have people in my life that cares about me, not to be suicidal. It's just not fair.
