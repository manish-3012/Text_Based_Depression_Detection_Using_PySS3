I am a wasteItâ€™s online schooling and Iâ€™ve been failing myself. Getting distracted on the internet and letting it get the better of me. Instead of getting a chromebook like the school ASKED ME TO, I decided to do it the hard way with my motherâ€™s crusty Toshiba laptop that runs on windows 7. My mother has bought countless things for me to be able to get work done and I e wasted it. All of it. Itâ€™s all my fault. If only I had taken a much easier path, I wouldnâ€™t have had to have my mother scream at me. Iâ€™m not worth all of this pain. Iâ€™m not worth all of this time. I should have figured this out on my own. Iâ€™m a fucking worthless teen who canâ€™t make up her damn mind. Iâ€™m going to fail, I have fucked up. I will never be able to make it up to them. Iâ€™m not worth it. I donâ€™t deserve to live. Iâ€™m just a worthless leach.
