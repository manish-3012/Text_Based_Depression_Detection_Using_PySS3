Apparently nobody cares when you're suicidalTo keep a long story as short as possible:
pretty sure my doctor mixed up my meds.  I was on luvox, asked to be switched to prozac.  That got approved, but the nurse told me to take BOTH of them, not switch them.  Even the pharmacist said it sounded wrong, and called my doctor to check, but they said it was right.

So I've been taking both meds for 3 months now, I go to get the luvox and my buspar refilled, and the pharmacy says that those meds were taken off my records a few months ago (when I started th e prozac)

So now I'm thinking that my doctor fucked up and I wasn't suppose to be taking both SSRIs at once.  I emailed her through the office portal 2 weeks ago, no response.  At all.  About me having to quit 2 of my psychiatric meds cold turkey.  Finally this last Monday I called them.  Told them I was having suicidal thoughts and that I needed to see my doctor, they said they would get a message back to her but she is booked for a month.

I call EVERY CLINIC WITHIN 50 MILES, and they all say they're not taking new patients short notice like that.

Now, to today..... I usually take. 25 Xanax as needed, which before was like once a week if that.  Ever since I had to.stop my other meds, it's gone up regularly, and today I took 5 by lunch time just to function.  So over lunch, I decide I REALLY need help, so I head to urgent care, tell them I've been feeling suicidal, and that I want to see someone.   They tell me that they aren't allowed to change meds through urgent care, and that they can't help me.  And they let me walk out the door.  Without a word.

How the fuck is this possible?  How is this legal?  The saying that nobody cares until you're dead is 100% true.
