I don't even think I'm living anymoreI rarely eat because I'm disgusted with myself when I do I cut myself and don't let my skin heal because I feel like my body should stay ugly and scarred I try to distance myself from everyone because I don't think I deserve any kind of connection with anyone and any connection I do end up forming I usually try to ruin it and end up completely alone again but I hate being lonely and the only time I can feel some sort of happiness is when I'm on my meds which I was told they won't work forever and I will eventually go back to always being depressed and when my meds do wear off my thoughts are terrible I convince myself why I should kill myself and that no one will care which is probably true and I feel like I should just give up I know people probably won't read this and if you did I'm sorry I wasted your time
