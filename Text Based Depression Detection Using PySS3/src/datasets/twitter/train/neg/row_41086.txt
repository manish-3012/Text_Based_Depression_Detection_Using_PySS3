Iâ€™m not going to make it until 2020I canâ€™t do it anymore. Iâ€™ve been trying for over a decade to find relief from my illness with no success and periods of where it gets worse. 

I am awesome, I am talented, I CAN do so much good if I wasnâ€™t so depressed but I just canâ€™t muster the strength anymore. 

Everyone keeps telling me how I have to live my life as I am so smart and a women of a very marginalized race.

I cannot be what people expect me to be and I donâ€™t know what I expect from myself, I hurt so much it takes all that I can to keep going. But Iâ€™m done. 

Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m not strong enough, believe me I feel guilty for those who I will hurt but Iâ€™ve tried long enough and I deserve to be selfish for once. I have it all planned out, I have the supplies and Iâ€™m ready to move on. Itâ€™s probably for the better, I am not a positive influence to the lives of those who deserve it. Iâ€™m so, so sorry
