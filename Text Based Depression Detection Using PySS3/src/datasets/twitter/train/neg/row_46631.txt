I want to die, but I want to believe there are good years ahead.Iâ€™m unable to work, not just because of COVID, but because I deal with anxiety, bipolar and learning disability. The anxiety is quite manageable until itâ€™s triggered. My anxiety is because Iâ€™ve had control, whether or not itâ€™s real or an illusion, violently ripped away, not a couple times, but frequently over the last 30 years. I was able to manage my anxiety by writing, it gave me the illusion of control back, but the anxiety is too much for me right now.

Since I canâ€™t work I have to depend on a small allowance from the government, and the sale of my fantasy novels, but that limits what I am able to do because I also have 4 kids who are my greatest joy, and my greatest pain. Because I canâ€™t afford to do anything for them, and I fear they will be just like me.

Let me go back to the beginning: 7 years ago I had to move back in with my mom because I couldnâ€™t hold a job and couldnâ€™t afford rent. Since then my mom passed away and left us with the prospect of having to cover all bills. The money she left us will only last six more months. Letâ€™s be clear, Iâ€™M NOT ASKING FOR MONEY. Iâ€™ll take pity in a pinch. 

But if you could check out my book series, The Jershon Saga, available for free on Kindle Unlimited, and tell your friends and family I would be extremely grateful.
