I'm tired.I have been thinking about cutting my wrists and being done. I'm overwhelmed and sad all the time. I have a great life. Why am I so unhappy? Why am I so thinking of just wanting things to done. I'm selfish because I wanna do things on my own and I want to be left alone. I have to work through my panic attacks or I wont be able to do what I need for myself/family. I cant ask for help because that will make me a failure in my own eyes. Anytime I get so stressed to the point I feel panic come on...someone tries to help me..and it just makes me panic more and more to the point I just wanna grab knifes a d do it. It's even worst when its quiet because all the things I do wrong just come back to haunt me later. 


"Why are you panic?!?"

"I DONT KNOW!!" 

everything just starts to narrow and I never want to harm anyone else...just me. I'm sorry. Things just hurt and i have no one who understands to listen...just listen. It's so hard.
