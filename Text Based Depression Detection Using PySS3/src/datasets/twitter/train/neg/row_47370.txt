What hope is there when things are good and your life is objectively great but you still wish it was over?A question a user asked in this sub earlier. I'm 22 and have *everything* I could need to be happy. Health, free and relatively easy education, money (very easy local part-time job), great relationships with my family and friends. But I want literally nothing more than to be dead already.
