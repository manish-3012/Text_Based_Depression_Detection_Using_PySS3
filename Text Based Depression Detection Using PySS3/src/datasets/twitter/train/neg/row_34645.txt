Iâ€™m sorryI donâ€™t know what to do with myself anymore. Iâ€™m drowning in my thoughts. I donâ€™t know who I am anymore. My memory is wearing down. Forgetting things. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m living in a big shadow, or cloud. Even when I havenâ€™t been drinking. I get this tunnel vision when I go outside. I donâ€™t know how long I have left. 

I love you all.
