Iâ€™m broken.The last two days have been worse than ever. I cannot get this suicide mentality out of my head. Every minute is a reminder that I should be dead . I stopped cutting for a week but went back to it tonight. Well I didnâ€™t cut this time. I stabbed my arm with the entire blade, pulled it out, and watched my blood drip into the sink. And then I started sobbing. This feeling of what Iâ€™m doing to my body...my body didnâ€™t deserve it, but *I* do, if that makes sense. I want to kill myself so bad. I do. I want to stop the endless, constant suffering. I just donâ€™t know if I have the strength to do it.
