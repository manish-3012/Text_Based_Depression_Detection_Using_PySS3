I'm just so sadI'm not supposed to feel like this but I am so very sad all the time. I put on a brave face and smile for my boyfriend and my family but I have this horrible void inside that I just can't fill. I cry for no reason when I am alone and I just think everyone would be better off if I died. 
I think the only reason I'm still around is because I don't want to destroy the people that love me but I am hurting so so much and don't know what to do.
I can't really talk to anyone, I feel so alone.
How do I stop these feelings? I have so much to live for......but do I really? 
Please someone, anyone. Talk to me.
