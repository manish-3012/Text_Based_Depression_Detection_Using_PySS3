Can't take my mom's remarks anymoreShe treats me like shit then acts like the victim when I call her out. She yells at me for little things, claims my depression is all in my head and I'm just lazy etc, then gets mad when I start crying. Today I asked her to repeat herself when she asked me about dinner so she yelled at me, then I said I wasnt in the mood to eat and cried and she left and came back when it was done and told me to either go out and eat or keep wallowing in my misery. She always makes snotty remarks under her breath (and to our faces) about me and my brother and it makes me wonder if she hates us so much why does she want to keep custody of us so much? Just to make me suffer more? When she was with her abusive boyfriend she made me feel like all of his outbursts were my fault for being kind of messy. 
I'm starting to wonder if I kill myself if she'll even feel bad about it. I want her to. I want to kill myself to make her miserable for treating me and my brother like shit all the time, I want her to feel sorry. I'm so close to doing it, I'm just so sad all the time and she acts like it's all in my head.
