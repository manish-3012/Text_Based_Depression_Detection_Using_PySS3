I tire of this.So, a roughly 19 years old here. Just recently got recently discharged from a mental ward again as the doctor seems to believe I'm okay after a month of being in there. I'm not. Today is Christmas, a day where I should be feeling happiness and joy, yet, I only feel tired. I so badly want to end it. For the last 5 years, I've had depression and anxiety disorder, it reached its peak three years ago and I decided I needed help, and went to a doctor. They placed me in a ward and I recovered enough to return back to society last year.


However, this year has been nothing but horrid. I feel like a reject in school as I'm 3 years older than them.  My tooth seems to keep on breaking and cracking no matter how much I tried to take care of them, one of them is causing me to feel like vomitting for a week now, how depressing.I keep hearing voices, telling me to end my life, it's been 4 months with them now and they still whisper new methods to kill myself with. The shadows are on the move. They used to be passive. And worst of all, I keep seeing myself in impossible places. In the middle of a busy road, standing on the air outside of my apartment, reaching out for me. And the worst part is, I feel like reaching back out and letting myself die. I'm so tired of everything going wrong. I'm so tired of my teeth issues. If I'm gone, then I'll probably save my mother from wasting a lot of money on a worthless trash like me.

If I can just muster up the courage to do it.. I can end this nightmare. Once. And for all.
