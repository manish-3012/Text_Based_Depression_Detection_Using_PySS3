I don't feel anything anymore.I haven't eaten in two days. I can barely sleep. All I do is lie down in bed and stare at the wall.

Before, I'd just feel sad to the point where I couldn't even force myself to smile. I'd cry all the time and stuff my face with food while hating myself for every fucked up thing I've ever done. Now...I just don't feel anything.

What's wrong with me? I'm not happy or sad. I feel nothing at all.. all of the anger and hatred and sadness has just disappeared. I don't think I know how to feel anymore. I think.. I'm done. I don't want to be alive anymore. I don't want to pretend that everything's okay when I don't fucking feel anything there. 

I'm so close to killing myself. Tonight just might the night.. the pill bottles are calling my name. But I don't know how I feel. I don't know if this is what I want. I have no fucking clue anymore.
