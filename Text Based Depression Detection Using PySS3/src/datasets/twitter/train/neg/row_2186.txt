Homeless later today, abused, aggressed against, and "dominated" my entire adult life.I just want to finish my suicide note, but I have some weird lethargy and indifference. The structure of society, the dominant ideology, and people acting on their behalf have ruined my life, traumatized me, and have greatly diminished my ability to function in the dominant bullshit paradigm.
