I stood in my basement for over an hour with a noose around my neck, turns out I'm too much of a coward to kill myselfNow I'm just crying. I actually felt kinda good before that, flat and emotionless but still ok. Now I'm a 28 year man sitting here crying like a baby while playing with his beard. Fantastic
