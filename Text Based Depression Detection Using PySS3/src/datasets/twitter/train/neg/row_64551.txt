Iâ€™ll probably do it in the next couple daysIâ€™ve been suicidal for a while but I think Iâ€™m reaching the point where I might actually do it. My relationship probably just ended. I say probably because Iâ€™m trying to change his mind but I donâ€™t know if it will work. I love him so much and I honestly donâ€™t want to live without him. This last year has been hell on me. I sort of tried to kill myself last month, I say sort of because I didnâ€™t truly want to die and I stopped in the middle of the attempt. I keep going back and forth from calm to suicidal and Iâ€™m realizing more and more that Iâ€™ll probably never be happy. The closest Iâ€™ve ever gotten to happy is numb and thatâ€™s still such a horrible feeling. When I last attempted I swallowed some pills, not enough to be toxic. I didnâ€™t realize at the time how horrible death by overdose can be. Iâ€™ve decided this time Iâ€™m going to slit my forearm and wrist. I realize the cut itself will hurt but at least I can peacefully fall asleep while I bleed out. I try to think about being happy without him but I truly canâ€™t. He is literally my other half and the only type of happiness in my life. I know the only reason I havenâ€™t done it yet is because Iâ€™m scared of the pain and the unknown, but I keep reminding myself how horrible it is for me on this earth, and how peaceful it would be to fall asleep and not wake up. When Iâ€™m gone, that fear will be gone too, Iâ€™ll be free.
