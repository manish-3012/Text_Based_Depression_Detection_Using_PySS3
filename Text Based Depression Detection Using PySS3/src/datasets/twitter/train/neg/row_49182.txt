To be or not to be? My marriage has ended, not it seems like there's only one solution.Hi, all. I just confessed to my wife of 4 years to cheating on her. It was a one night stand and I told her right when I got home. I couldn't keep it a secret. I knew what a horrible and unforgivable thing I did and I just couldn't live knowing I had done that to her and her not knowing. Two days later she told me she wanted a divorce. I can't blame her. She shouldn't have to be with someone she can't trust.

My family won't speak to me. My church won't speak to me. I'm completely alone, and I deserve it.

We're now 3 days away from signing the papers and I just don't think I can live without her. I know I should have thought about the affect what I did would have on her in all areas of her life. But what's done is done. 

I can't live knowing the hurt I've caused to all those around me. I now have no friends, no family, and no wife (deservingly so). Plus, it would be easier on her financially if I did myself in.

Is there any reason I shouldn't do it? Whay should I do?
