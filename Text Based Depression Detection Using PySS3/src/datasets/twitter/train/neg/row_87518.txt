Anyone out there want to chatIm drunk. Dealing with a lot. Not many people would like to talk with someone like myself right now. If I were sober, I would brush this post off. But I am struggling. I feel like I'm about to take my own life. A lot of stuff happening lately. A chat would go a long way. Hoping everyone is doing well.
