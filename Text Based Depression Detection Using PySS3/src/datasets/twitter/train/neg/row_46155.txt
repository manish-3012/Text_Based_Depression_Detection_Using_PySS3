Im actually a problemI can't be happy.

Thoughts of death and nothingness creep into my soul with every bit of vulnerability I demonstrate.

I yearn to bleed and feel my pain dissipate into the air.


My life has been a success in the life of others but I have ups and downs that cannot be controlled.

I've been in therapy. Its been 10 years of these thoughts and I'm 23. Its getting worse and I'm going to kill myself soon. Its not that Im actively planning it but I sense the feelings will surpass my survival instinct. 

Ill leave behind my wife but I guess that's what's meant to be. If she gave a damn I wouldn't be on reddit to get this off my chest now would I.

If there's anyone out there that feels how I do maybe leave a comment and lets sort this shit out or bite the bullet together.
