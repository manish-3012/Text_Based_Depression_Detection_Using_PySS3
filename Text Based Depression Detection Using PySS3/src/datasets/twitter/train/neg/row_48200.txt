Been a while since I've been on hereFinals are coming up. Just wrecked my dad's car today. Nothing major but he needs to get a new front light cuz I smashed it. It was really embarassing having people watch me and watching my dad try to fix the front of the car. I took it as an omen that im not gonna have a great week. I took a practice exam for my math class and I bombed. Idk if I can maintain my GPA. I'm eating ass in my philosophy class and I need maybe a C or a high D on my essays to pass. Im just really worried about my future and I keep thinking back to the 3 months ago when I tried to take my own life. I dont have any ideations anymore, but man my mind is really tormenting me right now.
