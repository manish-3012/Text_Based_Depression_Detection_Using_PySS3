What's the fucking point?At school, I'm the happiest person you'll meet. You would never guess that I've attempted suicide, or that I think about it a lot. At home...its different. I get bullied.. by my brother. My parents response? Ignore it. If I ask for help, I get ignored. I can't fucking take it. Today, I got slapped *only* because I was frustrated when my father wouldn't listen to my explination of something..the only reason I'm still here is because of my little brother and my best friend. I love my little brother, he's the only one that I have a connection with. And my bestfriend, if I killed my self, she would kill herself because she too, is really close to the edge. The fact that I hate my self doesn't held either.I worthless, I just want to die, but I don't want to hurt my friends or brother.

EDIT: my father just tolda me that I ruined his christmas, because I got a D on my report card

EDIT2:I just blew up on them. They're talking about councling. I don't want that.
