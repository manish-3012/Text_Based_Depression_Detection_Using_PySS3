I might not even be in the right place.I thought I better say something to someone somewhere. I've been spending time looking at suicide prevention hotlines lately but always decide against calling. 

I've been depressed for over 10 years now, I never talk about it, no therapy or anything. I just try to keep my hands busy. It helps for a while. Now that things are slowing down for everyone and we're isolating I can't sleep, I don't eat. I think about the set of circumstances I'm dealing with now and how the affects of it ripple over to everything. I'm nowhere near the end of it and already it cost me everything. The ripples will be a tsunami by the end. 

I love my kids more than anything in the world. Spending time with them, watching them grow and wondering what they will become. Watching their eyes swell everytime I leave, hearing them cry inside as I walk to the car. It fucking rips me apart. I want to be there for them more than anything, but I can see how painful it is to them. They feel betrayed and confused. Me too kiddos.

In 10 years I went from homeless to well off and back to homeless, depressed the entire time with a couple shining moments in between. Everything I worked towards, and became. Gone. My kids get roped in with me too. All because I told myself to stick it out, things will get better. 

I'm hurting. They're hurting. I could do more for them as a check. It's better than what I got. 

I've never been good at talking about how I felt. I never wanted to worry the people who kept me going. I zigged when I should have zagged. 

Maybe I'm wrong. I've been wrong before, but I've been right too. 

I know we all have a lot on our plate right now, I just wanted to know I did something. Thanks for reading. I hope you all get to where you need to be again.
