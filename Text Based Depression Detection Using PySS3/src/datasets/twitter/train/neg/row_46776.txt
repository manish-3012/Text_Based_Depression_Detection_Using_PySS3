Maybe this will help someone?I'm going to kill myself. I don't know when but I know that day Is coming. The day everyone will look down on me with disappointment smeared across their faces. Those looks will be way too much to carry with me. Burned into my already hurting eyes. I know that day is coming. I've been watching the tiny dominoes clicking into each other, getting louder each passing second. I'm quietly waiting for the day the last one crashes to the ground revealing all their crippling looks of udder dissipointment. I'll drown in those looks. Why don't I stop the dominoes? End the cycle? I'm just watching through these teary eyes that are killing me. Am I not stopping them because I'm too tired to catch up to them? Or am I letting them fall because I know that death is promised at the end of the trail. Either way I've failed.
   And I know my wish means nothing to you, yet everything to me. I wish you never follow me.
