I think Iâ€™m almost ready.I have a plan. Iâ€™ve actually had the same plan for months, but for the longest time I had a huge problem with my plan. I didnâ€™t want my roommates or fiancÃ© to find me. I couldnâ€™t figure out any way where I would be capable of killing myself, but also in a situation where the ones I love most wouldnâ€™t see me dead.
Now, I figured out that last detail. Iâ€™m going to die in a hotel room and leave a note on the outside of the bathroom door telling whoever opens the room to call the authorities. Police officers and emts see that kind of stuff all the time, so I feel less guilty about this way. Itâ€™s such a simple solution, I feel like such an idiot for not seeing it sooner.
Im not going to tell my therapist this for obvious reasons, but I felt like I had to put this somewhere.
