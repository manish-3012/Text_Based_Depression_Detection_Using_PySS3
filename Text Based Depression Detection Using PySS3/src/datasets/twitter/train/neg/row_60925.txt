I just find life incredibly boring.I don't know what else to say. 

I just find life in general quite boring. I don't think there's anything much I haven't really done.. I've traveled a lot. I go to an Ivy League school. I've had pretty much all the different types of sex you can. I seriously feel like even the stuff I haven't done, I can imagine doing and it's totally average. 

I'm so bored. I really want to go just because staying here seems awful and tedious. 

Boredom is what I feel all the time. I have no idea how to be excited again. I don't see the point of living when everything is so boring. I just want to go.

I don't even know what else to say. I'm also a totally awful person. I cheat constantly. I lie. I am so mean. I just don't know what to do. Please help me.
