Not looking to kill myself, but actively looking to â€œaccidentallyâ€ die.Do you ever think about â€œwhat if I accidentally fell on the subway trackâ€ or â€œwhat if I â€˜wasnâ€™t paying attentionâ€™ and got hit by a car?â€

I always do stupid things that put my life at risk because I honestly donâ€™t care. It wouldnâ€™t be the worst thing if I died, but I canâ€™t kill myself. I have 4 younger siblings and my family would be devastated, and I know my mom would blame herself. 

Help.
