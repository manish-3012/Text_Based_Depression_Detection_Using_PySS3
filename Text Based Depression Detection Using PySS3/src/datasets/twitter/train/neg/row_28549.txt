Birthday with myself...I am lonely....for once in my life I have had my birthday alone. My folks won't cancel their doctors appointment to come eat cake with me. My friends have better things to do and my own brother would rather work then spend time with his own flesh and blood. I have utterly no one to spend my birthday with....I ran out of generic Prozac since my insurance runs out so I can't touch through it anymore...first time I've had a panic attack in months just happened on my birthday....right now I regret this day more by the minute. Maybe I should end it where it all started...
