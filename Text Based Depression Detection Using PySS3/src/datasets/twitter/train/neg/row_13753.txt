funeral attendeesI've been having suicidal thoughts for some time now. Today things got worse as I had an argument with a loved one. My anxiety and fear crawled up so much it felt like they didnt care about me one iota. I got thinking if I did kill myself and i do have a few plans having given way too much thought into this. i got thinking who would attend my funeral?

Theres my girlfriend. Her brother and girlfriend might go too but theyre both in on call jobs in medicine. i'm unsure about my parents. they might be relieved more than anything. not joking. i've been a drain on them and I know it thx to acute mental health problems that I didn't used to have. I've got 1 sibling that might come. The other probably not. I have like 2 online friends. a shell of my former self that had way way more irl and online friends.

really got me down realizing alla this.
