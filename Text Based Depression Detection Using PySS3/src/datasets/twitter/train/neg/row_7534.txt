I'm just a terrible personI just do things which I'm not aware of that hurt people and make them hate me. The way I am, the way I was raised just make me a terrible person. Worst part? I don't even understand why. Why do I do such things? Why am I such an annoying piece of shit? I'm not intreresting, the only way I can get people to notice me is my humor, which is ironic humor. It gets old, and it becomes annoying. Other than that, I'm just an anxious prick. I don't want to live this life anymore, I can't see myself in the mirror without a feeling of disgust. It would be selfish to kill myself, but I'll be doing everyone a favor, they won't have to deal with my bullshit anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself is my parents, my friends probably can't stand me anymore anyway. 

I'd just like to change, completely.
