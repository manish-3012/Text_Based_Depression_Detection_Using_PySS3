my psychiatrist is awfulMy psych keeps throwing diagnoses in my face, ADD and OCD (though i have hardly symptoms of either) and most of the symptoms are easily attributed to my already diagnosed social anxiety. She tells me people have more difficulties than I do, which is fucking terrible to say to a suicidal teen. She doesnâ€™t believe that I want to die either.
