Got my letter, my shotgun, and just waiting to be found outWell I spent 30,000 in a year and a half.  MOst of it on prostitutes. If my dad finds out I spent that much Iâ€™m going to drive to a Forrest, pull the trigger. I canâ€™t even account for most of the money. 

I fucked up. Beyond repair. I canâ€™t get a job to even begin to try and work to repay him.  Iâ€™m not going to kill myself at home, property value will drop too much.  I have a shitty degree and never had to work to earn money. Now the money is all but gone and Iâ€™m struggling to eat or do anything. For the past weak I could stomach food. I rarely left my room.  I just tried to find meaningful jobs in order to crawl out of this hole. But nothing is working.

Maybe is life insurance can cover suicide?
