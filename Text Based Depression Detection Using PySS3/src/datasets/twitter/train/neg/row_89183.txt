Why do I feel suicide is the best option to me?I can't feel joy for anything anymore. This depresive thoughts are always on my mind and I don't know how to get away from them. I can turn them off watching porn because I'm adidct to it. I've been trying to affront this shit but it always defeat me, I wanna fucking live but I feel that is better to me to just die. I dont want to do things anymore, making goals, those goals that I dreamt years ago. What can I do to feel joy again?
