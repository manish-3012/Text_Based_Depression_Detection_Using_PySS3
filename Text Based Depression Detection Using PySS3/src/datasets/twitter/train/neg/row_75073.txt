I can't cry anymore.I've been using different antidepressants past few years and i started to prozac 3 months ago. I am 19 years old. I did try to hide it from myself but i really can't cry. I feel so empty. all i can feel is anger and boredom. I can't be happy. i am sad but i can't cry i dont know what to do. I can't reach to my psychiatrist because im in quarantine (my father is covid-19 positive) I don't know what to do. if i dont take prozac i have really bad anxiety attacks. but it also numbs me
