Forever hopelessIt seems like no matter what, there's always something that'll get me down.
And no matter how I try, that something will ultimately lead me back to wanting to take my own life.

Things have improved since this time last year, a lot of life problems have gone, I don't even have self hatred anymore.
But I'm still not any happier.
And there's not really much of a reason for me to feel so low all the time now, and that in itself gets me down.

I feel awful for feeling ungrateful for the things I have in life.

I wish I wasn't so depressed all the time.
