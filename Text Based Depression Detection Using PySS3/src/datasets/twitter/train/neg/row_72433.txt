Why nowI don't know why, but as of late I have been more emotinal and had mote trouble sleeping, today I hid a breaking point and I'm suddenly crying in bed and I have no idea why.
To clarify, I used to be bullied through my youth and handled it pretty bad, I came to the point of wanting to die for about a year as my grades dropped and I slowly descended in the school ranks. Since that time I have gotten my life together and atm I'm studying in university, got my friend list up and been having a pretty decent life. I have broken down like this before, but it was always during more negative times when I was in a vulnerable state. This is just random. Today was pretty great as I managed to repair my headset and save myself some money. I was generally in a good mood lately and thought nothing much of the sleep and enotion troubles, figured it was just an odd ocurance.
But the fact that it happened so out of blue is now really scaring me. I just don't want to go back to that time. I hope that venting a bit here is going to help and I thank you guys for hearing me out, excuses for any grammar and spelling errors.
