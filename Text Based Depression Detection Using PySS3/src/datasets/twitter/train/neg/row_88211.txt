I want bad things to happen to me hoping that will make me impulsive enough to finally end itI honestly want bad things to happen to me. Today was another day where I got really mad and I felt completely fearless. I could have easily hanged myself without hesitation in that moment. But I decided to wait an hour for whatever stupid reason. That was such a big mistake. Because then I started ruminating about everything again and my stupid survival instinct kicks in so that I won"t have the guts to do it anymore. I've had these situations so so many times but every single time I decide to wait and not just do it immediately when the rush is still there and I feel impulsive enough to kill myself. I usually decide to google everything again (even tho I did that countless times already) to make sure I'm hanging myself the right way. There would be nothing worse for me than turning out to be disabled and not dead.
