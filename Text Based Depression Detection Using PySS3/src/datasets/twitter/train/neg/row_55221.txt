Failed first semester of med school and am a virgin and want to dieBasically what the title says. I'm really disheartened. I don't feel as if I deserve to live anymore. I don't want to be left behind. I don't want to disappoint my parents. I don't want to be lonely. I'm currently researching most painless ways to die. Please help. I'm in danger of hurting myself.
