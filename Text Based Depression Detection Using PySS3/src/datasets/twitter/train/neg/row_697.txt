It's been One YearI kind of have a weird tradition I've been technically doing for nearly a decade now, though it's also sort of off and on. See, every year after my most recent suicide attempt, I celebrate it's anniversary. Whether it's a treat to myself or, as was with this past Wednesday, spending the day with myself, I look back on the day I last attempted. I refect on the year and whether or not I think it's been worth surviving.

However, this past "anniversary" was the first one I could actually celebrate in about four years. Since my first one, I've attempted seven times, and four of those have been stopping said celebration for just under half a decade. You'd think I'd have gotten better since it's finally been a year, right?

There's not that urge to go and jump off something or to slice myself open, but rather a void that's growing inside. Not necessarily something that is sucking me dry, but rather attempting to fill me up with the emptiness. I'm constantly trying to fight this, but I'm thrown a curve ball each time.

There's nothing I can do, is there? There's no point in celebrating if I keep losing. I'm just hurting so much, and I know I'm too broken to be fixed. If I can't even appreciate the year since my last attempt, what's the point?
