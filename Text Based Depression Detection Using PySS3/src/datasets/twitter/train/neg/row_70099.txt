Finally found happinessThe "light at the end of the tunnel" phenomenon is real. That light is nothingness, it's oblivion. It's freedom from forced existence as what boils down to a man who caught the tranny disease. Brought up as a man for 20 years, stuck in and disgusted by one's body. I no longer have to worry about pleasing anyone, will no longer be tortured by the mental illnesses and misanthropy in my head. No more days stuck in bed unable to draw up the courage to look in the mirror. No obligation to work 40 hours a week for the next 60 years. There's *nothing* in my future and I couldn't be happier. My poison is shipping overseas at the present, and I haven't anticipated anything this strongly since Christmas of 1999. I know it's finally over and my worries are evaporating. Goodbye.
