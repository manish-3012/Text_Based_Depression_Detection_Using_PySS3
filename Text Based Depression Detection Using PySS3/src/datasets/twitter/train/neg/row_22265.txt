Im ashamed of what i just didschools  almost out, 12 days for me untill its all over. i was happy at first, you know no grades, teachers, waking up early. summer sounded like a fucking blast. but then it hit me, i have no friends what am i gonna do all summer. everyone hates me at school becuase of some asshole who used to be my friend, i used to be everyones friend. i was on my A game untill he decided he didnt like me anymore and spread rumors untill everyone hated me. im so fucking lonely its driving me insane, school is the only way i come in contact with people and summers taking that away from me. i wanted to join a club over the summer but there all too expensive and my moms to depressed to even care about me. im so alone, i attemped suicide twice already the past 2 years after my dad left and our money went down the drain but i was hesitant. i wasnt sure. im sure now, ill make sure i dont stop. fuck this. fuck everyone. fuck everything im done. i just want to be happy
