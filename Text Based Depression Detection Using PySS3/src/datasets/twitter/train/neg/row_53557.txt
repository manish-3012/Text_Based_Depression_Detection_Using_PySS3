Iâ€™m going to do it tomorrow morningAs the title says, Iâ€™m going to sleep and then in the morning Iâ€™ll take the whole box of ibuprofen we have. I donâ€™t even know if I really want to die, I just really want help. I have BPD and anxiety but my doctor wonâ€™t prescribe me medication because Iâ€™m â€˜not bad enoughâ€™ and the public health counseling sessions I have are only once every month and a half. If I go private it will be $150 per hour and I canâ€™t afford that.

Iâ€™ve already pretty much ruined things with my friends, family, and girlfriend. So tomorrow Iâ€™ll wait until everyone has left and then take the pills. I might end up calling an ambulance straight away or I after taking the pills I might realise that this is what i want. I just really need support for my issues but itâ€™s impossible to get and Iâ€™m so tired of this shitty life.

I wonâ€™t tell anyone I know before I do it, that way I one can stop me if I decide to die. Iâ€™m not going to write a note or anything.

Iâ€™m not sure why I posted this. I guess since Iâ€™m not telling anyone in my life I at least wanted someone to know. I hope at least one person reads this.

Goodnight
