It is all my fault.I have no one to talk to. Iâ€™m 17 and I hate myself.

I donâ€™t even know where to start. I just hate myself. I really donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t make friends. I canâ€™t get into relationships. It is all my fault. I am an awful, annoying person. Nothing seems real anymore. I canâ€™t talk to anyone because no one cares. I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t like myself. I am a mess, I donâ€™t like sleeping and I donâ€™t like waking up. 

I always try to change. But it is all my fault I canâ€™t because It is never enough. I try too hard. How can I stop? I canâ€™t talk about these things because everyone just seems to go away because they are annoyed by me. I hate myself so much. 

I always think of Lip Gallagher's speech to his friend, about starting over. I wish I could start over. I have everything too. I just...donâ€™t like myself and I mess it all up. I am a loser. I am my own worst enemy. I am embarrassing and annoying. And maybe it may just be high school, I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t really care. I am weak, I let everyone push me over. I wish I wasnâ€™t like this. I wish I had someone to talk to. People always come and go, but it seems like everytime I try to talk about my problems everything ignores me. Why is it cool to not care? 

I take everything seriously. I donâ€™t have any good comebacks. I feel crazy. I canâ€™t even finish a screenplay. Iâ€™ll probably delete this when I feel better. I just donâ€™t know how itâ€™s so easy for everyone. 

My only real friend told me she doesnâ€™t like to talk to me anymore. I donâ€™t blame her. I am mean to her, and I donâ€™t know why. I want to die. I really hate myself. I canâ€™t accept myself because...well, if you knew, youâ€™d understand. I canâ€™t change, I mean, I can keep trying, but itâ€™s never enough. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know how to be. I donâ€™t know how to be the person I want to be. It feels so good to cry. I havenâ€™t cried in a long time. I donâ€™t want to go to school tomorrow but I have too. I already missed too many days. Its not like my school cares. 

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I am so alone and I canâ€™t talk to anyone. Can anyone help me? I just need you to understand that I am much better then where I was a year ago, but I still donâ€™t like myself. Iâ€™ve stopped doing things that I use to do, so maybe that can give me some hope. I just donâ€™t know what to do. 

I am aware of all the things I do. I just wish I wasnâ€™t. We always tell ourselves stories of how our lives will be, who we will be...but those are just stories. Life isnâ€™t a story, itâ€™s life. 

I canâ€™t even breath sometimes. I feel so tired and weak. I feel like I am doomed. And itâ€™s all my fault. I feel so mad at myself. I donâ€™t know why I do the things I do. I am pathetic.
