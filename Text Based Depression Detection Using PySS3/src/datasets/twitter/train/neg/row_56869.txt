I feel like I'm losing my sanityMy dad told me that he was going to work on homework with me even though I absolute hate dad(for reasons I don't feel like addressing in this post) he was really nice today and I feel like the rest of my memories about him being bad are like corrupted or wrong maybe when I ask him about some stuff that I thought happened in the past, he will say that it never happend, I don't know who to trust I don't think I can trust myself any more I don't know who I am, like I know what I think happened in my life my "name" friends places things but I don't know if I'm being myself I don't know my real personality even when I feel like I'm being my real with people I always feel like I'm lieing some way some how I think I might be going crazy or something, I don't feel safe at home, school or in in my body. I feel like killing myself, yet I haven't cried in forever like I'm some sort of crazy deranged murderer or something, that probably not the best description, I want to talk to somebody but I feel alone, the good friends I feel like are my friends seem depressed as well and I don't want to push my shit on to their lifes then they'll feel like shit as well I dont know why I writing this, I feel like I'm crazy just writing this, I don't know what to think or if I can trust myself, or who I actually am anymore. I don't feel safe anywhere. But I'm to much of a coward to actually kill myself and follow through with it, my life probably isn't that bad it's probably just all in my head. But even though that's what I've been told I can't fix my brain, I don't know what to do I don't, feel like anyone actually likes me for me, and the ones that actually to seem like they care are just doing it cause I look sad a lot, this probably isn't the best spot to end this but I need to go eat dinner, don't know when or if I'll respond to replys I'm just trying to and I don't really have anyone I know I can talk to right now, thanks for reading
