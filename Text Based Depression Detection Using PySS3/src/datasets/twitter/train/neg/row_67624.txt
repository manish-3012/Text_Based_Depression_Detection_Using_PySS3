I feel truly aloneI feel like crying every day over the fact I havenâ€™t even had a proper conversation with someone in so long, I have no friends, and itâ€™s not like I can change that because Iâ€™m so socially inept. I canâ€™t even begin to imagine how lonely I will be when I get older and i live alone, probably not even hearing from another human in months. I just want to die. I donâ€™t want to live out my life in immense emotional pain. I canâ€™t cope with the fact my life is pointless, and that I will never be anything significant to anyone or anything. Iâ€™m in so much pain I wish it would stop for just a day I want to feel like I have a purpose. 
I know Iâ€™m young and I still have so many more chances to make friends and talk to people but any sort of interaction terrifies me, even thinking about it makes me feel like throwing up. and I know Iâ€™ll fuck it up every single time so I might as well die already because whatâ€™s the point in living in loneliness?
