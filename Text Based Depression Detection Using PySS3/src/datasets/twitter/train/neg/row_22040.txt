I just can't do itI have every reason to take my own life, but I can't.

My girlfriend dumped me out of the blue. I thought we were happy, so it was a huge slap in the face.

I'm stuck in a religion that I don't believe in because I'm too much of a wimp to break my family's collective heart and leave.

I have no self-esteem, just looking in a mirror is enough to make me depressed.

I have no aim or goal in life, I'll probably end up working the same job for years with no end.

All my friends are happy and attractive and satisfied with their lives but I'm just not.

It all comes down to the fact that I'm just too much of a pussy to off myself, which makes me hate myself even more. It's just a vicious cycle.

I don't know what to do.
