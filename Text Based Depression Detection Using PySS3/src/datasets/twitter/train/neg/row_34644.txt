Just so lonely.Even though everyone says suicide isn't the answer, it always feels like it is. I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't have my family, I don't have many friends left. I feels so alone. I've struggled with depression my whole life, and it started to get better back in February and March, but because of certain events it's just gone down hill. This has been the most difficult year of my life and I just want out. I want help so bad, but I can't afford a counselor, or anti depressants. I've started working out, but I have no idea when that is supposed to start helping. I just feel like everything that could possibly help me, I have no way of getting. It makes me feel hopeless. I just don't know what to do anymore and I've been thinking about suicide more and more.
