"Why can't you see it another way? Don't you want to feel better?"I think I'm starting to get a better understanding of what my problem is. It's that my answer to that question is that I don't necessarily want to feel better. A couple of different people in my life have put this question to me this week, asking me if I'd rather stick to my interpretation of the situation I'm in or adopt one that would make me feel like everything is fine, and I have to say that I'd rather stick with my way. Because it's the only way of looking at things that makes any sense to me. It's the only way that seems rooted in a real attempt to face the facts of things instead of twisting them to suit some notion of well-being or contentment. I don't want to deceive myself. I hate myself for so many reasons already. I can't add being a shameless liar to the pile.

So I guess I'll never feel better. I feel like I'm seeing that now more clearly than ever. I've promised my family that I'll keep myself alive so they don't have to grieve me and everything, but I'll never be able to convince myself that my life has any real hope or meaning in it, like they want me to believe. I just have to accept things as they are and wait my life out. And that's all there'll ever be to it.
