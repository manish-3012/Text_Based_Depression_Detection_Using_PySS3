I feel like im dying and no1 cares.After reading George Orwell novel 1984 i see that my notions were true. Knowledge is not guaranteed to bring you happiness. The giver by Gary Paulson also brings me sadness in the heart. Though I'm not actually contemplating suicide, i do feel as if there is a lack thereof within our social system today. As a result i do feel alienated.
