Why am I even hereI wish Iâ€™d never been born. Everything is so mundane and bleak. My friends hate me and the ones I have left are sick of me. My love life is non existent. I get so anxious I feel like I could die. I dropped out of sixth form and Iâ€™m restarting which means I just wasted a year. and even if all that stuff works out Iâ€™m still not going to understand the point of being alive. I feel so lost and alone, I wish I was just a happy and content 17 year old girl instead of the shell I am most of the time
