Whatâ€™s the pointI canâ€™t afford to leave the place that I so desperately want to leave. Whatâ€™s the point in it all? What will I get out of it? We all die donâ€™t we? Whatâ€™s the difference between living until an old age and slowly fading away than ending it early. Will the happy memories be enough to outweigh the ones that have left us so exhausted? I donâ€™t see the point. 

Please tell me what there is waiting for me if I continue to deal with this until I can get out. I canâ€™t take it anymore
