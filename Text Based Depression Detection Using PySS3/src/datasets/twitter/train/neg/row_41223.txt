Sudden and strange fixationsSo I've suffered with suicidal ideation of some sort since I was 10/11 y/o and most of the that time it's been managible (now 23) with a few breakdowns along way. 

Recently (started pre Covid lockdown but I'm pretty sure it's made it worse) I've found that my ideations have strong foci. For a while it was guns - despite living in the UK I have quite a lot of experience with guns and am a qualified instructor, but I've never thought about guns in this way and it's made me debate giving up my licence -  and the last week or two I've been focusing on poisonous plants... Again I'm quite fond of plants, my room is full of them. 

I don't know where these ideations have come from and they seem strange and very powerful. Lockdown has definitely had an effect as I've felt a lot worse and had to up meds. But these episodes have felt so much more real than my previous suicidal ideation which never had such string foci. 

Just interested to know if anyone else has felt this? 

(And I am seeing a therapist, two atm actually and having weekly check-ins with an amazing GP)
