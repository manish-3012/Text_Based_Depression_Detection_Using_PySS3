I don't think I can win and I need help.I'm more vulnerable than ever with the lowest support I've had in months. I can't fully trust anyone with my feelings because all people do is lock me up in a hospital. I feel that this will eventually drive me into committing an irreversible act so I don't end up in the hospital. I just need help. It's just unbearable.
