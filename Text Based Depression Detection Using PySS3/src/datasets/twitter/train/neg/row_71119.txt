I hope I don't have to do it.I live in dread of the unknown everyday. I worry that a future event may happen. It may not, but if it does, I won't be able to survive it. I won't go into specifics, except that involved a mistake on my part that was psychologically and spiritually self-injurious. I feel like I live right now in a hell of fear and paranoia. The sad part is that I don't even have a way to kill myself if it comes to that. I won't have a lot of time, so hanging is out. The reason why is because I'm too broke to afford any other method. Well, I won't be in a couple of days, or weeks. By that time I can maybe afford a quick exit strategy. Even though I'm not the happiest person in the world, and I've thought about suicide before, I've never been this close to actually following through. Even through all my extreme insecurities and a fear of intimacy that is so crippling it has and will continue to condemn me to a life of loneliness. I may be miserable, but if my life continues to be as uneventful as it has been these many previous years, I will continue for the sake of continuing. However, if the event I fear so much comes to me, I will have no choice but to die. This fear of the unknown is the most hellish I've ever experienced. That is why I came here tonight, right now I feel particularly overwhelmed. There is darkness all around me right now, it's palpable. I know I will feel better once I have my exit strategy in hand. It will be an enormous relief to know that I have that final option. As I said, I really hope it doesn't come to that. I'm not a religious person, and I don't care what you worship or don't. But please pray for me, I'm a halfway decent person and have only ever hurt myself.
