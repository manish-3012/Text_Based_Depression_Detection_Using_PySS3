I'm about to turn 20 and I'm only moving downhill.Before I turned 18 I was smart and motivated and on the path to be successful. Unfortunately I couldn't follow through. I stopped going to school and was planning to kill myself. Around that time one of my cousins committed suicide and experiencing that made me hold off.

Since then I've made no progress. I've only gotten less and less functional. This past year has gone by so fast and nothing has gotten better. Even if I had the will to try to fix my life, I don't know if I could. And I don't have will. I'm too tired. I think the person I was is already dead. If I don't kill myself soon I'm going to wake up and be 25 and even more braindead and miserable.
