i am probably going to kill myself this weekthough im still considering not to. I've had this hole in my life for the past year or two and it just isn't worth trying to fix it because i know it'll come back. i tried playing guitar, and yeah it was calming, but now that hole is destroying any sense of fun in it. ive also been questioning my existence, like there truely isnt any point to anything. we are all going to die. i don't want to live with this hole anymore. im sorry
