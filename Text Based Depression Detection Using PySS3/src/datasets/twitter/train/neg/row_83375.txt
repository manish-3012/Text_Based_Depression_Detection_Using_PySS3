[F/19] I regretfully cheated on my boyfriend [21] and feel like killing myself. (x-post: r/relationship_advice)My boyfriend and I have been dating a little more than two years. We got along very well until lately... we've just been going through difficulties. We're both struggling to find jobs, and I am a house-hopper. He has helped me so much (coming to pick me up at midnight where I was hiding between the bushes at a Starbucks drive-thru from my dad).

I lived with him, got kicked out because his parents found out we are intimate with each other (even though his mom gave us permission, and we've been intimate before we lived together) and I didn't find a job and earn money to move into an apartment in less than three months.
They gave me a week to move out, and moved in with these **horrible** people and stayed there for three months.

My friend (who likes me) offered me to stay at his mom's and she accepted.
I'm a nymphomaniac and I hate to admit it. My boyfriend doesn't know that...
We haven't seen each other in months and I felt incredibly lonely and turned on. I needed to have sex. Don't get me wrong, I'd still be with my boyfriend if he weren't able to do anything sexual at all. I am not with him for the sex (that's a bonus).

As incredibly difficult it is to write this, I cheated on him. I will not go into detail. Of course I regretted it. I've done NOTHING but *terrible, hurtful* things ever since I moved in with my friend and his mom.
I felt like killing myself a lot lately. I hate myself. So much. I do not deserve to be with such a sweet, tolerable intelligent man. I know my attitude towards the world and people have changed and I despise it.
How can I deal with these heavy emotions?

And please excuse the grammar, English is not my first language and I am not good at expressing myself.
