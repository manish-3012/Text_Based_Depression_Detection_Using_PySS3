Waiting gameNo guts to kill myself, life is boring from my point of view and 80% of the world population is dumb as shit. I have a regular paying job and my own house, which gets pretty lonely some times, but its better than living withmy parents. I am starting to notice that I just canâ€™t save up any money without having to live like a rat. My dream is to one day freeze myself or go to mars or anything like that. I hate the way the world works, and just want to escape. But I canâ€™t do anything without money. I feel like itâ€™s just not possible for 80% of the world to achieve what they want, because their family is not that rich, and neither are mine. I still love my parents regardless and I would never kill myself as long as they are alive.

Iâ€™m hoping one day the world is going to end early, or at least my life, because I canâ€™t wait.
