I just donâ€™t want to suffer any longerI donâ€™t want to go through this hell anymore. My life was amazing, It really was. I loved my life. I donâ€™t want to see it go, but Iâ€™m in constant pain and I donâ€™t want that anymore. The people that once loved me no longer do. The people I care about donâ€™t care about me. I already tried once, but I just donâ€™t have a way to die. Every day I get to wake up and remember how I did nothing to deserve where I am. My life fell apart around me. I just want to end my pain, but I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to leave my loved ones, they donâ€™t care about me anywhere close to how I care for them.

I just want it all to be over, but I donâ€™t know how. I canâ€™t get a gun. I donâ€™t have access to drugs. Thereâ€™s no traffic to run into anymore, no heights to jump from, I just donâ€™t know anymore, and I hate it.
