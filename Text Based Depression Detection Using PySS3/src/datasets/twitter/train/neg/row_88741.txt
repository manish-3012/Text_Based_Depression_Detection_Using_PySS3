So long, and thanks for everythingI'd like to begin by saying that Reddit is a wonderful community and I thank you all for being a part of it.

Let me be clear, I may not be committing suicide, it depends on the outcome of my financial situation. I've been accepted to one of the most selective pharmacy schools but I may be unable to pay for that education. That's not even mentioning the loneliness and ostracization I feel from family and peers.

We'll see, thanks for everything. I'm going to enjoy my night of benzodiazepine bliss and forget that my life is a shitshow.
