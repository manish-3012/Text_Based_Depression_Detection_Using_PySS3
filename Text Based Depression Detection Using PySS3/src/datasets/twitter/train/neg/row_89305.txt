Iâ€™m in so much pain and Iâ€™m just exhausted. Iâ€™m ready to go now.My name is Reuben Bell, Iâ€™m 19 years old and less than an hour ago I pointed an air rifle to my head and pulled the trigger, the gun jammed so I tried again 3 more times and the useless thing didnâ€™t work. I wound up just punching the stupid thing until it fell apart, it went down fighting at least and I now have a piece of lead in my leg. Funny how it fires when I try to destroy it but when I needed it most it just didnâ€™t work at all.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this, I donâ€™t know why I do anything anymore. My life is a series of sleepless agony followed by a few short hours of sleep before the cycle continues. I donâ€™t even know how to describe how I feel on a daily basis, Iâ€™m constantly hurting but Iâ€™m also so exhausted that I just struggle to feel anything at all. It doesnâ€™t make sense but itâ€™s painfully real to me.

I have so many regrets. Iâ€™m haunted by the friendships I lost because I didnâ€™t just pick up the phone and send that one message, there was a time where I thought I could be normal and I might actually have been happy but I lost that and it was entirely down to my actions. Then I did it again, then again. Now Iâ€™m here.

I hate every part of me. Iâ€™m bisexual and it disgusts me, I donâ€™t even know why. I have no problem with gay people or bi people or whatever but with me it just feels wrong, my dad says being what I am is unnatural and I constantly hear people say my sexuality is not real, that it canâ€™t exist. To the people who believe this, fuck you. From the bottom of my heart I hope you suffer as much as I have. You truly deserve it.

Despite failing today I know that one day I will take my own life. It wonâ€™t be long now, I have 14 pence to my name and in 29 days Iâ€™ll be evicted once my rent doesnâ€™t come through. I tried to make an effort and look for jobs, I applied for hundreds. I received rejection letters or silence on all. I canâ€™t hope anymore and I donâ€™t want to, it would lead to a short relief followed by even more pain.

Iâ€™m not here for sympathy or help, Iâ€™ve made my decision and this is what I want and need. I always hear things like â€œthink of your familyâ€ and â€œyouâ€™re not alone.â€ You know what my family is? My family is the memory of an abusive mother who still lives in my mind no matter how far away from her I move. A woman who leveraged my first suicide attempt and the death of her own father to try and bring me back under her control. My family is a father who spent 3/4 of his life in another country with his girlfriend while I was trying to keep my brother away from the first monster he married, right before he abandoned her, leaving me to take all the emotions that brought.

So yes. When I take my life I will think of my family. And I will do so alone.

Iâ€™ve been giving thought to what I want to do in the coming days before I go. Iâ€™d like a good nights sleep, Iâ€™d like a hot meal and a duvet that isnâ€™t in tatters. Iâ€™d also love to go for a walk in the rain one more time. More than anything I just really wish I could get a hug.

I still have an air pistol and I know with enough shots to the head and chest it will kill me, I didnâ€™t see it as an option before because it would hurt so much Iâ€™d black out or quit but after shooting my self in the leg today Iâ€™ve realised I can take the pain, Iâ€™ll load up on painkillers, drink a good scotch, lock my door and throw the key out the window, turn the rain sounds on the TV up and get it over with. It might suck for a little while but once itâ€™s over I wonâ€™t have to feel this ever again so itâ€™s worth it. 

I know Iâ€™m just words on a page to you guys but if you want to do something to help, actually help. There are people in your life right now going through the early stages of what I went through, they can still be helped. Help them. Your comments on Reddit wonâ€™t save a life but being there for someone who could maybe just use a friendly chat right now might. With lockdown this is even more important. Please, please help someone who needs it, someone who still can be helped. Iâ€™ve accepted Iâ€™ll die alone, I really donâ€™t want others following me.

Thank you for reading.
