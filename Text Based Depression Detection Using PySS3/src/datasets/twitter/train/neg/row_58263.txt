my speech disorderIs making me feel the only way is to killmyself and is because I can't order food or to talk with someone in phone I can't take good grades in college or to get a job of my dream, everything is so hard I can't say my name to the last, and I don't have friends because of it, I can't countine with this all my life I don't know how I will won money to live, everything is so hard I'm so fucking loneliest just in room and dark all days, I know that has people that are more bad than me but, and I can't live with this pain all my life as stuttering therapy is not giving effect, Oh my god I'm so young I had much dreams just I'm overthinking everyday so much pain in my heart, oh god I can't handle this, and my therapist said to me that the situation is not improving, I swear I'm just surviving all those fucking years, even I decide to live I will live in pain all my life,and in the end I will surely end up with mental problems, I don't want from you to tell me do u want to talk or don't give up because this has no positive effect on me, Just I'm trying to tell you all that what this Monster is able to do to me, just in my phone in my room dark and thinking and thinking to much, I will stop this feeling soon and i will sleep forever peacefully, I love myself for that I don't want to feel pain.
