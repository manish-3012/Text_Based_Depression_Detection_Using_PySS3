I wish I wasn't a loser who hurts people accidentallyTwo years ago, I dated a girl, she was one of the nicest people I've ever met and I was a loser who was desperate to have a girlfriend so I asked her out and I knew she'd say yes.  Unfortunately she wasn't very attractive, so I broke up with her.  Apparently it destroyed her and now she's an alcholic.  The next year there was a girl I met, who was absolutely gorgeous.  I thought she liked me, so we hung out a bunch of times and I asked her out. She said no, because at the time I didn't have a six pack.  I was upset.  But I eventually got over it and started looking again.  Now a girl likes me, and I agreed to go out with her.  She isn't very attractive.  But she isn't ugly.  I think I was attracted to the fact that she found me attractive.  I know I've made a huge mistake and she's fallen for me, hard.  I don't want to hurt another person.  I don't know if I can do better though, but I don't want to settle for someone who I don't find at least attractive.  So I'm wicked confused and scared and all this negative shit.  I just wish I was good at people type stuff and not a loser.   I wish I was a douchebag who didn't care if he hurts people.  I would be so much happier as a douche.
