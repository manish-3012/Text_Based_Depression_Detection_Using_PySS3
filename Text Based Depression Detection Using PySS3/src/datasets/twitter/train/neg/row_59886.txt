if this feeling doesn't go away by the end of the yearI'm doing it.

I can't get anything right. I do one thing, get criticized for another. I'm tired of everyone expecting me to handle it all. I can only allocate my energy to one thing at a time and I'm tired of having to strive for some kind of perfection when I'm an unorganized piece of garbage. Everyone else can do it, but apparently I can't.

I've only been able to hide it for so long. It's showing through the cracks now as I've had more responsibility handed to me. It's only a matter of time before everyone knows how worthless I am. I'll get fired. I'll get kicked out of grad school. My family won't even notice that I'm gone. Hell, it'll relieve them probably since they're always complaining about me.

If I feel like this on December 31st - if I have not made any progress from now until then, I'm doing it. I don't know how, but I'm going to end it for good because it's not worth it like this. I wish I could give my life to someone who would make good use of it. Someone who doesn't need reassurance and who would value this time that I'm given. What a waste of energy.
