Finally making the right decisionI will never, ever, ever make it in this world. I have only inspired disdain and displeasure among those I claim to care about. Despite many attempts to the contrary I have only succeeded in pushing everyone away.  I am absolutely amazed at my ability to only cause pain and grief among anyone I talk to. I donâ€™t know where I keep going so wrong. I try to be kind and helpful, funny yet intelligent. No one likes me. I have tried to get into therapy but my school schedule doesn't work with any therapist. They said to try the school counselling but that wonâ€™t help. I thought about talking to the doctor and finally starting a prescription for antidepressants. Then I looked on Facebook and saw pictures of the party I was at the night before. People who wanted nothing to do with me were happy making new friends with other people. Thatâ€™s when I knew no pill could fix me. Itâ€™s not a brain chemistry problem, itâ€™s a me problem. I am a cancer in this world, I need to die. 


I am already in the process of getting my hands on my escape tool, i have deleted Facebook, I am writing my goodbye letter. I am going to drive to a secluded area in the woods, call up 911 on where to find the body, and I am out.
