No friends and no family.Nobody checks in on me, nobody puts in any effort. Iâ€™m pathetic, mediocre at best, and have no future to speak of. Itâ€™s so humiliating to write this but I donâ€™t know what else to do. The therapists Iâ€™ve seen have all made it worse and medication always sends me into a tailspin. Iâ€™ve been physically abused by my father and two intimate partners but whenever I talk about it I feel ashamed or weak, as though itâ€™s my fault for â€œlettingâ€ it happen. Nobody seems to care and I want to stick a gun down my throat and end it. I feel like the only reason I donâ€™t is because the people that know me would just shake their heads and act repulsed one last time.
