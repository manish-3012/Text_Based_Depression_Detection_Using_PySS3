How to tell someone that I am suicidal?I've been in a really bad place for the past couple months and I have become very close to committing suicide. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and depression for the past 8 years or so, but most of the time my suicidal thoughts are accompanied by a feeling of anxiety or a feeling of uncertainty.

But I've become completely hopeless in the past 2 or so months. I've started cutting again and I've lost all motivation to try and stop. I've already bought the supplies I need to kill myself and I have picked out a location. I just don't have a time yet. 

There is a part of me that still wants to live and it does scare me how much I don't care anymore and how close I've gotten to killing myself in the past couple of weeks. I am in college now and I am really close with one of my professors, who I have recently been talking to a lot about my struggles with coming out as transgender, and I want to talk to him about my feelings recently.

I am afraid that he will tell me that I am just looking for attention since I've come to him about personal things before. I am afraid that he will immediately call 911 or the school's security and I will be pulled out of school. I am already taking out loans to be here, so I need to finish the semester. I am afraid that if things go wrong, then I will kill myself soon after the meeting.
