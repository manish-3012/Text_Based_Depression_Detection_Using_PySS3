I need to understand the way i feelHello guys I hope this is the right place to talk about my problem since I feel suicidal, so alright.

I'm an 16 years old boy, I'd depression but I overcome it.. my life now is alright, I have everything I wanted but there's always something in my mind that keep me feel suicidal or down when I try to do something or think about something, it feels like I'm not controlling myself. I'd this feeling this past few months and of course I'm not alright with those thoughts, I'd like if someone could help me go trough this feeling but no one can understand me. I feel lost.
