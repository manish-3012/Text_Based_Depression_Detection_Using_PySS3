I Don't wanna live anymoreMy life from the outside looks good, im on the football team, on the math league team, i have a 3.75-4.0 gpa, i even have a bunch of friends. But i just wanna die inside. Everyday i come home feeling like a failure and that im not worth anything. I hate dissapointing people yet i always find myself doing it. Idk maybe im selfish for hating myself and wanting to die. Idk at this point.
