am i a shitty friend for this ?basically for some context i used to hang out with my two best friends, iâ€™ll call them suzy and velma. it was always just us three. we met some guys and then we because this friend group in college. they were always kind of tacky but it was whatever. iâ€™m not going to say a lot but basically velma and suzy start dating two of the guys in the group. theyâ€™re kind of bad boyfriends like enough to whenever they did something bad my friends would cry. anyways, I stopped hanging out with them because they say the N word and would make racially distasteful jokes. Im black. Iâ€™d constantly asked them to stop and they said they would and didnâ€™t so I left. my friends kept hanging out with them and hang out with them most of the time. Apparently theyâ€™ve changed but they never apologized to me for hurting me so I donâ€™t want to see them. Today it was Suzyâ€™s birthday, and I didnâ€™t go yestedsy because I had an essay turned in, but I also didnâ€™t hang out with them today because I didnâ€™t want to see the guys. I felt bad because Suzy is my good friend, and in fact she hung out with me on my birthday. I wanted to/shouldâ€™ve put my pride aside but being around them makes me uncomfortable.
