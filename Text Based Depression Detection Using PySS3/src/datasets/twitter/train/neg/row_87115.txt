Help.I just started looking at this sub today because of a friend's suggestion.
I've been depressed for a year and have also struggled with anxiety. It's been constant ups and downs where I spiral each time I slip up. I never sought professional help until recently and I've taken up cutting. My arm has nearly eighty marks and my thigh has ten. I started zoloft a month ago but I am not getting better. I am surrounded by love but I still fantasize about fading away and leaving this dull, numb life. 
Reddit, please give me a reason to hold on. Friends have told me countless times that there is hope, but all I see is darkness. I'd rather spiral than stumble in my struggle at this point because I'm afraid of failure. 
Someone help.
