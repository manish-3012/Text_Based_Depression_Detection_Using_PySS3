25. Father. Trapped. And ready to jumpI find myself all the time imagining what it would be like to finally go through and end my life. Iâ€™m on loved a burden on everyone a joke to everyone and a failure every time I try to talk to somebody about the thoughts or things that happened in my head all they do is cut me off and say I need help go find a therapist or more recently call the police on me it has made me feel so trapped and alone in locked away that killing my self seems like the only real option. I hate myself. Iâ€™m ugly. A loser. Have a kid. Fucking black and ugly as hell. My parents gave up on me. I work a dead end job. Missing a tooth. Iâ€™m like the typical nigga that nobody wants around. I just want to have some point in my life where Iâ€™m not miserable. All the time. I go through the day fantasizing about shooting myself. Painting a wall with my Mind. Because letâ€™s face it. I donâ€™t mean shit to anyone. Even anyone here is just going to say relax. Just so they can get karma. But whatever. Iâ€™m used to everyone ignoring or laughing at my thoughts. Feelings. Anything that has to do with me.  Is a joke.  What sucks worse is. If I do kill myself, everyone is going to say â€œIâ€™m so glad I avoided him manâ€ or. â€œI knew he was crazyâ€. My parents say â€œwell thatâ€™s your choice. I canâ€™t stop youâ€ when I say my thoughts to them. Women. Lmao fuckin never ever ever want to stay around me.  Because itâ€™s disgusting. Being black bipolar and not a thug. 
 
I hate myself 
I hate my skin tone
I hate my life
Thanks for laughing at my story. 
Sincerely, 
Dead dad walking
