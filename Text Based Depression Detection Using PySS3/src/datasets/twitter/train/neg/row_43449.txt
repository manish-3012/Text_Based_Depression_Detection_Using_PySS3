Feeling down latelyHey people of the internet i don't know if i even want to post here because I'm feeling a little better atm but who knows maybe there's some form of therapy in it.
Long story short I've been struggling with feelings of being down for about 10 years now and yesbi even had thoughts of ending my own life in the 10 years I've been struggling with these feelings, the part i hate the most is not really knowing what the cause of these feelings is i have a decent life I'm a healthy 24 year old male have a good job and i can save money cause i still live with my parents, so what makes me feel like shit idk just wanted to put it out there hoping someone can relate and who knows maybe someone knows the feeling and knows how to deal wit this.
Anyway  good day i guess,...
