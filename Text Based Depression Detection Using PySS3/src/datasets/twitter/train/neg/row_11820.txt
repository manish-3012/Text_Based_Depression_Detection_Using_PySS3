idk what to type here guy i like ill name him Jonas mutal friend Tyler 

So about two months ago I found a liking in a long-time friend, and he knew it so basically we did everything together and got a decent relationship. I ask him out, and he says yes, and we date n stuff. Still, then we got into a massive fight, and he told material which I do, which is wrong, but do it for mental health because I have grown up to mental and physical abuse and recently got my apartment. But then he gets our mutual friends in an online community, which is a big part of my life to mass harras me and ignores me that. Him blocking me getting people to mass harras me and blocks me killed me inside so decided to try to kill myself through overdose and talk to some other people one is tyler who we both are good friends with while the effect is kicking and then try to sleep so tyler joins a discord call with about 15 and screams at the guy I love n stuff that I'm killing myself and The guy I like doesn't care at that point since he is mad at me, but my friend keeps me awake, and I survive but later that night, Jonas comes and talks to me then that night about 2 am but he has been blocked by the mutual friend tyler and 2 others he is really good friends with have now blocked and won't talk to him but are my closest friends me and Jonas have broken up, and we don't talk anymore, but he is still blocked by tyler and the 2 others. i honestly just want to fucking end it at this point
