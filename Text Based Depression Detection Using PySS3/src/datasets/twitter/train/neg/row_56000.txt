The best part of my day is......coming home excited and hopeful about turning on my phone waiting for the notifications.

The worst part of my day is realizing that there are none because i have no one and no one loves me, just to get my hopes up again the next day and repeat the whole thing over and over again.

That and waking up in the morning not being dead
