It's done.Thanks reddit for being with me over the past year. It's done. And I'm leaving happily. I've tried everything to keep myself from choosing this route. But today is the day and I did it in a happy mood.

Without going into specific, i've taken a concoction of drugs and alcohol. I live alone and no one will be informed, It's definitely lethal unless my calculation is wrong. But the most important thing is that I'm leaving happily. I have no regrets. There's nothing going for me even if I stayed.

Reddit has given me some of the best time I've ever had. Thank you reddit.

I'll see you on the other side.

Good bye.
