Stepped out of the noose. Now what?What am I actually supposed to do now? All the problems that put me there are still here. I still hate life. I still want and cushy life, but I can't have one. I still can barely get out of bed, let alone actually go to college classes.

What the hell am I supposed to do?

I've been suicidal for 3 years now. I've been trying for that whole time to get better. I've been on numerous mixes of pills, none of which have worked. I've seen therapists, been hospitalized, done everything I could reasonably be expected to do.

Things will get better, when? When I put effort into getting better? I've been doing nothing but for 2 years now. Still suicidal, maybe only gotten worse. 

Do something I love for work? All I enjoy is video games. Not "video games and editing video's together." Not "Video games and banal commentary on live stream." Not beta testing video games. Not making video games. Just sitting on my ass playing video games. 

Sell everything and run away to somewhere else? WITH WHAT MAGICAL ENERGY?

Literally my only option is sit on my ass and do nothing. BUT WAIT, I did that all last year, and I still ended up in the hospital.

So what am I supposed to do? At college: I want to kill myself. Stay at home and do nothing: I want to kill myself. Get treatment: I want to kill myself. Go natural: I want to kill myself. Attempt and kill myself: I can't do it. 

Honestly, I don't know what to do. Maybe I'll try again.
