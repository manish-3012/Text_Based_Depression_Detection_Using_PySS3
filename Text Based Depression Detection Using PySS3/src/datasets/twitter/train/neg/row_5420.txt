HSP, Depression and Aspergers*Chapter 1: The Beginnings* 

When I was a child I was easily overwhelmed by sensory perception. For my parents this was slightly difficult, I mean, what to do with a child, that is sick almost every second day and doesn't want to play soccer with others or anything. However, as I got older I got used to it, knew how to handle it. Now the overwhelming of my senses is no problem anymore but I struggle another side effect of HSP. To be honest, I experience feelings and emotions more or, to be more precisly, in another way than others. All my life, people never understood me. Never knew why I felt so sad and depressed. Today it's still the same, I talked to my peers and comrades a lot about my problems and way of perceiving stuff, they however never understood it, talked to me like I have a chance of controlling it. "Ignore it and focus on yourself" - gotta vomit if I have to hear that type of shit ever again. 

But what bugs me off so much you may ask? Well, it is a long story, you don't know me so I try to bring it in a short way. 

*Chapter 2: Isolation and loneliness*

I never got loved my whole life. It's not that my parents were the worst but they still never truly understood me, especially my father. Ever since I hit puberty or so I had that enormous urge for interhuman closeness because I never had that my life. I can't even explain it properly, I'm sorry, but it hasn't to do with sex or something, I don't care about that at all. All I need is like... warmness, hugs, a girlfriend - that type of stuff. But sadly, all my approaches to girls, I thought were not hoes or bitches but rather friendly and loving humans, went a bad way. Everyone, as soon as I got slightly closer to them, treated me a bad way. Ignoring. Rejecting. Those things. One important thing is, I only approached girls when I already developed feelings for them, so it wasn't a huge amount of girls but you see, I am old and grown up now, over the years it wasn't just one, even though I was always stuck with one for a long time.

*Chapter 3: Therapy &amp; Medication*

I could never explain why me? Why I am destined for chronic isolation and loneliness. You see, the first years of rejection weren't that bad. I mean, it happens, but as I got older, and it never changed, like an endless cycle, those add up to a mixture of major depression. I went to see psychiatrists, therapy, even medication. Nothing helped me. I tried like 6 different antidepressants, none with success, my doctor told me - well the chances that some will help you after those are rather low, so I stopped taking another one. After this pointless trial and error, I decided to not do those goddamn drugs anymore, anyways, this only changes what you truly are. Makes you slow, alters your personality, but helps? Not at all. Therapy - 2 years now, first a counsellor for my own, then group therapy - no changing to the better. I am done.

*Chapter 4: Source of my pain*

Of course, I tried to find out the source of all this. Why my life is so shit. Why I am a burden to everyone around me. Why I am trash for everyone. Why no one likes me. My reasoning told me, maybe it was because of looks, but no it can't be looks, then it wouldn't always turn that way, even when I am older. It must be something more complex. (Also one girl I liked told me directly "and btw you are good looking (y)".) ... Maybe it was because I have some Asperger type of personality? You see, I never got diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, but I do feel like it. I have troubles interpreting the words and statements of others. I feel a huge derealization, can't connect with others, especially with the opposite gender, and everything I do for others feels like I am just adjusting for them. I also have an IQ of 125-130 (not meant to flex though, tested that three times at three different psychologists :/), which is another common trait for Aspergers, isn't it? After all, this might explain it, you see, I went out with girls I had emotions for but I always felt so detached. I do always feel that type of feeling anyways but in those situations even more intensified. It is not about the butterfly-in-my-stomach effect or something. It is something sad and depressing. I like to use the phrase "Wrong Planet" because this is what it feels like. What I feel like for a long time now.  

*Chapter 5: Future?*

I am sorry for the long text and probably edgy way of presenting it but this probably sums up why I am the way I am. For the tl;dr, I am on the edge of suicide. Didn't figure out the method yet but I live in a country where there are little ways (no guns and stuff), so maybe via jumping off a building or slicing the veins. I am not in the phase where I say, I am going to do it just after posting this but I am definitely planning it. However, I do give myself a few weeks to do some stuff for the last time and also to celebrate my birthday in May -&gt; I will see if no one cares for me again and no one wants to do something with me then, like always. You see, it sounds stereotypical but it is a hundred percent true, I actually don't want to die, I loved life when I was a child and stuff, always only wanted love, inner harmony and peace, sadly, I am the result of yearlong bad experiences and mental health issues that were untreatable, shaping my mentality and person in a way that is unrecognizable and in the end, I am tired of life, tired of Earth, tired of people, tired of waking up every morning in this prison I call my daily routine and never changing life, tired of this never-ending cycle of depression, tired of everything.
