bromhydrosisHi there, I also suffer this condition in my feet since the last  years. I visited over a dozen dermatologists and only one knew about this illness, she treatrd a couple of patients but couldn't cure anyone. She diagnosed me with 'pitted keratolysis', treated with fusidic acid during a month cures around 70% of patients. Also is recommended to use aluminium 20% antiperspirant, but this thing made things worse for me since my skin developed contact dermatitis.

Somehow I can manage the bad smell a couple of hours so I can go to work everyday. I take an oral antibiotic (Cefadroxil) and apply fusidic acid  or mupirocin. After that I apply an hypoallergenig antiperspirant (Lavilin) and I'm ready to go to work 5 or 6 hours with a bearable odour (the smell is still there but way less offensive).
At nights I apply urea40% in the feet, helps to kill some more bacteria. And is very important to wear only sandals, the cold and  oxygen make a hostile environment for  bacteria to develop(that's why the smell dissappears as soon as you take off your shoes).
I tried botox and worked for my hyperhidrosis, but the pestilence was still there.
Recently I heard about good guy bacteria neutralizing the bad smelly bacteria, try to google it as 'alive probiotic spray for the skin Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacteria' but I can't order it since they don't ship overseas.

I write a blog (is in Spanish, bromhidrosisblog.wordpress) and found that many people suffer this same hell, and also share suicide thoughs ... but please hold on a little, try to focus in other aspects of your life and try to improve yourself as much as you can while some genius discovers a cure to make us normal persons again.
