It never will get betterIve been told since a little boy, that it does get better and always hope for a better tmr but thats utter bullshit because 16 years of living in pain, i know it will never get better but it will get worse as this fucken shit makes me more miserable as the day passes and hope is a magical thing and everyone should hope, fuck off with that bs. Hope only gives me more pain and torment like i had hoped that i stopped getting bullied and it kept on getting worse instead wtf is that. Seriously fuck the people who say it will get better because it fucken doesnâ€™t and never will when you are in a dark place by yourself alone.
