Feeling death approachingDoes anyone else experience this? I don't have a plan in place or anything, I just know it's coming soon. Like I can't think long term, even something as close as Christmas feels too far out. Every time I try it just feels fake, like yeah it'll probably happen but I'm gonna be dead by then. Is this a thing that happens to sane people too?
