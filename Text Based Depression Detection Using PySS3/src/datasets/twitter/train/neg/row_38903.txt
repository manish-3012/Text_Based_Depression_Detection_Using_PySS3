No title requiredHi,

Last 4 years is all crap. Dropped from my university program because I supported a friend through his business project. I lost all my family money + my money + savings to this piece of shit. This idiot made me deaths threats so I'm stressed all the time.

I drowning in heavy heavy debt. 

I suffer from panic attacks and anxiety because of these said problems. Also high blood pressure.

I almost dryed out of money. The only thing keeping me going is my gf and my cats.

She knows I'm having black thoughts but I hide it from her saying everything is alright.

Suicidal thoughts on my mind. The solution to get rid of all my problems.
