September 18. That's the day.I have chosen this day because it is my birthday. I'll be 32. It's been a hellacious 32 years I might add. I have a support system. I have a great wife. I'm seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. But at the end of the day, nothing ever makes the pain go away. 

I half-heartedly tried committing suicide last October. Obviously I failed. It'll be clean this time, minuscule chance of failure. My wife nor any family or friends will be the first to find me. It's better this way. Tbh, I don't even know why I'm writing this. I have no intentions of backing out. I guess I just need some place to at least log my thoughts up until it's time.
