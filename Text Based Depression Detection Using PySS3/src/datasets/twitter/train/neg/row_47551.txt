A repeating hellish lifelong cycle.I think I am ready to go. Iâ€™m moving to a new place soon and I think I might carry out my plan a little after I get there. I only have a couple close friends left and I wonâ€™t know anyone there. My childhood was full of trauma, adulthood so far full of mental illness( Iâ€™m in my mid 20s). Iâ€™m starting a new graduate program that I will probably fail at since Iâ€™ve failed at everything else in my life. Iâ€™ve gotten fat again after a bout of anorexia and I just want to hide myself from the world. Iâ€™m tired. I feel alone and like itâ€™s just not worth being here anymore. Iâ€™ve always been alone. Will always probably be alone. I will continue to get bigger and bigger and continue to fail at everything I do. I want this off my chest and out into the world but the last time I expressed being suicidal to my friends it kind of blew up in my face. No one wants to be around someone who is sad all the time. No one wants to hear you cry every day. I think itâ€™s just time for me to wrap it up. Iâ€™m off my meds and Iâ€™m not even going to bother getting back on them because they only marginally help. Iâ€™m not sure how to move forward. Every day feels like a new fresh hell except itâ€™s all the same shit over and over and over. I donâ€™t think I can keep doing this.
