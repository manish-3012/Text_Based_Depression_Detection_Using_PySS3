Three yearsHi, I don't know why I'm posting this but here I go...

People always tell us that things are going to get better, that with a few words, all of life's problems melt away. Idiots. But for as long as I remember when I've gone through shit. 3 years has changed everything. With patience and effort your life can change so much in 3 years. Hang in there
