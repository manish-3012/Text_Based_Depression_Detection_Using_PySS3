I think this is the endSorry if this post is really long, I may rant for a little. So not too long ago my family found out I was cutting, they got me help and apparently I have bad anxiety. Iâ€™m seeing a therapist, but ever since they found out Iâ€™ve felt more and more terrible. I donâ€™t/canâ€™t cut anymore, but I do punch the wall until my knuckles go red, and try to scratch. No one knows this due to no marks being left. So many of these doctors appointment and my parents being so careful with me makes me feel useless, I feel like Iâ€™m being drowned with questions. Even a simple â€œhow was your day?â€ Makes me feel like Iâ€™m suffocating, Iâ€™ve been acting more cold and rude to my parents, I donâ€™t mean to. Itâ€™s never been this bad. I considered writing my suicide note for a while now, I think today is the day Iâ€™ll do it. The only thing thatâ€™s actually keeping me from using it is my to-be nephew. I want to be there for his birth, so I know heâ€™s healthy and I could go out with a peaceful mind. I just feel so useless like nothing matters to me, I want to cry but I canâ€™t. I could be so happy at one moment, then suddenly I feel like someone threw the biggest rock at me.
