I'm not feeling wellI've bored my friends to death. My boyfriend has left me. I'm having a weak moment that seem to lasting forever. I know that tomorrow I might feel better, but currently it feels like I will be stuck in this hole forever. I don't know how to helo myself. I am not willing to invest hundreds into therapy, so I guess I deserve to be stuck in this place. Anyway, this is becoming a rant... I am sorry about that. Felt I could talk to you guys...
