Anybody else get really scared when you get close to ending your life?Occasionally I will have a night where I get beyond the normal wanting to die, where I feel so unbelievably hopeless that I legitimately feel like I will hurt myself badly. 

I remember one night I was cutting myself and I realized that there is absolutely nobody there to stop me and that made me more scared than I have ever been in my life.
