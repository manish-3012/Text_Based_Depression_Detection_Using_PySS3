Disturbing thoughtsI still have fantasies of overdosing on pills then setting myself on fire. I'm too scared to act such fantasies out. I hate how emotional and sensitive I am. Emotional, highly sensitive, anxious and highly intuitive. I wish I could accept myself and I took rejection less personally. I can be very shy and very self centered. I wish I didn't care for others opinions on me.
