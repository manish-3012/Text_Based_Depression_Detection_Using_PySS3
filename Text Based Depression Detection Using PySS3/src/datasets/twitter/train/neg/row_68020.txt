Convincing your parents to let you see a therapistHey everybody. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a long time but really badly the last 5 or 6 months. I've been really close to suicide now 3 times (writing notes, making plans).

I try to tell my parents and they say 'you have nothing to be depressed about.' My dad has OCD and ADD and refuses to get help which makes him emotionally abusive and my mom is such a perfectionist and any grade lower than a 100 is "unacceptable."

When I get a 85 or 80 on a test or the vacuum lines in my room aren't perfect my parents uses a special router to turn off all my social media and wifi which totally cuts me off from friends and support.

I'm homeschooled (9th grade) and can't see a school therapist... and I'm pretty sure other family members would be the same.

Are there any free, confidential online therapy services or people who will mentor or do something like that?

Thanks. I really want to end it.. but I also don't. most of the time I do.
