idk what to do anymoreIâ€™m 16 turning 17 soon. a couple years back I was such a piece of shit. I did truly awful and cruel things to everyone else around me. not to undermine the things Iâ€™ve put people through but Iâ€™ve been through worse things than I have said and done to others, but the thing is is that the stuff Iâ€™ve done to other people bothers me way more than the stuff that has happened to me. 
I canâ€™t handle this guilt anymore I feel so fucking evil and disgusting, I wasnâ€™t even aware at the time just how awful I was, I thought my actions were justifiable. I just want a restart, I genuinely donâ€™t believe anyone thinks that Iâ€™ve tried my hardest to improve myself, to prove that Iâ€™m not that piece of shit anymore.
Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself for almost as long as I can remember. I donâ€™t even know if I want to enter the adult world this fucked up and mentally ill, especially with such a stupid fucking past like mine. I just want to die, I have no one and I have nothing, no aspirations, no hopes. I donâ€™t even care that Iâ€™m young, the damage has been done and im so fucked up. I hate this so much. all I really want is for this nightmare to fucking end
