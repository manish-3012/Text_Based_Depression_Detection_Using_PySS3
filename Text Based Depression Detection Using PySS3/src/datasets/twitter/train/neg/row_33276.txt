I feel empty inside, as if Iâ€™m just a shell of whoever I was before I was depressed.The last couple of days Iâ€™ve been just wanting to kill my self. Iâ€™ve been both mentally and physically tired. I toss and turn trying to fall asleep at night until 3 in the morning; trying to think of reasons to live. I would do it today but then no one would take care of my little brother.... I just feel so worthless. I havenâ€™t made any friends in college and I canâ€™t hang out with the people I used to hang out with because they all do drugs and I donâ€™t want to. I keep trying to convince myself that itâ€™s worth living but everyday I just feel more and more like Iâ€™m just fading into the background of everyoneâ€™s lives.

TodayI woke up feeling sick and I spilled tea all over myself and I was so upset that I just started crying. And I guess my mom could tell that I didnâ€™t feel well so she called my work to tell them Iâ€™m sick today. I guess I just wanted to add that even thought I feel like a horrible piece of s**t, Iâ€™m thankful for her and all that she does for me.
