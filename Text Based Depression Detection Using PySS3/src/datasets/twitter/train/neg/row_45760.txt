No one cares about me. They only care when itâ€™s too late.Ask anyone in the halls of the school I go to, what do you think of (insert my real name here)? 

â€œOh, heâ€™s annoyingâ€
â€œI dislike himâ€
â€œHeâ€™s a commie whoreâ€
â€œIâ€™d wish heâ€™d transfer schoolsâ€
â€œHeâ€™s a communist scumâ€

Iâ€™ll admit that I was annoying my freshman year. Iâ€™ve changed, but no one has seemed to notice. 

Letâ€™s just say I hung myself, which ibh itâ€™ll probably happen soon. 

â€œHe was a good friendâ€
â€œI liked himâ€

And some other made up shit.

I want people who like me for who I am

I donâ€™t want to have to kill myself to get people to legitimately care about me.

Sadly, that is not the case in my life.
