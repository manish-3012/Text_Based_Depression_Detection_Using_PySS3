I think I am about to just give upEveryone thinks that I am using suicide to guilt trip them into giving what I want.... It hurts. I ask them to stay. I ask them to help me. I ask them to understand, but all they do is leave me and then tell me that I guilt trip them. I just want a girl who will stay and who is actually there for me.Sadly, I think that it will never happen. I think I might have just finally given up not only on that, but everything else. There is much more to this want of sweet release than just a relationship deal.  It involves coming close to death, hitting rock bottom, and how people have left me during my times of need. It has left me a bitter person and has left me broken.  I just think it might be time for me to let go of this world and release my hope.  This message is only meant as a final cry for help. I am latching on with all my strength. I don't know why I am trusting strangers to help me live once again. To accept myself and be happy again is all I ever dream, but why I trust strangers to help me not go through with this treacherous plan is probably because I have no one left... Goodbye....I hope I will find that special someone...
