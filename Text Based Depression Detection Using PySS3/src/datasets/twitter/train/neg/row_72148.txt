I wish doctor assisted suicide for mental illness was acceptable in my country.I feel like no matter what I do or where I go, I just canâ€™t make it work. I feel like I donâ€™t belong on this planet, and Iâ€™m so tired of trying to get better. Iâ€™ve seen so many therapists, taken so many medications, been to mental hospitals, and I always end up back here. No one should have to live like this.
