What to do... Thinking I might finally have the courage tonight.Things have been going downhill for a while now. The last week I've been at rock bottom. Was reaching out to a friend but it only made me realise how misunderstood I truly am. I've tried all the meds, so many doctors, so many therapists... Never felt like suicide was my only way out until I realized yesterday it really is. I decided I would go to work and say my goodbyes today. Now at home and can't fight the urge, I thought I might try to save myself one more time and called a distress hotline but those always make it worse. What I realized is I really don't think I actually wanted anyone to listen. I guess I was looking for a reason to live. I considered the hospital but I don't think I want anyone to be able to stop me and prolong all this. What do you do when you don't want to talk about it but you don't really want anyone to stop you either, yet somehow I know I want some form of help if I'm posting this at all. I don't feel like reaching out to family and friends because I don't want any advice. Maybe I'm just looking for someone to tell me exactly how to do it. I don't know what I want. I am so effing confused.
