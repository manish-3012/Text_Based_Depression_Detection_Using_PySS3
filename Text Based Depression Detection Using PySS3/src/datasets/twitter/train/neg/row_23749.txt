Iâ€™ve fucked everything up and theyâ€™re better off without meNo ones gonna sympathise with this post Iâ€™m a piece if shit. Iâ€™m married with 3 kids ,when our first child was born we had nowhere to live was in a hostel, the government gave us a house (100% grateful) but my wages didnâ€™t add up to the basic bills we had so I took on a second income on top of working full time (selling coke) pretty normal from where Iâ€™m from TBF BUT, it obviously comes with risks
. My day job of stacking boxes in a warehouse was always a stopgap so I got into gambling . Also matched betting ended up pretty well off long story short that was 7 years ago everyone was happy we had a good life no one could complain . Today I have a cocaine addiction , alcohol dependency , and everytime Iâ€™m on the beer and the gear 3-4 times a week I start on the slots losing Â£1000-Â£2000 a night nothing excites me I have an itch that needs scratching either by a big win or a big loss . 9/10 times itâ€™s a big loss obviously but Iâ€™m fucked I feel like I tried my best to do the best with the options I had to make a good life for us all . Itâ€™s headed for fuckin DOOM it feels like I donâ€™t know what to do if I just disappeared theyâ€™d start from scratch on a legit life without all my bullshit . I tried , I failed , I shouldnâ€™t drag them down with me as I spiral my life into fuckin nothing that I canâ€™t seem to stop . 2 upvotes I do it
