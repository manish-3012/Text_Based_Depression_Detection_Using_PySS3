Im planning on ending it soon.No support for a long time, super broke, and things have been shitty for years and getting worse. I made posts on my main account but the account has gained considerable attention fir other reasons and I dont want anyone I know to see these kinds of posts in my history. Im just at the end of my rope so soon I'll be checking out. I know nobody will care, but i want somebody to know.
