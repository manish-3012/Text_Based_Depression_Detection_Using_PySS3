It's just been so difficult. Don't know how long I can keep this up.I can't stop thinking about dying. I've been struggling for a few years now and it's wearing me down thin. I know dying's not the answer but I can't stop obsessing over how much easier it'd be. I know what I'd do and I can't indulge and get the stuff I need because I know I wouldn't have the willpower to live with a way out within reach. It's so confusing. I want to live, but I want everything to be over. I loathe waking up in the morning, because I'm a disappointment. I hate the way I am and how hard I find mundane things everyone else does so effortlessly. I'm sad, defeated, and desperate at the end of the day. Hope is something I keep telling myself to believe in, but I'm so tired of letting myself down. I'm so tired. I'm so tired.
