I'm just doneI want out of this life. I have a few plans on how to do it and I'm depressed enough that I have no second thoughts. My family hate me. I don't really have any friends who benefit from my existence and no real reason why I'm wasting air on this godforsaken planet. It's not like I'm smart or kind or brave and honestly, I don't give a fuck about other people because it's not like anyone's ever given a fuck about me. No amount of therapy or medication has ever helped me so why fucking bother. Why bother with anything.
