How do you not hate yourself?21 year old male college student who dreads waking up every day here. I have no money, no sight of a woman, anxiety disorders, and major ADD. The only time I enjoy myself is when I'm in a social setting where I can be distracted from my hateful inner thoughts, I need help asap. I feel like Ive been heading down a dark path and there is no way for me to get out. I don't think I have the balls to kill myself but its something I think about once a while. I don't know where to turn or how to get back to the loving and fun self I once was. I only get glimpses of the old me when I'm out drinking with friends, and the next day its only worse. Idk, need someone I guess
